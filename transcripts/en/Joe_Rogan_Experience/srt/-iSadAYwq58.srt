1
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,890
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

2
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,350
Lloyd of attractiveness. It's just noise
coming out your mouth, son Caden Cuddy.

3
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,650
The beginning was really interesting.
I like it.

4
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,970
But then that whole whiny part in the
middle. I wasn't feeling that shit. Yo,

5
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,460
you just got to high Joe. Is that
what it was? We think so. Yeah.

6
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,290
He can't handle his weight. Do you think
that because you're too high, maybe.

7
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,180
Maybe John Fun. Are you too high?
I am not high at all. What? I know.

8
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,110
Oh, I see what, you know
what Scott corporate gigs.

9
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,720
I'm, no, I'm not. I'm literally not. How's
that possible? I'm, I think I'm immune.

10
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,560
I think, uh, I mean to marijuana.
I think so. I've never like,

11
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,530
you know, I was in college
and stuff like that. I would,

12
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,340
I would waste it and I would see people
get high off of like a hit or two and I

13
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:45,360
go, I just wasted an entire bag and I'm
not, I don't think I breathe in properly.

14
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:48,560
Or You were just telling us
about eating it. Yeah. I've only,

15
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,950
I'm a big fan cause I'm
not fan of coughing and I'm
not fan of that act cause I

16
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:56,550
think I'm going to die every time.
So if I do on just I eat it,

17
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,990
which is cool cause I literally,
and anytime

18
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,821
I do,
I get lost.

19
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:04,510
So lost in a music before
we go any further out to say
this podcast is sponsored

20
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:09,511
by the fleshlight fleshlight go to Joe
rogan.net and click on the link and say

21
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:14,360
15% that we have a real sponsor.
We have to like really pay attention.

22
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,070
You know what they need to do with those
is actually put a battery in them for

23
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:21,040
an actual light. Because
in, in, especially in this,

24
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,370
just see my loads glowing through.
Yeah. But you know where that is.

25
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,410
Even if it's hidden,
you know where that is.

26
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,270
And if your power goes out in your house,

27
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:32,110
you could probably get to that quicker
than a legitimate flashlight. Right.

28
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,980
Because let's say you haven't
been joy in lose. This, you know,

29
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,050
is if it's under some
books underneath the couch,

30
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,450
you know exactly where to
go to get a very good point.

31
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,240
I have no idea where any of my
flashlights, but you know where that is,

32
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,900
what that is. That's so true.
That's a good point, dude.

33
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,030
You know that actually
might be a legit product.

34
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,730
You might actually be able
to sell that to them. Yeah,

35
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,370
because they don't bring that up with
the fleshlight people in emergency

36
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,770
flashlights the back.

37
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,020
But people worry about shooting loads
and then getting battery acid on their

38
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,741
dick.
You know,

39
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:03,370
like something breaks and you get battery
acid just sprays out all of your balls.

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,280
But there's less of a chance
of getting battery acid there.

41
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,800
Then actually thrown into
some chicken meat and Vegas.

42
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,350
You probably have a better
chance of having something wrong.

43
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,680
Go down with the random chicken and
battery acid. Really? You think so?

44
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,390
Do you think,
uh,

45
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,630
a random chick is scarier than sticking
your Dick in some sort of a machine that

46
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:23,050
makes light out of a
battery? Jesus Christ, man.

47
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
Fucking laissez faire.

48
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,020
How lackadaisical and relaxing
color are you with your balls, man.

49
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:30,990
You're posting in your batteries.

50
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,300
The statistically probably there's a
better chance of getting something from a

51
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:38,050
random chick then to get
battery acid on statistically.

52
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:41,620
But that's because statistically over
the years a lot of people been fucking

53
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:45,550
random chicks. Not that many dudes
been sticking to Dixon battery holes.

54
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:49,320
Well not that we know that. We
know that there must be. So yeah,

55
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,170
there's gotta be some guy that spoke
girls, you know a couple of girls. What?

56
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,130
They've got battery acid or liver
JJ from vibrators. Oh yeah. Right.

57
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:01,360
Cause it's not the same thing if you
ever [inaudible] you tell him the truth

58
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,350
there.
There was a long time ago,

59
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:06,020
there was this girl I used to date back
in high school that used to have this

60
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:09,860
vibrator that was like the like she stole
from her mom who's mom stole it from

61
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:11,660
our grant.
It was the grossest vibrator ever.

62
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:13,370
And it was so cheap and plastic looking.

63
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,330
One time I was just looking at it and
was like, you have the dirtiest vibrator.

64
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,380
Cause we had like that this white powder
all around the the where the battery

65
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:25,790
was on the, on the side of it and
opened it up and it was just a blown up,

66
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,210
you know like those old batteries where
the acid just goes everywhere. She goes,

67
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:31,130
I never turn it on though and I'm like,

68
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,070
but look at this white stuff
all around it. Oh my God,

69
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:36,170
that white stuff is eaten
up or snap probably.

70
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:38,650
I mean like how horrible
these battery acid, if

71
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,560
there was a pawn star show we're
dudes brought in, that would be funny.

72
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,950
I would watch it.
I would like to see,

73
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,680
this is a vibrator I've had in my
family for like three generations.

74
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,040
My grandma had it and then they adapt
to bring that expert out to test it.

75
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,740
It'd be a tumble dildo tester and
this is a good quality. This was,

76
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,010
I've always touched

77
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,900
at battery acid by
mistake. Like, you know,

78
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,550
like you're taking an old
remote control and you're like,

79
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:04,010
God damn these batteries and he pulled
out and you're always looking at your

80
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:06,740
hands like, am I really supposed to be
doing this right now? Some nice car.

81
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,000
Some day sex toys will be like, they will
be like antiques that are fascinating.

82
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:15,310
Like if you find some Walras bone
dildo from the fucking French Alps,

83
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:19,480
it used to be in neanderthals. That
some fascinating shit man to us. That's,

84
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,080
that's really interesting.
Yeah.

85
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,680
I guarantee you like flashlights and
shit someday those things are going to be

86
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:27,020
like a big point of novelty
when they have like, you know,

87
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,560
three d holograms at suck your Dick when
they have some, you know what I mean?

88
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,880
I mean they're gonna have some crazy shit.

89
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:36,530
It's going to be just an a new experience
and artificial experience like wired

90
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,360
into your brain or micro robots.

91
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,960
Like it's a lotion that you put in your
vagina and like all these little baby

92
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:45,440
microscopic robots are formed a vibrate
certain ways and you could just use your

93
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,820
iPhone to like turn up the volume of the,
the vibration in my vagina jail.

94
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:52,580
You know what I mean? I don't think
it's going to be that complicated.

95
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,650
Go fucking microscopic robots inside your
pussy. I wouldn't trust him in there.

96
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,300
What if they decided not to leave and
you get some sort of a yeast infection or

97
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,840
that?
Yeah,

98
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,490
they start freaking out and they get
the virus and they start just slip.

99
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:08,280
They won't turn on you at first. The be
a friends. Everything we perfect. Yeah.

100
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,230
Then that's when he turn on me and we
just want to get better ways to get off.

101
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,440
You don't have to stick robots in your
posts. That's just me though, man.

102
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,970
I'm old school.
I'm simple when it comes to shit.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
If you hear my voice you like,
Damn Joe, you saw I've got a cold.

104
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,400
I still do have a fucking cold.
This is so disappointing.

105
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,940
I've had a cold for over a week now.
This is a longest,

106
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,350
longest cold I've had in years. Man.
Me and John are about to get this cold.

107
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,540
So what is, what is the forecast
for you when you get this cold?

108
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,620
Gets is going to come about like next
Thursday you're going to start getting

109
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,100
sniffles. I mean, is that going to be
okay for you by next Thursday? Yeah.

110
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:47,510
That's cause that takes vitamin C and
sleep and you'll be fine. That'd be good.

111
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,760
It'd be on stage in New York going.

112
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,570
Where are you in New York? Uh,
Gotham when New Year's Eve. Oh,

113
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,940
New Year's eve in Gotham. Gotham's
a great club. I loved that place.

114
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,240
I love it because of the security
guys that are there. Everybody's cool.

115
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,280
They're employees. Those guys just have
a certain kind of coolness when boom,

116
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,050
people are kind of being douchey.
Former cops. Yeah. They go in,

117
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:11,870
they do this move where they just
put their hand on the guy's shoulder.

118
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,680
He don't say a word and then they just
walk away and then that guy doesn't get,

119
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,120
he doesn't get mad. Like other clubs
where Ian, great. Uh, shoulder move,

120
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:23,450
sort of like a Spock thing. Kind
of like, I'm not the only one here.

121
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:27,260
Notice I'm in a suit and so are these
other guys and we probably all have

122
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:32,090
weapons. Wow. All in one. One little
one little. That's a God damn pro.

123
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,280
One little. Yeah, that's a great
club. It is. It is. I love that club.

124
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,600
Love that quote. That's backdrop to
[inaudible] club. I think just, you know,

125
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:41,230
it's most of our clothes backdrop.

126
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,220
Walking to that club stand
up to the special there. Oh,
did he? Yeah. Yeah I did.

127
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,710
It's showtime special there and
really interesting background.

128
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:50,230
He had like mirrors in the background.

129
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,080
You remember it like a
reflection of themselves, like
an eighties dance club. It,

130
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,010
it looked like did it? Yeah. Yeah. It
looked like a couple bad. Yeah, I taught,

131
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,930
I thought it was just unusual. I didn't
think it looked like a ladies dance club.

132
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,690
So remind me of like a one night or you
used to have to do where the, you know,

133
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,040
I liked it. It's small though. I like
that, that it's all intimate like that.

134
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,860
I may be the way to go when
you're filming a special,

135
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,610
I mean everybody wants to do like a big
crazy special and the theater and I've

136
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:18,810
done that,
but it doesn't seem,

137
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:22,230
it's not the same kind of
show as the the the club show.

138
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,520
The club shows a different
show. Yeah, definitely both
fun. They're both different.

139
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:30,100
Like the laughs and the big theaters are
way bigger cause there's so many people,

140
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:33,180
it's just, you know when when you get
on a roll and gets pretty fucking crazy.

141
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,210
But at a theater there's,

142
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:39,010
for me there's like a little
bit of a disconnect because,

143
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,660
well one you just can't see the people.
It's not we're doing on purpose.

144
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,340
You just have so many lights.
You just,

145
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:48,360
as you literally looking out into the dark
on, well I hope I'm staring at people,

146
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,770
but you can't tell. Yeah, it feels
very strange. It feels almost like a,

147
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,940
like sort of an artificial show feels
like a fake show. You know? It's weird.

148
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,730
It's sometimes they get going though
and they feel just like a regular show.

149
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,000
I've had giant places that feel like a
regular show sometimes just because of

150
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:07,370
the mood is right. It's like it works
out or you're at a small, you know club.

151
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:10,500
It's in the basement somewhere that has
a hundred people in that show feels,

152
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:14,580
I don't shows a crazy I did, uh, your,
your, your favorite place in Michigan.

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,380
Ann Arbor comedy showcase where I started.
That's a great place. First place ever.

154
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,320
We were there for the UFC and this place
is like an hour away from whether UFC

155
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,920
was but uh, mean a cigar did shows
there and fuck was a great club.

156
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,990
Perfect size. It's like 250 seats. He
like a comedy club. You're in a basement.

157
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,010
Yup. And then you can literally touch
without even extending your arms. I'm off.

158
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,040
There's something about those rooms,
man.

159
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,930
Those intimate rooms when you're onstage
and it hauls connecting and everyone's

160
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:49,620
having a good time and the materials
just coming out smooth and everyone's

161
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:53,490
laughing. It's like, man,
it's like some crazy energy.

162
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,410
It's the same if you ever walk into an
older house that was built a long time,

163
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:01,470
you know, an older house in a
neighborhood, there's an energy about it.

164
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:04,500
Then you walk into somebody's house
who lives in one of those prefab new

165
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:06,330
subdivisions and it's a different energy.

166
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:11,250
I think it's the same thing when you
feel like it's been lived in dwelt in

167
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,830
comedy club at mall where it,

168
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:17,430
it doesn't have that same whatever
that thing is. Yeah, that is,

169
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:20,670
I mean I guess you could recreate that
if you just had a real good environment,

170
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:23,100
but you're right.
All the new cool spots,

171
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:26,670
like even new cool spots to just open up
in la like, wow, what a great, cool spot.

172
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:29,940
Even if it feels cool, there's
something missing. Those,

173
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:33,810
those older clubs like the
comedy works in Denver,

174
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:38,750
Denver and also in a basement and he was
exonerated as a theme is it says photos

175
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,020
punch low in Atlanta. I just tricked by
photos. Maybe you're just like, oh my God.

176
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:46,140
So much head shots in my head and my
place has a lot history. Totally be.

177
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:50,070
Stoner talk might totally be stoner.
Talk. Absolutely. But you know, there's,

178
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:53,910
there's people that believe there's
certain like scholars that actually have

179
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:54,490
proposed

180
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,330
that the concept that everything
has a type of memory. You know,

181
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,660
Rupert Sheldrake experiences,
I think he's an evolutionary biologist.

182
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,640
I think that's what he does.
But he, um, had this um,

183
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,260
concept that everything has memory,
like tables and chairs.

184
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,740
They all have some sort of memory came
out to your table having memories.

185
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,310
I'd be like, God damn, I look
at that table's memories.
They carry like a certain,

186
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,930
the certain weight of their experience.

187
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,610
Although the environment
they've been around,

188
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:21,490
the idea is that when you're giving
off bad energy or good energy,

189
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,970
anything that's going on,
like the things around you pick it up.

190
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,900
That's why when you go to, I mean the
eye, it's totally more total hippy doc.

191
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,750
But if you go to someone's house
and they're like really cool,

192
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,600
like their whole house feels cool,
it feels like friendly, you know?

193
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,160
Did you ever go antique shopping?

194
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,220
It's kind of creepy and it's not just
like looking at regular furniture.

195
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:42,220
You're going through the shit that was
owned by somebody. It's probably dead.

196
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,060
And then you get to a box of old photos
of people's like wedding photos and

197
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:48,790
stuff that are just, you know, there's
no kids that took them, you know,

198
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,960
so are just miscellaneous people's
photos from like the 20s and stuff.

199
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,380
I'll buy a couple and just like look at
him and like draw mustaches on them and

200
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:59,320
throw them away and stuff. But there are
only like 25 cents. You should go there,

201
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,020
go to an antique store, find the
box of old photos. It's freaky.

202
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,340
That's all I had to say.
Wow.

203
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,760
Yeah. Old Pictures of weird man. The, the
idea that they just captured some person,

204
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,301
you know,

205
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:14,301
it's like we were so connected today
that just the concept of the way people

206
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:15,744
lived in like the,

207
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,580
the late 18 hundreds early 19 hundreds
like that's so alien to us. Just the idea.

208
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:25,581
So when you see a photo of someone from
like some fucking dude who was trying to

209
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,620
make it across the country with his kids,

210
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:33,300
you know from the wild west from like
1865 and you see a photo of the dude and

211
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:38,250
he like walked off, fuck, look
at that guy. That guy was just,

212
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,670
he was almost some sort of an animal,
you know?

213
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:46,110
I mean [inaudible] no fucking cell
phone. No cable. What did he learn?

214
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,520
Some Shit in school. What did they
even know then? Did they know anything?

215
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:54,420
I mean they were one step removed from
thinking that people would get in a boat

216
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:57,420
and fall off the face of the earth.
These motherfuckers that came over here,

217
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:01,470
those, the settlers like Jesus. When you
see a photo of them and their family,

218
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,310
hard looking people out there in the
woods and you knew eventually there

219
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,820
probably got fucking scalped
by Indians. Yeah. Like whoa.

220
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,350
That's a crazy ass picture.

221
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,270
Could you imagine if somehow or another
you got fucking transported back in time

222
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:20,080
and you had to live in the old
cowboy days? No. Fuck. Only the, the,

223
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,220
the prostitutes would be good I think. I
think that would be clean. Prostitutes.

224
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,520
Are you kidding me? You get
nothing is clean. No pregnant.

225
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,340
All regular girl smelled like
dirty prostitutes back then. Yeah.

226
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:31,620
I forgot about processes.

227
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,240
Powdered wigs and be kind
of cool to be disgusting.

228
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,200
Those women must have been just rancid.
It must have smelled like animals

229
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,490
just found this.
No one's shaving their legs.

230
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,440
They're barely survive and they're
eating dirt sandwiches every day.

231
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:52,190
They're out there in the fucking dust
taking baths. I what? They're like

232
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,600
entertainment tonight or extra wide. Like
they had the gossip about random crap.

233
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,730
They didn't know that they
were missing the Internet.

234
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,130
They didn't know that they were missing,
you know,

235
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:03,860
stuff because it didn't exist
in their head. So they weren't,

236
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,600
so they all had to just socially was
it just my only references are like

237
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:11,630
tombstone when they go to that dance.
Yeah. They'd go to the billiard hall.

238
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,900
I remember they played pool and they
would like get mad at each other and shit.

239
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:18,590
I remember Kevin Costner and Wyatt Earp.
Yeah.

240
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:21,770
But I guess you're just complain
about like, boy these, these,

241
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,740
if you've seen these new horseless
carriages, they're not gonna you know,

242
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,080
I guess you would have those guys,
the haters and the,

243
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,560
Oh I don't think the horseless carriage
just came around for awhile and I was

244
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:35,540
like I'm those actually going to be off
on a lot of it rubbed her I lifetime and

245
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:40,490
when competing at anything that I have
a whole generation or three. Yeah.

246
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,770
What,
how many years is officially a generation?

247
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:44,750
Cause I always like to
think of it as lifetimes.

248
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,800
I don't think like generations are too
fucking confusing. Like you know what?

249
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:52,740
How many, how many years do you fall
into, you know, tactically it's 10 kids.

250
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:56,060
He always invent new names for the new,
is it 10?

251
00:15:56,061 --> 00:16:00,980
But then if I can go look my dad's,
yeah, I think so. It's officially here.

252
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,610
This is definitely officially a new
generation because people will always talk

253
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:07,940
to me about someone who I have no idea
who the fuck they are and they act like I

254
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:11,420
should know this person is, you know,
like some famous singer or some famous,

255
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:13,040
you know, rapper or whatever
the hell it is. Yeah.

256
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:17,840
I'm at that age where whatever band is
on like a late night talk show. Yeah.

257
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,550
Yeah. Used to go, oh cool. These guys. And
they're like, hmm. Two don't know anybody.

258
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,410
Yeah. I don't know anybody. It's crazy. I
watch, you know, dancing with the stars.

259
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:30,950
I'm like, who is this watch? Who is this
guy? I watched an episode the other day.

260
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,810
Why did I like dancing? Joe?
Hi. Um, no, I don't like,

261
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,170
but you did dance furthers that
the upcoming movie movie. Yeah.

262
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,720
You kind of got the little dancing. A
flavor dance fever. Yeah, I got it yet.

263
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,430
No Man. That the rhythm catch him. The
rhythm caught on that rhythm. It was hard.

264
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:54,350
Dancing is difficult. It requires a
lot of focus. Like, well, we had to do,

265
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,110
I forgot what it's called,
some Spanish thing,

266
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,100
but it's like a big fucking serious
like bullfighting fucking dance.

267
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:04,520
It's like they throw their chest forward,
arms back,

268
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,540
and the dude who like was typing in,

269
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,880
punch out the dude who was like teaching
me how to do the mail moves was this

270
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:13,640
dude. He was like this bad house
dancer and I'm like, you know,

271
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:17,090
this is like something really hard to
do that you get like zero credit for,

272
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,120
and they're like, dudes don't give a
fuck that you're in really good dancer.

273
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,540
You know they, they're like,
part of them is like, yeah
man, that's awesome man. Wow,

274
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,880
you been incredible.
Then part of them was like,

275
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:29,720
why the fuck are you spending all your
time doing this? What are you doing?

276
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,570
Fruitcake? Just spinning around the
music that got his shit together. Yeah.

277
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,760
It's weird that that guy learns
all those dance moves in Britain.

278
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,930
Probably hundreds of moves within a song,

279
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,290
but then we give a lot of credit to a
basketball guy who can you go over here,

280
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,710
post out and then turn to the left?
That's all. You know what I mean? Well,

281
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:50,310
there's some one ones or something
to fund this. I mean, I guess, look,

282
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:51,300
there's something to all of it.

283
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:54,970
There's something to fun dancing and then
something to this as like some sort of

284
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:58,710
a,
a visual performing arts sort of a thing.

285
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,340
It's definitely a different experience,
but it's a lot of fucking work.

286
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,220
I have ballroom dance one,
two and three in college.

287
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,250
It's a lot of work and the final result
is not interesting to me. No, it's fine.

288
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,950
I don't care. I dated a girl who
was, I get big dancing. Chuck,

289
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:16,140
you're at the Brown Derby here in town.

290
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,460
Whenever I first moved to La and she
taught all these ballroom Nancy's and then

291
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:23,400
we went to some club that just
played normal music. Oh No.

292
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,720
She didn't know how to dance.
And she like, no, I don't
know. It had to be one, two,

293
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:30,720
three, four, one, two, three, one, two.

294
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,680
Like you're banging some
crazy robot broad. But yeah,

295
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,560
but you think that because she knew
18 south of dance that you know,

296
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,530
we get on the dance floor,
you know, hearing, you know,

297
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,010
you guys love snapping
power and says I love it.

298
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,901
We didn't talk about,

299
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:49,230
we weren't talking about where we're
going to have our second chance prompts.

300
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,370
Awkward moment ever is when they see like
in Vegas about five dudes hanging out

301
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:56,880
together and there's no girls Nero and
they're getting a couple of drinks in

302
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:58,890
them and they start sort
of like half dancing.

303
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,780
They can't like totally commit to dancing,
you know,

304
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,560
so like little go through
like half the moves.

305
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,830
Like I'm not really in the fuck of this
music when it doesn't make me move that

306
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:09,040
much.
But you know,

307
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,700
I'll give a little move or get with
a little move here and the, you know,

308
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,170
but they can't like dance with each other.

309
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,830
They can only move just some minimal
amount. You can't get crazy now.

310
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:20,150
You can't just sit in front of each
other, grow gyrating hips. This is,

311
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,660
you're not allowed to do that to dudes.

312
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,390
Girls can get together and dance
all they want, but with dudes,

313
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:29,070
you can only sort of half dance. I used
to go just by myself. Yeah. Sometimes.

314
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:33,120
Sometimes just to go out by yourself
to clubs. Um, when I first moved to La,

315
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:36,360
I did really, I would go on the
dance floor by myself. Oh my God.

316
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,370
There's something wrong with your
brain and you need to go to a doctor.

317
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,170
At first it's a little bad.
At first you,

318
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:45,150
you're going to get the guys that are
like, look at it. What's this guy doing?

319
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,133
You kind of do,

320
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,590
but then you get the girls that come
over to you because they liked the guy

321
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,980
who's then. We've done a lot of
work. Yeah, it did look, got tea.

322
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,000
I think it was a very gutsy,
gutsy move. Not always worked.

323
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,490
How many times does it failed
on you? Oh, I don't even know.

324
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:04,050
Probably more times than, but, but it
just takes that one time, you know,

325
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,340
just that one time.

326
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,490
Some dudes can take criticism or rejection
rather. Some dudes are fine with that.

327
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,450
I have a friend, he would, he
would hit on every girl that,

328
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,170
he was an ugly guy and he was fat,
but he didn't give a fuck who would swing.

329
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,640
He would swing at every pitch.

330
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,910
I know a couple of never known
that way that he's a comic. Yeah.

331
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,350
I don't want to give them up on the air.
I've owned you do mine either,

332
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:32,890
but you can't go to bars with that
guy because it's, it's too much too.

333
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,540
Those are always the guys who let
people know you're a comic. Like,

334
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,790
like there's a whole bunch
of comics that are that way.

335
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,320
So they go up to the volunteer, they, hey,

336
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,440
where's the comics had to chuck a hut
and then the bomb to usually like,

337
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,090
I don't care.
It's not what you want for,

338
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,470
or they want the girls to be
impressed. It's back. It's brutal.

339
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:52,810
When you with a dude will,
you know, there's no way.

340
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:55,940
If you go somewhere and there's a chick
that he's not going to hit on her and

341
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:58,720
then it's not going to get annoying and
it's not going to get embarrassing. Yeah,

342
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,720
those guys are brutal. Or,
you know, it's like, okay,

343
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:05,230
I can't hang out with you anymore because
if I hang out with you and we'd go

344
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:10,150
somewhere, you look immediately. Just
everything that moves the first fucking,

345
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,050
the waitress comes over. I think she's
kind of, Oh man, look at that target.

346
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,570
And then the next thing, no, all,

347
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,670
it's all about this fucking waitress
and him getting this waitresses number.

348
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:22,420
I'm like, Whoa, why can't you
just have lunch fucking Weirdo.

349
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,030
And then they don't come to your table
anymore because they don't want to deal

350
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:27,610
with Ya. And then, yeah, exactly.

351
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:30,160
And it because it works every 30th time.

352
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:33,580
They fucking just want to put in those
numbers, man. Yeah. Those crazy dudes,

353
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:36,430
they just want to put in those numbers.
And if you're around them, you're like,

354
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:40,450
oh great. It's embarrassing. Yeah,
it's fucking disastrous, man.

355
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:41,290
It's a shitty feeling.

356
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,680
I would, uh, gather move when I was on by
myself. I would go up to girls and say,

357
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,830
my friends left me.
Can I dance by you?

358
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:53,330
So I don't look like I'm dancing by myself
and low. Then you dance. But here's,

359
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:55,250
here's the trick, young
guys. Here's the thing,

360
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,200
you have to commit to that and you don't
talk to those girls. You don't go, can I?

361
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:04,310
Bebo and then, Hey, what's up ladies?
Then you ignore them. OOO, okay.

362
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,630
And then the cooler, one of the group will
then kind of come over and go, you can,

363
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,050
and then they'll let you into the circle
if you're not completely hideous and

364
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,310
embarrassing them.
The key is,

365
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:16,760
is not to give them attention
after you do that little move. Wow.

366
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,490
And then now you're the
hurt animal in the forest.

367
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,080
You're the bird with a broken wing.

368
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,070
And there'd be one nurturing girl in that
group that will bring you in. And yeah,

369
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,390
I just go up to him and go, Hey, I'm a
producer. I like, or moves, uh, ladies,

370
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:33,230
I just want you to just stop and
think about how fucking gross men are.

371
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,680
Have you heard a bang brothers?
I started, I stop for a second.

372
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:39,080
And think of how gross
men are and how fucking,

373
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:43,220
how much effort you put into creating
the perfect environment where they think

374
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:48,221
you're a nice guy or interesting or
mysterious or cute or whatever the fuck

375
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:51,860
you're doing.
How much of most most guys,

376
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,550
every day focus is just to
try to get girls to log them.

377
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,860
94, 4% of the day. Yeah,

378
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,110
that's Brian.

379
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,110
Bri gets off for like fuck you
mean Brian has no loads left.

380
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,110
Masturbation and girls.
He's got no loads left.

381
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,470
He's got no time for your bullshit.
White fucking around. John,

382
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,490
why are you fucking around man?
So these girls get stupid with it.

383
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,350
Like I have no loads for you.
You're dancing plan.

384
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,150
You just need to hit it out the fat.
You,

385
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,600
you spend too much time with that dancing
plan. And what is your dancing plan,

386
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:29,370
Brian? You just go up to
him. Go, Hey, am I producer?

387
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,570
What do you produce here? I'll play the
girl. I'll play the girl. Ready. Hi.

388
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:43,280
Hi. Uh, so I'm a producer.
Oh Wow. What do you do?

389
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,210
What do you produce? What do you
do? I'm like, actress. Sorry.

Wait tables right now.
I went on this call back.

00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,353
Whoa.

400
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,810
Stun a dumb checks. I'm
like, what the fuck is magic?

401
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,930
I'm dating Joe Wizard.

402
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,630
Uh, that girl used to date a
long time ago. Uh, Jessica,

403
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,040
the first thing I said to her,

404
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,270
she was playing with her iPod and we
were all out to dinner. And I go, Hey,

405
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:41,290
let me rephrase it. Your iPod for you.
She goes, what is it running slow?

406
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,040
And I'm like, yeah, let me refragmented
for you. And I took it in the night,

407
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,390
did all this stuff. And I'm like, there,
it should be running a lot faster now.

408
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,940
And she goes, wow, I didn't even know
you could do that. What's your name?

409
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,340
And that's how we, so what did
you actually do? You did nothing.

410
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:55,410
Now I just kind of,
I forget what I know.

411
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,870
What's shitty taste in music.
She has been some mother fucker.

412
00:24:58,871 --> 00:25:00,370
All these Bob Seger song.

413
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:05,260
Yeah,
La Cool Rock Zack

414
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,070
got from that commercial. I never
danced to the songs from the commercial.

415
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,510
That's where I know it from.

416
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,750
That guy was a bad mother
fucker back in the day.

417
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,610
There's certain certain dudes when the
well runs dry it, they, they, they,

418
00:25:20,611 --> 00:25:25,230
their music is like so different.
You know, like perfect examples.

419
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:26,100
Billy Joel,

420
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,330
Billy Joel is like one of the biggest
turnarounds ever from like a guy who was

421
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:32,130
like this young guy who had this,

422
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,860
these really passionate lyrics
and it was really interesting.

423
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:39,170
Like songs that really like
moved you to uptown girl.

424
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,390
She's been living, you know,
it's like in that eight. Yeah,

425
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,440
something happens where they
just hit the fucking rocks.

426
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,760
Whether it's love, it's too much
love. You know what I'm saying?

427
00:25:50,761 --> 00:25:55,650
Or too much hot chicks sex, you know, like
they've got it all now. It's like this,

428
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,400
the passion in the anger,
it's,

429
00:25:57,401 --> 00:26:01,530
it's not there anymore because now
they're banging supermodels and they drive

430
00:26:01,531 --> 00:26:05,400
and fucking Ferrari's and living
in mansions. So where's all,

431
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,110
where's all that struggle,
you know? And what's tricky,

432
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,190
your struggle, John? My struggle
right now. What are you,

433
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:13,600
what have you been struggling with lately?

434
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,710
John's got many struggles that he
can't talk about in the air. Brian.

435
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,270
We both know this. I have my roof
leak in. Your roof is leaking. Yeah.

436
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:23,430
That's a big one of those people.
What's better?

437
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:27,750
Your roof leaking or the roof is on fire.
Fucking Rufus on leaking.

438
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,000
We don't need no water.
Yeah.

439
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,580
Have you heard the new Eminem
song with Little Wayne?

440
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,420
Little Wayne is already making
songs. Yeah, he's already,
I'm just going to jail.

441
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:40,050
We could go. Yeah. And he's got like
three videos. Peppers make me feel lazy.

442
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,100
They put together a lot of work. Yeah.
Well you should. M and M has some

446
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,110
Wayne Little Wayne with a,

447
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,730
Little Wayne is a sign of the times.

448
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,420
My favorite new mnm lyric is I'm going
to stop being mean when Aquaman drowns in

449
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,040
human flame swims. Wow. That's not
good wine. That's not that good.

450
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,140
Why can't, well, yeah,

451
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,860
and so it's a m and M and who else?
A little Wayne Little Wayne did.

452

Both of them are really mad. They're
mad. They're looking. Holy Shit.

453

455
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:38,020
Everybody hears evidence and
little Wayne is that sure. No.

456
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060

What is fuck the water.

He's got such an unusual flow,
you know,

00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,560
he's never not pumps me up. Like even

it's like he's got a real original way
of making shit rap and rhyme or making

519

How many people fake UFC

00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,260
Who you pretend to walk out
like you're about to walk out.

528
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,450
That'll be a really funny
scene in a movie, Dude.

529
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:31,220
I have a fake walk out to a fight.

00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:40,220
I put in music and then a miring and then
that kicks and then before you know it,

533
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,640

man. Boxing around doctors, it's twice.

534
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:47,210
I think you've got to go to a brain
doctor. Sorry. Going to clubs by yourself.

535
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,230
That was when I was like 20 something

543
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:13,900
get into martial arts training
and you do it for awhile.

544

554
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,670
I used to be this exercise thing for
kids in the 80s with ribbons and sticks.

555
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:01,750
It's kind of funny that they can
have women's only gyms, but you,

556
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,800
they'll bitch at you if you
try to have a men's only Jim,

557
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,240
you can't have like a Menzel in gym.

558
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,330
You can have those curves and shit
like that where women can't go,

559
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,520
but you can't even even boxing gyms,
women go to the boxing gym,

560
00:34:11,521 --> 00:34:15,500
so I think even have to have a male
and female locker room or bathroom.

561
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,700
Actually you could have a co because they
do that in Hollywood. They have a coed,

562
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,940
which is horrible because then
girls have to go in there.

563
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:26,370
I have to do is take giant, stinky.
Yeah. I liked that sub separate. Yeah,

564
00:34:26,371 --> 00:34:28,910
you should have stuff separate. You
don't want to smell my shit hooker Joe,

565
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:31,880
you should. You should bring a guy
only Jim and cut instead of curves.

566
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:36,110
Call it like bulges or something
like all's bulges. Hairy balls.

567
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,370
So I've been doing the body rock.tv.
You have to check it out fellas.

568
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,240
Gonna you getting paid for this? Is this
a sponsoring your website? Because it is.

569
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:46,310
I'll throw up in your lap 100% of that,

570
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:47,570
but you should see the
girl who was on there.

571
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,930
That's what I'm trying to give you guys.

572
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:51,770
More nos filled with hot chicks so you
could look at them anytime you want on

573
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:55,400
the Internet. You don't have to
work out to them. Um, and then,

574
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,860
then I was going through
a phase where I'm like,

575
00:34:57,861 --> 00:35:00,350
there's a do you do to plays
right across the street from me.

576
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,930
We're at just literally it where I live.

577
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,890
Well you have to go and it's right
there. And I'm like, well maybe I'll go.

578
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,530
And then I saw um,
video,

579
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:13,490
some guy doing a reverse arms
lock or something. I'm like,

580
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:17,270
maybe I'll just do judges.
So I go on phases where like I just,

581
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,360
I don't want anybody punching me
anymore. Well, the Jujitsu thing,

582
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:21,580
the good thing about that is that it's,

583
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,530
you don't have to do striking
grappling enough to worry about it.

584
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:26,330
You'll get hit anyway.
You're always going to get hit.

585
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:29,960
You're going to get headbutts. So people
slammed and listen, you're accidentally,

586
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,490
it just,
things always get hit,

587
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:35,570
but it's not like the thing that impressed
me when I was um, doing this guid.

588
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:38,130
You do too, that there's a
guys in there that was like 60,

589
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:43,131
65 in probably more way more flexible
than me or containing young guys on a,

590
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,890
that's cool thing about rolling
around like that is the older you get,

591
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:50,400
you never have to leave it.
You're Jane might slow down a little bit,

592
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,670
but very technical martial arts,
very technical,

593
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,430
like I roll a lot of times
with guys who are way,

594
00:35:56,431 --> 00:36:00,210
way lighter than me and weaker than me,
and yet they can still tap me. You know,

595
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:03,390
there's, there's not too many sports
like that where someone who's bigger,

596
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:08,160
stronger, faster, more agile than you,
and yet you could still contain them.

597
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:11,130
You know? I mean, if you're playing
football and even if you're like,

598
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,030
there's no one on one football or one
on one basketball, even if you're like,

599
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:16,620
you know,
fairly talented.

600
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:20,490
If a dude is very fast and very athletic
and much quicker and stronger than you,

601
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,890
he's probably gonna fuck with you.
It's probably going to fuck you up.

602
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,090
But in Jujitsu, it's amazing what like
a light person can do to a big, strong,

603
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:31,020
heavy person. There's a Fred,
Felicia, Felicia, oh, do you
know Felicia? She's, Whoa,

604
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,260
what a John Jacques Machado
is black belts. Yeah.

605
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,470
That's where she's a great person.
She's really, you know, an excellent,

606
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,970
like legit black belt. Well, this Guy
Seymore butts. You know who he is?

607
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:44,940
The porn star. I used to have that
TV show. I forget what it was.

608
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,750
It was a showtime show.
Oh, it's cause demos? No,

609
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,830
it was the showtime show about him.
Something about him. Anyway, uh,

610
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,040
he wanted to film an episode where he
learn Jujitsu and then rolled with the

611
00:36:56,041 --> 00:37:00,590
girl. So he came to Eddie's
class. He learns all these moves,

612
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,810
learns when an Armbar is law firms with
a triangle is and they gave him like a

613
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:07,620
couple of private lessons and then he
rolls with Felicia on camera and Felicia

614
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:12,390
just commences to strangle him in
every way, shape or form. She wants to,

615
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:17,340
she arm bars him, triangles m takes his
back. I mean she just fuck's this dude.

616
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:21,210
I had no chance. It was like
just a, just a total mangling.

617
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:25,440
She mangled him and I think they put
very little of it if any of it on the

618
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:26,161
television show.

619
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,160
He didn't want to be embarrassed but he
stopped doing it because I would say a

620
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:33,880
dual, I was saying about Jujitsu or either
knife fighting or let's be realistic.

621
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,640
Cain fighting. They get, stop
all that. Go to Ju Ju Jitsu, man.

622
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:42,000
What did I just give you an inspirational
speech about 130 pound woman

623
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:45,890
strangling a male porn star to death too.

624
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,800
If she fought him to the death,
she would have won.

625
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,400
He'd be a dead man and
she'd be standing over him.

626
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,350
I will with his fucking head in her hand.

627
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,440
She fucking finished him.

628
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,890
Wouldn't it be cool to take like a
Chinese stars like class to become really

629
00:37:58,891 --> 00:38:01,770
good at it? To make it like at like a
boomerang where you can just go, yeah,

630
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:04,380
and then someone pulls out a gun.
This is Jesus Christ.

631
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:07,470
Why not get good at fucking
cannon bolts and no,

632
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:09,940
this is what you need to get
a sling and a really cause.

633
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,130
That's how David Killed Goliath.
But what if he's throwing knives?

634
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:18,150
If you got really good at it, you do. When
you eat a gun, it's heavy. They're sharp.

635
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,470
Carry a gun. You couldn't beat a
gun. You could. No, you didn't.

636
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,240
He got so good he could hit the guy right
in the vein in his superhero. Come on.

637
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:29,970
Fuck it. Goddamn kind of looks good
now you're just making up rules.

638
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,733
Silly Dude.

639
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,130
I think that does pull that fucking
fill full of bullet holes. Show

640
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,120
you guys one day.

641
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,130
This is the beginning of
kickass three bread pan returns.

642
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,040
What's wrong with you? Boy, that's what I
want to know. What is wrong with you? Uh,

643
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,290
it's,
it's pretty smart if you think about it.

644
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,940
I mean if it's a knife with five corners,

645
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:58,240
it's like a star of night. You've got to
keep them in a pouch so they don't stab,

646
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:02,290
you know, you go to get them out rather
obvious man purse thing on the side.

647
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,020
Oh and a million in there. Yeah.
Okay. Okay. I see what you're saying.

648
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,960
I saw like a thought this
through a belt buckle.

649
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:10,990
Chinese star and like Black Belt
magazine you could get, yeah.

650
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:14,560
He sat down to Brian wants to be a
character in a Spiderman comic book.

651
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,470
You did not. You did not order Chinese
starts as a kid. Yeah, definitely.

652
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:21,910
Pretty bad ass Dorn comes you're way
better. They're way better. Yeah.

653
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:23,980
But if you get pulled over with a gun,
it's a little bit different.

654
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:26,050
If you got pulled over with a bunch
of trying to catch up with, yeah.

655
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:26,980
You know what the difference is?

656
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:29,340
You can have a license for a
gun and you could buy Chinese.

657
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,370
Chinese starts like what the fuck
you and nanny shows or legal. Yeah,

658
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,350
they're sort of are they?
Yes.

659
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:38,740
You can know by the
Chinese stars at the mall.

660
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:44,440
Samurai sword. There's some laws to those
things. Shiny stars. No, there's no laws.

661
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,350
I don't think so. Not In California.
At least there wasn't in Ohio.

662
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,900
I know there wasn't in Ohio. I haven't
looked into Chinese start either way.

663
00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:51,880
They're going to think there's something
wrong with what he can't have it in

664
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:54,030
your pocket. Cause that would
be a concealed weapon. Yeah.

665
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,180
But if you have a big clear Ziploc bag,

666
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,310
like you go to the airport,
he starts,

667
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,830
I do need you, but you're kind
of a poured Ninja. So yeah,

668
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:09,370
you have to keep it in a Ziploc bag.
You know you don't really,

669
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:15,160
you didn't have all the cool Ninja
stuff. You got problems kid. Both.

670
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,000
Both of you together, make dual
appointments, go to the brain doctors.

671
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,180
You think baths are really that
much worse than taking showers?

672
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,940
Like if you were to take a bath
everyday and scrub every day,

673
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:28,480
do you think it's worse? I mean your
showers are a hundred times better, right?

674
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,930
Well, the problem with baskets that you're
in the same goddamn water that doesn't

675
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,700
rinse off. If you took a bath and
then took a quick shower afterwards,

676
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:41,490
that's the move. Right? But line in your
own filth and you just, it's like t.

677
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,310
That's what it's like. It's like
butthole tea. Yeah, that's hot water.

678
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:46,420
Your butthole,
your balls,

679
00:40:46,421 --> 00:40:49,990
all that is all run your face now and
you dunk your head under notes on your

680
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:54,120
forehead. It's all butthole and
balls. Tea. That's what it is. Yep.

681
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,340
And soap and dirt and
skin. No, it's stupid.

682
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,260
You ever meet those girls
that only take baths?

683
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,630
They didn't take their pussy butter.
That's gross.

684
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,280
I don't want to smell your feet either.

685
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,730
You need to take God
damn shower I clicker.

686
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,980
It's 2010 almost 11 get your shit
together, John. You and check.

687
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,280
Check this out. I went to the ghetto
washing machine the other day at best buy.

688
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:17,860
This shows you how bad best
buy's been getting lately.

689
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,500
Lately I've been going to best buy
and looking at like Kodak camp,

690
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:25,060
there's this camcorder that I got off
Amazon for like $175 right then and I

691
00:41:25,061 --> 00:41:28,750
noticed that they always have
it there for $250 and I'm like,

692
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:31,240
why is that such a price
difference than Amazon?

693
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,530
I went to get a washing machine yesterday,

694
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,220
five 99 $599 I was about to pay for it,

695
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:40,760
but then I read lasered the price tag
thing on what does that mean? Red Lasers,

696
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:44,900
that application where you at scans the
UPC code and shows you how do you do it?

697
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,190
It's an application on your iPhone. What
do you do? You took a photo it, yeah,

698
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,390
well you pull it out and it opens it and
point it towards the UPC symbol and it

699
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:56,060
scans it and finds any local
places that has this product,

700
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:59,180
any online places and gives you all
the information about whatever product

701
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:01,760
you're scanning. So I'm about to
tell this guy, I'm like, all right,

702
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,780
I want this washing machine,
500 $599 fine, whatever.

703
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:05,990
That's a good washing machine.

704
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,610
And I scan it right at the last second
and it was two 99 at Sears and free

705
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,550
shipping. So they were like, oh,
I guess we'll price match that.

706
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:17,600
And they gave me free shipping and I
got done the washing machine half off.

707
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,570
Do they have to price match that?
They, that's one of their policies.

708
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,400
Best buy price matches everything. And
then just last week the Internet, Huh? No,

709
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:30,230
no, no. It has to be a local retail around
you, but they also just drop their fees.

710
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,000
Like when best buy was notorious.

711
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:33,860
Every time you bought something
and then you return it,

712
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:37,010
they always charge you like
10% 15% restocking fees.

713
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,770
The other day they just stopped that.
So there's no more restocking fees.

714
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:43,040
They're trying to, you know,
compete with Amazon and stuff.

715
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:46,160
But then you see these products lately,
like how the fuck are you?

716
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,440
That's 50% more than Sears.

717
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,010
They're just hoping that nobody
notices. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

718
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,310
Well back in the day when they say we are,
we'll give you the guarantee.

719
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:57,980
They knew nobody was going to check.
That was probably safe.

720
00:42:57,981 --> 00:43:00,200
But now that you have
phones and you can go, okay,

721
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:02,290
I'm going to pull it up right now.
That's incredible.

722
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:05,270
You've got to adjust that red
tacting see things like that alone.

723
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:08,430
Make the iPhone and even droids
you can do that with two it. Yeah.

724
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,090
I mean this is like some
fucking futuristic shit,
man. Getting was incredible.

725
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,340
Yeah. You can take a photo
of the, the price tag,

726
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:21,341
it scans it and finds those fucking
objects in local markets refuse and every,

727
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:27,500
it's amazing the between that
in the fucking that Shizam Shit.

728
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,950
When you're at a restaurant and you
press that thing and it picks up the song

729
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:32,750
and tells you where the song
has let you buy the song,

730
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,900
let you watch it on youtube instantly.
Cause you young kid,

731
00:43:35,901 --> 00:43:40,490
you didn't know what it's like where
you'd have to walk into a record place or

732
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:42,230
[inaudible] place and go up to the guy.

733
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:47,420
Do you guys have that one song that goes
[inaudible] imagine going with that m

734
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:51,980
and m song, not being able to figure out
what it is going to a to a CD stone go.

735
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,160
Do you ever when he goes [inaudible]
[inaudible] or something like that or no,

736
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:02,300
do it again to this guy [inaudible] I
remember there was places where you could

737
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:06,200
go where you can sample them. I
don't know what, what was it, virgin?

738
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,190
I think it was virgin.

739
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:10,700
You would go and you'd put headphones
on and they would have this specific CD

740
00:44:10,701 --> 00:44:14,420
knew you'd be listening to tracks. So you
would always be waiting like God damn,

741
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:16,250
I can't get in one of
these fucking headphones.

742
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:18,500
All these greedy people keep
listening to every song.

743
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:21,360
So some people would just
stand there for hours.

744
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,320
There was sitting there for hours just
listening to album after album cause they

745
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:24,951
had them all up.

746
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:27,830
They're available to listen to and
that's how you'd find enough shit was any

747
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,590
good. So you take, I'm thinking
about taking a chance on this CD.

748
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,480
Let me listen to do it. And you'd go up
to the little station and listen to it.

749
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,960
Yeah. Which wasn't that long
ago. No, no, you're, yeah, we're,

750
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:40,800
you're talking less than 10 years.
Not even.

751
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:43,680
Probably you talk about a
fucking business has been trans.

752
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,270
I don't know if this is a true fact,

753
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:48,540
but talk about a business has been
transformed. I was looking on the, uh,

754
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,730
OMG facts on,
on Twitter,

755
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:55,970
and it said that 90% of all
music is downloaded illegally.

756
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,380
Yeah. That's crazy. Cause I buy
every single thing that I get. Yes.

757
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,970
But you make good money.
You're, you're successful.

758
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,660
I want to know if you were hurting, I
could see the justification. I mean,

759
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,930
I could totally see it. If you're
broken, you're a fan of something.

760
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,140
I totally get it, man. I think
it's a gray as fuck area.

761
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:18,240
I don't think it's as simple as everyone
calls it stealing. I don't think it is.

762
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:20,580
I think it's ones and
Zeros and it's out there.

763
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,170
And I think that when people can
support you, they will support you.

764
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,380
And that kind of support I think is more
valuable voluntary support than people

765
00:45:30,781 --> 00:45:33,990
who just can't fucking afford
to support you financially.

766
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,980
But they still like what you're doing.
So I see it both ways.

767
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,930
I totally see the pirates point of view
and I totally see the artist's point of

768
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:45,660
view. I don't think it's
a cut and dry issue, man.

769
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:49,590
What you're doing is you're giving out
information, you know, you're given out,

770
00:45:49,591 --> 00:45:52,890
whether it's books or movies or it's,
if they enjoy it,

771
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:55,500
they're going to support it. If they can,
they're, they're going to support it.

772
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,700
You know? And it'll be like
an even proposition, you know,

773
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,160
when people can support
you and do support you,

774
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,040
well then the guy spent money
because he's a fan, you know,

775
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:07,650
and like you gave him some legit
shit and he wants to support you.

776
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:11,790
And that to me is a way better
exchange than he took the chance on.

777
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,240
I didn't like it. And you've got his
money anyway. I don't want that money.

778
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,270
You know, I want the money where you
know what the fuck you're getting. Right.

779
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,480
You know what I mean?
But that's not like for capitalism.

780
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:24,690
It's not the best strategy,
you know, unless you do,

781
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:27,930
a lot of people just got to figure out
new ways of working. I mean that's what,

782
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,430
you know, back in the day,
that's what Dane Cook did
with, I think his first album.

783
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:35,520
Right. He gave, he put it on the
Internet and gave it away for free.

784
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:38,700
And that's why everybody in
that age bracket at that time,

785
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,920
right when mp3s came out,

786
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:45,050
you had Dane cook stuff on there
cause he gave us and then look,

787
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,380
look what happened.
Let's see.

788
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:51,270
There's a big difference between us as
comics and music. The music industry,

789
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,180
the music industry is basically
nonexistent. It's gutted.

790
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:58,050
I mean they've lost so many
jobs and so much money for us.

791
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,570
See putting my stuff on like,
well I'm a fucking comic. I,

792
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:03,870
I'd go on stage and I talk. You know what
I'm saying? It's just me. I wrote it.

793
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,400
I sat down, I put it all together,
I performed it, you know,

794
00:47:06,401 --> 00:47:09,540
a thousand times over the year and
then boom, there it is. You know,

795
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:13,590
it's like there's such a big
difference between that, that as a,

796
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:17,700
as a piece of performance and music,
whereas you've got producers,

797
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,210
you've got all these fucking people
that are involved in it. The band,

798
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:24,150
you've got all the, the drummer you
got the guy writes the music, got the,

799
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,140
the guy who writes the lyrics, they all
have to go together. They've got agents,

800
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:30,400
they all have separate agency,
all of separate managers.

801
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,300
And then there's a fucking record producer
production company that acts actually

802
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,980
put money behind this and advertise them
and build up an image for them and get

803
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:42,130
them on all these television shows and
there's a fucking machine behind this

804
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:46,000
brand and that machine just got,
it's supplied to money cut off.

805
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,920
It's like somehow or another,
there's a giant leak in their barrel.

806
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:53,860
They're barrel of wealth that
they had forever. I mean they had,

807
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:56,500
they never thought the record
industry would go away. Jesus Christ,

808
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,030
everybody's been pimping artists
forever from the Elvis days,

809
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,430
Beatles, the rolling stones, you name it.

810
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:08,560
People got rich as fuck off of selling
them. And now that shit has changed.

811
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,470
It's changed radically. It's why
the record industry's coming back.

812
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,040
They're bringing back lps that you know,
a best buy.

813
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:18,370
I saw they have a bunch of lps now, you
know, like give me record disks. Yeah.

814
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:20,530
Because that's something,
you know, even if you steal,

815
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:23,140
you're buying something right
with the music and you don't.

816
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:24,880
People have a record and it's a novelty.

817
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:28,270
It's a novelty to have to
look at like Dee aunt word,

818
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,780
Deann word became famous
entirely through the Internet.

819
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,170
They don't need anybody else.
They don't need anybody else. Man.

820
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:39,370
They have a giant loyal fan base
already and growing all the time.

821
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,160
Every day when people are passing their
videos around and passed her songs were

822
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:45,400
on, they could fucking make their
own shit. If they had a backer,

823
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:49,350
they had someone to print
up their, there's their shit
and sell it and then it's,

824
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,270
you know, arrange a deal with iTunes,
arrange a deal with, you know,

825
00:48:52,271 --> 00:48:54,610
amazon.com and all those other
places that sell them online.

826
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,050
They don't need anybody. No. You
could do a new business. Yeah.

827
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:59,860
Especially even your comic.

828
00:48:59,861 --> 00:49:03,370
You could literally with some
small technology record your thing.

829
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,710
And have it up on iTunes in a day or two.

830
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,410
I wonder what the numb the
numbers on iTunes are though.

831
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:11,020
I wonder like what like
a really good selling,

832
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,640
like you know CD is on iTunes.
I believe they sell.

833
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,760
I was listening to a as if
it's 90% you know? Yeah.

834
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:22,690
It was just in a w train was talking on
a radio show and they were saying the

835
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:24,010
bad thing is let's say you,

836
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:28,030
you like some band and you have to buy
the whole album and then that would make

837
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:31,240
huge album sales.
But now if you only like the one song,

838
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:33,880
people are just going to
go get into one songs.

839
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:35,920
You're not really selling a lot of good.

840
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:38,470
That's because a lot of your
songs are wack as fuck son.

841
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,660
I need to get back to the drawing board,

842
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:44,560
get some stronger hash before
you put out your shit. Yeah man.

843
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,860
How many times have you gotten cds
in the past and where it was like,

844
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:50,860
there was like a couple of jam and
songs and there were some songs.

845
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:53,980
It looks like they just slapped that
bitch together to fill to most of them.

846
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,203
The worst is when you,

847
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,080
there was that one's got that one band
had a great song that hit and most of the

848
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:02,760
time their whole CD was just awful songs.
[inaudible]

849
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:06,280
the time. Uh, ice cream castles.

850
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:11,340
The only album because that was at the
time there were there five songs on that

851
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:13,960
album and a thinking back.
I'm like,

852
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:18,010
I paid full money for that when I was
that age and the only get five songs,

853
00:50:18,011 --> 00:50:22,570
there's less than 20 minutes. Brian
Find Morris Day and the time. Cool.

854
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,850
Because I'm cool dude.

855
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,010
[inaudible] Morris Day and the time.
Cool. This is one of my favorite songs.

856
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:32,840
When I was a kid,
I loved Morris Day.

857
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:36,170
I was always sad when Morris Day just
did not get the recognition I felt he

858
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:40,470
deserved to me. He was mad aging
personality and he's very interesting.

859
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:43,850
I like the, I just holds the
mirror Jerome. Yeah, Jesse.

860
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:47,770
Yeah.
Listen to this shit.

861
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:49,140
This is from,

862
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:55,350
what year is this baby?
I have no idea.

863
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,810
You've got to put on my NASA space
goggles for this. This is great.

864
00:50:58,811 --> 00:51:03,160
Welcome to the decimal.
A club. Cup it up like,

865
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,450
Hey, this isn't the right song dude.
Like the intro that he doesn't say cool.

866
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,680
This is not the right song. Boys
Day at a time to walk. Orion. Yeah.

867
00:51:14,681 --> 00:51:15,760
What's the name of the sidewall?

868
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:20,470
C. O. L. E. W. J. L. B.

869
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,950
I just wanted to get you guys warmed
down. Here it is bro. Turn though.

870
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:28,910
This song is one of my all time
favorites. It's not. It's not.

871
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:33,190
The library was. Please don't do it.
Go back and do it to me. Here we go.

872
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:37,900
We'll try that. No, by the shit
on Itunes, man. Jesus. Boy.

873
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:41,830
I'm to hate. Is that station
that all the music's on now,

874
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:43,750
is that Vivio or whatever?
That's on youtube.

875
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:47,110
Vimeo and they make you watch commercials.
Here it is. Give me some volume.

876
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,230
This is probably like,

877
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:56,231
what is this like an 83
or you feel like 81 81

878
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:58,983
years old

879
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:04,603
to

880
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,030
the majesty.

881
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:18,160
It's got everything bro. [inaudible]
everything. He's got everything.

882
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,880
[inaudible] [inaudible]
he's just bragging.

883
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,040
That's the whole song.
He's just a bad motherfucker.

884
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:04,370
Don't get [inaudible] my time.

885
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:15,450
Just letting me know.
Driven everywhere

886
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,490
to
take me home.

887
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:30,490
Dozens.
Dude's got doesn't ring right here.

888
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,470
Heaven knows it.

889
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:54,970
[inaudible]

890
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,520
the the narcissist song to get one.

891
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,670
The greatest narcissists
song perhaps ever.

892
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:07,520
Although a little bit earlier we were
talking about three guys sitting around on

893
00:54:07,521 --> 00:54:10,390
a dance floor. They couldn't really
commit, but during that song we were,

894
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:14,080
we were those three guys. I'll dance
right in front of Bitch. I ain't here.

895
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:19,050
You got the wrong guy. Brown wearing a
NASA suit would fuck it. Space Goggles on.

896
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,800
You don't think I'll dance in
front of you. Which by the way,

897
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,830
we were discussing before
when people travel,

898
00:54:23,831 --> 00:54:27,690
they should have to wear those when I'm
wearing them from no one everywhere.

899
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,000
This was my fanny pack. That's how I'm
gonna move around the airport. Right.

900
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,040
When people know where I am,
I wonder if they get,

901
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,430
you get in trouble to think like you
look like you work for the airport or

902
00:54:36,431 --> 00:54:39,520
something. You could just say this is
a fashion statement. [inaudible] Bro.

903
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:40,870
It's my travels.
Not like,

904
00:54:40,871 --> 00:54:44,470
it's not like official government aren't
wearing this on stage from now on just

905
00:54:44,471 --> 00:54:48,040
where Nasa Shit. We just think if you
only wore that for the rest of your life,

906
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:51,610
you'd never have to worry
about ever finding anything
else to wear it. Just that.

907
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,830
Yeah. But I don't want to be that guy,
dude. I don't want to be space. 1999 okay.

908
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,520
Why trying to sell me down that road?

909
00:54:57,521 --> 00:55:00,250
John Heffrons want to
wear a fucking jumpsuit.

910
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,480
I don't want to work in an aviation plant.
I don't want what you guys get though.

911
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:06,820
Did you get ice cream
too, bro? We're from NASA.

912
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,180
We worked for an acid the whole time.
Reason I've been asked,

913
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:14,010
questioning the moon landings. I
am an agent of disinformation. I'm,

914
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:18,190
I'm here to make a doubter's look
foolish. That's what I do. Yeah.

915
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:19,870
And I just worked in human resources,
but

916
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,940
believe it or not, easier to keep me
alive. Try not say anything. So yeah,

917
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,270
I get a little bit crazy when I did
that wacky tobacky inside me and,

918
00:55:30,271 --> 00:55:33,520
and they don't want me to represent the
company in a mostly sexual harassment.

919
00:55:33,521 --> 00:55:37,360
But yeah, for him, I, I talk about black
cock and I stayed in his eyes, hey,

920
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:40,150
I don't think it's sexual harassment,
but for him,

921
00:55:40,151 --> 00:55:43,690
whatever he gets nervous
happen once in space. Right.

922
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,280
Do you think sexual harassment and space,

923
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,610
can you imagine that if he
came back and the woman goes,

924
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,470
I would like to file a complaint.
We were up there.

925
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:54,700
If there was one camera that the the
astronauts didn't know about and then,

926
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,940
you know, get back to earth and
everybody, they're bringing my toe room.

927
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,800
Why do you want to explain what
the fuck this is all about?

928
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,230
They're all waitlists sucking
cock fly through, spinning,

929
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,620
rally air blowing each other.
I mean,

930
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,100
have you ever had sex experiments
up there? They had to off.

931
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,140
I'm sure it was off records, but
the Russians did it. The guy,

932
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:17,950
they probably can't help themselves.
They fuck those wild animals.

933
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,540
They're probably up there
just banging right now.

934
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:22,540
That was probably a pickup move.
Hey, I, this one's off the record.

935
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:25,750
Bob was supposed do sexual experiment
today. You know what? Honestly,

936
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:27,300
now that you brought this up,

937
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:31,690
I seem to remember that there was like
some sort of a debate on this recently

938
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,230
about where they were talking about people
having sexual relations in the space.

939
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:37,680
I'm going to have to Google that shit.
I wonder if they have banked.

940
00:56:37,681 --> 00:56:42,040
That was an issue. They should have a
birth in space. That'd be Badass. Yeah.

941
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:43,810
But could, you know, dude,

942
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:48,450
it would not be everywhere in
with lists. Yeah, you could. Yeah.

943
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,870
I'd be like better than giving good for
the kid. There's no way. Yeah, dude,

944
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,440
you can't have a kid in the high altitude.
You know, when we, we had to get out of,

945
00:56:57,441 --> 00:57:01,930
uh, the of the mountains mountains above
boulder because, uh, my wife was pregnant.

946
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:07,240
Imagine being a fucking space sex band
aboard the International Space Station.

947
00:57:07,241 --> 00:57:12,100
They have banned sex. You can forget
joining the 200 mile high club

948
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:19,220
a cig out the Massa commander Alan
Poindexter told the reporter about the

949
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,530
concert, who asked about the consequences
if astronauts boldly went where?

950
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:25,870
Probably know others have been.
Okay,

951
00:57:25,871 --> 00:57:30,871
what does that fucking Innuendo you bitch
ass politician that sexual intercourse

952
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:36,250
is not permitted. A board,
the International Space
Station, we are professionals.

953
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:40,150
Poindexter said we treat each other
with respect and we have a great working

954
00:57:40,151 --> 00:57:43,510
relationship.
Personal relationships are not an issue.

955
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:48,430
He explained we don't have
them and we won't. Hm. Well,

956
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:51,280
what are you going to do when people go
in a space for like six months at a time?

957
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:55,240
That's the thing. If they ever decided
to like Malay shares, what does it flow?

958
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,580
Some shit to footloose guy of the space.

959
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:02,440
There'll be no dancing to be no sex in
dancing on this and I got base stations

960
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:05,460
for you. Well, the way I look at it,
that galaxy come through here. We,

961
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:08,950
so we're technically not on the feet.
Do Roots.

962
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:12,430
If you got dudes in a spaceship and
they're traveling six months to Mars,

963
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,980
they might start bawling in each other.
I got news for you.

964
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,180
Six months is a long ass time though.
Scientists might crack just a,

965
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,740
I'd be fine with six lines.
You would be the,

966
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:27,710
I think we both have some friends. That
would not be. It'd be like when we,

967
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,260
all right guys,
let's someone's,

968
00:58:29,261 --> 00:58:32,350
someone's jerking me off and just tell
your story now before we go any further,

969
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:35,470
there's no big deal. Chokey comment. How
long can you only gave? It's on earth.

970
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:36,940
Both technically not on earth.

971
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,510
Close Your eyes and you pretend you're
making butter and I closed my eyes and

972
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:45,130
pretend you're a girl. That you're beefing
man. Like chimpanzee hand as a girls,

973
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:50,370
you're catalyst fucking thick fat fingered
knuckles as they pump up from my cock.

974
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:55,210
What Jeb? We talked about this in the
meetings. It's illegal by the way.

975
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,800
It's illegal. That's the thing. Now,

976
00:58:56,801 --> 00:59:00,040
you know sex is banned aboard
the International Space Station.

977
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:03,620
So we answered her own question. Okay.
So if you're the two people that, that,

978
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:07,180
that you do have sex, then is there a
third that's going to be the snitch?

979
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:12,170
Probably was the land and the
guy that was going to San Sacks,

980
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:14,590
jealousy,
some bitch locker.

981
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,900
Poindexter this guy's name's
Poindexter coincidence. I think not.

982
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,200
Or if you did it, you did. That would be
the biggest story ever. Yeah. If I said,

983
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:26,750
well, why is, why is a
second space illegals?

984
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:29,930
I'm fucking Poindexter and you can't
tell me what I can do in space.

985
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:33,380
Sounds like Lee Lee.
That's like [inaudible] is Brazilian.

986
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,350
If we had Brazilians in space, they would
just start fucking, they won't even ask.

987
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,740
Did you ask questions?
Say, well, Tao Tao the bag.

988
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:45,020
We had set a precedent sphere
first doing it and there's banging.

989
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:48,940
Did you know astronaut's camp? Bourbon
space? Astronauts cannot burp and space.

990
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:52,640
And why is that? I don't know.
It's a fact though. Really? Oh,

991
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:55,430
it's not physically possible.
No, it's not physically possible.

992
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,170
You can be good to stay in space,
Huh?

993
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,570
That cannot be good for you
when you're at zero altitude.

994
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:02,750
Apparently it plays all sorts
of havoc with your bones.

995
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:05,210
Like your bones get real brittle
and shit. They get like, you know,

996
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:08,690
they get thin and you're, you lose all
your muscle because you're not resisting.

997
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,000
You know, it's like, yeah,
you, he come down to earth.

998
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:14,300
It's like you're all fucked up man. It's
like look, you've been in bed for a year,

999
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,210
you know, man, it's pretty crazy.
Like you have to like recover.

1000
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,710
It takes a long ass time to recover.

1001
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:22,130
Can imagine now you can't
cry on space properly.

1002
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,980
So how the fuck are they ever going to
have it so that people can go, I mean how,

1003
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:28,490
what's the longest that that a person's
been in a space station is like a year.

1004
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:32,480
If they'd done a year up there by
themselves. Who's done the longest? No,

1005
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:35,930
I have no idea. We should find
out how would they going to me,

1006
01:00:35,931 --> 01:00:38,930
cause like when you see like shows like
Battlestar Galactica and shit and people

1007
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:41,330
are traveling across the galaxy
like a cool, it's like a mall.

1008
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:45,200
It's like as you make gravity, do you
make fake gravity on the, on those ship?

1009
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,610
Is that possible?
Can I do that?

1010
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,240
Can you make fake gravity until they
make fake gravity? How the fuck that?

1011
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:56,090
Fuck gravity with the jets. You how are
they free fall? Yeah. Or is that's fake.

1012
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:58,910
No gravity. Right? We
need to do it backwards.

1013
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,960
Or do you adjust it like the temperature
in the house so you can like go. It's,

1014
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:04,700
there's a little too much gravity here.

1015
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:08,300
There's a little too less and there's
a dial just on the law that Kirk,

1016
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:11,610
can you just go and turn up and
people float a little bit easier?

1017
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,760
Good question. I'm on space. Age does not
a good question. It was a good question.

1018
01:01:16,761 --> 01:01:20,320
Both me and Brian be like, wow,
what a good question. You're,

1019
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:22,760
you're taking credit for something
that was not that good fellow.

1020
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:27,200
Did you know Venus is a planet
that rotates clockwise? Holy Shit.

1021
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:28,100
Check this dude out.

1022
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:33,100
This guy has been up there for 748 days.
Ooh,

1023
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:38,370
whoa. I bet he's crazy. Oh No. No
cumulative time in space ever. Oh,

1024
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,640
okay.
You cons?

1025
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,680
I think there's guys who can mean they
dropped him off at his space station,

1026
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:45,760
left him up there.
There's a country. Yeah,

1027
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:49,490
because isn't that what the space shuttle
does is go up and give those guys like

1028
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:52,220
help them out and well, yeah, they
leave him up there for a few months.

1029
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,220
That's gotta be so hard.
I mean,

1030
01:01:55,221 --> 01:01:58,460
I've been a gas stations in middle of
the country where dudes I think are

1031
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:01,970
equally as trapped. Well they don't move
around much up there either. You know,

1032
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:04,190
there's not like a lot of
room. It's not like, you know,

1033
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:07,670
you're up in like a hotel
room in the sky. Like, no,

1034
01:02:07,671 --> 01:02:09,410
you're in like these fucking tubes.

1035
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:14,600
What happens if you go counseling or you
can, you know, there's, there was one,

1036
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:18,260
um, there was an issue where they were
talking about having a gun on board and

1037
01:02:18,261 --> 01:02:20,790
whether or not they should have
gun on a case. If the shoes,

1038
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:23,430
I should look up that too.
Gun on speeding. Crazy.

1039
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:27,540
Youtube commentators are just astronauts
that have gone crazy up in spaces being

1040
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:30,280
assholes because they're
fucked.

1041
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:34,660
His video space station
crew can access a gun. Yeah.

1042
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:38,070
Yeah. They have a gun up there, man.
They have a gun up, Derek. He said what?

1043
01:02:38,071 --> 01:02:39,580
He goes low loony k.

1044
01:02:39,581 --> 01:02:43,550
Some dude goes like fucking event horizon
and pulses eyeballs out and starts

1045
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:47,640
screaming Latin at you. Do you ever
see that movie dad? They went into,

1046
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:52,200
they went through some fucking wormhole
and it's like some futuristic science

1047
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:55,740
fiction horror movie and it's
what the dude from Jurassic Park,

1048
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:59,610
I forget his name, but uh, it's kind of
fun. It's kind of stupid fun, you know,

1049
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,660
stupid fun space, horror
movie. And he uh, he goes,

1050
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:08,070
naughty guy with a gun.
Did you see that video of that cop debt?

1051
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,270
This guy was Robin,

1052
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:14,271
like a cvs cop comes in
just to get something into
standing behind them and then

1053
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:19,290
realizes what he's doing. If you, you
know, I think it's new. No. Where's that?

1054
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:22,980
Is that a great deal? Here's the deal
with the gun. The Russians have the gun,

1055
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:27,360
those mother fuckers every, this is
how it goes on the spaces. Every space.

1056
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:32,340
Craft carriers, survival gear for crash
landing and the Russian suse, s, O, y,

1057
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:36,690
u, Z. I don't know how to say that.
Suis Suez has a kit that includes a gun.

1058
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:41,370
Russians leave it to the Russians.
There's smart man. They're like, well,

1059
01:03:41,371 --> 01:03:45,690
I fuck around building a gun. We have a
gun than a kettle bell. You don't need it.

1060
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:50,870
You have it better done than to need it
and not have the gun has been there for

1061
01:03:52,201 --> 01:03:54,150
as long as the space
station has been an orbit.

1062
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,160
Its existence has been kept secret.

1063
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:59,490
NASA and Russian officials
won't talk publicly about it.

1064
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:01,943
That's funny.

1065
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:05,880
You can't talk about the fact that people
might go crazy because then you plant

1066
01:04:05,881 --> 01:04:08,370
that little seed out there and
then they could possibly go crazy.

1067
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,490
It's very tricky, right? Hmm. No,

1068
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,950
that's not, you know, you gotta
be tricky, man. You don't want to,

1069
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,630
you want to plant the seed.

1070
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:22,610
You want to say everyone who's done
this mission has found it invigorating.

1071
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:26,280
They come back and you write a book.
It's foster phobia.

1072
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:29,670
We're really gone by the first couple
of the preframe them before yourself.

1073
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,270
All the view is so spectacular.
I guarantee you,

1074
01:04:33,271 --> 01:04:36,390
you're just going to have a
smile on your face all day.

1075
01:04:36,391 --> 01:04:37,620
Don't forget to take pictures.

1076
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:40,440
You think you're there and then there
you are on day two and you're like,

1077
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:44,410
oh my God, I'm stuck up here
for six months. Gun. What?

1078
01:04:44,411 --> 01:04:48,870
The God closet in the cloud and he's a
Chinese guy. Keeps filling with a gun.

1079
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,390
I want to kill him with these chopsticks.
Shut off.

1080
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:53,920
I get about the gun fucking ears.
There's a gun on this.

1081
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,380
Make sure that bullet
only goes through him. No,

1082
01:04:57,381 --> 01:05:01,260
and not through the Hall Mall Space.
How do you shoot a gun and space?

1083
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:04,980
What if you blow a hole through the
wall? Doesn't everything explode? I mean,

1084
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:08,250
aren't you going like fucking 3000 miles
an hour or something crazy and what?

1085
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:11,340
I think when you're on an airplane can,
if you should have gotten in an airplane,

1086
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,580
yes. You know what else tries me crazy
about the space station. My seat up.

1087
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:18,370
There I go.
Wouldn't you think constantly that you're

1088
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:20,290
going to get hit by a
meteor or an asteroid?

1089
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:25,660
I guess there's a lot of stuff up there,
dude. I would be fucking freaking figure.

1090
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:27,070
I mean if they figured
out how to avoid it,

1091
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:29,500
I don't think there's been an
instance where anybody's gotten hurt.

1092
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:32,680
But if you look at the night
and you see like shooting stars,

1093
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:36,670
those are fucking just rocks
not manned by that stuff.

1094
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:39,640
They have one guy just on thruster,
just like a video game.

1095
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:42,310
We're going to head comm. They don't
see those things until they're awake.

1096
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:45,130
It's till it's way too late.
And the darkness of space,

1097
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,570
you don't see things like you. You
can't just look out for it, you know?

1098
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:51,220
And little ones,
micro meteors,

1099
01:05:51,221 --> 01:05:54,760
they're like little fucking grains of
sand that will go right through metal.

1100
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:57,040
You know though, how do you
not get it? But I don't know.

1101
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,290
I don't know how they avoid that.
Somehow or another,

1102
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,620
maybe they just roll the dice and
hope everything's going to be okay.

1103
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,980
But if they got caught in some sort of
media I'd shower and it just hit the

1104
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:10,390
right spot. Like, Oh man, I think
could get fucked up. Hmm. And,

1105
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:14,350
and you don't have like force fields,
no force fields.

1106
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:20,680
So that's not the idea of us getting
wiped out by a meteor. Seems so alien.

1107
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:23,410
Seems impossible.
It seems so stupid.

1108
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:27,040
Like to even bring it up is like you
think you really worry that people would

1109
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:30,550
get wiped out by a meteor impact
or an asteroid impact really.

1110
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:31,900
Does that really bother you that much?

1111
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,860
But then you know that it's happened like
all these times throughout the history

1112
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:38,560
of the earth. Like why wouldn't
we be thinking about that?

1113
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:41,560
Why the fuck did we think that we're
immune to all the shit that has definitely

1114
01:06:41,561 --> 01:06:44,560
happened before. Right. You know,
we just keep going through like,

1115
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:47,140
hey we're going to be fine. No
worry bumped meteors. Come on man.

1116
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:51,130
In one sense it's true. You can't
live your life worrying about meteors.

1117
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:53,530
Cause then you waste your whole life
and you're an old man on your death bed

1118
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:58,360
going, fuck not a single media. And
then you'd die and then yet you know,

1119
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:01,870
and you go, God, I could've had a goddamn
party if I just ignore those meteors.

1120
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:05,280
But that's like with everything into
one that focuses their time on that is

1121
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:06,150
ridiculous.
Like,

1122
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:10,620
did you see that story of that lady was
just driving with her whole family and

1123
01:07:10,621 --> 01:07:13,530
like a car in front of her,
like hit up pot,

1124
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,910
a pot hole that they fixed,
but they didn't fix it all the way.

1125
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,440
And so when the car in
front of it hits it,

1126
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:24,480
it made the concrete fly off and it went
right through the windshield of the car

1127
01:07:24,511 --> 01:07:28,920
behind them and just woman's face
smashed, gone. And she died instantly.

1128
01:07:28,921 --> 01:07:32,280
And it's like, that's like a meteor. You
know? If you're worrying about a meteor,

1129
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:34,530
same thing would've happened.
You'd just be dead, you know?

1130
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:38,130
Why would you be so concerned about
meteors killing you? You know,

1131
01:07:38,131 --> 01:07:38,964
when anything be

1132
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,840
some strong logic there. Brian, you know,
I liked the way you said that. Oh yeah.

1133
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,590
I mean,
I'm not really worried about meteor,

1134
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,450
so I don't think anybody would be or
could be. Right. You can't really,

1135
01:07:48,451 --> 01:07:50,670
you can't even intellectualize it.
That's what I'm saying.

1136
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:54,510
It's like the idea is so alien to us.
It seems like it's fiction.

1137
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:58,160
It seems ridiculous, even though
it's absolutely true. Yeah.

1138
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,410
We'll probably be hit by Mexico
before we be hit by a meteor.

1139
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:07,100
I think the aliens are coming first before
anything happens to come in and save

1140
01:08:07,591 --> 01:08:11,680
us. John F John F on, do
you believe in aliens? Um,

1141
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:14,400
I would say yes. There's
got to be, we can't.

1142
01:08:14,401 --> 01:08:18,320
I think we can't be the only
once we would most likely.

1143
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:23,040
But do you think they've ever been
here? Um, I would like to think so.

1144
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:25,500
I don't know. I mean, you watch all the,

1145
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:28,610
the pyramid stuff and then you see people
try to create and you can go, okay,

1146
01:08:28,611 --> 01:08:31,670
how was that? Or yeah, but
that doesn't mean that the,

1147
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:35,150
the most likely scenario for
the pyramids is not that if you,

1148
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:38,300
if you go and do it, the most likely
scenario, which is really fascinating,

1149
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,260
is that they were an incredibly,
incredibly advanced civilization.

1150
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:43,430
And it's somehow or another,

1151
01:08:43,431 --> 01:08:47,510
they fell from that high level of
advancement and became, you know,

1152
01:08:47,511 --> 01:08:51,000
rather ordinary, which is how Egypt
is now. You know, that's what's I,

1153
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:54,590
I'd say actually even more fascinating
that it was obtained by human beings and

1154
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:58,360
that something happened. Whether it's,
you know, people just kept coming in.

1155
01:08:58,361 --> 01:08:59,370
My joke that I still,

1156
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:03,200
my act is that all these dumb people out
fuck the smart people and there was no

1157
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:07,250
smart people left and they wonder what
their version of keeping up with the

1158
01:09:07,251 --> 01:09:08,750
Kardashians was.

1159
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:11,480
Cause maybe something like that happened
and then should they were going to be

1160
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:14,210
this super smart race. Then Bam. Dot.

1161
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:17,390
Hasselhoff you blaming the
keeping up with the Kardashians,

1162
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,270
those type of shows that still
shows are just a symptom.

1163
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:23,870
There are a symptom of the rot under the,
what was their version of that like?

1164
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:28,790
Maybe there was a guy who stood in front
of a colleague seeing things and people

1165
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:30,170
listened to him and then they stop.

1166
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:33,380
I think most likely the
Egyptians were super advanced,

1167
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:36,740
but there were advanced in a completely
different direction than we're advanced.

1168
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,350
You know,
we've spent all this time and you know,

1169
01:09:39,351 --> 01:09:44,180
working on computers and working on
technology and working on, you know,

1170
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:48,290
the ability to split the atom and
nuclear power and all this crazy shit.

1171
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:51,230
Whereas I think they spent a lot of their,

1172
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:55,580
their science and their ideas on studying
the cosmos and they had all these

1173
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,440
wacky ideas about the afterlife and
the human body and that they're there.

1174
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,420
They were fascinating
as far as like their,

1175
01:10:02,421 --> 01:10:06,200
their ability to make objects and
construct things that were so much more

1176
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:09,110
advanced than anybody else near them.
Anybody else,

1177
01:10:09,111 --> 01:10:12,410
anywhere else in the world of fun?
I mean they were making these incredible,

1178
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:16,490
incredible fucking structures,
like the Great Pyramid, 2 million,

1179
01:10:16,491 --> 01:10:18,260
300,000 stones.

1180
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,620
I mean some people think they poured
them with concrete and they made concrete

1181
01:10:21,621 --> 01:10:23,810
out of them. Some people think they
were caught, whatever the fuck they did.

1182
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,960
I mean the fact that anybody was able
to do that at least a few thousand years

1183
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,160
ago where they think it's 2,500 BC.

1184
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:34,310
But there's some other people like John
Anthony West that think that, you know,

1185
01:10:34,311 --> 01:10:37,550
the, the, the oldest part of
Egypt is even older than that,

1186
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:41,960
but there's some structures that they
found under the sand that predate even the

1187
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:44,340
construction of the Great Pyramids
that are these amazing, you know,

1188
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:46,960
stone structures.
And the idea is that there was a,

1189
01:10:46,961 --> 01:10:50,630
a civilization there thousands and
thousands and thousands of years ago,

1190
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,570
maybe even 30,000 years,
a really super advanced civilization.

1191
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,690
And that there was a few of these all
over the world, but some shit happened,

1192
01:10:56,810 --> 01:11:00,380
some shit went down, whether it's
a meteor or whether it's, you know,

1193
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:05,381
some crazy supervolcano or some massive
fucking disease that killed everybody.

1194
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:08,420
Hmm. The weird thing is
you're from Detroit, right?

1195
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:11,510
The weird thing is when
civilizations fall apart,

1196
01:11:11,511 --> 01:11:16,290
it does not take long for the
fucking earth to take back
the land. Yeah. You know,

1197
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:16,891
Detroit,

1198
01:11:16,891 --> 01:11:21,750
I mean has a huge issue now with first
of all bears and some of the outlying

1199
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:23,400
cities,
the outlying towns,

1200
01:11:23,401 --> 01:11:27,060
bears have started moving into towns
because there's so few houses because the

1201
01:11:27,061 --> 01:11:28,920
houses are broken down
and all these houses,

1202
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:31,050
there's like a website
that was dedicated to it.

1203
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:35,190
All these houses where trees are growing
through the fucking the front floor and

1204
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:37,230
the porch is getting eaten up by trees.

1205
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,100
It's like nature is just taken over
that shit over in a couple of decades.

1206
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:41,930
Not even.

1207
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,250
Yeah,
and that's the thing about Detroit.

1208
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:46,640
It's not even a scary city in the sense
that there's a lot of people there.

1209
01:11:46,641 --> 01:11:48,350
It's so ghost towny yeah,

1210
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:52,430
you can go for subdivision cause they
were trying to do a lot of that urban

1211
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:55,910
farming where they were just going to
blow up subdivisions and stop putting

1212
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:59,600
greenhouses and going, let's just start
growing stuff in the middle of the city.

1213
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,150
Wow. They're really going to
turn it back into the country.

1214
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:05,160
That's what they're doing.
How nutty is that urban?

1215
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:09,620
There's so few people there that that's
like actually a legit move. Yeah. Yeah.

1216
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:12,920
There's tear down the houses and build
huge greenhouses and just dealt right now

1217
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,980
cause now that can do that with
soil and they can just all right.

1218
01:12:15,981 --> 01:12:18,500
That's why if the, you know,
well we were the last pot,

1219
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,710
well we were there for the well that
would definitely help them. You know,

1220
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:26,330
just call on when we were there for the
UFC they said it's 33% unemployment rate

1221
01:12:26,331 --> 01:12:30,750
in Detroit now. 33% that's
insane. Yup. One out of five.

1222
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:34,760
That's insane. It shows you what those
auto jobs through what one auto job did,

1223
01:12:34,761 --> 01:12:38,720
you know that's amazing.
One out of three is unemployed three guys.

1224
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,570
One of them was out of work. That's
amazing. And when you go there it's,

1225
01:12:41,571 --> 01:12:46,571
it's such a weird vibe that it obviously
so that everybody has that mentality.

1226
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:48,710
Everybody just feels like all my,
you know,

1227
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:52,820
my whole family and everyone I went to
high school with and college all has that

1228
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,120
we've been beat on mentality like do but

1229
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,770
til way better off than third
world countries. You know,

1230
01:12:58,771 --> 01:13:00,930
if everybody just moved
in together and you know,

1231
01:13:00,931 --> 01:13:03,750
and had less meaningful if w
two out of three are working,

1232
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,200
that's still way better than Guatemala.
You know,

1233
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,720
if everybody had like a real sense of
community and hoard it all together and

1234
01:13:09,721 --> 01:13:12,690
got all the family together and they all
ate meals together and they all shared

1235
01:13:12,691 --> 01:13:15,600
wealth. Yeah. You know,
it's just, it would be fine.

1236
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,820
There's still a first world country.
It's still America,

1237
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:21,450
but nobody wants to live like that and
everybody wants to have their own fucking

1238
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:26,340
parking spot. And you know, I mean,
in one sense, I understand. I mean,

1239
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:29,490
everybody used to have it just a
little while ago, but in other sense,

1240
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:33,710
no matter how bad Detroit is, you
know, it's not fucking Peru. No.

1241
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:36,060
You know what I mean?
There's some spots in this,

1242
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:40,410
there's some spots in this
country or this, uh, this
map rather, where, you know,

1243
01:13:40,411 --> 01:13:43,170
you can go to countries where there,
there's just fucked man.

1244
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,380
They're never going to get out of
this hole. There's just poverty.

1245
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,450
And everywhere you go, there's, you know,

1246
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:51,570
these factories that are popping up out
of nowhere and they're polluting the

1247
01:13:51,571 --> 01:13:55,890
rivers and there's no jobs and
there's no fucking future and no hope,

1248
01:13:56,190 --> 01:14:00,600
just sadness. So Detroit not
that fucking bad, you know?

1249
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,330
And I always slept around Goddamn time.
Still America.

1250
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:06,370
Yeah. Yeah. I went to this bar
the other day called bar sinister.

1251
01:14:06,371 --> 01:14:07,640
Have you ever been to it Joe?

1252
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:12,200
It's a bondage bar I've ever
been to bondage Barbara for

1253
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:16,760
doing when you're not with me, I'm going
to lose you. But there were, there was,

1254
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:21,220
there was, there was a party, you're
going to get raped. I know those places.

1255
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:23,500
There was a, there was a party
though and it was pretty sweet.

1256
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,800
But you walk in and there's like
these like handcuffs and just people,

1257
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:29,260
normal growth. Like, oh my
god, ha ha, I'm at this bar.

1258
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:33,220
They get tied up in these guys with whips
come out and just start spanking them.

1259
01:14:33,221 --> 01:14:36,370
They're just like, oh my God. Yeah.
You know, there were two normal girls.

1260
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,410
Guess what? Those aren't
normal girls. Yeah. Well,

1261
01:14:38,411 --> 01:14:40,800
I mean normal girls don't
like full of whipple.

1262
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:44,380
They looked like fucking snow white.
These girls are like, they were just like,

1263
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:47,740
oh my God, we're out of at, you know,
like tourists. That's what they look like.

1264
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,500
Okay. And it was the greatest
thing ever, man. He's like,

1265
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:53,950
do you think they got caught up in the
moment or do you think that's like holy

1266
01:14:53,951 --> 01:14:56,400
loving it and it was just chicks?
It was kind of like the,

1267
01:14:56,401 --> 01:14:59,560
the crowd that you would see like
at dimples when you do Karaoke,

1268
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,830
which is just a bunch of girls there
at the Party and have fun. It was like,

1269
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:07,120
that is kind of bowls demos as a
thing that John used to be a dumb,

1270
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:10,240
the master. He would go every
weekend when he was, uh,

1271
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:14,890
it was by my house in Burbank. It just,
uh, you see it on a lot of TV shows.

1272
01:15:14,891 --> 01:15:18,460
It's like the first karaoke bar
in the country and it's, I mean,

1273
01:15:18,461 --> 01:15:21,880
that's her Brittany Spears got busted
for if we're doing like a lot of famous

1274
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:25,540
people go there. It's the dive.
Iest uh, that's where they were at.

1275
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:28,690
The Bar story happened and uh,
yeah,

1276
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:32,530
but I used to live right dash
paint Christmas eve there.
Once I spent Christmas,

1277
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:37,450
there was no dancing by yourself.
He rocked George.

1278
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:40,240
Michael was your thing, right? Yeah.
Yeah. We me and a buddy would sing.

1279
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:43,360
What song would you sing last Christmas?

1280
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,310
Well he would sing cause he's from
wherever. George Michael's farm.

1281
01:15:46,311 --> 01:15:49,420
So he sounds exactly like them.
George Michael.

1282
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:52,150
So I would just be up there and the people
that are like, you guys are so good.

1283
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:57,250
Keep in mind, dude, I was 24 years
old when I see a little George. Mike,

1284
01:15:57,251 --> 01:16:00,850
you were the guy you were
trying hard to karaoke. No,

1285
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:02,470
karaoke scares me to death.

1286
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:05,830
I literally will have a panic attack
before I get on stage and sing.

1287
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:09,250
Unless there's like five
other people with me,

1288
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:11,500
then I can just be the guy
who gets lost in the back.

1289
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:15,940
So what are you talking about then?
But I would go on stage. Right.

1290
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:20,230
And then, you know, cause I'm
still, and then you'd sing a song.

1291
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,060
It was either this one or in the funny
thing, you would do this in July.

1292
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:29,840
Took it song, sing it for us,
John. No, I think that's a really,

1293
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:35,200
really like, if this comes on the
radio, are you going to change it? Um,

1294
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,000
to be honest,
I would probably leave it on,

1295
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:41,700
I wouldn't have to go from m
and M to this to seven dust. Uh,

1296
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:47,380
I would have to be really, really
hard to listen to this. Yeah,

1297
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:48,160
really high.

1298
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,160
I would have to be so hard that I
shouldn't be driving or there was no other

1299
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:54,130
cars around you while you were driving.
I have gotten so high,

1300
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:58,780
those by myself at an airport cuddled
up in the corner with the iPod going,

1301
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:01,950
what is this going on here?
That's what the song is. The song,

1302
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:05,700
you renew the lot cards in Los Angeles.
The guy plays his song and goes, Julie,

1303
01:17:05,701 --> 01:17:10,190
you like this? And then if you go, yeah,
I'm kind of into it. Here's your card.

1304
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:14,990
This is, this is one of those songs you
find in your iPod and you really go,

1305
01:17:14,991 --> 01:17:16,850
what the fuck was going on?

1306
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,400
How about you're at the gym and
somebody asks you a question,

1307
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:23,120
when you take it out of your ears,
this is what they here. Do you ever um,

1308
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:26,510
press shuffle and get embarrassed
by your collection of Shit?

1309
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:29,340
Yeah. That you have? Yeah, I have some,

1310
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:33,750
I have some songs that I'm not sure if
I bought them as a goof or you're in the

1311
01:17:33,751 --> 01:17:36,200
mood sometimes I just don't know.
You know,

1312
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,060
how many times have we been on the road
and we'd go to like a record store and

1313
01:17:39,061 --> 01:17:42,450
you'd just buy the most ridiculous cds
just cause you and Joey Diaz started

1314
01:17:42,451 --> 01:17:43,650
talking about in the car.

1315
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:47,250
And next thing you know you have mc
hammer the ghostbuster too soon. Yeah,

1316
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:51,160
track. Hey, track four is legit.

1317
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:55,810
My Proton pack on my back and disparate
Joey Diaz will get me excited about

1318
01:17:55,811 --> 01:17:58,890
music. That's the truth. Joey Diaz
starts talking about pink Floyd.

1319
01:17:58,891 --> 01:18:02,230
Do you want to move to England? Where
were they? What's the neighborhood?

1320
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,390
What's the street like?
I drive in the left hand side.

1321
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:07,980
I'm fucking moving man money and we're
just going to sit and listen to it all

1322
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:12,520
day. Let me Cox like a David Gilmore
in 1972 dirty white boys in England.

1323
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:16,390
These dirty motherfuckers coming up with
the greatest music the world has ever

1324
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:20,710
known. The world has ever known. Dog,
I'll give you the fucking address.

1325
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:25,280
1826 Lancaster street. You're like, I
gotta get on a plane. I'll kind of go,

1326
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,100
I've got to find my destiny.

1327
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,250
The craziest thing with Joey when he
talks about music is sometimes he'll just

1328
01:18:30,251 --> 01:18:33,370
break out somebody's name and I'd be like,
no way. That's a good song. He's like,

1329
01:18:33,371 --> 01:18:35,680
no,
it's John Test and the pointer sisters,

1330
01:18:35,681 --> 01:18:38,320
they're doing it too wet and you're like,
no way is that good.

1331
01:18:38,321 --> 01:18:41,980
And he puts it on and it's great. Oh,
he's kind of a knowledge for it. Well,

1332
01:18:41,981 --> 01:18:46,120
all he does is smoke weed and sit around
and come up with shit. Yeah. You know?

1333
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:49,510
I mean, that's what he does. He smokes
weed. He watches Clint Eastwood movies.

1334
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:53,470
He smokes weed. He watches Steve
McQueen movies. He smokes weed.

1335
01:18:53,471 --> 01:18:57,520
He listens to music, he smokes
weed. He writes jokes. Have
you seen black swan yet?

1336
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:59,920
What does that,
it's a new horror movie.

1337
01:18:59,921 --> 01:19:03,010
Or a suspense movie called Black
Swan and everyone that has seen it,

1338
01:19:03,011 --> 01:19:07,250
it's told me that is the craziest movie
of the year. You've got to see it insane.

1339
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,780
It's, you haven't heard about
it? No, I haven't heard anything.

1340
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:13,870
It's called Black Swan I think is
black swan. Let me double check,

1341
01:19:13,871 --> 01:19:18,460
but I'm pretty sure it's black. So on.
Wow. Um, whenever they heard hazing, man,

1342
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,620
I don't know man. It,
yeah, it's Black Swan.

1343
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:21,410
Yeah.

1344
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:23,840
Here, check out this
trailer, uh, of this movie.

1345
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:24,630
Yeah.

1346
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:28,110
This is pretty crazy.
And it's a Free Camille Black Swan.

1347
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:29,490
Is this an American film?
Yeah.

1348
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:34,670
We're going to play with them.
The video later, gentleman.

1349
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:38,700
[inaudible] you can't see it.
It's a green band trailer.

1350
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,313
Okay.

1351
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,630
It's restricted.

1352
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:46,760
Had the craziest dream last night.

1353
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:51,710
Better girl who's turned into a smile
pair prints cause for the wrong girl.

1354
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:53,930
She kills her stuff.

1355
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,090
[inaudible]

1356
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:00,820
he burned Mr. Feature me more
this season. Oh, he should.

1357
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:04,900
You've been there long enough and you're
the most dedicated dancer in the company

1358
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,700
or New Swan Queen.

1359
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:10,890
The exquisite Nina Sears.

1360
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:19,830
Lilly, you're going to be amazing
how much? The way she moves central.

1361
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,090
She's not faking it.

1362
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:26,300
These are all hot jacket.
Come on.

1363
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:29,900
They go in through ballet. I
took a class here. You sweet.

1364
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,820
Kurt's about to get crazy on my dodge
was hard for teachers.

1365
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:40,010
I don't want to talk about that. Feeling
me to relax. [inaudible] it's the rule,

1366
01:20:40,011 --> 01:20:43,000
isn't it? It's all this pressure.
I knew it'd be too much. I knew it.

1367
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:45,680
What's she doing here?
He made me your ultimate,

1368
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,270
the only person standing
in your way is you.

1369
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:56,070
[inaudible] Hey,

1370
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,910
no wireless.
I have my ways.

1371
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:05,760
Whoa. Lesbos Shit. Yeah. Oh, they're
going at it. I thought it was a hard movie

1372
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:14,480
to my sweet girl.

1373
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:24,810
Be sure this is the hardware we did. Yeah,
I heard it's really fucked up too. Yeah.

1374
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,793
Yeah.

1375
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:29,630
I think that the rotten tomatoes score
is like 83% they're not going to show you

1376
01:21:29,631 --> 01:21:32,960
any monsters. Look her eyes. Whoa.
What's going on there? I don't know.

1377
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:38,210
She's turning into a swan. Really?
When's this come out? It's out right now,

1378
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:42,080
but yeah, it's been long period has been
going through tonight. Let me go tonight.

1379
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:47,060
Uh, I can't, I got to stand
up. Comedy did too. Oh,

1380
01:21:47,061 --> 01:21:49,260
really? Yeah. It's
house south, by the way.

1381
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:51,860
Sunday I'm having a little
comedy show at Sal's.

1382
01:21:51,861 --> 01:21:55,210
It's going to open mic mixed
with comics. Like, like, like,

1383
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,830
like regular commingle comics. Yeah.
It's gonna be a lottery systems though.

1384
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:02,630
It might come down. Yeah.
Check Salads. Feeling better.
New Soles on Melrose Avenue,

1385
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:06,140
Melrose. And what a, it says Vienna cafe.

1386
01:22:06,141 --> 01:22:09,530
It's a yellow awning or right
across the street from us. Seven 11.

1387
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:13,250
I don't know the cross street
off hand, but it's on Melrose.
Yeah, it's on Melrose,

1388
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:16,970
east or west of, um, the uh, improv.

1389
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,920
If you're a northeast, it's south of
the Improv. Isn't that right? South? No,

1390
01:22:21,921 --> 01:22:24,440
because they're on the same street and
the street goes east to west. Okay.

1391
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:29,270
If you're facing the Improv, yeah. Turn
left and you go down to me. That's east.

1392
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,660
East. Yeah, I think, yeah.
Yeah. The ugly. Right.

1393
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:37,520
88% for black swan on rotten
tomatoes. Him. That's pretty strong.

1394
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,020
It's out right now outright. It's that
cool. I heard it was fucking Badass low.

1395
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:45,100
I saw heard that fighter movie was really
good. That's really good too. Yeah,

1396
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:48,350
that's the one I want to Christian
Bale, man, that guy, there's,

1397
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,330
there's dudes who like,

1398
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,960
they do something when they get a role,
you know,

1399
01:22:53,961 --> 01:22:57,860
that completely transforms their body but
nobody does it. Like that fucking guy.

1400
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:00,080
Did you ever see the machinist?
Yeah.

1401
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:04,520
How did those guys change their bodies
so much? What did you see? The machinist,

1402
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:06,310
you know he did no,

1403
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,570
do you know what I'm talking about?
Full blown.

1404
01:23:08,571 --> 01:23:11,240
And machinists was a movie
where he lost super skinny.

1405
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:16,750
He was eating like an apple and
a can of tuna a day. That's it.

1406
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:21,580
And he literally like, he probably
fucked up his body. Like when you're,

1407
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,030
when you do something like that and
you probably take years off your life,

1408
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:26,860
you probably damage your organs.

1409
01:23:26,861 --> 01:23:31,480
Like what he did was extreme like
really like almost like he looked like a

1410
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:34,930
monster, you know, like he would, he
would like make life a little crazy,

1411
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:39,430
like you know, gestures and there's
photos and videos of it all on online.

1412
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,620
Like people use it as a
avatars on message boards.

1413
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:44,320
Just because it's so fucking
creepy, man. There's,

1414
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:47,060
there's dudes that are willing to go
that extra mile and he's one of them.

1415
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:50,290
And then how do they get
big enough to be Batman?

1416
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:54,190
Just get on the juice son here.
Start telling some spots,

1417
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:58,570
eat some burgers. I don't know. I
mean I guess if you, you rehydrate,

1418
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,003
um,

1419
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,790
I guess like how long would it take
you to get back to your normal salvo?

1420
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:05,653
Take months.

1421
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:08,410
It would definitely take notes months
and months and you would have to do it

1422
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:12,130
slowly. You know, your body just
suddenly you starve it like that.

1423
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:16,510
Your body like would not be very receptive
to weight lifting or anything either.

1424
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:19,000
You're Bobby probably be so freaked out,
you know,

1425
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:23,050
just probably trying to like
try not to. Yeah, yeah. No Shit.

1426
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:27,520
All then I won't do it then. Don't
do that, dude. What'd you do that,

1427
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,320
if you ever got a movie,
Somebody said, John have fun.

1428
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,570
We want you to be in this movie,
but you've got to play this crack head.

1429
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,100
You got to lose like 100 pounds.

1430
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:37,150
You got to look all fucked up when
a scratch you up and my whole life,

1431
01:24:37,151 --> 01:24:41,080
ever since I wrestled 98 pounds than
one oh five I just kept telling myself,

1432
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:44,260
I will rule the world if I'm one
60 I haven't ruled the world.

1433
01:24:44,261 --> 01:24:46,420
If I'm one 70 now I'm
like one 80 I'm like,

1434
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,970
I need to get back to one
70 my face is round and fat.

1435
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:52,780
Too many singers losing weight
in high school for wrestling.

1436
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:54,760
I did it for wrestling and
I did it for taekwondo.

1437
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:57,260
It's the stupidest thing in high school.

1438
01:24:57,261 --> 01:24:59,470
Half the people that are
growing and they're, they're,

1439
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:03,460
they're getting them to do stuff to
their body and cut weight so bad.

1440
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:05,860
Luckily I was always little
so I never had to cut.

1441
01:25:05,861 --> 01:25:10,630
I mean I was that small anyway. Yeah,
but you didn't cut anything? I never did.

1442
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:14,290
Oh really? Yeah, I know. I've always
had us cut everybody cut weight.

1443
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:18,940
I was always like four pounds under
whatever way class, so I never was like,

1444
01:25:18,941 --> 01:25:19,774
I'm going down.

1445
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:23,290
My friend Anthony used to lose an insane
amount every year and he always talks

1446
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:26,140
about how he,
he would just eat everybody's Italian,

1447
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:29,320
his whole family beat and Pasta and he'd
be sitting there with a cup of shaved

1448
01:25:29,321 --> 01:25:32,230
ice and that's what he was
allowed to eat and they'll just,

1449
01:25:32,231 --> 01:25:37,231
cause he had to drop all this weight and
even nutrition and how to do that stuff

1450
01:25:37,361 --> 01:25:41,710
has changed over the last 10 20 years. So
even fuck, even when we were in school.

1451
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:44,080
Oh yeah,
the UFC guys have it down to a science.

1452
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:49,340
Then you go and still eat a lot and get
strong and add muscle and still lose

1453
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:51,880
weight. It's crazy. You'd like
to use American top team guys.

1454
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,790
I've never seen anything like it.
These guys, somehow or another,

1455
01:25:54,791 --> 01:25:58,930
I don't know what they do, they just
have it down to like an art form.

1456
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,620
They know how to get these guys there.

1457
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:04,980
They get them to cut like 20 pounds over
the course of a few days and you know,

1458
01:26:04,981 --> 01:26:08,060
and it's not that long. It's a, it's a
pretty short amount of time they do it in.

1459
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:11,340
And then the guys weigh in and then
they balloon him back up and they,

1460
01:26:11,341 --> 01:26:14,510
they gained like 15
pounds, 20 pounds. Yeah.

1461
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:16,430
We walked in once on Tiago Elvis,

1462
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:21,080
he was a in the gym at the palms and it
was a day he was fighting and they had

1463
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:24,290
him the day of the fight, they
hadn't gone through all these, uh,

1464
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:26,780
shadow boxing moves, like
go, go, go, go, go, go.

1465
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:29,720
It was burning like he's trying
to like put all this, you know,

1466
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,690
glycogen depletion out of his muscles.

1467
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:36,080
And then he would give him some sort
of a drink and the drink was like this

1468
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:39,860
carbohydrate drank that refueled all the
muscles so the muscles got back to full

1469
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:40,694
size.

1470
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:44,480
So that was the idea is that you make
them work and then when you make them work

1471
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:48,470
a little bit, it allows them to
take in more moisture, more water,

1472
01:26:48,471 --> 01:26:51,740
and they get thicker. More
sugar. Yeah. These guys,

1473
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,150
they haven't down to an art form.
And so they have these guys like yours,

1474
01:26:55,210 --> 01:27:00,170
you know, and t Bowers, he's the
biggest 155 pound fighter on the planet.

1475
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:02,120
He's one of those guys where
you looking at me and go,

1476
01:27:02,121 --> 01:27:06,260
how the fuck is that guy won 55 well,
he's not,

1477
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:10,880
he's only one 55 for like an hour or
I know he's won 55 he gets down to the

1478
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:11,320
weight,

1479
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:15,050
it weighs in and then they give them a
little pedialyte and then they give them

1480
01:27:15,051 --> 01:27:20,030
bags of Ivy. Like most guys use ivs now.
You know, that's the smart way to do it.

1481
01:27:20,031 --> 01:27:21,410
To get water back in your system.

1482
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,550
They need to have I ve places for people
who leave bars that are like really

1483
01:27:25,551 --> 01:27:29,150
boozed up. We can just plug
in and feel good. Yeah.

1484
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:32,900
But it's good man. It's that
simple. You're fucked. You know,

1485
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:34,640
it's kind of go through your whole system,
you know?

1486
01:27:34,641 --> 01:27:38,060
There's no shortcut to sobering up. I
don't think they can do that with an ivy.

1487
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,610
But yeah, if they could, that would
be the [inaudible] or the next day.

1488
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:42,110
How about that? When, when you know,

1489
01:27:42,111 --> 01:27:44,810
when you feel super super
that well you could do that.

1490
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:48,650
You could go the nearest banana bag or
something, popping in like a Jiffy Lube.

1491
01:27:48,651 --> 01:27:50,630
Sit there for 15 minutes.
Get plugged in.

1492
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:54,260
If you went to a place you know that
could rehydrate you with like a vitamin

1493
01:27:54,261 --> 01:27:58,160
drip in and ivy and you know the Sugar
Water Iva, you could totally do that.

1494
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:01,040
We should do it. You know why? Why not?

1495
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:06,220
Why not do that man plugin sit there
like a hangover stations in Vegas.

1496
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:10,080
Oh, that'd be perfect. No, but the problem
is people don't want to get needles. Man.

1497
01:28:10,081 --> 01:28:13,340
You'll go into stick some fucking
needle in my arm. Whoa. I'm fine man.

1498
01:28:13,341 --> 01:28:16,990
I'll just drink some water. Depends on
how screwed up he got the night before.

1499
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:21,050
But isn't that the, the main thing with
um, with hangovers, isn't it dehydration?

1500
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,120
Isn't that what's really fucking you
up? Yeah, it's, you're just, yeah,

1501
01:28:23,121 --> 01:28:27,830
your body's depleted from all that
stuff. So put it back in. Powerful.

1502
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:29,570
That's why at the end of the night,

1503
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:33,140
I usually switch to beer and water for
like the last couple of years and then

1504
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,760
after that,
that's really smart.

1505
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:38,780
You should pound pound water when you
get home to just force yourself to drink

1506
01:28:38,781 --> 01:28:42,210
way more than you want to just
pound it, pound it. Yeah. You know,

1507
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,440
speaking of Vegas,
picking up pounded at February for me,

1508
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:49,850
Joe Diaz and Ari Shaffir at
the Mandalay Bay theater.

1509
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:55,060
It's the day before the Superbowl
weekend UFC to be a sick UFC to Anderson

1510
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:59,030
Silva's fighting Vito Belfort.
And uh,

1511
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:01,980
that's going to be off the chain
and I'm sure there's a great

1512
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,430
supporting cast as well. I don't
know the full card yet, you know,

1513
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:07,980
it's kind of when they're in
February. I was thinking like, man,

1514
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:09,870
anything can happen between
now and February, you know,

1515
01:29:09,871 --> 01:29:13,220
in the MMA guys get
injured so often. US, Vma,

1516
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:17,700
I've heard your voice almost every night
this week for three hours. Oh yeah.

1517
01:29:17,701 --> 01:29:20,730
You've been getting into the
UFC lately. I just, you know,

1518
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:25,230
I just got a 2010 all the
game game flight it and it,

1519
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:29,060
it came get that. So then that
got on the new one though. Yeah,

1520
01:29:29,061 --> 01:29:30,150
I was supposed to work this week,

1521
01:29:30,151 --> 01:29:33,200
but I can't because my voice
and then I created John Heparin,

1522
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:37,120
a hundred and hundred 80 pounder. Look at
you. I thought you want to be one seven.

1523
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:38,850
It's easy to learn.
I heard it's really hard.

1524
01:29:38,851 --> 01:29:41,520
I heard that the controls
are pretty hard to master.

1525
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:45,180
I buttoned smashed for awhile now.
I've got one or two moves,

1526
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,190
but I swear playing the video game,

1527
01:29:47,191 --> 01:29:51,660
but I think it's all how you visualize
stuff that you actually learn.

1528
01:29:51,661 --> 01:29:55,710
You can learn some ground stuff
by doing it on the video game.

1529
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:59,730
100% really like actual moves.
Oh,

1530
01:29:59,731 --> 01:30:01,200
here's somebody put on the message board.

1531
01:30:01,201 --> 01:30:02,880
Somebody puts some
photos of Christian Bale.

1532
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:06,120
Look at those pictures will
be the one on the left.

1533
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:12,600
Dude. God Damn, he's crazy. I
did it again for this movie too.

1534
01:30:12,601 --> 01:30:15,690
He got super skinny for this
movie to hmm to play crack. Ed.

1535
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:19,200
Why don't you just get like a cool one
when you can eat a lot and just become a

1536
01:30:19,201 --> 01:30:23,190
fat slob? Well, that's fine. That
role. That's what a dinero used to do,

1537
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:27,360
or even a Matt Damon did it. Denny Denny
for his last one where it's like a,

1538
01:30:27,361 --> 01:30:31,410
he's a CIA agent, but maybe it's kind
of supposed to be funny. Not Serious.

1539
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:35,130
We gained really? Yeah, and you
just ate a lot of pasta and donuts.

1540
01:30:35,131 --> 01:30:38,980
A just got written the outage that is
that the movie about the dude who's like

1541
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:43,850
some swings in informant, the informant.
That was obviously a good mood. Yeah,

1542
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,470
I didn't see it. Yes, I didn't. Why
didn't I have to gain weight for that?

1543
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:50,670
I think he did though because these
guys wanted to be doe. Yeah. Yep.

1544
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:54,510
That's absolutely fine. Yeah.
Stallone did that once too.

1545
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:58,680
Remember that he did that for cop land.
He gained a gut and there was like, Whoa,

1546
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:01,310
so fast. Yeah, that was a good maybe,

1547
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:06,360
but I think that UFC going through some
of the ground stuff than in your brain,

1548
01:31:06,361 --> 01:31:09,610
you kind of learn. Okay.
I think that's how you, do

1549
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:13,650
you think you've actually
applied something that you
learned from the game to a

1550
01:31:13,651 --> 01:31:18,240
sparring session? Have you done that?
I think you would have, you know? No,

1551
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:22,620
but I think people do all the time.
What are fights like in school now,

1552
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:25,590
do you think? How many kids
you got to MMA? You know,

1553
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:29,010
I'm like fighting it so much more of a
part of our culture now that it was just

1554
01:31:29,011 --> 01:31:31,680
a couple of decades ago.
Even let's even go 10 years ago.

1555
01:31:31,681 --> 01:31:34,800
Do you think anybody in let's
say just a regular, you know,

1556
01:31:35,170 --> 01:31:39,510
nonlethal just fight with everything
about throwing your knee. Nobody would.

1557
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,640
Nobody was,
everybody was headhunter.

1558
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:47,330
But now I've seen youtube fights where
guys clinch and throw on that strictly

1559
01:31:47,641 --> 01:31:51,930
from watching UFC. Oh yeah. Directly
from just, just seeing it going,

1560
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:56,910
all of that exists. Let me bring
that into my repertoire. Yeah. Yeah.

1561
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:59,920
It seems like a move that
anybody can do to, you know,

1562
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,590
it doesn't, it's not like a
giant flying head kick, you know?

1563
01:32:02,591 --> 01:32:03,490
It seems pretty simple.

1564
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,760
I even grabbed the guy and you throw
your knee up and you hit him. You know,

1565
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:11,430
it's not like they're complicated. Yeah.
Or, and you were to get ahold of them,

1566
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:16,130
or even dirty are clenching or dirty
by holding that and stuff like that.

1567
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:19,000
A lot of that's going and watching
youtube fight with this guy.

1568
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:22,270
Have you seen the break one? When the
guy just says, put me out. It's this kid,

1569
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:26,020
he's got really baggy pants. He's just
telling this guy, let's go, let's go.

1570
01:32:26,170 --> 01:32:28,540
He says, put me out. He
go, yeah, put me down.

1571
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:33,040
He's like telling the guy to knock
them out, but his hands are, are at,

1572
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:37,600
is this the guy? Knock them out. It's
an awesome really to really skinny kids.

1573
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:41,860
And then there he almost like there's
a type equipment. Is it a fight? No.

1574
01:32:41,861 --> 01:32:46,570
They're on the street. One guy staying
or is it a fight? No, it's, it's a fight.

1575
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:51,760
Okay. In one guy's got like a phone,
which I have, but it, I took it off here.

1576
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:55,000
I have a video.
When I was in grand rapids,

1577
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:58,170
this guy was trying to fight.
He fought a couple guy.

1578
01:32:58,180 --> 01:32:59,910
This guy has like a sweater on,

1579
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:03,610
puts his hand in his pocket
and starts walking over to him,

1580
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:06,550
grabs him right,
spins around,

1581
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:09,190
throws in a rear naked
choke when he's on top.

1582
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:12,940
So this guy obviously knows some type of
fighting because he was way too cocky.

1583
01:33:12,941 --> 01:33:16,000
You don't put, you know, so he's
got a rear naked choke on the guy,

1584
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:21,100
jumps up in the air in and knocks
out the guy's legs so you know,

1585
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:24,610
wants to fall down with him. But
he's got his back, he's standing,

1586
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:29,650
the guy now who had the rear naked
choke and falls to the ground because he

1587
01:33:29,651 --> 01:33:30,580
pulls the guy on top of them,

1588
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:34,840
smashes his head onto the cement cause
you're in the middle of the street.

1589
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,480
Oh Shit.
Now loses a thing.

1590
01:33:37,481 --> 01:33:41,080
Pretty much is knocked unconscious and
that guy rolls on top of them and just

1591
01:33:41,081 --> 01:33:42,040
starts wailing them.

1592
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:46,620
And I had it on my phone up
until I was in the middle.

1593
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:50,260
Then a huge fight broke out and then I
decided to put my phone away. I'm like,

1594
01:33:50,261 --> 01:33:53,270
why would that guy think to pull guard?
You know what I mean?

1595
01:33:53,271 --> 01:33:56,200
Cause that's also from watching
kind of UFC where you go,

1596
01:33:56,201 --> 01:33:59,350
you know that I would have just stayed
standing and wouldn't choke the guy out

1597
01:33:59,351 --> 01:34:03,420
from standing. He's just fucked
up. Yeah. Yeah. It was like,

1598
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:06,630
it was the craziest thing I've ever
seen. I'm like wow, that guy just,

1599
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:08,020
he did a duck under,
you know,

1600
01:34:08,021 --> 01:34:12,880
so he goes to grab ducks under then
throws in the choke and the guy then jumps

1601
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:16,300
up and pulls the guy right on top of,
there's so many street fights.

1602
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:19,350
No on fuck fucking cell phone cameras.
I love watching them.

1603
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:23,050
I just like watching them to see
what, what guys do in, in, in there.

1604
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:27,940
But the other one I saw this guy throws
a knee and then the guy black block the

1605
01:34:27,941 --> 01:34:32,440
knee, you know, put, Kinda
did that little handout thing,

1606
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:35,950
but you know, they didn't notify
you. Jump from the iTunes listener.

1607
01:34:35,951 --> 01:34:40,210
John was just moving his hands left and
right. What, cause he was like saying, uh,

1608
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:45,360
uh, he was taking his knee over here
for the iTunes. There's been, I'm,

1609
01:34:45,361 --> 01:34:48,520
I'm trying as I have enrolled
or done anything in forever,

1610
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:53,200
but there was this guy on youtube
that showed a, um, a thing,

1611
01:34:53,201 --> 01:34:58,070
so he's on his back, reaches
up, grabs the guys a head

1612
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:01,790
and arm, you know, and pulls him close
and then sweeps him. Right? I'm like, oh,

1613
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:05,600
that seems like a pretty cool
sweep to know with basic,

1614
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:08,270
I don't know how practical it is
when you basically just reach up,

1615
01:35:08,271 --> 01:35:12,920
grab the guy's head, pull them in and
then plan a foot and then saw good.

1616
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:14,600
As long as he doesn't
know what he's doing.

1617
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:17,710
But I bet you spend running that
in my head over and over again.

1618
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,090
This is what you get in.
Then I need to do at this class,

1619
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:24,290
go to a Goddamn Jujitsu class. This is
what Kung people, Kung Fu people do.

1620
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:26,510
They sit down and they go,
well, it's like grabbed,

1621
01:35:26,511 --> 01:35:28,790
you'd like this and then
I got your arm right.

1622
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:30,410
He ain't not throw you on the ground.

1623
01:35:30,530 --> 01:35:32,450
And then they'll like practice
doing that over and over again.

1624
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:33,980
Well that that's not how you do it.

1625
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:36,560
The way you do it is you've got
to try it on somebody. I remember,

1626
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:37,910
if you don't try it on somebody,

1627
01:35:37,911 --> 01:35:41,180
you've got some nonsense move that you
don't really know what's going to happen

1628
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:44,180
if it got defense. Cause you have to
learn whatever. The guy grabs me here, oh,

1629
01:35:44,181 --> 01:35:45,500
if he grabs me here, I'm fucked. Okay.

1630
01:35:45,550 --> 01:35:48,260
So I have to stop them from grabbing me
here and then I have to make sure that

1631
01:35:48,261 --> 01:35:50,870
this leg gives and get past this lie.
Cause if it does, then I'm fucked again.

1632
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:54,500
I remember when we did that a tour
together a couple of years ago,

1633
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:58,580
the Tate was with us in some guy and
some guy was saying, yeah, I just,

1634
01:35:58,581 --> 01:36:02,570
you just do this and you break the guy's
leg and Tate just goes off and goes,

1635
01:36:02,571 --> 01:36:05,000
really? How do you know? Do
you have a room full of us,

1636
01:36:05,001 --> 01:36:07,400
small Chinese boys that you
break their legs and practice?

1637
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:10,550
You've never broken a leg that way.
Have you ever seen anybody who's Bro,

1638
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:14,870
it was funny. How do you know? How do
you know that, that you don't know. So,

1639
01:36:14,871 --> 01:36:19,170
so don't say it's going to bring some
really good impression that taste really

1640
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:21,380
good. That's like the best impression
that Taylor I've ever heard.

1641
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:25,790
It's totally true. Tate and I were, uh,
I think I've told this story before,

1642
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:26,624
but I'll tell it anyway.

1643
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:31,520
Tate and I were in a hotel in
Vegas and some big Douche bag.

1644
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:35,390
Let's go. It was really a taint. It's
huge. Right? Tate is like six foot three.

1645
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,210
He walks around like two 35 and
he's got a shaved head. He's coming.

1646
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:42,050
He just looked. Yeah. You just see, look
at him and he'd go, no, probably not.

1647
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:44,720
The guy in the room. I'm like,
yeah, it looks like a killer. Right?

1648
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,340
And he's a nice guy,
but you know,

1649
01:36:46,341 --> 01:36:49,520
but people will fuck with him even
though he's this big, it's so ridiculous.

1650
01:36:49,521 --> 01:36:51,560
It's fucking kid who's like a frat boy.

1651
01:36:51,561 --> 01:36:55,160
He looked like he was about six foot six
and handsome fella drunk off his ass.

1652
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:59,040
But he was being a really, really
aggressive and uh, you know, he's telling,

1653
01:36:59,041 --> 01:37:01,280
stated that wasn't his room tape
was like looking for his keys.

1654
01:37:01,281 --> 01:37:04,340
Like that's my room bro, while you
go to my room. And Tate was like,

1655
01:37:04,341 --> 01:37:07,100
looking at this guy, I was like,
no, I'm pretty sure it's my room.

1656
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,330
And he sticks the key and they're like,

1657
01:37:08,331 --> 01:37:11,840
Tay was being really friendly about
it and the key works. He goes up,

1658
01:37:11,841 --> 01:37:15,650
seats my room. So he goes in,
take it easy and shuts the door.

1659
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:19,280
And once he gets inside my
room was right next to him.

1660
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:24,890
I hear Bang, Bang, Bang. I hear
pounding on his door, right? So,

1661
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:25,620
uh,
we,

1662
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:29,630
we go out into the hallway and the guy
is pounding on his door and the guys like

1663
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:32,450
fucking pussy fucking
shut that door in my face.

1664
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:37,130
I told you that's my fucking room. It
was like craziness. It was like, oh no,

1665
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:40,770
what is going to happen here? And
tape was like, oh yeah, yeah. Big Guy.

1666
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:44,390
Is that what's going on? This is your
fucking room, Huh? And the guy's like,

1667
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:46,370
what do you fuck up?
Kick your fucking ass bitch.

1668
01:37:46,371 --> 01:37:49,750
She was saying all this crazy shit.
So Tate says, come on man, come on,

1669
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:52,190
take a swing at me.
And the guy like doesn't know what to do,

1670
01:37:52,191 --> 01:37:54,470
doesn't know where to go.
And so he moved.

1671
01:37:54,471 --> 01:37:56,880
There was a lot of John back in
play before all this happens,

1672
01:37:56,881 --> 01:38:00,480
but I'm going to cut to the chase.
The chase was the guy steps forward.

1673
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:04,260
Tate leg kicks him and then
pulls guard on the dude.

1674
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:09,060
So he's got this guy on top of them in
in the lobby and he's got them in what's

1675
01:38:09,061 --> 01:38:11,880
called an Omoplata, which just got
him in the shoulder lock position.

1676
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,110
And right when he gets him down,

1677
01:38:13,111 --> 01:38:16,530
he's got them in its own path to the
security guy. Show up, stop. Hey, stop,

1678
01:38:16,531 --> 01:38:21,300
stop the fight. Are you the guy
from fear factor? I go, yeah, yeah,

1679
01:38:21,301 --> 01:38:23,670
don't worry about this. This
guy's not going to get hurt. I go,

1680
01:38:23,671 --> 01:38:26,260
he's going to be fine.
He's just going to get choked unconscious.

1681
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,070
This guy's an asshole. So then
Tate hears that. He goes, well,

1682
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:32,460
I guess I'm choking on my conscious.
So Tate sinks or rear naked,

1683
01:38:32,461 --> 01:38:35,460
choke on them and puts them
totally asleep, doesn't hit him,

1684
01:38:35,461 --> 01:38:37,890
doesn't hurt him that God
doesn't have a scratch on him.

1685
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:41,250
The guy's face down in the carpet,
unconscious snoring,

1686
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:45,870
his friends come grab him,
apologize, pick the guy up,

1687
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:47,310
put the guy in an elevator,

1688
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:50,400
the elevator door closes and he
goes out of our life forever.

1689
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:53,200
He just had odd by the
way, thank God. Yeah,

1690
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,950
well he was just so embarrassed and he
probably didn't even know what the fuck

1691
01:38:55,951 --> 01:38:58,910
happened. The guy was so drunk
and so stupid. This is my room.

1692
01:38:58,930 --> 01:39:01,370
They never did anything to him.
Tate. They did not hurt him.

1693
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:04,420
He did not hurt him at all.
He just incapacitated him,

1694
01:39:04,421 --> 01:39:08,220
taught Tom a quick lesson and his friends
were so happy because his friends were

1695
01:39:08,221 --> 01:39:11,910
like regular size dudes discloses giant
guy and this guy was a giant Douche,

1696
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:15,560
you know, the whole day. And he
probably had to deal with that. Nice.

1697
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,990
Just everybody where ever he goes,
what the fuck you looking at bitch?

1698
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:22,290
They just one of those guys and
so he fucked with the wrong dude.

1699
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,480
I mean it's like Karma
just led him to take

1700
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:29,490
call university.
You know what?

1701
01:39:29,491 --> 01:39:32,220
We need to make a little
shift on how you view life.

1702
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:35,820
You need to see drop
you off at floor five.

1703
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:37,350
You've been treating people like shit,

1704
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:41,580
looking to throw something in your life
that's going to push you in a different

1705
01:39:41,581 --> 01:39:44,850
direction. Yeah. I became
a yoga teacher after that.

1706
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:50,130
I really tried to find a center. You back
with the goggles? I liked the goggles.

1707
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:54,240
It's a cool look. You know what I like
about goggles when you're, you know,

1708
01:39:54,241 --> 01:39:57,990
I always wondered like
I watched Al Pachino get
interviewed the other day and he

1709
01:39:57,991 --> 01:40:00,510
got interviewed and he kept his
sunglasses on the whole interview.

1710
01:40:00,511 --> 01:40:03,960
He was talking to Larry King. I'm like,
what kind of nonsense is that? Is it,

1711
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:06,180
is it hot in the room or is
it Brighton Room or something?

1712
01:40:06,181 --> 01:40:08,940
Like why do you have sunglasses on?
And he was talking about, I was so shy.

1713
01:40:08,941 --> 01:40:11,490
He wears sunglasses because he can't
even look people in the eyes. Like,

1714
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:13,800
is that it or do they like,

1715
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:18,180
it's really easy to pretend that you're
living in a movie and that life is like

1716
01:40:18,181 --> 01:40:22,230
some crazy fucking thing that
you've created when you're
looking through goggles,

1717
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,940
you know? Yeah. I like wearing
sunglasses all the time. Yeah.

1718
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:30,880
I just didn't ever want him. I just, I
like my eyes be as relaxed as possible.

1719
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:35,600
Nighttime indoors, nighttime indoors
so much. But Hey, a bonded by colors.

1720
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:37,650
You wear them indoors.
Uh,

1721
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,860
like if I'm at a restaurant and it's
during the day and it's like bright in the

1722
01:40:40,861 --> 01:40:42,880
restaurant, I'll wear it once
in awhile. I'll wear my son.

1723
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:45,410
But if you're having a conversation with
somebody, you take them off. Right, right.

1724
01:40:45,411 --> 01:40:49,020
If they're wearing glasses too.
So you just go with it. Yeah,

1725
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:51,210
I remember like I don't like,
I don't like squinting,

1726
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,980
I hate squinting cause I squint on the

1727
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:58,210
computer all the time. So I
like my, I like to massage
my eyes when I, when I can.

1728
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:01,900
So it's not a matter of looking
cool. No, no, not at all. No.

1729
01:41:01,901 --> 01:41:03,490
It's relaxation of the eyes.
She,

1730
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:07,690
she doesn't want your eyes
to have some shade on Him,
right? Hmm. Yeah. Interesting.

1731
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:11,240
Yeah. Like I really like if
I'm at the olive garden, I
don't want to seed the, the,

1732
01:41:11,241 --> 01:41:14,730
the decor. I don't give a shit about
the paintings and stuff like that.

1733
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:16,640
The power of Yardi.
Emily,

1734
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:24,010
do you eat at Olive Garden family? Huh?
Do you eat at the, Oliver got eight there.

1735
01:41:24,011 --> 01:41:27,100
You got eat there bro. What's close and
you're hungry. It's not a bad choice.

1736
01:41:27,101 --> 01:41:29,890
Right? It's fast. The breadsticks
still good. I've been, it's great.

1737
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,810
The only problem with the olive garden
is that lately there salads are half the

1738
01:41:34,811 --> 01:41:38,740
size it used to be. So
they'll still refill them all
you want, but they're like,

1739
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:41,770
they take longer to get now
and they're half the size,

1740
01:41:41,771 --> 01:41:43,720
so they're trying to fill
you up so you get, you know,

1741
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:46,060
full faster so you won't get them salads.

1742
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:49,030
They're trying to get you full
bug giving you less salad. Yeah,

1743
01:41:49,031 --> 01:41:49,661
because they're there,

1744
01:41:49,661 --> 01:41:53,800
they're giving you half as much and so
you eat it and then you have to flag down

1745
01:41:53,801 --> 01:41:58,240
the, the weight, the weight or to get you
another one. That's a half one, you know.

1746
01:41:58,241 --> 01:42:03,070
So that's one full regular old school
salad that took twice as long to to go

1747
01:42:03,071 --> 01:42:03,670
through.

1748
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:06,220
And the whole time you're sitting there
getting full use out of your sign of the

1749
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:09,060
economy. Brian, they may
believe salad I believe soon.

1750
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:10,960
So something that's troubling you.

1751
01:42:10,961 --> 01:42:14,450
So because it doesn't all
of garden fanatic, uh,

1752
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:18,700
you could tell like nowadays all
olive garden fanatic. Fuck yeah,

1753
01:42:18,701 --> 01:42:21,880
I love the olive garden or you
like one of those Fandango dudes.

1754
01:42:21,881 --> 01:42:23,320
It's got like a little,
I'm actually,

1755
01:42:23,321 --> 01:42:26,500
I just don't care that much about the
f the off guard, but I go there a lot.

1756
01:42:26,501 --> 01:42:29,950
But you'll notice if you go to the
salad. Yeah, I do. I'm a Yelp elite.

1757
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,590
But if you go to the salad,
uh, if you go to this,

1758
01:42:32,591 --> 01:42:35,770
if you look at the Saudis a lot smarter
now, how do you become a Yelp, Yelp elite?

1759
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,980
You get chosen. What does Yelp, yeah.

1760
01:42:38,981 --> 01:42:42,790
And hopefully I just had to put in my
application to become the 2011 Yelp elite.

1761
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,900
But hopefully they pass me. So if you're
listening yelpers, what does that mean,

1762
01:42:46,901 --> 01:42:49,990
Bro? What are you doing? Going to
a stadium and it's 12 guys, look,

1763
01:42:49,991 --> 01:42:53,790
I get this other badge that most people
don't have on Yelp. So just check it out.

1764
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,370
Go to my profile and tell me what's
going on with Yelp. What do you yeah,

1765
01:42:56,371 --> 01:42:59,710
I don't even running around
reviewing things all day. No, no.

1766
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,570
Once in awhile or review something.
Usually.

1767
01:43:01,571 --> 01:43:04,180
How many reviews do you have on
your account? Not, not that many.

1768
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:06,760
I don't do it that much
anymore because I'm so busy,

1769
01:43:06,761 --> 01:43:10,360
but it's not their money here.
I'll tell you, hold on honey.

1770
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:13,810
Yet big enough to get a Yelp elite. Yeah.
What does that mean, Bro? I think you're,

1771
01:43:13,811 --> 01:43:17,650
you're being very a sketchy
with my Yelp status.

1772
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:22,650
A Yelp elite pretty much
only means that, uh, that,

1773
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:25,360
that your reviews get pushed
up higher than the other guys.

1774
01:43:25,361 --> 01:43:29,020
I think B and modest burn and that a,
you get invited to Yelp parties,

1775
01:43:29,021 --> 01:43:33,490
which is a a great time.
Yelp parties have 95 reviews.

1776
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:35,320
Wow.
That's a lot of reviews kid.

1777
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:39,730
But I've been doing it since
2006 or 2007 or something. Damn.

1778
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:44,380
You just go into whatever restaurant
store, just whatever it is and go. Yeah.

1779
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:46,720
And the customer service,
we're okay. Yeah, exactly.

1780
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:48,760
I do it for restaurant
member of the media.

1781
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:52,100
Have you heard like
bloggers calling the media?

1782
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:55,460
That's what it gets. Hilarious.
Right. You know, that was a member of,

1783
01:43:55,461 --> 01:43:59,060
as a member of the media,
like Whoa, what? Right.

1784
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:03,080
But I guess they are right. I mean,
what the fuck is the difference?

1785
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:07,220
I mean at a certain point in time we
have to make some sort of a distinction

1786
01:44:07,221 --> 01:44:11,300
because every douche bag that has a
website can't be in the team. You know,

1787
01:44:11,570 --> 01:44:13,430
there's some people that are
absolutely terrible at it.

1788
01:44:13,431 --> 01:44:17,670
Like you have to like if you were, uh,
uh, you know, a member of the media,

1789
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:20,600
a writer for say, The New York
Times, you know, they had standards.

1790
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:22,280
By the time he got to the New York Times,

1791
01:44:22,281 --> 01:44:25,220
you were a certain caliber of journalist,
you know,

1792
01:44:25,221 --> 01:44:28,910
but any asshole can just start a fucking
blog and basically now it's all the

1793
01:44:28,911 --> 01:44:32,630
same thing. You have just as much of a
possibility of getting your shit scene.

1794
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:34,550
Yes,
some really high traffic thing.

1795
01:44:34,551 --> 01:44:37,790
If you write something good
and it's controversial or

1796
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:42,250
totally interesting, one celebrity
tweets it, fuck, you know,

1797
01:44:42,251 --> 01:44:43,220
and then everyone goes

1798
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,721
the there,

1799
01:44:43,721 --> 01:44:46,840
the media then then all of a sudden
they're showing up at places with cameras

1800
01:44:46,841 --> 01:44:51,620
and it's All v Webs fueled. You know,
it's how we live in a strange time, ma'am.

1801
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:52,191
Look,
Joe,

1802
01:44:52,191 --> 01:44:56,530
I reviewed the hotel the day after the
fire at the hotel in San Francisco. Yeah,

1803
01:44:56,870 --> 01:45:01,640
the fire at the cliff and then one night,
that's a terrible hotel.

1804
01:45:01,641 --> 01:45:04,460
Stay at folks if you,
I mean if it's a nice hotel,

1805
01:45:04,461 --> 01:45:07,460
but if you're going to stay
there and a fire breaks out,

1806
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:12,520
the fucking hotel has these staircases
that are these tiny single file

1807
01:45:12,531 --> 01:45:14,690
staircases.
They were jammed up with people.

1808
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:19,310
You know what I heard when I was in
San Francisco, however many times ago,

1809
01:45:19,311 --> 01:45:22,070
I had dinner with, um,
Tim Ferriss, you know,

1810
01:45:22,071 --> 01:45:26,510
guy wrote four hour work week and
he just a four hour body and he was,

1811
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:30,950
his buddy wrote this book called Emergency
Neil Strauss I think wrote emergency

1812
01:45:30,951 --> 01:45:33,620
just about how to live
like Bourne identity guy,

1813
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:37,370
how to have a couple passports because
the problem is if stuff goes down and you

1814
01:45:37,371 --> 01:45:41,030
can't get out of your country,
that's all you know. So anyway,

1815
01:45:41,031 --> 01:45:43,050
he tells you to have extra passport.

1816
01:45:43,090 --> 01:45:45,860
This guy emergency says that's
a good way to get arrested, man.

1817
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:50,220
Catch you with extra passports. How do
it, well, there's other countries, uh,

1818
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:55,070
that will give you dual citizenship
real if you invest legal.

1819
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:59,210
Yeah, yeah. Show you. But
you have to invest in their
infrastructure. So how much,

1820
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:00,051
uh,

1821
01:46:00,051 --> 01:46:03,640
I think in the book the Guy was talking
to guy for like $100,000 or something.

1822
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:07,670
Fuck Outta here.
[inaudible] up with $100,000.

1823
01:46:07,671 --> 01:46:09,990
Give us some whack ass little
fucking third world country.

1824
01:46:10,270 --> 01:46:13,610
You get to view a female.
Yeah. What are you doing, Bro?

1825
01:46:13,611 --> 01:46:18,611
You give an icon in Nigeria so then
you get fuck out of here Graham.

1826
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:26,160
But he said the guy.
Nah, I could he, yeah.

1827
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:30,950
He asked what hot many fire trucks you
think is there to protect the entire city

1828
01:46:30,951 --> 01:46:34,550
of San Francisco. And I was, I always
said, I don't know, probably hundreds.

1829
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:38,570
It was I believe less than 20 total.
Whoa.

1830
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:43,670
Now say these words, but I
could be wrong, but it's,

1831
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:46,100
it's something like that where
you would think there's no,

1832
01:46:46,101 --> 01:46:50,040
there's hundreds for the entire city
of, no, there's literally big rigs

1833
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,170
that can shoot water like 20 of them.

1834
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:56,700
So if anything really happened in his
city like that, the thing is it's,

1835
01:46:56,750 --> 01:47:00,150
it's going to go well. We were the whole
show. The whole book is how to survive.

1836
01:47:00,151 --> 01:47:00,780
Like born,

1837
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:03,990
we were at the hotel and the fire broke
out supposedly four 30 in the morning,

1838
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:05,040
but it wasn't really a fire.

1839
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:07,470
It was just some assholes that
blew off fire extinguishers.

1840
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,210
But it looked like a fire
that it looked like a fire.

1841
01:47:09,211 --> 01:47:11,830
There was smoke because of
the extinguishers are like,

1842
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:15,930
it looks like smoke and it's flooded,
you know, through the hallways.

1843
01:47:15,931 --> 01:47:19,500
And we were going down this little
single file staircase at four 30 in the

1844
01:47:19,501 --> 01:47:22,920
morning where people just shuffled
on the staircase. It was maddening.

1845
01:47:22,921 --> 01:47:26,910
Everyone was going so fucking slow.
It was really scary, man. It was.

1846
01:47:27,310 --> 01:47:31,410
I thought so hit their head and the
stairs going down and at one point like me

1847
01:47:31,411 --> 01:47:34,890
and Joe both felt like we're just going
to start beating up the people in front

1848
01:47:34,891 --> 01:47:38,640
of us. No more, no more hotels
that are from the 1700 now.

1849
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:42,120
They didn't kiss my ass first floor,
second floor. Now I'm like first floor,

1850
01:47:42,121 --> 01:47:45,750
second floor. That's all I want. Well
it's just those old ass hotels man.

1851
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:49,140
Like that's, that's your staircase,
right? I mean it was so small.

1852
01:47:49,141 --> 01:47:52,020
I literally had a hard time
getting through it. Me,

1853
01:47:52,110 --> 01:47:54,180
I have one person had a hard
time getting through it.

1854
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:59,360
So I got skinny ass staircase and there
was fat people and old people and tired

1855
01:47:59,371 --> 01:48:03,990
people and people in poor health and they
were all just clogging up the stairs.

1856
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:06,720
You know, you really, when you
see a person during the day,

1857
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,940
you see a person that's all warmed up.

1858
01:48:08,970 --> 01:48:13,230
You know they've had coffee and they're
moving, you know what I'm saying?

1859
01:48:13,231 --> 01:48:17,430
They got up a couple of hours ago and
had breakfast and they're, you know,

1860
01:48:17,431 --> 01:48:18,940
walked out to the brisk,
you know,

1861
01:48:19,090 --> 01:48:22,230
cold air before they got into
the building where you meet them.

1862
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:23,700
But when you see them,
boom,

1863
01:48:23,701 --> 01:48:27,570
right after they wake up and they're
all disoriented and their slowness might

1864
01:48:27,571 --> 01:48:30,540
get you burned to death. Yeah,
it's a fucking trip, man.

1865
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:32,820
You always wonder about that when you're
on a plane or you have to sit in the

1866
01:48:32,821 --> 01:48:34,280
exit row and you're like, okay, I'll,

1867
01:48:34,281 --> 01:48:38,610
I'll open this if I have to wear these
hundred and 50 people active allies of

1868
01:48:38,611 --> 01:48:41,340
stuff. And then I always think,
no. I'm like, there's no way.

1869
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:44,820
But then you hear about stuff like the
plane and landed in the Hudson where

1870
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:48,910
everyone just orderly. You know, the
got 150 people out. I'm like, I dunno.

1871
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:51,690
That's just such a,
that was a safety landing.

1872
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:54,510
That landing was almost like they
landed on the ground. It was just,

1873
01:48:54,511 --> 01:48:58,440
they were on the water, you know,
it almost seemed like it made sense,

1874
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:03,320
but I hear you. Yeah. Like you never
know what people just, you know,

1875
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:08,550
climb over the week in the slow just
to save or is it already, I don't know.

1876
01:49:08,551 --> 01:49:12,480
I've never depends on the situation and
how dire the circumstances are and it

1877
01:49:12,481 --> 01:49:15,440
depends on, I mean, look at black
Friday or whatever it's called,

1878
01:49:15,441 --> 01:49:18,840
and you see people trampling over
each other to get into a store. Right.

1879
01:49:19,110 --> 01:49:22,260
So they're on a southwest flight. Chances
are you going to get trampled, right?

1880
01:49:22,270 --> 01:49:26,600
Yeah. So then you're good to go. Yeah.

1881
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:29,100
If you're on virgin,
you're probably going to be okay.

1882
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:32,520
Everyone's going to be cool with you.
Yeah. Have you flown many virgins? No,

1883
01:49:32,521 --> 01:49:36,420
I heard it's awesome though. Yeah. The
view. No, I haven't fun any of them.

1884
01:49:36,421 --> 01:49:40,170
John half on. You're a
world traveler, Huh? You're
constantly not around the world,

1885
01:49:40,171 --> 01:49:43,560
but I mean around the country
you're covering stand up. Yeah.

1886
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:48,070
It's a lot of fucking lasts. I don't like
planes anymore, man. Last year, yeah,

1887
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:50,080
last year was 40 something
weeks or something.

1888
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:55,650
And then I have this week off and then
June 1st is my first week and the you in

1889
01:49:56,090 --> 01:50:00,790
and off starting next week. And I leave
God, you just out every weekend. Yeah.

1890
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:05,470
How do you do that? It's a used
to be easier, but now I uh,

1891
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:10,680
to be honest then now I occupy my time
with so much other little projects during

1892
01:50:11,141 --> 01:50:15,370
the day that that's what gives me, you
know, like dancing. I dance, I do my,

1893
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:19,920
my ribbon thing. I'm in my a knife
fighting and Cain fighting class stars.

1894
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:23,050
Do you take classes and shit when you go
on the road? Like if you go on the road,

1895
01:50:23,051 --> 01:50:26,740
are you a Wednesday through Sunday guy?
Like how do you do the road Wednesday?

1896
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:30,370
Yeah, Wednesday through Sunday.
So you can't say travel day.

1897
01:50:30,430 --> 01:50:32,170
You're just home Monday,
Tuesday and then Bam,

1898
01:50:32,171 --> 01:50:35,080
you're out on the road on Wednesday?
Yeah. Sometimes a Thursday, you know,

1899
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:37,330
leave on Thursday.
Is your wife meet you places?

1900
01:50:37,331 --> 01:50:40,240
Do you like try to set it up where you
see each other more than two days a week?

1901
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:44,870
No. Whoa. I mean we used to, um, but
now she's got a job. So No, you know,

1902
01:50:44,871 --> 01:50:49,270
when we see each other like asking
classes, like when I was in Atlanta,

1903
01:50:49,870 --> 01:50:52,540
um,
there's a boxing gym by my hotel,

1904
01:50:52,541 --> 01:50:55,780
so I would go in there and then work
with that guy for a couple of days.

1905
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:59,110
Just do you ever go to the boxing gym
and they try to set you up and once I'm

1906
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:02,710
doing to spar with you, uh, I won't
do Mount Holyoke asked you though.

1907
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:06,340
I had before and I've gotten beat up,
you know, then you're on stage going,

1908
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:09,940
somebody beat you up, not beat
up. But you know, other guys,

1909
01:51:09,941 --> 01:51:14,941
60% might be different than my 60% and
it's a funnier story if some guy knows

1910
01:51:15,941 --> 01:51:19,450
who I am and knocked
me out then going 60%.

1911
01:51:19,450 --> 01:51:23,380
That's a boring story. Right. So, yeah,

1912
01:51:23,381 --> 01:51:26,710
it's hard to trust people. I don't, when
you're spoiling me, unless you find,

1913
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:31,030
you know, do you have a problem with tr
Accra Krav Maga Class A couple times?

1914
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:35,230
You know when you're sparring. And
I'm really, I pride myself in going,

1915
01:51:35,410 --> 01:51:38,140
if we're going to go 50, we're
going to go 50. I don't have an ego.

1916
01:51:38,141 --> 01:51:42,040
I don't need to go 65 and prove anything
to you were both here to learn and blah

1917
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:45,250
blah blah, blah. But there is a couple
of times where I haven't been, I just,

1918
01:51:45,251 --> 01:51:50,251
I still get even mad thinking about
kicking 40 50% a five year old could

1919
01:51:50,561 --> 01:51:51,341
probably catch that.

1920
01:51:51,341 --> 01:51:55,660
Kik when you literally are just going
more of the Mo motion to maybe step in.

1921
01:51:55,870 --> 01:52:00,310
The guy catches my foot and
then straight just, you know,

1922
01:52:00,910 --> 01:52:04,740
just how hard you punched you in the first
enough.

1923
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:08,830
Why all stars and fell to the ground.
Do you think you hit your hundred percent?

1924
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:15,100
Uh, he pretty hard. Not, not
a hundred, but it was, no,

1925
01:52:15,101 --> 01:52:18,070
it's tricky, right? There was no
martial arts classes. A tricky,

1926
01:52:18,071 --> 01:52:19,630
you've got to make sure that the
people that you're training with,

1927
01:52:19,710 --> 01:52:21,940
you trust them. You know,
that's where, when you,

1928
01:52:21,941 --> 01:52:25,420
when you're striking things get weird
when you, you know, kicking him punching.

1929
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:28,180
Yeah. Cause you know you really
can't do it full blast everyday.

1930
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:31,330
So you've got to assume that the guy is
going to be willing to work with you and

1931
01:52:31,331 --> 01:52:34,270
you know, we're just going to kind of
tag each other. So we work on our timing.

1932
01:52:34,620 --> 01:52:37,480
Yeah. That's why I like doing like
just I go to a place like that,

1933
01:52:37,481 --> 01:52:41,230
I'll do a lot of just bag work or Mitt
work and bounce around where there's

1934
01:52:41,231 --> 01:52:45,910
really, except for the midst maybe
slapping yet, like that's equally as well.

1935
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:48,800
I just want to do it to give me
something to do and get my heart rate up.

1936
01:52:48,801 --> 01:52:52,100
So I don't want you to take the guys
on the road with you. Uh, used to.

1937
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:57,130
And then the last couple of months I
haven't cause evolved con Kinda cutting,

1938
01:52:57,230 --> 01:52:59,570
not famous, but then they kind
of move on and they're like,

1939
01:52:59,571 --> 01:53:03,980
I don't feel like witchy to me is,
you know, you gotta get slackers,

1940
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:07,780
get people who just don't want
to get famous and yeah. Yeah.

1941
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:11,240
Then I've got to go on the road on
the roads too hard yet. It's funny,

1942
01:53:11,241 --> 01:53:15,080
his kids I used to, now I think starting
next year I'm going to find some guys,

1943
01:53:15,081 --> 01:53:18,170
but I'm going to have some rules.
You know he, I know that sounds dumb,

1944
01:53:18,171 --> 01:53:23,171
but I did a show where it was me and
brewer is both of us pretty amazing show

1945
01:53:23,751 --> 01:53:28,250
cause I'm high, low level and he's
even even higher level. But I did,

1946
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:31,730
I didn't do more in 20 minutes in
front of them in and then he would,

1947
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:35,140
but during that 20 minutes I'm like wow,
that feature spot you will,

1948
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:39,110
you don't have time for anything. There's
no time to talk to people in the crowd.

1949
01:53:39,111 --> 01:53:40,520
20 minutes. It's very quick. Yes.

1950
01:53:40,521 --> 01:53:44,270
So then now when I see guys opening for
me having conversations with the crowds,

1951
01:53:44,271 --> 01:53:44,780
I'm like,

1952
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:49,780
how do you have the time stop that do
20 minutes of nonstop material and then

1953
01:53:50,271 --> 01:53:53,400
get off the stage. Don't have a, I
don't know how. So now I got, yeah,

1954
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,610
but sometimes when you're opening though,

1955
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:59,420
sometimes like talking to the crowd
just a little bit here and there,

1956
01:53:59,421 --> 01:54:02,390
it kind of like brings everybody to,
I'm talking, no, I'm talking feature.

1957
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:04,760
I'm not talking to MC.
So just the feature,

1958
01:54:05,110 --> 01:54:09,970
that spot you should just go up
and rip. Just be yeah. You know,

1959
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:11,460
I think,
but then I was fine.

1960
01:54:11,461 --> 01:54:14,040
Guys that sit on the stool
and these start day there,

1961
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:17,940
everybody's got their own thing
though man. Like, but for me, uh,

1962
01:54:17,941 --> 01:54:21,220
you know in front of me, those
guys. So I gotta I gotta fine. Yeah,

1963
01:54:21,221 --> 01:54:23,410
I've got to find,
got to find the right God.

1964
01:54:23,411 --> 01:54:25,070
That's funny that you
monitor what they do.

1965
01:54:25,550 --> 01:54:27,380
Why don't monitor and say anything but it,

1966
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:28,910
but it bothers you when
they sit on the stool.

1967
01:54:28,970 --> 01:54:32,930
But that's 40 some weeks a year and
that's where that kicks in where then now

1968
01:54:32,931 --> 01:54:35,890
you just find little things, a bitch
book. It's funny where you go to a Condo,

1969
01:54:35,891 --> 01:54:39,950
the same guy, you go with the
same guy 40 weeks in a row. Um,

1970
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:43,700
I used to settle, drive you crazy. Yeah,
I think that's what I got to do is fine.

1971
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:46,640
You start telling them what to do with
his act. Like don't sit on a stool.

1972
01:54:46,641 --> 01:54:49,790
Don't ever say anything. No, I don't see
any bigger roles. You say you got rules?

1973
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:51,800
Well now if I have a
new guy opening for me,

1974
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:56,660
I would kind of find a guy and you go,
okay, I let his yet. I like his style.

1975
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:59,150
So you treat it as if he's an employee.

1976
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:03,110
The only thing I don't like
dude's doing is what's the tricky.

1977
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:05,130
It gets tricky if you,

1978
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:08,150
you bring a guy with you
and then he starts talking
about the shit that you talk

1979
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:10,820
about before you talk about it.
Then you're like, hey man, you know,

1980
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:11,870
I already talk about that.
Like,

1981
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:14,300
why are you talking about that when you
bring me up? And I thought, that's weird,

1982
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:18,110
you know? Yeah. You know, it's funny,
as you're walking to work with guys,

1983
01:55:18,111 --> 01:55:20,900
let's say that are just
there and as the week goes,

1984
01:55:20,901 --> 01:55:24,060
I notice this and they'll start
doing more and more. Yeah, similar,

1985
01:55:24,061 --> 01:55:27,890
lightly touching, not even doing it, but
just dusting in enough where you're like,

1986
01:55:27,891 --> 01:55:31,370
really? You haven't watched what I've
done who do that on purpose? You know?

1987
01:55:31,371 --> 01:55:34,250
They do that on purpose. They're stepping
on your materials, what they're doing,

1988
01:55:34,490 --> 01:55:37,690
they're stepping in your area and
they're doing it on purpose just to,

1989
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:42,380
to so that when you bring it up there
is not the initial recognition of, yeah,

1990
01:55:42,410 --> 01:55:45,780
yeah. Like they've already heard
this 20 minutes ago, you know,

1991
01:55:45,781 --> 01:55:48,510
they've heard that they've heard
this subject breached 20 minutes ago.

1992
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:51,660
Even briefly. It just takes some of
the wind out of the sails a little bit.

1993
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:52,571
I worked with a guy,

1994
01:55:52,571 --> 01:55:55,680
I heard him talking to his friend and
the on the phone and he never saw me do

1995
01:55:55,681 --> 01:55:59,330
stand up. He's like, he's in the
green room and he's like, yeah,

1996
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:02,580
this guy's going to have a good
hard time following me this week.

1997
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,210
You heard him say that he's bragging.

1998
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:09,540
He walks in and he saw that
I heard. I'm like, Yeah Dude,

1999
01:56:09,541 --> 01:56:12,030
I hope you rock it. That'd,
that'd be great. You can't,

2000
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:14,700
you really did your with your,

2001
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:19,450
you know guys and paint like to hunt
men like you're going to do gauge.

2002
01:56:20,630 --> 01:56:25,260
It's hilarious. Who was his Garmin and
call them out and then used to fuck Aye.

2003
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:28,680
Aye. Aye. No, do it. I don't remember.

2004
01:56:28,681 --> 01:56:32,130
I bring Joey d road whenever I can.
Joey should be a headliner,

2005
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:36,150
but he's just too crazy to go on the
road by himself. Right. Catcher's trust.

2006
01:56:36,151 --> 01:56:37,650
Joey who won't show up.

2007
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:42,420
You know why I think back in the day when
you first started doing comedy for Guy

2008
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:46,200
Crushes in front of you for me, because
you'd be insecure, you'd go, oh,

2009
01:56:46,201 --> 01:56:47,610
that guy crush,
what am I going to do?

2010
01:56:47,730 --> 01:56:51,760
But then you reach an age in a confidence
level. You go, that's awesome. Yeah, I'm,

2011
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:56,100
I'm not gonna ride that same way. Well,
you all capable of be enjoying it.

2012
01:56:56,130 --> 01:56:58,590
Unfortunately for some people
guys that go on before him,

2013
01:56:58,591 --> 01:57:01,770
it's like a competition, you
know, and they're not enjoying it.

2014
01:57:01,771 --> 01:57:05,340
Instead of like watching the, the act and
having fun and being inspired, they're,

2015
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:07,830
they're not enjoying it.
And you could see shows where like if you,

2016
01:57:07,831 --> 01:57:11,470
or see you and Joey and,
and anyone else went when every,

2017
01:57:11,471 --> 01:57:16,050
when the comics like each other to show
is better because there's a cooler vibe.

2018
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:19,050
I've done shows where it's
Mc hasn't talked to me.

2019
01:57:19,051 --> 01:57:21,570
Feature guy was just
being friendly and me.

2020
01:57:21,690 --> 01:57:25,410
And then I get on stage almost like
I'm by myself this entire week. Yes,

2021
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:27,250
let's hear it for those guy like,

2022
01:57:27,251 --> 01:57:31,840
and there's no connection and there's
no opposed to if your friends are like,

2023
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:34,170
the worst is when you try
to bring a guy in like you,

2024
01:57:34,171 --> 01:57:35,450
like you try to pal around with them,

2025
01:57:35,451 --> 01:57:39,650
but you realize like deepen this a one
way street. This guy's a Douche bag. Like,

2026
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:44,160
fuck, I'm working with a douchebag.
Yeah. You know, it's always tricky, man.

2027
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:46,890
Going on the road. That was the number
one thing that I hated the most.

2028
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:48,690
So you never knew who
you're gonna work with.

2029
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:52,650
You could be working with some dude with
a real negative energy and I work with

2030
01:57:52,651 --> 01:57:57,330
twos that get super drunk and just one
of fallen down and make an ass out of

2031
01:57:57,331 --> 01:57:59,370
themselves in the next light. You got to
hang out with them again. You're like,

2032
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:03,150
hey man, you guys want to go to a bar?
No, I don't want to go to a bar with you.

2033
01:58:03,151 --> 01:58:06,910
You crazy alcoholic. Fuck
right. And then, you know, no,

2034
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:08,820
no longer have a friend for the week.
Yeah.

2035
01:58:08,821 --> 01:58:13,821
I worked with a guy recently who read
news or even worse is the guy who used to

2036
01:58:15,001 --> 01:58:19,300
drink and looks down at you
want a shot? No, I don't drink.

2037
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:23,730
I'm trying to look down at
people never looked down. Brian.

2038
01:58:23,731 --> 01:58:28,540
Fuck you man. I don't look down at
leave. I'm a little, I don't drink. Yeah,

2039
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:31,400
I've seen drunk John Heffernan.
I've seen sober. Jon had,

2040
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:36,390
I welcome sober Jon Ephrata drunk.
John Heffrons better for all of John.

2041
01:58:36,391 --> 01:58:40,280
The phone's breaking up.
I can't hear what I just said.

2042
01:58:40,830 --> 01:58:42,190
He's not gonna remember this conversation

2043
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:46,510
anyway. Yeah. There's the guy that John
Hernandez desert drank way better. Yeah.

2044
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:49,580
Way more money way.
Uh,

2045
01:58:49,620 --> 01:58:54,100
John was the old John Heffron was easier.
Yeah. What do you mean to get into bed?

2046
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:59,320
And Brian, Brian's got plans.
Um, what was I going to ask you?

2047
01:58:59,321 --> 01:59:01,180
You got the one oh,
silly hologram bracelets on.

2048
01:59:01,181 --> 01:59:04,360
Do you really think that things helping
you? I know, but I like to wear it though.

2049
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:08,900
I like something like an athlete. Yeah.
It's Kinda cool. It's like a moderate up.

2050
01:59:09,050 --> 01:59:12,010
What is the first goes live
strong bracelets. Yeah.

2051
01:59:12,011 --> 01:59:15,790
I used to have one for this Q lane that
was supposed to do the same stuff years

2052
01:59:15,791 --> 01:59:17,350
and years ago,
but that was really expensive.

2053
01:59:17,351 --> 01:59:19,960
This I got free in like
a golf bag or something.

2054
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:23,170
It's supposed to be something
that's supposed to balance
you. It's all nonsense.

2055
01:59:23,171 --> 01:59:26,110
Complete total nonsense.
They cannot not be nonsense.

2056
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:29,040
But what the placebo effect
people like take those things.

2057
01:59:29,090 --> 01:59:31,360
Then they have all sorts of like benefits.

2058
01:59:31,361 --> 01:59:34,300
Their back feels great and all of a
sudden their injuries go away and then if

2059
01:59:34,301 --> 01:59:36,370
they deal with the placebo and it works,
then it works.

2060
01:59:36,580 --> 01:59:39,730
But it's kind of placebo effect is
some real shit. I don't know why,

2061
01:59:39,790 --> 01:59:43,600
but it's some real shit, you know? Yeah.
You just tell yourself and you go, okay,

2062
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:46,650
it's all connected to evade.
The placebo effect is very much like,

2063
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:49,240
like when you're on stage and
you know things are funny.

2064
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:52,000
You know how you got that feeling where
you know things are funny and you just

2065
01:59:52,001 --> 01:59:56,020
kind of like trust in it and it just
goes to this sort of magical place for it

2066
01:59:56,021 --> 01:59:58,360
just comes out. I think the
placebo effect is the same thing.

2067
01:59:58,361 --> 01:59:59,920
It's like you know this
is going to heal you,

2068
01:59:59,921 --> 02:00:02,170
you know there's going to
make you better and boom,

2069
02:00:02,470 --> 02:00:04,300
it just lights up all
those parts of your brain.

2070
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:07,150
You just have to truly believe in it.
And He'd do it. You're an idiot. Look at,

2071
02:00:07,151 --> 02:00:07,811
it's a rubber band,

2072
02:00:07,811 --> 02:00:10,600
which should probably bandwidth with
the sticker that would be on underneath

2073
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:15,601
your baseball hat if you bought it for a
little Hologram or your baseball cards.

2074
02:00:16,571 --> 02:00:21,070
It shows that it's a real, a upper deck
shit is goddamn ridiculous. Just kind of,

2075
02:00:21,150 --> 02:00:23,860
so how long do you think you can keep
this up? This travel on the road?

2076
02:00:23,861 --> 02:00:26,770
40 weeks a year cause I that'll kill
them on. What are you running from

2077
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:31,810
running to? What's good? You're
saying sassful you know it's a sign.

2078
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:32,890
It's 80 it's so funny.

2079
02:00:32,891 --> 02:00:36,580
I keep joking with people telling people
I'm going to start a mailing lists for

2080
02:00:36,581 --> 02:00:39,550
when I'm about 65 in
Branson, Missouri. Oh,

2081
02:00:39,590 --> 02:00:42,370
I'm going to do a 1:00 PM show
Yakov Smirnoff specialists,

2082
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:46,270
but it's legit but can be 65 70
at that point. You know who cash.

2083
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:50,980
But I do have a thing I told myself and
I'm putting plans together where I'm

2084
02:00:50,981 --> 02:00:53,260
going to retire when I'm 50,
you know,

2085
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:57,550
just done really and only working for
when I want to because I'll still be

2086
02:00:57,551 --> 02:00:59,710
relevant. And you know,
there's not really any time,

2087
02:01:00,190 --> 02:01:04,280
but that's my goal is I'm in work around
La and work wherever you are, whatever,

2088
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:06,670
who stands up whenever you feel
what happens 10 years from now.

2089
02:01:06,671 --> 02:01:09,340
But I'm going to keep running
for the next 10 years.

2090
02:01:09,341 --> 02:01:12,250
I wanted to talk to you about this while
we have you on the podcast because now

2091
02:01:12,251 --> 02:01:13,750
I'm just remembering,
um,

2092
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:18,810
you were the one that has been doing
these crazy cyber conference shows and

2093
02:01:18,851 --> 02:01:22,450
we've actually talked about you on the
show before about you've done these

2094
02:01:22,451 --> 02:01:27,250
corporate gigs. Explain, explain exactly
how it goes. Yeah. I brought a tape of it,

2095
02:01:27,251 --> 02:01:28,870
but we can't play it.
What it is,

2096
02:01:28,871 --> 02:01:33,340
it's with Cisco's telepresence and you
go into a room, just a conference room.

2097
02:01:33,341 --> 02:01:38,341
You sit down at a table and then across
from you is maybe three big screen TVs,

2098
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:40,220
maybe about eight inches each.

2099
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:44,510
68 68 inch screen, maybe each
one. Each one. Wow. Okay.

2100
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:48,410
So then on one of the screens was Boston,

2101
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:53,090
the one in the middle was New York. The
other one, Washington DC. In each screen,

2102
02:01:53,330 --> 02:01:58,010
imagine 30 40 people sitting in
each screen. So that little squares,

2103
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:02,870
like webcams? No, just a Oh, a group? Yes.

2104
02:02:02,871 --> 02:02:04,280
Just like your group,
like an audience.

2105
02:02:04,281 --> 02:02:07,550
It looks like a window when
looks like a window. No,

2106
02:02:07,551 --> 02:02:10,390
it doesn't look like a Webcam
at all. It looks like. So the,

2107
02:02:10,391 --> 02:02:14,700
the screen is filled with an audience.
So if we were to, you have a,

2108
02:02:14,770 --> 02:02:17,560
a big sliding glass door.
If we were to set up uh,

2109
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:21,290
chairs and then Brian gets on the
other side of the, of the window,

2110
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:25,640
that's exactly what it looks like.
You're to scale, everything's to scale.

2111
02:02:25,641 --> 02:02:27,690
So you're not looking at little guys,
you're,

2112
02:02:27,770 --> 02:02:32,060
and then how you sit in the table
because then their table does the same.

2113
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:36,320
It looks like it's one big
round connected table. Dude.

2114
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:40,340
Someone should set up cyber comedy clubs.

2115
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:44,740
Well that's due. So I was
the friend. I wish I had a,
you don't have to show video.

2116
02:02:44,750 --> 02:02:48,030
And this is more and more
people are listening to this
on iTunes and [inaudible].

2117
02:02:48,270 --> 02:02:52,820
So in your house? No, this, this one
was I, I've done it at a couple hotels.

2118
02:02:52,830 --> 02:02:56,630
I just wanted the big chains. The
Hiltons or something has this, this,

2119
02:02:56,690 --> 02:03:01,550
this technology and then their hope it
is now you have a business meeting in New

2120
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:03,470
York. You live in Los
Angeles. You're not flying.

2121
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:08,220
You go into their hotel sitting there.
I can look across from you. It's all,

2122
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:11,820
this is a whole chain. Like
all the Hiltons, it's, it's,

2123
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,050
I don't know if it's the
Hilton's, I forgot what plan
I was the cliff hotel. Yeah,

2124
02:03:15,051 --> 02:03:16,880
but so that's their thing.

2125
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:20,360
So I've done it now
Cisco a bunch of times,

2126
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:23,630
but three or four of them? No.
Are these squeaky clean gigs?

2127
02:03:23,631 --> 02:03:25,640
Do you have to be squeaky clean?
Yeah.

2128
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:30,650
In what had happens is in each room is
people who want to buy the technology.

2129
02:03:30,651 --> 02:03:35,330
So it's the owners of these companies
that spend 25 million, 50 million.

2130
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:39,470
So imagine those type of guys. Okay,
so you're doing stand up to them.

2131
02:03:39,890 --> 02:03:44,540
So then you sit down, are you doing
stand up or are you do my presentation?

2132
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:48,980
No, I do my act. So I sit down and then
you have the Cisco person here going,

2133
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:53,600
you know for a meeting because maybe they
watch a presentation about the system

2134
02:03:54,230 --> 02:03:57,320
but Dah, Dah Dah. And then I
get an intro almost like a,

2135
02:03:57,410 --> 02:04:00,890
like an mc wood and then
you kind of go off into it.

2136
02:04:01,810 --> 02:04:05,150
And how I look at is, you know how
when you do morning radio you show up.

2137
02:04:05,150 --> 02:04:09,410
It's just the Dj and maybe a news girl.
It's the same.

2138
02:04:09,411 --> 02:04:10,940
You have to tweak your,
your brain.

2139
02:04:10,941 --> 02:04:13,370
You know how when you get there
you kind of performance mode,

2140
02:04:13,371 --> 02:04:15,680
but you see all the people
sitting there looking at it.

2141
02:04:15,681 --> 02:04:20,681
So then you see them and then you could
go in whatever room is the loudest.

2142
02:04:21,410 --> 02:04:25,610
That's what you see. So it, it,
it knows if somebody is talking.

2143
02:04:25,730 --> 02:04:29,450
So let's say Boston was laughing
really hard, that it, ah,

2144
02:04:29,510 --> 02:04:33,290
and the need quiet down and all of a
sudden New York would pop up, you know,

2145
02:04:33,291 --> 02:04:36,650
cause somebody talked or, or did something
wrong. I'm looking at one screen. Well,

2146
02:04:36,651 --> 02:04:39,330
it would constantly,
well that's annoying.

2147
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:42,660
Why wouldn't it just be the same
screen over and over again? It does,

2148
02:04:42,661 --> 02:04:44,100
it picks up whoever's talking.

2149
02:04:44,101 --> 02:04:47,250
So then that way the focus
can be on that person talking.

2150
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:50,640
Can't they have it static?
I wouldn't see that from me.

2151
02:04:50,670 --> 02:04:53,310
You would want to see the audience
and they would just want to see you.

2152
02:04:53,311 --> 02:04:56,460
If you could just have that stat. What if
you fall in love with somebody? Tell me,

2153
02:04:56,461 --> 02:05:01,200
Brian, please. Piano music.
Am I done in San Francisco?

2154
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:03,210
Um,
so yeah,

2155
02:05:03,211 --> 02:05:06,800
so you do it and then you
would look across from you,

2156
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:08,490
hey guy in the NASA suit.

2157
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:12,810
And then so that's what I would have to
do is you'd have to bring in people, um,

2158
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:16,380
you know, so they feel connected and
then you just do your, your stuff.

2159
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:20,520
Could they do it static where they just
see you all the time and then you, yeah,

2160
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:23,580
because I laid on that piano mother
fucker. This isn't even sad anymore.

2161
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:25,180
It could be a sad if we want it to be.

2162
02:05:25,370 --> 02:05:27,720
What do you want to
talk about several way?

2163
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:29,940
Have you ever fallen in love
to talking about sad things?

2164
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:34,920
I think to some of the status things.
Are these people like HD though? Like,

2165
02:05:34,921 --> 02:05:37,190
like I mean like really,
really good pitchers.

2166
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:40,830
Like you're looking into a window and the
person's right there, that's the only,

2167
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:44,370
and their faces just kind of come on like
so it was a room you in that you're in

2168
02:05:44,371 --> 02:05:46,680
like pitch black.
So you just see like these faces that,

2169
02:05:46,681 --> 02:05:50,110
are these bodies come in front of
you eight? No, it's least three.

2170
02:05:50,111 --> 02:05:53,970
You have three screens, but each screen
does not have an individual video on it.

2171
02:05:53,971 --> 02:05:58,160
They all have, they all have
the same thing. Doesn't weird,

2172
02:05:58,200 --> 02:05:59,460
but I'm sure there's adjustments,

2173
02:05:59,461 --> 02:06:03,870
but sometimes all three screens will be
one city and then other times it would

2174
02:06:03,871 --> 02:06:07,680
split and I don't know,
it's all voice activated so I don't know.

2175
02:06:08,490 --> 02:06:09,720
And that would be distracting.

2176
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:12,540
I think if they could keep it static so
that you could just get into your head

2177
02:06:12,541 --> 02:06:14,970
and do your material. I think it
can be very much like an audience.

2178
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:19,920
I think that's a real possibility of
cyber comedy club where a comic would

2179
02:06:19,921 --> 02:06:24,921
perform in a studio in la or wherever
the hell they are in New York and people

2180
02:06:24,931 --> 02:06:29,340
would come, you know like, hey, we're
going to do Austin, Texas and Ohio and,

2181
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:31,680
and you know, you're in the room
with you, like what's up, what's up,

2182
02:06:31,681 --> 02:06:33,570
how are you already
doing? And it's like, wow,

2183
02:06:33,571 --> 02:06:37,230
where we really are in a room
together like that. Dope. Last,

2184
02:06:37,231 --> 02:06:41,340
a couple of weeks ago I did a thing for
Cisco at their place and then I went

2185
02:06:41,341 --> 02:06:44,550
downtown to some steak place
right by the staple center too.

2186
02:06:44,551 --> 02:06:48,780
This is a great idea for a TV show, man.
So I'll, so doing what you're saying.

2187
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:53,640
I was, now I'm in a steakhouse downtown.
They have a conference room, there's a,

2188
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:55,170
I'm sitting at this table,

2189
02:06:55,171 --> 02:07:00,171
almost like the last supper table with
people all on my right and left a screen

2190
02:07:00,571 --> 02:07:01,890
and TV in front of me.

2191
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:06,360
I'm looking at another steak
house that was in Tempe, Arizona,

2192
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:11,550
full of a hundred people all sitting
at tables. Just like, uh, you know,

2193
02:07:11,551 --> 02:07:14,820
like you're at a restaurant,
they're watching me on TV.

2194
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:20,330
I'm doing my stuff in that 100
people in that room are laughing.

2195
02:07:20,461 --> 02:07:24,590
So I would like, and I would
literally do crowd work. I'd go, yeah,

2196
02:07:24,820 --> 02:07:27,510
be in the white sweater and the
second table from, what's your name?

2197
02:07:27,511 --> 02:07:30,160
And she would shout out Sarah.
He said,

2198
02:07:30,170 --> 02:07:32,100
what was the last argument
you got in with your husband?

2199
02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:35,260
And then she would have a thing and I
would talk and then that room would laugh.

2200
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:40,180
It's a really, it's kind of crazy. That's
pretty interesting, man. So you can do it.

2201
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:44,360
And people were like, Eh, the
people in the room wanting be, um,

2202
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:48,260
into it yet because, so imagine
watching a comedy central special. What?

2203
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:52,380
Say That again? Like a lot of
people go in. Cisco was wearing,

2204
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:55,960
I had some other trainers that want to
buy the technology. They were saying,

2205
02:07:56,200 --> 02:08:01,200
how can you engage or build rapport
with a hundred people that are in a

2206
02:08:01,331 --> 02:08:03,220
different city,
not with you.

2207
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:06,460
That was a weird thing that
like is a comic gonna work,

2208
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:10,030
but it works because just like you're
watching comedy central and you're

2209
02:08:10,031 --> 02:08:12,010
watching someone special,
you're laughing.

2210
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:16,410
Now imagine if that guy could look
out at you and go, hey, you're a,

2211
02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:20,740
you're almost pit and have a conversation
with you so it really adds this whole,

2212
02:08:20,741 --> 02:08:21,970
why would they say it wouldn't work?
Look,

2213
02:08:21,971 --> 02:08:24,220
as long as you can interact with the
people you can interact with them,

2214
02:08:24,221 --> 02:08:27,010
it's going to be a weird thing.
A cyber comedy club was a very,

2215
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,180
very interesting idea.

2216
02:08:28,181 --> 02:08:32,230
That technology that they have a home
version of that still look at me now,

2217
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:34,720
but you know what I'm saying?
Like you wouldn't have to travel so much.

2218
02:08:34,870 --> 02:08:36,790
You know you get,
if you had a cyber comedy club,

2219
02:08:36,791 --> 02:08:38,830
you could have people come to
see you all over the country.

2220
02:08:38,831 --> 02:08:40,600
They organized the shows,
you know,

2221
02:08:40,601 --> 02:08:44,460
and have a be cheap like a movie ticket
instead of like a comedy club tickets

2222
02:08:44,690 --> 02:08:47,980
where it's a live show and you gotta to
justify the airfare and all the shit to

2223
02:08:47,981 --> 02:08:50,330
get the guy to the club this way is just,
you know,

2224
02:08:50,331 --> 02:08:54,430
it's just in a studio somewhere you cut
a lot of the expenses out is cheaper and

2225
02:08:54,431 --> 02:08:57,670
the people go and they're, it's a real
show. It's like they're interacting,

2226
02:08:57,970 --> 02:08:59,520
you know, and you know, and like,

2227
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:03,250
especially for me when I do question
Anson Shit question and answer shit.

2228
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:05,680
Like you could see that it was really
happening right there. And then,

2229
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:08,230
and I don't know how many cities you can,

2230
02:09:08,231 --> 02:09:11,800
let's say you do it at the hotel
where it's set up. If you, if there's,

2231
02:09:11,801 --> 02:09:12,820
I don't know what the limit is,

2232
02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:16,550
but you could have like yet
10 satellite cities and what,

2233
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:18,580
I don't know what the
technologies were like one,

2234
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:22,180
you had like five cities going at the
same time, but yet one conti audience,

2235
02:09:22,510 --> 02:09:24,980
they're just heckling and being douchey.
Just mute them.

2236
02:09:25,650 --> 02:09:28,480
I put you on ignore Kansas City.
You just got on the door,

2237
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:31,780
you should probably have a moderator.
You'd have a club owner, which is just,

2238
02:09:31,781 --> 02:09:34,720
you know, somebody sitting there meeting
people that are getting out of control.

2239
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:37,780
Yeah, the mute the audience, but the, the
feed still comes through, you know, watch.

2240
02:09:37,781 --> 02:09:42,550
It's a Cisco is 8 billion trillion dollar
company and I gave them a legitimate

2241
02:09:42,551 --> 02:09:45,310
thing. When you're done with those,
it's a weird thing. You Go, okay,

2242
02:09:45,311 --> 02:09:48,010
well we're done. And you know how
when you're done with something,

2243
02:09:48,011 --> 02:09:51,400
you're used to shaking a hand or
pat or there's a, okay, we're done.

2244
02:09:51,580 --> 02:09:52,660
Well they don't have anything.

2245
02:09:52,661 --> 02:09:55,360
And I told them they need a virtual
fist pump where when like, okay,

2246
02:09:55,361 --> 02:09:59,950
later I hit a button and a fist just
comes to your screen and then we do a,

2247
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:03,190
you watch this right now,
I'm going to show you,

2248
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:08,230
I will be willing to
willing virtual mansiony,

2249
02:10:08,410 --> 02:10:13,200
maybe a virtual handshake,
fistfuls bone dare to business travel,

2250
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:17,380
business fist bump in the world of human
resources, it's not going to exist.

2251
02:10:17,740 --> 02:10:22,740
I bet you not going to watch you behavior
with secret handshakes and fist bumps

2252
02:10:23,231 --> 02:10:26,920
and shit. There's going to be
a some type of a thing. Whoa.

2253
02:10:26,950 --> 02:10:29,650
Maybe like a green light,
a nice green light like a palm.

2254
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:31,090
I invent a two thing like palm,

2255
02:10:31,091 --> 02:10:32,950
it shows up in the screen
watching and I'm gonna say this.

2256
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:37,550
Then the ideas can be there. All the
business guys take off their jackets.

2257
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:40,100
You know they have the shirt and ties and
they throw them over the back of their

2258
02:10:40,101 --> 02:10:40,934
chairs.

2259
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:44,810
I'm going to invent suit jackets that
aren't real once they just covered the

2260
02:10:44,811 --> 02:10:48,590
back of your chair.
So you see that as a piece of your suit,

2261
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:51,260
but you don't have to wear the jacket.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2262
02:10:51,261 --> 02:10:55,630
You got tackled. Brilliant idea. That's
an idea. You're talking about. Signage.

2263
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:57,780
Jackets are never a good idea.
John had fraud.

2264
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:01,130
They're going to go on the
back into herself too long.

2265
02:11:01,131 --> 02:11:04,670
Virtual fist pump talking
about your sake jackets bro.

2266
02:11:04,700 --> 02:11:07,910
That are going to go on the
back of, because here's the
thing, when you do those,

2267
02:11:07,911 --> 02:11:10,500
you don't have to wear dress
pants because they can't it.

2268
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:15,260
They're like newscasters. So the new
look, you can go board shorts, flip flops,

2269
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:20,390
maybe a nice shirt with a tie
fake jacket cover over the thing.

2270
02:11:20,391 --> 02:11:22,560
You look like you're wearing
a suit and you got problems.

2271
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:27,920
Brain dog guys are NASA in the
beginning of the show brain doctor,

2272
02:11:27,921 --> 02:11:31,700
you need to go see one telling you you're
gonna, you're gonna, we're gonna see it.

2273
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:34,550
You're all gonna for start there John
Heffron I'd be willing to bet you an

2274
02:11:34,551 --> 02:11:35,720
insane amount of money.

2275
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:39,970
That fake jackets that you put on the
back of your city will exempt. Okay.

2276
02:11:40,130 --> 02:11:42,530
Cause he will exist cause I'll
create them. Okay. You will,

2277
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:46,500
they will exist and they will be a money
pit of disastrous proportions for me.

2278
02:11:46,730 --> 02:11:50,720
I need somebody that direct message me.
I need a seamstress.

2279
02:11:51,350 --> 02:11:54,320
What is it like dealing with those people
in that world and doing like squeaky

2280
02:11:54,321 --> 02:11:58,250
clean comedy only and not being able to
take any chances up there or go into any

2281
02:11:58,251 --> 02:12:02,180
weird directions. What does that like
I've always done is that type of comedy.

2282
02:12:02,181 --> 02:12:06,440
So it's not weird for them than you do.
You're currently has got me. I'm an adult,

2283
02:12:06,441 --> 02:12:09,540
but I'm not, you know, I don't
get ever super grass. I, I'm,

2284
02:12:09,570 --> 02:12:13,460
I believe you can turn a,
a clean bit dirty,

2285
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:15,950
just buy things then vice versa.

2286
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:19,140
But yet you are one of the most perverted
people I've ever met in my life. Right.

2287
02:12:19,150 --> 02:12:19,983
It's pissed off with that.

2288
02:12:20,090 --> 02:12:23,840
Plus I think it's weird when you
have jobs that then affect you.

2289
02:12:23,841 --> 02:12:27,710
Like when I used to do morning radio
with Bonaduce, we are on a soccer mom,

2290
02:12:27,930 --> 02:12:32,750
a duty station. You have gun buyback.
You guys were on a soccer mom's station.

2291
02:12:32,751 --> 02:12:37,670
Yeah. We would like blow. Danny tried to
get in a fight at a matchbox 20 concert.

2292
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:42,500
So that shows you what kind of saying try
match. But in a fight at a mailbox, he,

2293
02:12:43,060 --> 02:12:46,710
it was the great, he took off his shirt
and was going to fight the entire row.

2294
02:12:46,850 --> 02:12:51,450
Jj at pineapple. Why would the shirt
off? Because better in the bathroom,

2295
02:12:51,950 --> 02:12:54,620
I think this is back when
Danny partied, I think, uh,

2296
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:59,060
Danny met up with the listener and
the disappeared, whatever happened.

2297
02:12:59,061 --> 02:13:03,380
So he came back in an altered stain. No,
he was never that type of guy liquor.

2298
02:13:04,030 --> 02:13:08,630
Um, no. I thought, I think
we was. Um, and he's talking,
he's talking about the story,

2299
02:13:08,631 --> 02:13:11,330
so I'm not thinking of, but it was that
date, rape drug, whatever your thing.

2300
02:13:11,331 --> 02:13:15,830
He did GHB. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So
yeah, but, but Danny scar tissue,

2301
02:13:15,831 --> 02:13:18,140
he did mid to all this stuff. I don't
know how that guy, but so he did.

2302
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:22,070
So then he came out crazy. Did you say
Danny is scar tissue? His whole body is,

2303
02:13:22,071 --> 02:13:25,370
or there's no way you can be alive with
all the stuff that he has done. Really?

2304
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:29,340
There's no way you have to be totally
embalmed. What did they do that with frog?

2305
02:13:29,341 --> 02:13:33,990
So the body's preserve? Yeah,
formaldehyde. His, that's his entire body.

2306
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:37,570
Really? Oh yeah. He's a Zombie. You can't,
he's not alive. What's wrong with him?

2307
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:41,790
He's just done so much stuff to his body.
What was it like working with that guy?

2308
02:13:41,791 --> 02:13:44,880
How long did you work with them?
Different? Kiss him five years.

2309
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:49,440
Five years on the radio. Every morning.
Every 15 in the morning. And Michigan,

2310
02:13:49,441 --> 02:13:53,610
which means that's when I scraped off
the ice on my thing. Drove 45 minutes.

2311
02:13:53,670 --> 02:13:56,370
How many months a year is it
snowing like that? And Michigan,

2312
02:13:56,510 --> 02:13:59,990
it started December and go to
like May. June. Yeah. I mean it's,

2313
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,930
so that's a long drive. A June,
seven months. Seven months.

2314
02:14:05,050 --> 02:14:10,050
Eight April and yeah, half the April,
half a year. Half it's cold and crappy.

2315
02:14:10,051 --> 02:14:13,320
Yeah. Okay. So cold and crappy. You
get up at three 30 in the morning.

2316
02:14:13,321 --> 02:14:17,400
You do it stand up at night
still? Yeah, around town. Um,

2317
02:14:17,970 --> 02:14:20,070
but it was Austin cause
I would sell out stuff.

2318
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:24,390
I mean there were some benefits I
wasn't playing and I was 25, 26.

2319
02:14:24,391 --> 02:14:29,280
Why would you ever want to sleep?
So I would do like radio bar appearances,

2320
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:32,700
you know, like I was that guy movie
premieres, but he got paid a lot of money.

2321
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:36,240
How crazy was daddy? Uh, beyond crazy?

2322
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:40,140
Because the thing with Danny is you never
knew which guy you were going to get.

2323
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:43,050
You can have a guy that you work
with that's a consistent ass,

2324
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:45,900
but at least then you know how to tip toe.
Other times,

2325
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,600
Daniel be the coolest human
being you've ever met.

2326
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:51,990
And then you come in the
next day and you'd go,

2327
02:14:51,991 --> 02:14:56,490
he's gonna literally slit my throat. The
only advantage, I mean did it. Now we're,

2328
02:14:56,491 --> 02:15:00,690
we're really good friends. And at first
he, he hated me. He wanted to hit you.

2329
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:05,190
Um,
well I never did radio before I met him.

2330
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:08,250
I was just a comic round town and I
didn't know how to talk with that person.

2331
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:10,590
It's try having that conversation
with them. It's tough.

2332
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:14,330
So imagine being a 22 year old kid,
not, you know, David [inaudible].

2333
02:15:14,370 --> 02:15:18,450
And I was like, yeah, but one time I,
you know, I just didn't have my rhythm.

2334
02:15:18,451 --> 02:15:22,110
I just didn't know. So he
hated you because, oh, hated
me. Hated working with you.

2335
02:15:22,170 --> 02:15:25,500
Hated just, yeah. Yeah. And he
didn't want to work with you.

2336
02:15:25,530 --> 02:15:29,010
He didn't want to know why to me fired.
I just moved back from Los Angeles.

2337
02:15:29,070 --> 02:15:33,900
So I moved to from Detroit to Los Angeles
and then got that job and move back to

2338
02:15:33,901 --> 02:15:38,190
Detroit and then got fired
maybe three or four weeks later.

2339
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:40,470
And then did he get you fired?
Yeah,

2340
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:43,740
he got me fired and then we
went to Chicago together.

2341
02:15:43,770 --> 02:15:46,440
It was an odd for some
weird thing and then we ate.

2342
02:15:46,740 --> 02:15:51,510
He didn't suddenly liked me and
then then I was on the shelf.

2343
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:53,760
You know what?
What are you talking about?

2344
02:15:53,790 --> 02:15:57,780
We did a radio show together and for some
reason why we were doing it in Chicago,

2345
02:15:57,781 --> 02:16:00,810
something clicked where he's like, oh,
I get you and I'll have friend. Okay,

2346
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:04,010
you're in. Then it was
so, I'm so confused. Okay.

2347
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:07,260
You started off together in Michigan,
you did a radio show,

2348
02:16:07,261 --> 02:16:11,100
he's got you fired and they got me
fired because they were going to get me,

2349
02:16:11,130 --> 02:16:14,100
you know, how did you go to Chicago?
What is this Chicago trip about?

2350
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:19,160
I got fired on a Friday and we were going
to go to Chicago on Monday to do a hit

2351
02:16:20,820 --> 02:16:25,530
this loop, the loop in Chicago.
So we do it as a permanent gig.

2352
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:29,320
Well, Danny's thing was a, I can't
believe they did that. You know,

2353
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:32,740
why don't you come to Chicago? We'll
do the show Monday. Puts you up.

2354
02:16:32,770 --> 02:16:34,030
I didn't know.
Just took confuses.

2355
02:16:34,031 --> 02:16:38,140
He's still doing the show in Michigan
and he does a show car. So yes,

2356
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:41,740
he would do morning shows in
Detroit afternoon in Chicago.

2357
02:16:41,741 --> 02:16:44,530
So he would get on a southwest flight.
Wait a minute.

2358
02:16:44,531 --> 02:16:48,310
He did a show every day in
two markets. Yes. Oh my God.

2359
02:16:48,311 --> 02:16:53,140
We'll get on a southwest flight and fly
from Detroit to Chicago, do the thing,

2360
02:16:53,170 --> 02:16:57,850
and then get on another flight. Fly
back. Holy Shit. Yeah. Every day. Yeah.

2361
02:16:57,851 --> 02:17:01,090
He did that for a couple months and then,
you know,

2362
02:17:01,091 --> 02:17:02,770
then he figured out technology,
but keep,

2363
02:17:02,830 --> 02:17:05,440
you know where they can ISD and
at where he would do it in thing.

2364
02:17:05,441 --> 02:17:10,090
But he was doing that every day is insane.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. How long is the flight?

2365
02:17:10,570 --> 02:17:15,220
A year? 10 minutes. 20 minutes. 40 yeah.
So it's an on Vegas, like flying to Vegas.

2366
02:17:15,221 --> 02:17:19,360
Yeah. And he would do it every day, back
and forth, and then do his radio show.

2367
02:17:19,361 --> 02:17:22,030
Holy Shit wrapped in,
you're in Chicago. Yeah.

2368
02:17:22,060 --> 02:17:24,790
You gotta give the Guy Credit for that?
No wonder why he was on drugs.

2369
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:29,080
So he got to be on drugs. So I was
fired, but he didn't tell me that it was,

2370
02:17:29,081 --> 02:17:32,080
he was like, I can't believe they
did that. I that's like so he didn't,

2371
02:17:32,110 --> 02:17:34,660
I didn't tell you that he got fired.
So he goes,

2372
02:17:34,661 --> 02:17:36,640
why don't you just come to
Chicago this weekend? We'll,

2373
02:17:36,641 --> 02:17:39,110
we'll party that just sucks.
Have friend. But you know, well,

2374
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:41,020
so he's Kinda like probably felt guilty.

2375
02:17:41,021 --> 02:17:45,060
I'll let you party in in Chicago with
me and then you're gone for life. Okay.

2376
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:48,190
Did the show with them on that
Monday and he's like, you know what,

2377
02:17:48,191 --> 02:17:51,880
I'm going to make a call like we had,
cause he never listened to me.

2378
02:17:52,210 --> 02:17:52,691
You know what I mean?

2379
02:17:52,691 --> 02:17:55,540
Like what's the problem on the show if
you would just listen to me. He knows.

2380
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:58,500
So anyway, long story short, I came
back and like, Eh, you know what?

2381
02:17:58,501 --> 02:18:01,420
We won't fire you but we'll give you,
you got to take a pay cut.

2382
02:18:01,750 --> 02:18:04,930
Because I was making, if you
know, keep in mind, I'm 23,

2383
02:18:04,931 --> 02:18:09,820
24 morning radio in Detroit,
making $150,000. Wow.

2384
02:18:10,020 --> 02:18:13,930
I mean, that's like $1 million to a
23, 24 years. Was this because, well,

2385
02:18:13,950 --> 02:18:18,520
why were they given you a pay cut? What
are they doing? You know, because I was,

2386
02:18:18,521 --> 02:18:22,780
I had no management or anything and
they're a huge corporation. They're like,

2387
02:18:22,781 --> 02:18:26,230
you get the Gig in the first
place. Uh, this huge radio guy,

2388
02:18:26,231 --> 02:18:30,670
Dick Perton in Detroit was leaving the
radio station and he suggested to that

2389
02:18:30,671 --> 02:18:33,190
management, you need to bring this
Heffron kid in. Keeping in mind,

2390
02:18:33,191 --> 02:18:37,290
I'm just at college, you know, so then
they go and you know, dig burrows.

2391
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:38,440
Most standup comedian.
Yeah.

2392
02:18:38,441 --> 02:18:42,160
And I was on a show and he was probably
the most famous radio guy in Detroit,

2393
02:18:42,161 --> 02:18:46,570
so they hired me just because of that
and put me with Dan. But Dan is the guy.

2394
02:18:46,571 --> 02:18:50,230
How crazy. Danny. Yes. Danny. He's the
guy who, and I've told it well, anyway,

2395
02:18:50,410 --> 02:18:55,270
he's the one who got me into fighting.
Um, he was really in the boxing and stuff.

2396
02:18:55,271 --> 02:18:59,620
So then what he did was he came to the
radio station and he had like headgear

2397
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:03,820
cups, boxing gloves and says, you know,

2398
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:08,050
I'm friends with Jackie Colon, we're going
to go to her place and we're going to,

2399
02:19:08,470 --> 02:19:10,870
I want you to learn to box so
I have somebody to spar with.

2400
02:19:10,871 --> 02:19:14,410
So he bought me all my appointments.
He bought me all my equipment,

2401
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:17,460
got me crazy coaches and goes, have
friend. I'm going to tell you, I mean,

2402
02:19:17,461 --> 02:19:18,910
she got a box so I have somebody to,

2403
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:23,230
and we're going to suffer every day from
12 to 12 to three. That's ridiculous.

2404
02:19:23,270 --> 02:19:25,840
So long time to get good at
boxing can just start sparring.

2405
02:19:25,841 --> 02:19:30,230
Someone had been doing it forever.
Yeah. So I, so I got to stuff and then,

2406
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:31,040
um,

2407
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:35,930
then me and Danny fought and I would
never been more afraid of my entire life.

2408
02:19:36,650 --> 02:19:39,950
Like there's a thing about fighting. You
can be a really good, you go to class,

2409
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:40,550
you're learning,

2410
02:19:40,550 --> 02:19:44,450
but you have to have that thing in you
that makes you want to kill people,

2411
02:19:44,810 --> 02:19:48,140
which I've never had. I enjoyed
fighting and I learned learning stuff,

2412
02:19:48,141 --> 02:19:52,190
but I don't have that. There's that
thing. Dan is a complete psycho.

2413
02:19:52,370 --> 02:19:54,830
He completely has that
thing and we'll kill you.

2414
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:58,820
Then that's when that shortly after,
that's when he gave me a concussion.

2415
02:19:58,850 --> 02:20:02,840
Hit me right in the back of the head,
um, to people punching on you dude.

2416
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:07,130
Cross guard. That's right. To,
to do cheat. So that's when we,

2417
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:10,280
so he hit me in the back of the head.
I went home,

2418
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:13,040
the girl was dating at the time,
comes to my apartment and goes,

2419
02:20:13,041 --> 02:20:16,910
why'd you buy a VCR on my kitchen table
from best buy out a VCR? I'm like,

2420
02:20:16,911 --> 02:20:20,330
I didn't buy a VCR. She's like, yeah,
well who's is that ago? I Dunno,

2421
02:20:20,570 --> 02:20:25,100
looked saw that the credit card receipt
was my signature. But this was weird.

2422
02:20:25,101 --> 02:20:27,800
This was in the 90s when
people bought DVD players.

2423
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:32,420
So I actually went backwards in
technology. Don't remember buying a VCR.

2424
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:36,500
She took me to the hospital and then the
guy did the stand up on one foot thing

2425
02:20:37,010 --> 02:20:40,060
and I fell over and he's like,
what's a mat? So then, you know,

2426
02:20:40,070 --> 02:20:45,070
I had a really weird duty not to backwards
in a technological progress with,

2427
02:20:45,780 --> 02:20:46,550
with a punch.

2428
02:20:46,550 --> 02:20:49,850
He knocked you back to the visa and
then after that he recruited me.

2429
02:20:49,890 --> 02:20:53,720
We're friends. Why wasn't there anyone
around to stop you from boxing him?

2430
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:57,740
I had no guidance. That's
so sad. I had no guy.

2431
02:20:57,741 --> 02:21:00,880
I wish I could've been
your front of and no, no.

2432
02:21:01,290 --> 02:21:05,240
I had no guys don't do a chart and
don't get, we need you here on earth.

2433
02:21:05,810 --> 02:21:07,830
We need you for your brain.
We need you to be funny.

2434
02:21:07,831 --> 02:21:11,830
And we can't have people
after that, Danny, you know,
like me and stuff like that.

2435
02:21:12,130 --> 02:21:15,260
Let Him Punch you and fire you
and he's the best guy ever. Yeah.

2436
02:21:15,261 --> 02:21:18,350
You just gotta go the big bit of a
gauntlet and then it isn't doing,

2437
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:20,630
so you've got a show in Philly
or something? Yeah, he's married.

2438
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:24,380
He's about to get married again. It
was, he married, uh, I don't know.

2439
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:25,513
How do you know this?

2440
02:21:25,700 --> 02:21:29,060
And there's somebody that knows somebody
who knows somebody who's marrying him.

2441
02:21:29,061 --> 02:21:33,890
Yeah. Really? Oh, tell me
more. Very interesting. Yeah,
he was dominating. Yeah.

2442
02:21:34,550 --> 02:21:37,760
Interesting guy to get in a
fight out of matchbox 20 concert.

2443
02:21:37,761 --> 02:21:42,230
You really have in a work because that
crowd is not necessarily violent Oz fest.

2444
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:46,560
Yeah. Of 20. It's guys being forced to
take the girls you've never seen man.

2445
02:21:46,690 --> 02:21:49,850
Some emo do's get really pissed when
they see the trick with another dude and

2446
02:21:49,851 --> 02:21:51,470
they realize that they're
crying isn't working.

2447
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:55,370
Sometimes they turn like temper
tantrum ish. Right? Yeah.

2448
02:21:56,570 --> 02:21:57,950
Well John had fun.
Where are you next buddy?

2449
02:21:58,340 --> 02:22:02,150
Tell people where to where they can cut
you up. Towels or what? Well John ron.com.

2450
02:22:02,151 --> 02:22:05,990
Right? Two F's W uh, John, uh,

2451
02:22:06,010 --> 02:22:10,430
h e f f r o n.com and a Twitter schedule.

2452
02:22:10,431 --> 02:22:14,480
And your Twitter is at John Heffron.
Yeah. And John and I met a long time ago.

2453
02:22:14,481 --> 02:22:16,460
We was doing the maximum comedy tour.
You,

2454
02:22:16,461 --> 02:22:20,270
me and Charlie Murphy and we've been pals
ever since. There was a fun tour. Yeah.

2455
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:24,230
Wise there was a financial disaster
for bud light and all the people put it

2456
02:22:24,231 --> 02:22:26,010
together. If they did,
the guy who was a promoter

2457
02:22:26,020 --> 02:22:28,710
didn't like no advertising.
We just kind of showed up everywhere.

2458
02:22:28,930 --> 02:22:33,480
The kids never did any radio. He didn't
do any, you would expect to sell out, uh,

2459
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:36,540
uh, you know, 7,000 like you okay.

2460
02:22:36,541 --> 02:22:40,470
Every show you've ever done
when you go on a city sells out.

2461
02:22:40,890 --> 02:22:42,420
Especially for me at that time,

2462
02:22:42,421 --> 02:22:45,300
even go four years later I
was selling out like crazy.

2463
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:48,810
But then so you would think and that
just shows you that nobody knew about it.

2464
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:49,900
Nobody knew about.

2465
02:22:49,901 --> 02:22:53,580
It was a miss my own friends that know
about it and I didn't promote it very

2466
02:22:53,581 --> 02:22:55,940
well on my own shit,
on my website and everything.

2467
02:22:55,970 --> 02:22:58,230
I thought they hadn't taken care of.
I didn't think of how to think that.

2468
02:22:58,231 --> 02:23:00,660
You're like, finally there's a
tour with a lot of money behind it.

2469
02:23:00,661 --> 02:23:03,810
They're going to put posters and they're
going to do some stuff. I didn't get it.

2470
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:08,070
The whole, uh, selling, you
know, the, that promotion is
actually a part of the job.

2471
02:23:08,071 --> 02:23:11,430
I never thought of it that way. I always
thought, oh, little take care of itself.

2472
02:23:11,431 --> 02:23:12,530
Someone will take care of it.
Right.

2473
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:15,170
You don't take care of it if you
don't let people know about it.

2474
02:23:15,380 --> 02:23:17,100
They actually get upset. They're
like, what the fuck, dude?

2475
02:23:17,101 --> 02:23:19,260
I didn't even know you had
a show. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2476
02:23:19,410 --> 02:23:22,380
I started concentrating more on
my message board and on my number,

2477
02:23:22,490 --> 02:23:25,770
my message rather than my mailing list
and Twitter and all that shit after that.

2478
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:29,580
Yeah. You know, it's not when someone
else puts it together, it's not fun.

2479
02:23:29,581 --> 02:23:32,520
But it was a fun gig. You know,
we, we had a good time, man.

2480
02:23:32,521 --> 02:23:34,830
I would love to do some mortgage like
that with you. We should do some,

2481
02:23:34,950 --> 02:23:39,690
some big travel points where you just
have to know our acts are so different.

2482
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:43,420
You know, we should do some, uh, some big
gigs together. You know, where we, uh,

2483
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:47,610
you know, we made it, make our
fans meet how we started. Yeah.

2484
02:23:47,730 --> 02:23:50,040
I always thought of a cool
thing where you would, um,

2485
02:23:50,130 --> 02:23:53,650
you know how they have all
these four leases places in
every city you go to just,

2486
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:57,300
you can go to any mall or strip mall.
There's buildings.

2487
02:23:57,510 --> 02:24:01,320
We just to see the power of the
Internet and go, we're in this city.

2488
02:24:01,410 --> 02:24:03,150
We're doing it at the corner of this,
you know,

2489
02:24:03,151 --> 02:24:07,140
ran out one of those places for the
day but not a normal comedy place.

2490
02:24:07,230 --> 02:24:09,720
Like a restaurant that
went out of business.

2491
02:24:09,810 --> 02:24:12,600
Right and you get set up a
sound system and then you go,

2492
02:24:12,601 --> 02:24:15,750
we're going to show up and then you
blast it to your network and see how many

2493
02:24:15,751 --> 02:24:18,240
people show up in that one area.
That's an interesting idea.

2494
02:24:18,241 --> 02:24:19,560
If you knew the venue in advance,

2495
02:24:19,561 --> 02:24:22,470
you knew it was a at the pre and
then you'd have to go and just see.

2496
02:24:22,471 --> 02:24:26,030
It'd be kind of like a workspace
comedy show, but I don't know.

2497
02:24:27,570 --> 02:24:28,950
By the way I should mention this.

2498
02:24:29,070 --> 02:24:34,070
What is the shit and we will be doing it
soon is Kevin Smith's Mod castle in La.

2499
02:24:34,470 --> 02:24:38,940
It is the Shit I did.
Tom Green's podcasts from there.

2500
02:24:39,030 --> 02:24:43,590
He does a live podcast with an audience.
It's fucking fun as shit.

2501
02:24:43,770 --> 02:24:48,770
I lost like half standup comedy half
audience like we got to do on there with

2502
02:24:49,111 --> 02:24:53,190
Joey. It's, it's incredible.
What did they call it? Pod pod.

2503
02:24:53,191 --> 02:24:55,170
Castle Smith Smog cast.

2504
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:58,860
Smith podcast and it's just like almost
like a studio for people do podcasts.

2505
02:24:58,861 --> 02:24:59,910
Like,
you know what it's like,

2506
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:03,060
it's like one of those little tiny
theaters where they teach acting classes.

2507
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:05,940
That's what it looks like. It's like
one of those really small theaters.

2508
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:11,150
Seats may be 50 people and they have
a stage and a microphone set up and a,

2509
02:25:11,741 --> 02:25:14,910
you just give the dude and SD card. He
slaps it in at the end of it. It's over.

2510
02:25:15,030 --> 02:25:18,210
They, they, they sell tickets again in
the ticket's paid for renting the place.

2511
02:25:18,820 --> 02:25:22,510
That's 20 bucks, 20 bucks taken in an
old school way. If you think of that,

2512
02:25:22,530 --> 02:25:24,210
what's that Guy Camp Wogo

2513
02:25:24,310 --> 02:25:28,970
Wobegon that old school radio.
Garrison Keillor. Yeah. Yeah. No, but,

2514
02:25:28,971 --> 02:25:32,080
but you're thinking you're doing a live
show in front of live people that's so

2515
02:25:32,081 --> 02:25:34,220
old school. The way that they use, uh,

2516
02:25:34,290 --> 02:25:38,710
Jimmy Pardot has got a podcast and they
did a live show where they had people in

2517
02:25:38,711 --> 02:25:41,410
the audience and it was just
Webcam for 20. It was really,

2518
02:25:41,411 --> 02:25:43,480
I did Carolla's podcast.
Tony was,

2519
02:25:43,560 --> 02:25:47,980
it was odd because Corola had it
almost like a radio show, you know,

2520
02:25:47,981 --> 02:25:48,580
one guy would,

2521
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:51,940
these guys would go out for 15 minutes
and the next guys would go up for 15

2522
02:25:51,941 --> 02:25:54,630
minutes. You know, I think
you know, and then you,

2523
02:25:54,631 --> 02:25:56,450
you almost felt like I was doing standup.

2524
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:59,580
It was like real when I was doing
stand up on stage with him. You know,

2525
02:25:59,590 --> 02:26:03,450
we were just riffing and talking about
shit. It's very strange. I think, um,

2526
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:07,600
the way we do it, it would
be more interesting. Like
the way we do it where it's,

2527
02:26:07,601 --> 02:26:08,371
you know, the, the,

2528
02:26:08,371 --> 02:26:12,380
the whole podcast is just some long
run on conversation with someone who's

2529
02:26:12,400 --> 02:26:15,520
interesting and you do these,
keep having guests come in. Yeah.

2530
02:26:15,550 --> 02:26:18,730
New guests and you go to the crowd to
you and you let the crowd ask questions,

2531
02:26:18,731 --> 02:26:21,760
give them a microphone. You know, Tom
Green went out to the crowd and then,

2532
02:26:21,930 --> 02:26:25,820
you know, the crowd gets to throw
questions at you and talk to Joe,

2533
02:26:26,070 --> 02:26:31,060
who are you going to allow any of
that nonsense? None of that silliness.

2534
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:34,120
Yeah. Those are the most people you
got to do that. That would be awesome.

2535
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:35,830
Not The great thing about technology fees.

2536
02:26:36,010 --> 02:26:40,100
I was playing UFC a whatever it
is undisputed. Yeah. You know,

2537
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:42,790
from just kind of knowing you
and some other stuff I've done.

2538
02:26:42,791 --> 02:26:45,970
I've know a lot of fighters and it's
funny, when I was in a tournament,

2539
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:50,350
every time I would come up against a
fighter that I know I would take a picture

2540
02:26:50,351 --> 02:26:52,060
of it and then I would tweet them.

2541
02:26:52,330 --> 02:26:54,730
So it's cool that you can
have that much interaction.

2542
02:26:54,731 --> 02:26:57,250
Now it could be playing a video game.
Oh there's frank Trigg.

2543
02:26:57,280 --> 02:26:58,450
I'm going to let Frank Trigg,

2544
02:26:58,451 --> 02:27:03,100
Nolan bought the knock them out
and then you sent him a video. Hey,

2545
02:27:03,250 --> 02:27:04,720
here's what's going to happen to you.
Hey,

2546
02:27:04,721 --> 02:27:08,560
do you think that you could set it up so
that we could try to do some sort of a

2547
02:27:08,561 --> 02:27:12,040
cyber comedy club thing? Do you
mean? If you know these Cisco people,

2548
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:15,250
great to hear is it's be someone who'd
be into doing something like that were

2549
02:27:15,251 --> 02:27:15,821
really into,

2550
02:27:15,821 --> 02:27:19,870
because the cool thing is is that they
were using me to show that it doesn't

2551
02:27:19,871 --> 02:27:24,040
have to be stuffy, but here's another
cool, well they also have the,

2552
02:27:24,041 --> 02:27:28,600
I don't know what it's called. It's some
home unit, but not the home unit. Look,

2553
02:27:28,601 --> 02:27:31,360
I'm, I'm talking about, but
you could do a home unit,

2554
02:27:31,361 --> 02:27:34,750
but I'm talking about setting it up in
a hotel somewhere where you sell tickets

2555
02:27:34,751 --> 02:27:38,140
online. The people come to
the hotel. To be honest,

2556
02:27:38,141 --> 02:27:41,860
I met so many hotels that I
forgot which one is the one that,

2557
02:27:41,861 --> 02:27:45,670
but I'm pretty sure it's like the
Marriotts or some and what you do is you

2558
02:27:45,671 --> 02:27:46,540
technically,

2559
02:27:46,810 --> 02:27:51,730
how it works for businesses is you rent
out that space and then somebody rents

2560
02:27:51,731 --> 02:27:52,680
it out. Whatever. Dude,

2561
02:27:52,681 --> 02:27:57,250
we should really sit down all we do shows
over and talk about this because this

2562
02:27:57,251 --> 02:28:00,760
could be a great way to do shows
where you don't have to travel.

2563
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:02,320
You can do shirts at Cisco.

2564
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:06,280
I know that like we could go to there
for this last one I did was hilarious.

2565
02:28:06,281 --> 02:28:10,810
Right. And when I was in New York, I
wait a minute. Stop. Where Cisco? Um,

2566
02:28:11,050 --> 02:28:14,200
off of Santa Monica.
Oh, it's in La. Oh yeah.

2567
02:28:14,570 --> 02:28:18,620
The one of the buildings
I've done in front. So they
have like a studio there. Uh,

2568
02:28:18,630 --> 02:28:21,010
it's, it's, it's like huge.

2569
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:23,960
Imagine 500 cubicles for people to work,

2570
02:28:23,961 --> 02:28:27,320
but nobody works there because
everybody works at home.

2571
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:31,090
It's like their craziest place. You
walk in, they all work at home. Yes.

2572
02:28:31,091 --> 02:28:34,370
So it's all these empty desks,
but it's a huge office building.

2573
02:28:34,610 --> 02:28:37,620
And then they have a big conference room
with this technology set up in there.

2574
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:37,820
Like,

2575
02:28:37,820 --> 02:28:41,180
so they all use this video conferencing
technology that no one goes to work.

2576
02:28:41,181 --> 02:28:44,180
Yeah, no, nobody. So when
I went there to secretary,

2577
02:28:44,181 --> 02:28:47,120
let me in and I'm a pretty fucking dope.
Yeah.

2578
02:28:47,121 --> 02:28:50,270
And I was about to go to do my thing.
Last time I did it,

2579
02:28:50,271 --> 02:28:54,110
there were 30 people in the room with me.
Right. So there was some energy there.

2580
02:28:54,140 --> 02:28:57,920
Right. This time I show up on myself.
I'm like, oh, there's going to be,

2581
02:28:58,300 --> 02:29:01,760
there's nobody, right? One
guy shows up, am your liaison.

2582
02:29:01,970 --> 02:29:03,890
So then we walked around the cubicles.

2583
02:29:03,950 --> 02:29:07,250
I went to two guys I didn't know
that are working and go, hey dude,

2584
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:09,140
I got to go in there and do stand up.

2585
02:29:09,170 --> 02:29:12,050
You need to come in there with
me so I'm not the only one.

2586
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:16,160
You need to sit next to me.
And when I'm doing my material or talking,

2587
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:19,400
smile and laugh the entire like,
I don't even know this guy.

2588
02:29:19,460 --> 02:29:23,810
You waited in the waiting room so dull.
So you, you went and grabbed people.

2589
02:29:23,811 --> 02:29:28,100
I'd rather two guys and said go need
to know. Not only did you grab them,

2590
02:29:28,101 --> 02:29:31,720
you instructed them on how to enjoy our
a diva, John. Yeah. You're a dealer.

2591
02:29:31,730 --> 02:29:34,430
God Damn it. Well no, because
now it's about the thing,

2592
02:29:34,431 --> 02:29:38,240
cause I didn't want to be there and then
have this guy sitting next to me just

2593
02:29:38,241 --> 02:29:40,790
stare at him and he's not getting paid.
You're the one getting paid. Did it?

2594
02:29:40,791 --> 02:29:45,020
And it was like a cool kind of
would be hated your comedy. Yes,

2595
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:48,050
well that would suck. But there was a,
two of the coolest guy podcast is like,

2596
02:29:48,051 --> 02:29:52,550
we're doing this and for me there's a
1086 people tuned in right now while we're

2597
02:29:52,551 --> 02:29:54,290
doing this.
You're doing the same thing.

2598
02:29:54,291 --> 02:29:57,380
You're doing standup for a thousand
people right now. Yeah, it's the same.

2599
02:29:57,780 --> 02:30:02,690
It was just cool. Let's go. But it
was weird. It reminds me when I was,

2600
02:30:03,070 --> 02:30:05,240
uh,
doing a lot of colleges performing,

2601
02:30:05,241 --> 02:30:09,770
you'd have to do these noon teasers
where you'd go in at noon and the,

2602
02:30:09,771 --> 02:30:13,740
in the student union, what, you
never had to do these, so I,

2603
02:30:13,790 --> 02:30:17,270
you'd have to go in. They would make
you go. So you and Brian are studying.

2604
02:30:17,300 --> 02:30:21,140
I would have to go up and go, hey guys,
this is, keep my no TV credits though.

2605
02:30:21,140 --> 02:30:24,990
Nothing. Stop it. I would go, hey
everybody, I'm John Hepburn on the comic.

2606
02:30:24,991 --> 02:30:29,060
He'll be in you. I'll be in the
Rathskeller, uh, tonight at eight. Go.

2607
02:30:29,061 --> 02:30:30,110
And you'd have to do,

2608
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:34,370
you'd go around to the tables and this
was part of your contract did to get

2609
02:30:34,371 --> 02:30:37,190
people to show up at
the show at nighttime.

2610
02:30:37,191 --> 02:30:41,420
Stop that 100% I would do that constantly.
Oh my God,

2611
02:30:41,421 --> 02:30:42,260
I've never heard of them.

2612
02:30:42,261 --> 02:30:46,220
This was back in the day when I was in
my early twenties I would do 80 to 100

2613
02:30:46,221 --> 02:30:48,770
colleges a year.
Oh my God.

2614
02:30:49,700 --> 02:30:54,530
This is pre or post any amount of duty.
This is a pre radio. So keep in mind,

2615
02:30:54,531 --> 02:30:56,910
I'm 21 concussion to blame. No, no,

2616
02:30:57,090 --> 02:30:59,570
2122 so now it's funny.

2617
02:30:59,571 --> 02:31:03,470
20 some years later and $8 billion
more for the show that I'm doing.

2618
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:07,640
I'm going around to random people going,
hey guys, I'm going to be in this room.

2619
02:31:07,641 --> 02:31:12,260
Can you come in? It's so funny how it
goes in full circle and it's the same,

2620
02:31:12,261 --> 02:31:15,650
but you're getting paid way more.
That's hilarious.

2621
02:31:15,770 --> 02:31:20,770
I really think that that could be
a unique thing like [inaudible]

2622
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:23,940
those guys are doing would be a
real business, a cyber comedy. Well,

2623
02:31:23,941 --> 02:31:26,040
here's what I thought that
Simon and a strip club,

2624
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:30,810
so imagine going into a room gone. I
was turned it. Bell came anyway. So, um,

2625
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:33,990
I'd like to see a girl in Bangkok and
then Bam, you're in Bangkok. Well,

2626
02:31:33,991 --> 02:31:36,330
I guess you could do that, but there's
a lot of videos out there, dude.

2627
02:31:37,130 --> 02:31:40,770
You are talking to them telling Webcam
show there's Webcam shows and get them

2628
02:31:40,771 --> 02:31:44,970
set up so we can do it. Well let's do
it. Let's do a comedy club. I think, um,

2629
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:49,750
if we could set it up with a few hotels
in a few different cities, you know,

2630
02:31:49,751 --> 02:31:53,910
and banging out like fight only if it's
online. Yeah. Cause he just need holds.

2631
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:57,150
It's like Nita certain promoter in
each individual town and make sure that

2632
02:31:57,151 --> 02:32:01,130
there's seating and then they have
alcohol or whatever they have at the,

2633
02:32:01,131 --> 02:32:04,140
at the show. Because you do it at
the hotel. There's a hotel bar.

2634
02:32:04,760 --> 02:32:07,300
They can have some or don't come in.
Yeah.

2635
02:32:07,890 --> 02:32:11,850
And then they showed his wait staff there
and have it take a cyber comedy club.

2636
02:32:12,200 --> 02:32:14,880
We can, this is a great
idea, dude. I've done it.

2637
02:32:14,881 --> 02:32:18,250
And have I brought your video to see
him? Oh, well we use the video. Yeah,

2638
02:32:18,251 --> 02:32:22,240
you can't. Um, but dude, it's fun.
People are people and it, right.

2639
02:32:22,250 --> 02:32:24,210
But you're doing it all
through the corporate network,

2640
02:32:24,211 --> 02:32:25,740
whereas you have to be
super squeaky clean.

2641
02:32:25,950 --> 02:32:30,060
What I would want to do is use them and
like maybe like get them to have it just

2642
02:32:30,061 --> 02:32:33,060
be a, yeah. It's just whatever
you feel like talking about. Yeah.

2643
02:32:33,061 --> 02:32:34,620
I don't want to have to
worry about being clean.

2644
02:32:34,621 --> 02:32:37,690
I don't wanna have to worry about that.
Well, we can't use your technology. Yeah,

2645
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:38,550
yeah. No, this is,

2646
02:32:38,551 --> 02:32:42,510
you're using our technology and they
don't rent it out to whoever wants it.

2647
02:32:42,511 --> 02:32:46,800
You could be talking about anything.
We need to talk to them. We'll do it.

2648
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:50,430
Something has come out of this podcast,
ladies and gentlemen, birth an idea.

2649
02:32:50,790 --> 02:32:54,510
Make sure you're getting bad fruits.
We do not know. We cannot know,

2650
02:32:54,511 --> 02:32:55,680
but that's one of the
beautiful things in life.

2651
02:32:55,681 --> 02:32:58,890
Sometimes just you have ideas
and those ideas create something.

2652
02:32:58,891 --> 02:33:02,100
Cause the imagination
manifest things in real life.

2653
02:33:02,101 --> 02:33:04,500
The imagination seems
like a frivolous thing,

2654
02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:09,300
but without it we would have nothing.
It is a real thing. It's a force.

2655
02:33:09,301 --> 02:33:13,500
It's a force that makes ideas
appear through the work of man.

2656
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:14,821
I tell you this,

2657
02:33:14,821 --> 02:33:17,940
you look around whoever you're
watching this look around your room,

2669
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:59,250
Thousand 400 [inaudible] and I did
that thing where I follow everybody who

2670
02:33:59,251 --> 02:34:01,740
followed me and then they die.
How bad did that get?

2671
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:05,260
It have to make a lot of lists, so
I, you know what I mean? I had a,

2672
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:08,130
I had to start block.
I had to start a unfollowing people.

2673
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:11,880
I have a few dummies that say
interesting shit cause they're so stupid.

2674
02:34:12,150 --> 02:34:17,050
But I was, I was falling
way too many hoes. God.

2675

Stay strong.

2679
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:37,240
There will be peaks and valleys.
They will be ripples in ways,

2680
02:34:37,241 --> 02:34:41,020
but you've got to maintain
your own personal balance.

2681
02:34:41,830 --> 02:34:46,300
That's my, that's my word to

2689
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:18,540

homosexual for makes you say that
