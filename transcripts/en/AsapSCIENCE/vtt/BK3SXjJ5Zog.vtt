00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.081
As the saying goes ‘It’s not the size
that counts, it’s how you use it’ - but

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:08.851
does this long standing phrase ring true in
the hugely debated topic of penis size? Does

00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:12.650
your member actually make a difference in
attractiveness or ability to pleasure your

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.650
partner?

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.820
Interestingly, humans have the largest penis
of any primate, both in absolute size and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.430
relative to body proportion...so you can be
proud of that! Through our evolutionary history,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.591
females likely developed an interest and preference
for penis shape and size - much like how female

00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:30.369
peacocks have a preference for a male with
stunning feathers. As a result, they chose

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.360
mates with larger penises, ultimately passing
on those genes. This is know as sexual selection.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.040
It also may have been an advantage for males,
as a longer penis is more efficient at removing

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.280
the sperm of rival males during intercourse.
The longer your depth of thrust, the better

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.470
semen displacement, ensuring your genes get
passed on.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.580
One particular study found that some women
experience more frequent vaginal orgasms with

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.780
longer penises, suggesting that it may be
able to stimulate the entire length of the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.050
vagina and the cervix. However, it’s important
to note that women experience different types

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.920
of orgasms; in fact, vaginal and clitoral
orgasms may be completely separate phenomena

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.530
- they use different nerves, and even stimulate
different areas of the brain. Even the coveted

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.520
“G-Spot”, another sexually sensitive area
in women, is located only ⅓ of the way into

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.259
the vagina. Apart from this, many surveys
of women have found that they’re not nearly

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.869
as concerned with size, as men might think,
and preferences vary. However, studies on

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.869
homosexual men have shown that they regard
a larger penis as ideal.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.719
Another study in 2013 actually found that
flaccid penis size may also be a major factor

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.719
in male attractiveness - even before sexual
contact. Which may seem odd considering we

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.750
wear clothes nowadays; but for our ancestors,
the genitals would have been visible. In the

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.689
study, women were asked to rank the attractiveness
of males based on computer generated images

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.030
reflecting different body types and penis
sizes. From this, it was clear that not only

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.680
were taller and more fit men much more desirable,
but flaccid penis size played a role in their

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.479
perceived attractiveness too. The larger the
penis, the higher they were rated. But there

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.280
was a limit - a flaccid penis larger than
about 7.6 cm and attractiveness began to diminish.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.540
It would seem a penis in proportion may be
most desirable. After all, over exaggerated

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.030
traits - even those related to attractiveness
- can often be a sign of problems.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.720
And it turns out that the person attached
to the penis makes a difference too - with

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.280
most all studies showing confidence, enjoyable
personality, and attraction being the best

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.670
predictor of sexual satisfaction. Ultimately,
while size does seem to matter in some ways,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.750
bigger isn’t always better!

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.140

penis. We break down some of the craziest
