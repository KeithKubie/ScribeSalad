00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.780
To get a better intuition for
the price elasticity of demand,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.180
I thought I would take a look at
some of the more extreme cases

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.800
and think about what types
of elasticities of demand

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.920
we would see.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.820
So this right over here
is a vial of insulin.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.390
Many diabetics, not all
diabetics, but many diabetics

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.750
need to take insulin daily.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.331
They need to inject it in order
to maintain their blood sugar

00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:22.830
level.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.650
If they don't do it, bad things
will happen to their body.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.630
And they might even
prematurely die

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.330
if they don't take
their insulin on time.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.170
So let's think about what
the elasticity of demand

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.430
might look like for
something like insulin.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.540
So in one column,
I'll put price.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.610
And in the other column,
I will put quantity.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.520
So let's say that
insulation right now

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.100
is going for $5 a vial.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.320
And we have a group of
diabetics who need insulin.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.670
And they're all going to
buy the insulin they need.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.200
And let's say, in
this group, that

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.870
turns out to be
100 vials per week.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.370
So this is in vials per week.

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.840
Fair enough, that's
exactly what they

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.236
need to do to maintain
their insulin.

00:01:06.236 --> 00:01:07.860
Now, what happens if
the price changes?

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.010
What happens if the
price were to go down?

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.160
Let's say the price
were to go down to $1.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.070
Well, what would
the quantity be?

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.779
Well, they're not going
to buy any more insulin.

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:19.820
They're going to buy just
what they need in order

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.379
to maintain their diabetes.

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:23.170
And remember, we're
holding all else equal.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.020
We're not assuming any change
in expectations of price.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.960
They expect price go
up or down or anything

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.620
like that So in
this case, they'll

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.580
still just by 100 vials.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.514
Now, what happens if
the price went up a ton?

00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:35.930
And what happens
if the price went

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.580
to-- what happens if
we went to $100 a vial.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.460
Well, it would be hard for them.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.802
But they need it to survive.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.760
So it's going to squeeze
out any other expenses

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.320
that they need to
spend money on.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.390
And so they still will
buy 100 vials a week.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.920
And so you could keep
raising price, within reason.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.720
And they would still
buy the same quantity.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.770
Obviously, if you
raise it to $1 billion,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.895
then they would just wouldn't
be able to afford it.

00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:02.210
But within reason, they're
going to buy 100 vials per week,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.340
no matter what the price is.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.630
So this is an example
of perfect inelasticity.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.550
Another way, so if you think
of the physical analogy

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.430
that we talked about
with elasticity.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.360
It's like a brick.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.430
It doesn't matter how much,
within reason once again,

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.240
any amount of force
pulling or pushing

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.730
that a human could
put on a brick,

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.771
it's not going to change.

00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:30.870
It's not going to deform
the brick in any way.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.070
And likewise, any change
in price within reason,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.570
within reason here,
isn't going to change

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.700
the demand in any way.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.740
It's perfectly inelastic.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.690
And if you want to
do the computation,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.960
you could look at inelas-- you
could figure out the demand

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.670
elasticity for, let's
say, when you're

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.260
going from a price of $5 to $1.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.550
So the price went down by 4.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.070
And the quantity changed by 0.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.380
So your percent
change in quantity,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:09.230
so delta percent-- I'll write
it-- percent change in quantity

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.710
is equal to 0.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.120
And then, your percent is
going to be over your percent

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.880
change in price if you
use the averaging method.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.019
It was-- it would be going down
by 4 over an average of 250.

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.310
It'll be a fairly large number.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.520
But at 0 over anything
is still going to be 0.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.850
So it doesn't matter what
that thing is over here.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.570
Your elasticity of demand
in this situation is 0.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.180
And if you wanted to see
what this demand curve would

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.770
look like, let's plot it.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.850
So this right over
here is my price axis.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.560
And that is my quantity axis.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.480
And so no matter
what, let's say this

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.130
is a quantity of 100
of vials per week.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.970
That's true when
the price is $5.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.680
So that's true in the prices $5.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.420
They're going to demand
100 vials a week.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.600
That's true when
the price is $1.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.990
They're going to demand
100 vials a week.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.300
And that's true, if the price
is $20 or $100 or whatever.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.590
They're going to demand
100 vials a week.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.750
And so a perfectly
inelastic demand curve

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.230
would look like this.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.149
It is a vertical line.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.550
It doesn't matter
what price you pick.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.010
The quantity demanded
is always going

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.640
to be the exact same thing.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.670
Now, let's go to
another extreme.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.670
So this is perfectly inelastic.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.430
You can imagine.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.200
Well, what is perfectly elastic.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.670
Something that changes a lot
if you have a small percentage

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.707
change in price.

00:04:39.707 --> 00:04:42.040
And to think about that, let's
look at these two vending

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.550
machines.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.410
And you see that they
both do sell cans of Coke.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.900
That's a can of Coke there.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.350
That is can of Coke there.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.800
And let's say, starting
off, the can of Coke,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.120
let's say that they cost
$1 in each vending machine.

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.390
And we're going to assume
that this one, remember

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.350
all else equal.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.630
So we're going to assume
that this vending machine

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.140
right over here doesn't change.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.840
Does not change.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.480
So it's just going to
be consistently charging

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.475
$1 for a can of Coke.

00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:16.100
And they're sitting
next to each other.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.650
And it looks like they have
a little coffee machine

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.270
in between right over here.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.250
So let's think about
the demand curve

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.980
for this, for Coca Cola
in this vending machine

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.090
right over here.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.090
So let's think about the
price and the quantity.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.620
So I'll do-- let me do price
column and quantity demanded.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.990
So let's say if the price is $1.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.860
So if the price is $1,
then just odds are,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.240
it's going to get about
half of the sales per week.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.050
And let's say that ends
up being, I don't know,

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.100
let's say that ends
up being 100 cans.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.480
This is in cans per week.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.354
Now what happens?

00:05:58.354 --> 00:05:59.770
And let me put
some decimals here.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.289
So this is $1.00.

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.080
The price is $1.00.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.420
It sells 100 cans per week.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.961
And probably this
one also would also

00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:06.520
sell about 100 cans per week.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.310
Now, what happens if we have
a very, very small change

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.870
in price.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.770
So if we change, if we go
from $1.00, instead of $1.00,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.890
we are at $0.99.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.470
What's going to happen?

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.810
So this, remember, this
machine right over here

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:25.600
is not changing.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.970
This is-- we're talking--
our demand curve is

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.420
for the quantity of Cokes
sold from this machine.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.750
And the price was
for this machine.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.340
So if this machine is
even a penny cheaper.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.780
And assuming that people,
there aren't lines forming

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.630
and things like
that, people are just

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.274
always going to go
to this machine.

00:06:41.274 --> 00:06:43.190
If it's easy enough, if
there's no difference,

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.981
they're always going
to go to this machine.

00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:48.090
So this machine will be able to
get, will sell all the Cokes.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.956
So it's going to sell 200 Cokes.

00:06:51.956 --> 00:06:54.580
Now, what happens if, instead of
lowering the price by a penny,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.140
you raise the price by a penny.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.267
So instead of $1.00,
your at $1.01.

00:06:59.267 --> 00:07:01.850
Well, now everyone's going to
go to the other vending machine.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.933
They're going to say, oh,
we don't-- even a penny,

00:07:03.933 --> 00:07:05.610
might as well walk to this one.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.510
Assuming everything
else is equal.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.300
So then, they're
going to sell 0.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.540
And so what would the
demand curve look like here.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.555
Let's plot it out.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.440
So this is the price.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.200
This right over, this axis
right over here is quantity.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.180
And this is in cans per week.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.960
And so this is 0.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.690
This is 100.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.510
And then, this is 200.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.040
And then this is a price of $1.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.570
That's $1.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.290
So at $1, the quantity
demanded is 100 cans.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.380
Fair enough.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.650
Now, at $0.99, the quantity
demanded is 200 cans.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.090
So at $0.99, the
quantity demanded is 200.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.910
So $0.99 is right
below that, it's 200.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.670
So it's right over there.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.470
It's like right, right,
there's a little bit lower.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.180
And $1.01 a little
bit over here,

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.710
the quantity demanded is 0.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:13.060
So the demand curve here is
looks something like that.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.740
So it's going to be
almost horizontal.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.950
So it's going to be approaching
perfect elasticity, very

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.520
small changes in price end
up with these huge changes,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.110
huge changes in percent
quantity demanded.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.590
And I courage to work
out the math to see here,

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.905
that you will get a very
large number for elasticity.

00:08:32.905 --> 00:08:34.280
And so something
that is, this is

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.039
approaching perfect elasticity.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.059
A truly perfect
elasticity would be

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:43.140
something that is
a horizontal line.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.280
So in this case, so over here,
our elasticity of demand--

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.220
and I'll talk about the
absolute value of it, is 0.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.450
And over here,
the absolute value

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.700
of our elasticity of
demand is infinity.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.450
'50 Because, remember, it's
percent change in quantity

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.050
over percent change in price.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.070
When you go from either,
from one scenario to another

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.030
over here, you're percent
change in price is very small.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.450
It's roughly about 1% in this
scenario right over here.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.260
Changing the price
up or down about 1%.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.710
But then, you see your
quantity is changing, depending

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.876
on which one you're looking.

00:09:15.876 --> 00:09:19.380
Your quantity is changing
on the order of 50% to 100%,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.050
from that 1% change in price.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.976
So you have a huge
elasticity of demand here.

00:09:22.976 --> 00:09:25.100
It would be a real-- it
would actually be a number.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.640
But as you can imagine, as
it becomes more and more

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.290
sensitive, as quantity
demanded becomes

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.060
more and more sensitive to
a percent change in price,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.040
this curve is going to
flatten out completely.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.720
And you will have an
infinite, absolute value

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.480
of your elasticity of demand.
