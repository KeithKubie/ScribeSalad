THIS STORY WILL BE

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.221
[mumbles]

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.656
- [laughs]

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:26.894
- I'M GONNA TELL YOU A STORY
ABOUT GENERAL VON STEUBEN.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:28.629
IT'S THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:31.965
WASHINGTON TROOPS
ARE FREEZING TO DEATH.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.301
THEY SAID, WASHINGTON, YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.470
EVERYBODY AROUND US IS DYING.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.171
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO EAT.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.506
THEY ARE FREEZING COLD.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:40.974
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:45.712
WASHINGTON SAYS, I'M GONNA TALK
TO MY BUDDY BEN FRANKLIN.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:46.713
'CAUSE I DON'T EVEN KNOW,

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.649
BUT FRANKLIN WAS
JUST PARTYING IN PARIS.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.883
IT'S VERY WEIRD.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:53.654
FRANKLIN LEARNS
OF THIS PRUSSIAN WAR GENERAL--

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:54.688
VON STEUBEN.

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:57.224
HE WAS TRAINED
BY THE KING OF PRUSSIA.

00:00:57.224 --> 00:01:00.027
BEN FRANKLIN SAYS,
HEY, VON STEUBEN,

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:04.264
WHY DON'T YOU
COME TO CALIFORNIA?

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.767
NAH. NO.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:10.070
BEN FRANKLIN SAYS,
WHY DON'T YOU COME TO AMERICA

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.505
AND FIGHT FOR US?

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:15.175
AND VON STEUBEN'S LIKE, LOOK,
I ALREADY GOT KICKED OUT

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.878
OF PRUSSIA FOR BEING GAY.

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.180
I'M OKAY HERE IN PARIS.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.249
IT'S OKAY TO BE GAY IN PARIS.

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.652
AND PARIS IS LIKE,
NOT OKAY TO BE GAY IN PARIS.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.087
WE'RE ABOUT TO KICK YOU OUT.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:30.624
AND VON STEUBEN SAYS,
CHECK, PLEASE.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:34.528
- [laughs]

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:37.864
SO VON STEUBEN
SHOWS UP WITH COOKS

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.099
AND BUTLERS.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.567
HE'S DRESSED TO THE NINES.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.135
HE'S WEARING FURS.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.938
HE'S GOT A DOG,
AND HE SAYS,

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.841
HEY, I'M VON STEUBEN.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:51.878
HE LOOKS AT ALL OF
GENERAL WASHINGTON'S SOLDIERS,

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:56.216
AND HE SAYS,
LOOK AT THIS GROUP OF DOGS.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.351
THEY'RE DYING.

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:58.452
THEY'RE STARVING.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:01.588
THEY HAVE NO AMMUNITION,
NO LOVE.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:03.790
THE SOLDIERS ARE LIKE,
I DON'T LIKE THIS GUY.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.858
GEORGE WASHINGTON SAYS,
NO, NO.

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:05.892
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.127
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.228
AND VON STEUBEN'S LIKE,

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:11.298
I AM GONNA WHIP YOU GUYS
INTO SHAPE.

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.066
NEW COACH IS IN TOWN.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.535
VON STEUBEN STARTS
TRAINING THE SOLDIERS,

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:16.903
RUNNING THEM THROUGH THE RANKS.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:19.039
HE'S STRETCHING THEM
THROUGH THE STRETCHERS.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.207
HE'S YELLING AT THEM
IN PRUSSIAN.

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:21.708
AND THEY GO,
WHAT'S HE SAYING?

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.645
WASHINGTON IS LIKE, OH, BOY.

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.113
THE GUY DOESN'T
EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH,

00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:27.748
SO HE SAYS,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:28.782
BLAH, BLAH.

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:30.217
AND THEY HEAR,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:31.385
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.520
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.654
BUT GUESS WHAT.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:38.425
A YOUNG CAPTAIN SHOWS UP--
BEN WALKER.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.927
HE SAYS, I CAN UNDERSTAND
ALL THE BLAH-BLAH-BLAHS.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.230
I SPEAK PRUSSIAN,
AND I CAN HELP THE AMERICANS

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.431
UNDERSTAND HIM.

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:48.235
VON STEUBEN TURNS OVER
HIS SHOULDER AND SEES...

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:51.238
THE MOST HANDSOME AMERICAN
HE'S SEEN SO FAR.

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:54.775
STEUBEN'S INTO BLONDES
AND THIS GUY IS PLATINUM BLONDE.

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:57.711
BEAUTIFUL CHEEKBONES,
PUFFY LIPS.

00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:01.448
BENJAMIN WALKER SAYS,
I WILL BE YOUR GUIDE,

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:04.351
AND, UH, THEY BECOME BUDS.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.420
BUDS.
- [laughs]

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.321
THEY HAVE THIS--THIS--

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.957
THIS TRAINING MONTAGE.

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:12.559
[Survivor's Eye of the Tiger]

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:16.296
SO BENJAMIN WALKER ENDS UP
BEING EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEEDED.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.798
HE HELPS THEM WITH THE TROOPS.

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:19.733
VON STEUBEN
STARTS TEACHING THEM THINGS.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.835
HE'S LIKE, THESE ARE KNIVES.

00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:23.503
YOU CAN USE THEM
TO STAB PEOPLE.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:26.039
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
OH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.375
HE TEACHES THEM
HOW TO CLEAN THEIR TEETH.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.010
TEACHES THEM
HOW TO CLEAN THEIR BODIES

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.478
SO THEY DON'T GET DISEASE.

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:33.580
PEOPLE WERE LIKE, WE'RE JUST
TRYING TO WIN A WAR, MAN.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.083
AND HE WAS LIKE,
THIS IS HOW YOU WIN A WAR.

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:37.984
- ♪ IT'S THE EYE
OF THE TIGER ♪

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.986
- THEY START TRAINING HARDER,
AND THEN HE SAYS,

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.155
BEN WALKER, YELL AT THEM
IN ENGLISH,

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.524
AND THAT GUY SAYS,
MORE SQUATS.

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.093
MORE SQUATS, COME ON!

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:48.762
HE LITERALLY CHURN--
HE CHURNED--

00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:52.265
HE CHURNED THE ARMY
INTO BUTTER.

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.101
- DO YOU KNOW
ANY DRINKING GAMES?

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.602
- OH, YEAH.

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:56.970
- I WAS JUST THINKING,
IS THERE ANY WAY

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.238
WE COULD TAKE THIS SHOT?

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.639
OH, WHAT'S THAT?

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.508
- YOU GOT TO DRINK.

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:03.143
- WAIT.

00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:04.177
- SO...

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:07.047
IT'S THE BATTLE OF SPRINGTIME.

00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:08.982
NO, IT'S BATTLE HILL.

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.718
NO, IT'S
THE BATTLE OF BARREN HILL.

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:15.789
THESE TERRIFIED KIDS
ARE JUST CRUSHING IT.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.059
HIS TROOPS START BEATING
BATTLE AFTER BATTLE,

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.828
USING THE TACTICS
OF VON STEUBEN.

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.230
THEY USE THEIR BAYONETS.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.835
THEY HAD ALL CLEAN TEETH,
AND THEY WON THE WAR.

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:30.937
WASHINGTON SAID,
VON STEUBEN,

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.007
YOU CAN LIVE WITH WASHINGTON--

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:37.043
I'M SORRY.

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:38.979
- BEN WALKER.

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:45.185
- WASHINGTON SAID,
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A HOUSE

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:48.455
TO LIVE IN, AND I WANT YOU
TO LIVE WITH THAT GUY,

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:52.192
BEN WA--BEN WA--THAT GUY.

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:56.463
I WILL GRANT YOU
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LOVE EVER.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:05:01.001
SO THE ARMY USED VON STEUBEN'S
TACTICS FOR 100 YEARS.

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.270
THEY CALLED IT
THE BLUE--THE BLUE BOOK.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.772
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE SAFE.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:09.776
SO VON STEUBEN SAVED THE WORLD.

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.814
- THIS STORY'S LIKE THAT MOVIE
 RENAISSANCE MAN.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.884
REMEMBER WHEN DANNY DEVITO CAME
AS THE POETRY TEACHER?

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:20.020
- NO.
NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.621
IT'S MORE LIKE THE, UH--

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:25.425
THE GUYS

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:26.426
- OKAY.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.028
- ISN'T THAT--

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:29.262
- ISN'T THAT--
- MIGHTY DUCKS.

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:31.865
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:34.768
IT'S MORE LIKE THE
WORLD MIGHTY CUPS.

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:36.303
- THE MIGHTY CUPS.
- MIGHTY CUPS.
00:05:36.303,00:00:00.000
- YEAH.
