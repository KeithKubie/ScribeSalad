much worse it seems kind of quaint
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.899
much worse it seems kind of quaint
almost in retrospect I think at one

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
almost in retrospect I think at one
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.630
almost in retrospect I think at one
point I had said he begins to undermine

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
point I had said he begins to undermine
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.859

the press and I think no he's just like

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869
the press and I think no he's just like
 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.149
the press and I think no he's just like
everyday

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159
everyday
 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.100
everyday
so the undermining is definitely

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
so the undermining is definitely
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.500
so the undermining is definitely
escalated look he's over

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510
 
 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.160
