00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:01.525
- [Voiceover] So, we have
three functions here.

00:00:01.525 --> 00:00:02.791
What I want to do together

00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:04.010
is think about whether each of

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.260
these functions are even or odd.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.443
And just as a little bit of a reminder,

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:11.788
for an even function, if you were

00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:14.748
to input -x into the function,

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:17.163
it's the same thing as inputing x.

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:20.680
At f(-x) is the same thing as f(x).

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.561
For an odd function,

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:26.125
if you input -x into the function

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.065
That's going to be the same thing

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:31.987
as a negative of inputting
x into the function.

00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:33.845
And then, if it's neither, well then

00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:36.225
neither one of these are going to be true.

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:37.803
So let's test this.

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:39.742
So let's first look at h(x).

00:00:39.742 --> 00:00:41.042
And like always, pause the video

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:45.407
and see if you can work
through this before I do.

00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:46.800
So, let's just see what happens

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.283
if I try to evaluate h(-x).

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:54.346
So it's going to be -10 times -x

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:59.346
to the 11th power plus
-x to the ninth power

00:01:00.638 --> 00:01:05.638
minus -x to the third
power plus seven times -x.

00:01:07.743 --> 00:01:10.355
Well, what is that going to be equal to?

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:14.697
Well, -x to the 11th power is going to be

00:01:14.697 --> 00:01:19.697
equal to the negative
of x to the 11th power.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.473
Because we have an odd
exponent right over here.

00:01:23.473 --> 00:01:25.714
Let me just restate what I just said.

00:01:25.714 --> 00:01:30.714
So negative, let me just, -x to the third,

00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:36.681
that's the same thing as the
negative of x to the third.

00:01:38.193 --> 00:01:41.374
We know it's going to
give you a negative value.

00:01:41.374 --> 00:01:46.157
Similarly, -x to the
seventh is going to be

00:01:46.157 --> 00:01:48.351
equal to the negative of x to the seventh.

00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:50.035
Try it out with some number here.

00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:53.540
If this was -1, -1 to the seventh power

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.340
is the same thing as negative times

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.615
one to the seventh power.

00:01:57.615 --> 00:02:01.690
So, let me write that over here.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.499
So this is going to be
-x to the 11th power.

00:02:08.547 --> 00:02:11.821
This is going to be -x to the ninth power.

00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:12.843
And here, while I'm writing this one,

00:02:12.843 --> 00:02:13.969
we're gonna do the exponents first

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.942
and then put a negative in front of it.

00:02:15.942 --> 00:02:20.942
This is going to be negative
of x to the third power,

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:24.127
and well this is just -x, so if you have

00:02:24.127 --> 00:02:27.423
- 10 times the negative of x to the 11th,

00:02:27.423 --> 00:02:30.326
negative times a negative
is going to be a positive.

00:02:30.326 --> 00:02:32.648
So this is going to be positive 10x

00:02:32.648 --> 00:02:37.495
to the 11th power, and then
minus x to the ninth power,

00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:40.809
minus x to the ninth power, and then

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:43.781
you subtract a -x to the third,

00:02:43.781 --> 00:02:47.565
so that's going to be a
positive x to the third,

00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:50.776
and then this is going
to be minus seven x.

00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:52.599
And notice, what we have right over here

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.224
is similar to what we have up here

00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:56.186
except all the signs are different.

00:02:56.186 --> 00:02:57.417
So this is the same thing as if I

00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:59.483
had took a negative and I multiplied

00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:03.836
it by h(x), so this is negative h(x).

00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:05.055
If I took each of these
and I multiplied them

00:03:05.055 --> 00:03:07.040
by a negative one, then I got what

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.084
I just got here, which is h(-x).

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:11.963
So we just saw that h(-x) is equal

00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:16.339
to negative h(x), and so we know

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:20.553
that this is an odd function.

00:03:20.553 --> 00:03:22.318
And one telltale signature for it

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:24.918
is it's made up of a
bunch of odd functions.

00:03:24.918 --> 00:03:27.298
We have an odd exponent over here.

00:03:27.298 --> 00:03:29.341
This is an odd, this is going to be an odd

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:30.839
function if it was by itself.

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:32.534
This is an odd function
if it was by itself.

00:03:32.534 --> 00:03:34.438
This is an odd function
if it was by itself.

00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:36.121
And so is that an odd function by itself.

00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:37.456
So if you add up a bunch of odd functions,

00:03:37.456 --> 00:03:40.103
you're going to get an odd function.

00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:43.934
All of these have odd exponents on them,

00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:46.232
which make them odd functions.

00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:49.332
So let's think about the
f(x) right over here.

00:03:49.332 --> 00:03:54.332
So, f(-x), well negative seven, well -x

00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:56.843
to the sixth power, you multiply

00:03:56.843 --> 00:04:00.117
a negative six times, it's
going to be a positive.

00:04:00.117 --> 00:04:02.172
So that's just going to be negative

00:04:02.172 --> 00:04:04.540
seven x to the sixth, and then plus three.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.537
Well negative x to the fourth power,

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.440
I don't wanna skip a step here,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.772
so this is negative x to the sixth power

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:16.772
plus three times negative
x to the fourth power

00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:23.283
minus nine times negative x squared.

00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:26.237
And then we have plus eight.

00:04:26.237 --> 00:04:28.153
Well, a negative number to the

00:04:28.153 --> 00:04:31.217
sixth power is going to
now be a positive number.

00:04:31.217 --> 00:04:32.309
So this is going to be equal to

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:37.309
negative seven times the
same thing as x to the sixth.

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:38.914
Plus, well, negative x to the fourth

00:04:38.914 --> 00:04:40.435
is same thing as x to the fourth,

00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:41.874
the negatives all cancel out, so you're

00:04:41.874 --> 00:04:43.848
gonna have three x to the fourth,

00:04:43.848 --> 00:04:46.112
then minus, negative x squared

00:04:46.112 --> 00:04:47.191
is the same thing as x squared,

00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:48.155
negative three squared is the same

00:04:48.155 --> 00:04:50.581
thing as three squared,
just giving an example.

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:52.868
So it's going to be
negative nine x squared,

00:04:52.868 --> 00:04:54.145
the negatives here cancel out, plus eight.

00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:57.071
Well notice, this is
the same thing as f(x).

00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:02.071
So we have f(-x) is equal to f(x).

00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:05.313
So f(x) is even.

00:05:05.313 --> 00:05:06.648
And once again, this should not

00:05:06.648 --> 00:05:08.250
be a surprise, 'cause it's made

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.406
up of a bunch of even
functions all added together.

00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:13.544
Each of these are symmetric about

00:05:13.544 --> 00:05:16.191
the y-axis, so you add 'em all together,

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:17.711
you're going to get an even function.

00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:19.128
It's made up of a bunch of terms

00:05:19.128 --> 00:05:21.914
that all have even degrees.

00:05:21.914 --> 00:05:23.005
So it's the sixth degree, fourth degree,

00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:24.166
second degree; you could view this

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:28.125
as a zero'th degree right over there.

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:30.133
Now let's think about g(x).

00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:31.584
G(x) buried in here.

00:05:31.584 --> 00:05:32.989
And you might just be able to look

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:34.103
at it, and say, "Okay, look, this is

00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:36.112
"an even function there, this is an

00:05:36.112 --> 00:05:40.047
"even function, but
this is an odd function,

00:05:40.047 --> 00:05:41.243
"and this is an odd function."

00:05:41.243 --> 00:05:44.203
Has a third degree term,
and a first degree term.

00:05:44.203 --> 00:05:46.107
So it's a mixture of
even and odd functions,

00:05:46.107 --> 00:05:50.089
so this is gonna be neither even nor odd.

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:51.923
And you could test that out.

00:05:51.923 --> 00:05:55.951
We can look at g(-x) is going to be

00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:57.867
equal to, well -x to the fourth

00:05:57.867 --> 00:05:59.771
is the same thing as x to the fourth,

00:05:59.771 --> 00:06:02.046
so it's gonna be three x to the fourth.

00:06:02.046 --> 00:06:04.205
Negative x to the third is the

00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:07.108
negative of positive x to the third.

00:06:07.108 --> 00:06:12.108
So, that's going to be a
positive 10 x to the third.

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:18.050
Actually let me just write
this, let me write it all out.

00:06:18.183 --> 00:06:20.806
So negative x to the fourth minus

00:06:20.806 --> 00:06:24.161
10 times negative x, to the third power,

00:06:24.161 --> 00:06:29.161
plus -x squared minus -x.

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.181
So this is just x to the fourth,

00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:36.745
this is the negative of
positive x to the third,

00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:39.288
this is the same thing as x squared,

00:06:39.288 --> 00:06:41.377
and this, well, that's just -x,

00:06:41.377 --> 00:06:43.781
so it's going to be three
x to the fourth power.

00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:45.684
Negative 10 times the
negative of x to the third

00:06:45.684 --> 00:06:48.958
is positive 10 x to the third power

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:53.323
plus x squared, and then you
subtract a negative plus x.

00:06:53.323 --> 00:06:56.620
So notice, this is neither g(x),

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.920
it's definitely not g(x) 'cause

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.126
we swapped the signs on the two

00:07:00.126 --> 00:07:05.126
odd-powered terms, we
swapped the signs over here,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.280
but it's also not the negative of g(x).

00:07:10.284 --> 00:07:12.141
We've only swapped signs on a few of them.

00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:13.140
And that's because we swapped signs

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.344
on the odd terms, not on the even terms.

00:07:16.344 --> 00:07:17.795
So this one right over here is

00:07:17.795 --> 00:07:21.504
neither even nor odd.
