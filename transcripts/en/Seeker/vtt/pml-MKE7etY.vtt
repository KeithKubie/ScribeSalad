00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:00.920
Pubic hair!

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.050
It's awesome!

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.830
Well, according to
me-- and also science.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.802
Hey, everyone.

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:12.510
Welcome to DNews.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.639
I'm Laci Green.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.180
There's a noticeable
trend these days

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.200
toward removing pubic hair, a
fad that's pretty new, given

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.430
that in the past it
wasn't as much of a thing.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.260
Definitely not in the '70s.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.290
Our parents loved their pubes.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.150
As far back as the 1400s,
pubic hair was fashionable.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.960
In fact, if someone
had to remove it,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.390
like if they had lice, there
were pubic wigs called merkins

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.840
that people would wear until
it grew back, which I actually

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.240
just think is
hilarious, a pubic wig.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.140
Gripes that we hear
these days about oral sex

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.220
and pubic hygiene
are relatively new.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.530
And so, too, are the
array of razors, tweezers,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.620
electric shavers, waxes,
creams, expensive hair removal

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.040
procedures, all with the aim
of keeping you clean and sexy.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.940
But is pubic hair really
that dirty and terrible?

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.410
Scientifically speaking, no.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.240
Pubic hair itself
actually serves

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.310
some important
evolutionary functions.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.960
It's a protector
of the treasure.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.200
It exists to provide a
bumper from the irritating

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.045
friction of sex.

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:06.980
It also serves to keep harmful
bacteria and pathogens out.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.910
Pubic hair also harbors
pheromones, an erotic scent

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.140
unique to each person
that you subconsciously

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.520
pick up on in a partner.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.750
There are more obvious
practicalities as well.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.240
If you have sensitive
skin, shaving super sucks.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.010
It can be irritating because the
hair removal inflames the hair

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.560
follicles, which can
cause itchy, burning,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.525
nasty discomfort.

00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:28.500
This irritation, when paired
up with the moist environment

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.360
that is the genitalia,
creates a perfect place

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.200
for unpleasant bacteria to grow.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.709
Strep, staph boils, cellulitis,
and pustules on the genitals

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.625
are more common in people
who shave regularly.

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:41.520
Shaving and waxing also make
you more vulnerable to sexually

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.080
transmitted
infections that spread

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.500
by touching such as
herpes or genital warts,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.240
because it's easier to contract
with little tiny openings

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.040
in your skin.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.054
Of course, shaving isn't a
certain recipe for disaster,

00:01:52.054 --> 00:01:53.470
and lots of people
do it, and they

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.900
don't get pustules or
herpes or anything terrible.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.900
It can be fun, a way to change
it up to feel extra sexy.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.760
But it is a personal thing that
in light of the medical facts

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.520
isn't necessarily for everyone.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.954
Basically, you should be free
to do you, whatever that is.

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:07.620
All right, guys.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.560
You knew it was coming.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.976
What's your pubic
hair preference?

00:02:09.976 --> 00:02:12.236
Do you like to shave,
trim, grow it out?

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:13.860
