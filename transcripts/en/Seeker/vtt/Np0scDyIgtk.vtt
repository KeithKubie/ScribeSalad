00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.419
People say that talking to yourself means
you’re crazy.

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:04.320
But I’m the picture of sanity, right other
Julian?

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.240
That’s right Julian.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.450
Hello out there, It’s Julian for DNews.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.110
Recently we got a question from Phyiogambit
asking about people talking to themselves.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.110
Why do we do it?

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.390
And is it a bad thing?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.910
People often associate talking to oneself
with schizophrenia, but that’s not totally

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.950
accurate.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.930
Schizophrenia is different from multiple personality
disorder; a schizophrenic hallucinates voices

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.189
or sometimes sees people or animals, instead
of housing multiple distinct personalities

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.060
in their head and switching between them.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.789
Sometimes schizophrenics try to communicate
with these other voices or visions, and to

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.100
an outside observer it looks like they’re
talking to themselves nonsensically.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.820
But if it’s not caused by the symptoms of
schizophrenia, private speech isn’t necessarily

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.820
a bad thing.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.260
In fact it can be good for you.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.350
One psychologist, Dr. Linda Sapadin, actually
thinks it can be beneficial, so long as it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.499
stays positive.

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.411
According to Sapadin, there’s nothing wrong
with giving yourself a compliment after a

00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:59.780
job well-done, or giving yourself some motivation
to get your rear in gear.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.690
She also says that speaking out loud can help
you organize your thoughts, decide what you

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.070
want, and set goals.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.870
Sapadin’s claims are supported by studies
done on children.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.830
Young boys and girls tend to talk to themselves
as they go through a difficult task that they’re

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.830
learning.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.330
Children who guide themselves through tests
out loud tend to get higher scores.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.560
A study of preschoolers asked them to do a
task twice, once with private speech and once

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.560
without.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.830
Again, the children performed better when
they talked themselves through it.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.990
When we get older we start internalizing our
thoughts more, but that doesn’t mean we

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.410
still can’t benefit from it.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.300
A 2001 study gave adults age 18-23 an easy
computer problem, a difficult one, a repeat

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.710
of the difficult one, and making an origami
shape 3 times.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.170
All 53 participants talked to themselves at
some point, but it was most frequent the first

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.300
time they did the difficult computer trial.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.890
It also diminished every time they made the
origami model, suggesting that talking to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.000
themselves helped them learn and remember
how to do a difficult task.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.290
Aside from helping you learn, you might catch
yourself muttering when you lose something.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.820
A 2012 study published in the Quarterly Journal
of Experimental Psychology decided to see

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.340
if it actually had any benefit.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.860
They had subjects repeat what they were looking
for while scanning supermarket shelves.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.630
When searching for a familiar item, they found
it slightly faster.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.739
When searching for an unfamiliar item, they
were a little slower than if they weren’t

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:09.739
speaking out loud.

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:10.890
The difference?

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.849
Only about a hundred milliseconds either way.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.980
They concluded speaking out loud provides
no significant difference in the speed of

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.099
finding something.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.249
So mutter away all you want, but it’s not
going to make your keys materialize any faster.

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:25.650
Talking to yourself probably isn’t a sign
of mental illness, but if you are having hallucinations,

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.650
schizophrenia is treatable.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.489
Treatment may actually get simpler soon.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:45.150
Anthony Carboni talks about the schizophrenia
switch here.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.579

answered it to their satisfaction.
