00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.640
[NOISE] Anybody there?

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.900
&gt;&gt; Is that you, Charles?

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.880
&gt;&gt; It is, maybe.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.190
Who's asking?

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.760
&gt;&gt; It's me, Michael.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.100
I was going to do another lesson.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.030
&gt;&gt; Ooh, I like lessons.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.060
How are you doing Michael?

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm doing all right.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.370
&gt;&gt; I notice that my favorite
letter is on the screen.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.570
&gt;&gt; Yes, Charles like the c.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.010
Si si si, Senor.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.900
Yes, so remember we had
a lesson that was a triple a.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.220
So this is the triple c lesson.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.865
&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:24.500
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It would make sense.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.470
&gt;&gt; What about the triple b?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.790
&gt;&gt; Triple b happened, but you have to
pay premium rates to see that one.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.780
&gt;&gt; Nice, we quadruple your tuition.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.920
&gt;&gt; No, there's no triple b
at the current time, but

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.120
we can think about that for later.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.080
&gt;&gt; Maybe for our third class.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.760
&gt;&gt; So, let's see.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.980
So we talked about game theory.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.510
And one of the cool
things about game theory,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.980
is it let us reason about sequential
decision making in agents and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.380
learning, in the context of there being
more than one of them in the world.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.940
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.760
this is something that I
wrote in my dissertation,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.080
is that in some sense MDPs,
are very solipsistic.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.740
&gt;&gt; Wow, did you actually write that?

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.730
&gt;&gt; I did.
It's in my intro.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.790
Do you know the word?

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.270
&gt;&gt; Of course I do.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.210
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Do you want to define it for everybody?

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.319
&gt;&gt; No,
because that actually would be ironic.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.830
&gt;&gt; Okay, fair enough.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.260
So the idea of solipsism is that
you're the only thing in the universe,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.210
everything else is just kind of there.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.240
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; But you're the only real thing.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.570
And so one nice thing about
the game theory setting,

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.150
is it actually let's us admit
that maybe we're not alone.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.010
So what I'd like to do in this lesson,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.940
is actually dive in even more deeply to
that idea, and talk about how the MDP or

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.050
the mark off planning and
learning type framework,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.580
can be adapted to be able to talk
about coordinating between agents,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.170
communicating between agents, and
actually coaching between agents.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.000
&gt;&gt; That sounds perfect.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.990
That's actually the kind of
thing that I like to do, and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.790
I like to think about
as part of my research.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.590
So I'm looking forward to learning more.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.300
&gt;&gt; Excellent.
So the way we're going to do that,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.020
is actually look at different
ways that Markov models can be

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.760
kind of modified and redefined,
so that coordination and

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.320
communication, and so forth,
is a natural property in the model.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.140
And we'll look at a couple
different models.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.070
The first one is called Deck Palm PP's.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.580
And the second one is called
Inverse Reinforcement Learning, and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.410
they kind of get at these different
issues in slightly different ways.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.440
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.487
I think, well we'll do that.

00:02:13.487 --> 00:02:15.900
We'll talk about it some more, later.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.400
&gt;&gt; OK.
