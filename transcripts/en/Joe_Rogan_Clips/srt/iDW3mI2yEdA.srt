1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,430
I always wanted to ask you one thing.
Uh,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,120
it's completely different
subjects. Can I ask you, uh,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,860
when you're doing interviews
at the end of fights,

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,600
did you ever feel trathen
somehow no wait list once I'm,

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,170
no, no, no, no. I,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,250
one thing that I hope the
fighters realizes that what
I'm trying to do is only

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,610
get them to express themselves.
I want them to shine.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,210
I really genuinely want them.
They won this big fight. I want,

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,780
I want them to express themselves. I want
them to maybe maximize their marketing,

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,220
perfect their marketability and just
like tell the world how they feel.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,460
Like that's a incredibly
unusual experience to win
a big fight in the cage on

12
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:46,530
paper view in front of millions of people.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,990
My goal is only to try to get them to
communicate the better and to let them

14
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:54,150
know that I'm there to support them.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,000
That's all I'm ever trying to
do for forfeit, you know? Yeah.

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,900
Like I was saying before,
before we started talking to,

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,740
I have a lot of fat friends in MMA,

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,290
sweetest guys as people consider what they
do for a living. It's crazy. So crazy.

19
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:12,060
Yeah. Damn young from the lay.
Yeah. Ninja Shogun. They are.

20
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,620
Oh, how is Ninja doing these days?
Man? Add less time. I talked to him,

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,390
he got some, he got some, uh,

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,010
I don't know if it was because of
the fighting and I cannot say that,

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,760
but his speech,
it's a little slow.

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,140
It is already hard to understand.
Even Shogun, they have this,

25
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:34,800
what they call the whole nace,
which is the way of speaking.

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,630
They come from this state,

27
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:39,690
which is very hard to understand what
they say from Queer TB. Right? Yeah.

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,820
I'm good at Chiba in people.
We don't from color chips.

29
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,850
Sometimes Wednesday speak to too fast.
You don't understand that much,

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,560
but Aneesha I think he got some,
some injuries in there.

31
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,950
Got some scars on his head.
I think he got some surgeries and yeah,

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,760
I think he had surgery on, it was fine at
the time. People are kicking people in,

33
00:01:55,761 --> 00:02:00,120
in soccer kicking. Yeah. And he was
one of the best. He was good. Yeah.

34
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,490
He was an animal.
He was really young too.

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,120
And at the end he was like getting
knocked out with slaps. Yeah,

36
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,700
that's the scariest thing is
when you see their chin go,

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,940
when their ability to take upon,

38
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,940
what's crazy is shogun seems to be
making a resurgence. It's crazy.

39
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,150
He amazing.
He W I w I,

40
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:22,950
we used to be very good friends with
one of his coaches and after the fight

41
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:27,270
would Handerson the first one,
which was like a crazy fucking chaos,

42
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,420
that was a chaos. And I was
talking to him in, he was like,

43
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,680
you don't even imagine
how talented this guy is.

44
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,000
But uh, he got a focus. If he was focused,

45
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,600
he would kick his ass and like
fucking two minutes. So he just,

46
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,470
that's the way they do it in the shoe box.

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,260
They like to fight. They like to
fucking just go at it. Yeah. He,

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,690
him and Sidebar Org and a
[inaudible] Les Anderson,

49
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,040
the same thing. But the way they do,
it's just like, let's go to war. Yeah.

50
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,530
And sometimes the, the, the game
changed in, but shoguns like learning,

51
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:08,500
you can see that he's like
improving, still improving. And like,

52
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:12,340
I think it was like 36, 34 his last
fight, he looked sensation. Amen. I mean,

53
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:16,180
he looked like a fucking killer to phrase.
He can take a shot again now.

54
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,020
It's weird.
It's like,

55
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,340
I mean he got knocked out by a few
different guys and he's lost some fights,

56
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:24,820
some tough fights. But his last fight he
looked as good as he's looked in years.

57
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,930
It's, it's sad for me when I see like, uh,

58
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,080
I don't know why he's always with
Brazina's, but when I see like an old,

59
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,770
an old fighter getting his sp two quick.
Yup.

60
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,390
I remember his fight with Sonnen. That
was, that was, yeah, well he got caught.

61
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,520
He got caught on the guillotine,
but it's fast.

62
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,960
The guy framed for like six months
and that's very frustrating.

63
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,730
Remember when Royce he went back to
five with huge down was like, yeah,

64
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,820
well Matt Hughes was in his
prime and then, you know,

65
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:57,970
and he was so strong
and hoist just wasn't,

66
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,960
he wasn't physically capable and do it
right. He didn't look the same, you know,

67
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:06,130
it just didn't look like he was
physically capable those same way.

68
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,000
And you know, Matt, he was his
fucking talented, unbelievably
talented. And when he,

69
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,690
when he got on top of hoisting, it was
smashing them. I was like, oh yeah,

70
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:18,010
that's hard to watch. It's not a wash.
Yeah, but that's the life. I mean,

71
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,560
that is the life they chose,
you know, and chocolate.

72
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,980
Dell just got knocked out by Tito Ortiz
and that was hard to watch because you

73
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,480
could tell he just can't take a punch in.

74
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,630
I wasn't that five that went there to
watch it. It was, it was bad. It was,

75
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,820
it wasn't,
he wasn't moving right either.

76
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,120
The thing about when fighters
take a lot of knockout losses,

77
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:39,121
one of the things that's very becomes
a parent is there balance looks off and

78
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:43,900
their movement doesn't look the same.
Like their neurology, their, they don't,

79
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,780
the body doesn't move. It's not the
same. Yeah. You can look the same,

80
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:49,720
but there's react the same way.
Right. I mean, even Anderson,

81
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:50,920
when he lost his style bender,

82
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:55,480
I think style bender would've been a
tough fight for him at any point in his

83
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:59,140
career because style bender is
just fantastic, super technical.

84
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,910
But Anderson looked like he was a
step behind the Anderson of old,

85
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,990
like the Anderson that knocked out v
tour or the Anderson that, you know,

86
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:09,400
you go back to the early days,

87
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:13,330
the Anderson that knocked out Chael
Sonnen that Anderson was a fucking,

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,900
he was just in a Sasson.
Yeah, he was so good.

89
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,810
He just knew what to do and when to do it.
And when the style bender fight,

90
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:23,920
he just looked like he was a little
off little office, but he's also 46.

91
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:28,570
I don't know. He's, I think he's won one
year older than me. He's 43. He's only 40.

92
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,460
Yeah, we do. We do. We
did a show together. Uh,

93
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,170
we do a show this show on Netflix
called the old tomato bisque master,

94
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,940
which is a Brazilian
Netflix is here as well.

95
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,000
Terry crews did an American,
we do,

96
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,040
we do like all holes from all different
countries and we meet and it's like

97
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:50,290
American Ninja Warrior
for Netflix. Oh, okay.

98
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,460
And they have like hosts from different
countries and we have the Brazilians and

99
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:59,180
the Italians and the French guys.
Uh, and I did this show with Andrew.

100
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:03,350
So he's a sweet guy. He's a great guy,
great guy. He's a great guy. I mean,

101
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:05,300
he's one of the all time greats.
I mean,

102
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,990
I had the honor of calling a lot of his
fights and it's crazy because, yeah,

103
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,760
and it's crazy. [inaudible] when
you're talking about the guy,

104
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,230
the guy is getting older. I remember
I had a talk with Minataro. Uh,

105
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,750
he was like three or four,
like it was like two, two,

106
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,770
two fights after he actually retired. And
I asked him, why, why you keep doing it?

107
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,670
You don't have to do, you don't, you
don't have to prove anything to no one.

108
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,670
And what he said to me, I think
it was so fair. He was like,

109
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,450
I fought when this thing wasn't giving
me any money. Right. So just give,

110
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,730
let me lose the fight or two and get some
money at the end of my career because

111
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:45,120
I deserve that. He wasn't like, of
course he was going there to win,

112
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,330
but it's like I want to take the risk
because I was fighting in Japan getting on

113
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:54,360
on old $5,000 and now that the game,

114
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,690
it's like bringing you so much money.
I'm gonna retire.

115
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:01,160
Let me just do a couple or,
well Minataro not,

116
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,460
not only was he a pioneer and one of
the great MMA heavyweights of all time,

117
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:11,090
but he is so important for MMA because
he showed that heavyweights can fight off

118
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:14,030
their back and then heavyweights
could win by triangle.

119
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,630
Like when he triangled Mark Coleman and
was tapping guys with armbars when he

120
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:21,160
beat Bob Saget.
Bob Sapp on his fucking crazy though.

121
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,060
That is one of the greatest MMA fights
in the history of the sport. 375 pound.

122
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:27,650
Bob Sapp submitted guitar only,

123
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:30,650
probably weighed two 30 and he
wound up tap it in with an arm bar.

124
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,770
It was fucking Creighton
after get spiked on his head,

125
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,170
which still apparently
fucks with him to his day.

126
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:39,440
His neck was fucked up permanent because
of that. Yes. I didn't know that.

127
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,000
375 pound guy who doesn't even look
like a human. He looked like a,

128
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,150
like a comic book.
Yeah.

129
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,130
He smashes him on his head
and metatarsal recovered.

130
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,700
And I mean he was one of the
toughest guys of all time.

131
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,150
But she was run by a truck when he wasn't
there at, yeah. That's that scarring.

132
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,440
So it's run by a crazy. Yeah,
that's crazy. I mean, he's, um,

133
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,950
he's one of the most important
figures in the history of the sport.

134
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,440
And then I think Fabrisio took it to
another level because for [inaudible]

135
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,380
probably has the best guard in the
history of the sport is history.

136
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:13,790
The heavyweight division.
I mean,

137
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:17,300
when he caught fade or when he had him
in his triangle and he had them locked up

138
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:19,590
like that,
you don't get away with that guy like you,

139
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,320
you might get out of some people's guard,

140
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,670
not Fabricio that mother fucker
locks people up. Ain't, yeah.

141
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,430
And I got to thank you, man. I'm here
just because of him Gal for that. Well,

142
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,850
my respect for him, you know, when he
reached out to me and was like, okay,

143
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,260
I'll get your friend on
100% and he is a great guy.

144
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:39,180
And that's what I, well,
that's why I asked you if, uh,

145
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,810
if you'll kind of feel threatened because
when people get there in the fight,

146
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:48,610
you don't know what it was
going to happen. And when
you goal over there to talk,

147
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:48,911
we don't want,

148
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:52,720
you can see a wrong thing at the
Romano or maybe you can make mistakes,

149
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:56,940
you should stay. So my, my intention is
always to just to make them look good.

150
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,050
That's all I'm trying to do,

151
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,040
I'm trying to do is just get them
to express themselves and, and, and,

152
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,720
and also put some emotion to how great
their performance was. Perfect. Yeah.

153
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,350
But it's a weird job, you know,
to also be a comedian, you know,

154
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,180
it's a strange combination. The,
yeah. Do they go watch you sometimes.

155
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,960
Sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
That's good. That's very good.
