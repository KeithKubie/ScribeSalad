00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.899
This episode of DNews was proudly made possible
by the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:20.030
It's not just a sedan, it's a Subaru.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.890
Howdy snooze buttons, Trace here snoring away
for DNews!

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.090
We've talked a lot about sleep, but while
scientists have slowly been decoding the secrets

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.020
of animal naptime, we still don't know exactly
WHY we sleep.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.150
We DO know though, that if we neglect it,
we're screwed.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.170
The world record for sleep deprivation is
264 hours of wakefulness, or about 11 days.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.960
It was set by a high schooler in the mid-1960s.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.000
Researchers routinely keep people awake for
a eight to ten days with no ill effects.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.110
But that's not the same.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.360
By the way, this is sleep deprivation.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.329
Sleep deprivation is different from insomnia.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.500
According to the International Classification
of Sleep Disorders, Insomnia is a nightly

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.390
complaint of an insufficient amount of sleep
or not feeling rested after the habitual sleep

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.159
episode, while sleep deprivation is when a
person persistently fails to obtain sufficient

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.420
nocturnal sleep required to support normally
alert wakefulness.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.889
One happens TO you, the other you're doing.

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:18.649
Both have the same result, though.

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:19.729
Not sleeping.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.090
When this happens, the human body responds,
poorly.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.469
To say the least.

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.039
Physically, the brain sends out hormones like
cortisol -- the stress hormone and TSH -- or

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.310
thyroid stimulating hormone, which regulates
metabolism.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.990
Blood pressure goes up, and your metabolism
stops processing glucose correctly creating

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.299
food cravings for carbs.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.329
The overall temperature of the body will drop,
and the immune system slows down.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.679
Mentally, this causes problems with attention
and concentration, irritability, depression,

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.189
fatigue, decreased motivation and if it goes
on long enough, can seriously mess up cognitive

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.340
function altogether.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.369
So again, it seems that sleep isn't just a
lovely retreat from the busy world, but also

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.020
necessary for life!

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.179
Without it we can barely survive!

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.209
After a few days of sleep deprivation, people
begin to experience forced brain shutdowns

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.780
called microsleeps -- where the human brain
shuts down for just a second and goes into

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.780
sleep mode.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.599
During that time, the brain is asleep, and
the person loses motor function; but not for

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.099
long enough to feel rested.

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.689
This was happening to the high schooler who
set the 11-day world record.

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.099
In experiments at the University of Chicago,
lab technicians kept mice awake for about

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.129
two weeks before they died of whole body hypermetabolism.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:45.070
In humans, Fatal Familial Insomnia strikes
in middle age, and as the name suggests it's

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.950
inherited and deadly.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.849
When someone in one of the maybe 200 families
in the world who have FFI reaches middle age,

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.921
they'll be unable to sleep their autosomal
systems break down and they eventually die

00:02:56.921 --> 00:03:03.930
or total organ failure after six to thirty,
sleepless, months.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.890
Scientists are reluctant to say that the lack
of sleep is what kills them, as the disease

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.870
is actually related to Mad Cow, more than
anything else.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.920
We probably CAN'T die from a lack of sleep
itself, but most scientific studies have found

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.640
psychological effects like paranoia and hallucination
take hold and prevent us from learning more

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.260
about the physical effects.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.930
Though sleep studies HAVE shown purposefully
depriving yourself of sleep can increase risks

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.659
for diabetes, obesity, heart problems, depression,
and of course large equipment accidents thanks

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:34.659
to microsleeps.

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.090
If you need to recover from a lack of sleep,
just sleep!

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.870
The guy who was awake for 11 days slept for
14 hours and was pronounced completely normal.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.090
There's no such thing as catching up on sleep,
but a true full night of sleep will do you

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.499
good, regardless.

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:50.470
What's the longest you've ever gone without
sleep?

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.209
I went 40 hours on a road trip to watch the
last Space Shuttle launch.

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.409
I was kept awake by Dr. Pepper, candy, and
extreme geek-itude.

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:58.889
Did you beat my record?

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.269
