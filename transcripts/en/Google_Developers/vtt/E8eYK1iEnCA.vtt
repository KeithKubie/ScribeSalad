KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.059
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.070
Joining me in this
studio is Max.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.050
He is a former Googler, multiple
time Founder, and currently

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.520
working on AltSchool.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.070
Max, thanks for joining us.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.686
MAX VENTILLA: Thanks
for having me.

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:16.329
I'm actually a
former Googler twice.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.300
KORY JEFFREY: Twice.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.820
MAX VENTILLA: And then I came
back and then I left again.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.990
KORY JEFFREY: So let's
start with that story then.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.160
MAX VENTILLA: So I had done a
startup in college basically

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.330
and just kind of got my
ass handed to me, and said,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.399
OK, there's a lot of
things that I need

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.690
to know before I do that again.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.230
And so one of them
was I wanted to work

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.460
for a really great,
awesome company that

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.930
modeled for me the kind of
company I wanted to build.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.810
And so after working for an
amazing company in Europe

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.380
and finishing my
MBA, I went to Google

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.470
and was part of this kind of
small corporate strategy group

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.030
and got that crazy itch to
start something, not least

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.370
because an amazing person
was finishing a PhD

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.920
and I wanted to start a
company with him forever.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.020
And so I did that.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.350
And then Google ended up
buying the start-up, Aardvark,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.228
like two and a half years later.

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:05.997
And so I ended up
back at Google.

00:01:05.997 --> 00:01:07.705
KORY JEFFREY: And now
left Google again--

00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:08.550
MAX VENTILLA: Yeah.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.785
KORY JEFFREY: --to do AltSchool.

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:10.180
MAX VENTILLA: That's right.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.450
KORY JEFFREY: So
tell us about that.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.699
MAX VENTILLA: So it's been
about two and a half years.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:16.400
So I was running the
personalization team

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.180
prior to leaving Google, and got
to work on things like Google

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.060
Now, and just really
felt like there

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.090
was a role for personalization
to play in the broader world

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.360
and education specifically.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.150
And I'm a parent.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.200
I had a two-year-old
daughter at the time

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.640
and was very much thinking
about school and future school.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.434
And just when you have
that Google experience,

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:42.100
you are trained to
think about the world

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.880
in a certain way,
which is around scale

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.890
and continuous improvement.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.930
And that's at odds with what
I saw in the education space

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.120
where schools are structurally
resistant to change.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.940
There aren't the
kind of resources

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.120
to really do a kind
of R&amp;D enablement

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.050
of some transformative
new model.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.640
And so that kind of
possessed me and a number

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.840
of other folks from Google
and an amazing child

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.780
center and educators
that we partnered with.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.930
We've been working on
that journey of how

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.100
do you really transform the
ecosystem in which people start

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.930
and run schools, starting
with a set of schools

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.710
that we operate ourselves that
have a level of technology

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.420
enablement that's unheard of.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.440
So we have 150 people
working for AltSchool.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.410
50 of them are
educators and 50 of them

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.130
are engineers, many of them
from places like Google.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.705
And that kind of
one-to-one ratio

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:32.860
is something you don't see.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.180
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah,
yeah, for sure.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.500
And so I noticed when
I was reading about it

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.150
that it said you are able to
get a level of personalization

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.085
without resulting
to screen learning.

00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:42.627
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:43.418
MAX VENTILLA: Sure.

00:02:43.418 --> 00:02:45.500
So I thing that the most
important technologies

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.186
for a classroom should be
invisible from the classroom

00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:50.560
for the most part
in the same way

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.490
that the most important
technologies from driving

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.650
aren't so obvious when you
get behind the wheel of a car.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.180
There are things that go
into the safety, and the GPS,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.370
and the testing, and
eventually to things

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.882
like the car's steering
itself with Tesla and ones

00:03:05.882 --> 00:03:06.590
that will follow.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.430
And so similarly,
we want to think

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.410
about how do we set up that
classroom to be most dynamic,

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.020
to be most responsive to what
each child in that classroom

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.600
needs in terms of what classroom
they're in to begin with,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.107
with what educators
and what peers,

00:03:22.107 --> 00:03:23.940
and what kind of
curriculum they're pursuing

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.050
and extracurriculars, and
then down to having each child

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.320
be able to be on a different
trajectory each week

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.780
with 20 to 25 different
activities in their playlist

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.190
that all can be assessed
in almost real time, where

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.966
those playlist items should be
happening primarily offline.

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:42.840
But there should be a
digital representation.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.298
There should be an
interoperability

00:03:44.298 --> 00:03:45.232
between classrooms.

00:03:45.232 --> 00:03:47.440
And there should be a level
of transparency and rigor

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.710
that's very hard to
accomplish in a scaled way

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.690
without relying on technologies,
in this case, technologies

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.725
you need to build yourself
from the ground up.

00:03:56.725 --> 00:03:58.100
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.220
So you said you were
running schools.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.129
How many children have
you educated so far?

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.170
MAX VENTILLA: How many
children have we educated?

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.960
We have 330 students
in our schools today.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.250
We've only been around
for two and a half years.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.630
So we started with lower
and upper elementary,

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.079
that first pilot year with
just a one-room schoolhouse.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.579
And then we expanded to include
middle school the next year.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.845
And we literally only had
one kid graduate that year.

00:04:23.845 --> 00:04:26.220
We intended to have none and
give ourselves a little more

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.290
time to graduate a student.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.280
But this guy Zev came along
and was just too awesome.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.869
We said, OK.

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:30.910
We're going to admit you.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.220
And it was a good call.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.870
So we'll have more and more
kids in the years that follow.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.120
KORY JEFFREY: And so this
sounds like right now you're

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.279
working off of your own
kind of high-touch model.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.320
Like you said, you have
to have only an ecosystem

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.054
with engineering
and the educators.

00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:46.470
How do you see this kind of
rolling out to a public school

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.345
system in the future?

00:04:47.345 --> 00:04:48.230
Or do you?

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.630
MAX VENTILLA: Yeah.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.838
So we think of it in kind
of a three-phased approach,

00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:53.060
where phase one is we're
the only inhabitants

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.170
of this transformatively
different ecosystem that

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.836
doesn't start out
that transformatively,

00:04:56.836 --> 00:04:59.030
but we build, and we
iterate, and we invest.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.110
And we start chasing
that kind of hockey

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.110
stick curve that has
a long flat part.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.070
And we're the only
client of that ecosystem.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.520
It's only our schools that
exist in this kind of AltSchool

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.550
world.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.250
But over time,
and we think we're

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.300
maybe halfway in that
five-year journey

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.350
to where we can start to invite
other people in that ecosystem.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.982
And you'll see charter
schools, public schools,

00:05:22.982 --> 00:05:24.940
Montessori schools,
international baccalaureate

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.580
schools start in
this new universe

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.440
that makes it much easier
to operate a great school.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.480
Today it's way too hard to
start and run a bad school,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.541
let alone a good school.

00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:37.290
And you look at something
like Montessori,

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.748
which is the best out-of-the-box
approach we have for lower

00:05:39.748 --> 00:05:42.100
elementary, it's over 100 years.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.600
There's no technology
enabled in it.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.700
There's no significant
network effect.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.390
And we want to create this
ecosystem, which in phase two

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.080
allows more and more people
to start more and more diverse

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.067
schools that still meet that
high bar of what a school

00:05:54.067 --> 00:05:56.400
today should be in terms of
being personalized, in terms

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.000
of being iterative, in
terms of being data-driven.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.210
in terms of using
technology in the right way,

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.236
not to replace
relationship-driven real-world

00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:05.574
learning but to kind
of superpower it.

00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:07.990
And eventually over the long
term, we hope to kind of move

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.780
to the third phase,
where we represent

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.230
a viable option for
existing schools and school

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.540
systems which will educate
the majority of kids

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.490
for the foreseeable future to
do things in a different way,

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.250
in a different place in the
same way as after 20 years,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.200
from '95 to 2015, this
internet ecosystem

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.120
now represents the way that
even the most traditional media

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.170
players and content providers
increasingly operate.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.158
And we want a similar
dynamic to take place

00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:34.759
over the next decades.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.050
KORY JEFFREY: That's very cool.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.570
It's like a long-tailed
infiltration of the education

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.472
system.

00:06:39.472 --> 00:06:40.830
That's cool.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.125
So you're at Founder World.

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:46.010
There's like thousands of really
interesting tech, entrepreneur,

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.860
non-tech people here.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.900
What attracted
you to this event?

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.780
MAX VENTILLA: So I like
any opportunity to go

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.800
spout off to people that
haven't rammed their head

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.442
into the same walls as I have.

00:06:59.442 --> 00:07:00.900
I don't think it's
worth that much.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.649
At the end of the day,
you learn by doing,

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:04.890
and you learn by being
alongside someone doing.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.580
And someone telling you
can't really make big impact.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.350
But I wouldn't have
started AltSchool

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.399
if I wouldn't have
heard Elon Musk talk

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:15.690
in a few individual situations.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.187
So maybe I can be the
poor man's Elon Musk

00:07:19.187 --> 00:07:21.562
and talk to people that are
even earlier in their career.

00:07:21.562 --> 00:07:22.402
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:07:22.402 --> 00:07:23.610
MAX VENTILLA: So I like that.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.350
It's something I think is built
into the startup ethos, which

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.450
is you pay it forward.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.930
So like when there is
a great audience, when

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.624
it's very much about how
do you inspire, how do you

00:07:35.624 --> 00:07:38.994
give actual tactical advice
as well to the next generation

00:07:38.994 --> 00:07:41.660
of entrepreneurs, I want to do a
certain number of those a year.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.535
And we like the people
organizing this event,

00:07:43.535 --> 00:07:44.977
so I was happy to do it.

00:07:44.977 --> 00:07:47.060
KORY JEFFREY: And so you
were on stage, obviously,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.370
earlier talking to potential
young entrepreneurs

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.460
early in their career.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.420
What was the message
you were getting across?

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.920
MAX VENTILLA: So
for me, the message

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.570
is mostly about you want
to focus on the long term.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.390
Startups tend to fail.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.730
They take a lot of time.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.070
They take a lot of money.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.240
And you want to set yourself up
assuming that those things are

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.420
true, which means not relying
on intelligent design,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.370
like a hunch you have,
and then you go, go, go

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.260
as fast as you possibly can.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.590
It's to kind of use
first principles,

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.300
assume you're wrong,
iterate, iterate, iterate,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.814
focus on acceleration, put
the earliest version out there

00:08:24.814 --> 00:08:26.980
that you can and start
learning as soon as possible,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.530
be quantitatively and
qualitatively user driven.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.637
And in the earliest phases, try
to weed out false positives,

00:08:34.637 --> 00:08:36.220
and don't worry about
false negatives.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.340
Who cares if you didn't
do the thing that

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.340
would have been the next
billion dollar startup.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.384
All you care about is
not doing the thing

00:08:42.384 --> 00:08:44.370
that ends up being a failure.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.870
KORY JEFFREY: That's
cool, actually,

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.450
So as you walk
around here, there's

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.116
all sorts of different
booths, all sorts

00:08:49.116 --> 00:08:50.390
of different technologies.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.710
Is there anything particular
here or otherwise in the tech

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.649
space today that gets
you really excited?

00:08:55.649 --> 00:08:56.440
MAX VENTILLA: Yeah.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.820
So I haven't had the
chance to walk around here.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.640
I think that there are some
amazing building blocks that

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.870
have been put into place.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.070
So obviously, things like cloud
infrastructure and big data

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.940
analytics are extremely
interesting to me.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.870
I think that they are
moving into things

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.520
that allow consumer behavior.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.450
So the proliferation
of mobile payments,

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.592
super interesting to me.

00:09:21.592 --> 00:09:25.150
More seamless identity, the fact
that I can use my thumbprint

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.619
and put in my Amazon
password on a mobile site,

00:09:27.619 --> 00:09:30.160
I think that stuff is going to
grease the wheels for actually

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.520
a transformatively different
way that we behave online.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.100
I'm now interested in
more lately things that

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.610
allow us to in the real
world make fast progress

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.370
around digital systems.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.860
So that could be anything from--
like Texas Instruments makes

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.560
a kind of wearable chip
that's very easy to play with.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.840
Intel is starting to do some
really interesting things

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.400
with transistors for mobile.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.110
So I think that just
lowering the bar for people

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.660
to get started on
real world devices

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:06.350
is especially interesting for
me in a real world venture that

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.260
still wants to use technology.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.520
And there's some critical
kind of AIP pieces

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.860
that come along with
that in terms of things

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.300
like voice transcription.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.080
It's amazing to me that I can
open up Siri or Google Now,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.290
and it could basically,
in this noisy room,

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.720
do a pretty good
job transcribing.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.554
I want to be able to
use that kind of stuff.

00:10:24.554 --> 00:10:25.553
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:10:25.553 --> 00:10:27.720
And so being a two-time
Googler and obviously

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.640
a tech entrepreneur, what
is your favorite Google

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.840
technology?

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.360
MAX VENTILLA: I mean, Google
Search is just transformative.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.010
I think Google Search on
mobile is just amazing,

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.130
being able to give it to my
daughter who expects that.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.350
Anything she wants to know--

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.880
KORY JEFFREY: Is there.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.580
MAX VENTILLA: At any time.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.996
I just think she's
going to become

00:10:46.996 --> 00:10:49.783
a different human being as a
result. It's so cool to watch.

00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:50.206
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:10:50.206 --> 00:10:52.100
Well, thank you,
Max, for joining us.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.351
It was great to have you here.

00:10:53.351 --> 00:10:54.850
And thank you, guys,
for joining us.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.960
We are on site at Founder
World in San Fransisco.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.510
