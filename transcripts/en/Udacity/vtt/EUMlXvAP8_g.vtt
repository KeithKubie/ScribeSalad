00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.956
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In one of our earlier quizzes when you were deciding which curves were

00:00:03.956 --> 00:00:08.376
parabolas and which ones weren't, we saw the equation y equals 3x squared plus

00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:12.420
2x. We know very well by now that if we want to find the x intercept of this

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.704
equation we need to start by setting y equal to 0, and then the next step after

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:20.920
that will be to try to get the expression on the right hand side, with the x's

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.515
in it, into a form where we have one factor multiplied by another factor. Where

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:29.655
both factors have an x to the 1st power in them. And in fact, you already know

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:34.118
how to do this. All this involves is factoring. Remember, that means looking for

00:00:34.118 --> 00:00:38.470
a common factor between terms, and putting it outside a set of parenthesis so

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.646
that it will And multiply in. So, what is a way that we could rewrite this

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:47.321
equation by pulling out a common factor that both of these terms have. Please

00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:50.659
fill in one of those factors here, and another one here.
