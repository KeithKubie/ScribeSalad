00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.036
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.984 --> 00:01:20.525
EMMA SEPPALA: So
I'm going to start--

00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:22.180
since we're talking
about happiness,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.638
I'm going to start
with showing you

00:01:23.638 --> 00:01:25.970
something that I saw in
downtown Palo Alto yesterday.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.500
When I just got
off the plane and I

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.190
arrived and was looking for
some lunch, I walked by a store.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.690
This is what it
said in the window.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.590
"Whoever said money can't
buy happiness simply

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.030
didn't know where
to go shopping."

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.540
Anybody know where this was?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.980
Right next to LYFE Kitchen.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.520
So when we think about
the science of happiness

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.410
and when we look at it as
psychologists and researchers,

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.560
there are two different
kinds of happiness.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.890
And one is the happiness that we
derive from sensual pleasures;

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.910
the happiness we derive
from things like shopping,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.870
for example; from food;
from money; and even

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.200
from awards and achievements.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.490
So all those things that give us
some kind of material pressure

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.660
or the pleasure that we
receive from succeeding

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.550
in some small way
gives us a boost.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.684
Then the other form
of happiness that we

00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:29.350
look at-- so the first
form of happiness

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.100
is something we call
hedonic happiness.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.680
And the other is called
eudaimonic happiness.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.070
And that is happiness
that's derived from things

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.900
like meaning, from things like
purpose, service, altruism--

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.940
something beyond
just your own self.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.939
And if you look at the research,
the first type of pleasure,

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.230
which is basically you can
think of it as a sex, drugs,

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.180
and rock'n'roll pleasure--
it's so fun, right?

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.280
But it has a very
momentary, short-lived life.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.980
It comes and goes very quickly.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.240
And that leads us to want
more, which is actually

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.140
evolutionarily adaptive
because we want to eat again,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.640
or we want to look for a
partner that has insured that we

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.040
survived and that our ancestors
survived and reproduced

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.490
and so forth.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.450
But if we look at
eudaimonic happiness,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.290
that's actually the source
of much more long lasting

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.100
well-being.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.080
You can even think
of it as fulfillment.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.870
It's not just a momentary joy.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.390
It's something that lasts.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.050
And I'll talk about
that a little more.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.550
So that's just a
little introduction

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.590
to the topic of happiness since
we're talking about that today.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.910
So one of the reasons that I
wrote "The Happiness Track"

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.900
was that I attended
Yale and Stanford,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.810
and I've worked
there for many years.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.920
And I saw that
alongside the brilliance

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.550
that's there-- and I know
many Google employees who went

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.160
to [INAUDIBLE] universities.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.700
Along with the brilliance,
and along with the excitement,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.450
the innovation, the amazing
learning opportunities,

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.630
also sometimes came misery.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.620
What I mean by that is high
levels of stress, of anxiety.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.720
In my first year at Stanford
as a graduate student,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.490
I was pretty giddy.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.350
Every day was biking
down Palm Drive,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.100
palm trees on either side.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.216
The sun is shining.

00:04:28.216 --> 00:04:29.590
I just moved from
the East Coast.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.170
So I was warm every day.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.010
I was wearing a
t-shirt every day.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.680
It was amazing.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.400
And I was learning
from these legends.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.595
I mean the people in
the academics there

00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:42.850
are legends in their field.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.470
And yet, that first
year I was there,

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.650
there were three
suicides on the campus.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.120
And I was thinking, wow, we
have this amazing opportunity.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.530
We're in this place that
people dream of coming to.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.780
And yet, there's
so much despair.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.210
And those were, of
course, extreme cases.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.830
But what I saw was that
there was a lot of feelings

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.100
of stress and anxiety.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.900
And I'll tell you one story
that really exemplifies

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.410
what I'm talking about.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.900
So I started the psychology
of happiness class

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.259
with my colleague,
Carol [? Pitofsky, ?]

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.800
who's the head of
Health Improvement.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.360
And I know some of
you actually were

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.560
students in that class,
which is wonderful.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.870
And after one of the classes,
a student came up to Carol

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.810
and said, I have to drop out.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.900
It goes against everything
I've ever learned.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.320
And Carol said, what you mean?

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.130
And she said, well,
my parents told me

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.920
I have to be very,
very successful.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.440
So when I asked them, how do I
become very, very successful,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.830
they said you have to
work very, very hard.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.130
And she said, OK.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.380
And then she went back to
them and said, how do I know

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.330
when I'm working hard enough?

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.190
And they said, when
you're suffering.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.470
Again, it's an extreme example,
but it's one that we actually

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.580
all buy into a little bit.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.764
It's one that we see.

00:06:00.764 --> 00:06:02.430
And it's one of the
reasons we're seeing

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.004
50% burnout across industries.

00:06:05.004 --> 00:06:06.920
It doesn't matter if you
work for a nonprofit,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.510
if you work for
the medical field.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.570
We're seeing huge levels.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.220
And 50% is on the
lower end of what

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.590
we're seeing across industries.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.840
We're seeing that 80% of doctors
visits are due to stress.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.010
And we're also seeing that
75% of employees in the US

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.130
workforce are disengaged.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.740
And that's not to
mention-- and we've all

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.050
heard the impacts of
stress, that stress

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.900
is linked to diseases
that are-- like asthma,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.180
diseases like diabetes,
and a host of other things

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.250
that we're seeing very
much in our society today.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.520
So I was very interested
in this topic of happiness.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.369
And I dove into it as
a graduate student.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.910
And the more I dove
into it, the more

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:58.784
I was shocked to see that the
research suggests something

00:06:58.784 --> 00:07:00.450
very different from
what we're thinking.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.010
So the idea that we're buying
into-- the misconception

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.160
that we have is that in
order to be successful,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.500
we have to sacrifice,
or at least postpone,

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.690
our own happiness
now with the idea

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.790
that later we'll be successful,
and therefore, we'll be happy.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.014
But if you look at the data,
it actually proves us wrong.

00:07:17.014 --> 00:07:19.180
And I'm going to go through
some theories of success

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.200
that we have.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.710
And I'll go through
them now so that you

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.140
can see that they are some of
the ideas that we buy into.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.100
The first one is that you've
got to focus on the future.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.880
You need to keep your
eyes on the prize

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.520
in order to get things done,
and I'll go into that more.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.880
The idea that we can't have
success without stress-- again,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.380
that is so exemplified by
that student, what she shared.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.050
Persevere at all
costs-- just keep going.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.100
Work to exhaustion
sometimes, but that

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.880
is the way to meet your goals.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.910
Focus on your niche.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.180
Become an expert.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.820
Become the go-to
person in your field.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.080
Spend most of your
time reading up on it

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.450
and becoming the person who
knows absolutely everything.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.980
And then play to your strengths.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.170
You're good at some things.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.500
Other things, you're weaker at.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.520
Do the things you're good at.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.420
And finally, look
out for number one.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.795
It's kind of a
dog-eat-dog world.

00:08:19.795 --> 00:08:21.290
It's competitive.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.580
You have to look out
for yourself first.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.955
And sometimes, that means
elbowing people out of the way.

00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:28.288
Would you agree that those
are some of the theories that

00:08:28.288 --> 00:08:28.890
are out there?

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.306
Whether or not they're yours,
they're some of the theories

00:08:31.306 --> 00:08:33.659
that we hear about
and learn about.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.370
I'm going to go
through some of them.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.580
And I'll tell you a little
bit about what the data says.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.909
Focus on the future.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:44.730
Focus on the future means
keeping a mind on your goals

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.947
and where you want
to go at all times.

00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:48.280
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.250
Obviously, it's a great
idea to have ambitions

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.590
and to have kind of a game
plan of what you would like.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.040
However, we can spend
most of our time

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.450
with our mind in the future.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.140
And that actually
is problematic.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:07.110
So actually much of the
time, our mind is wandering.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.000
How many of you have
had your mind wander

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.330
since I started talking?

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.170
OK, good.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.574
It means you're normal.

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:17.160
So I'm not going to
take it personally.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.470
So 50% of the time,
our mind wanders.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.770
Research out of Harvard
was done in which

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.010
there was a study in which
participants took a Blackberry

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.600
home.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.599
And they were pinged
randomly throughout the day

00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:31.340
and asked, what are you doing?

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.760
What are you thinking about?

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.470
And how are you feeling?

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.620
So basically, they
were looking at

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.620
were people thinking about
what they were doing,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.090
or was their mind wandering?

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.300
And how did that make them feel?

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.480
The most interesting
thing was the result.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.310
The result showed
that you are never

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.570
happier than when you are
in the present moment.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.575
So even if your mind is
wandering to something

00:09:54.575 --> 00:09:55.950
you'd rather be
doing-- let's say

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.824
you're doing something
you really don't like,

00:09:57.824 --> 00:10:00.350
like your taxes, or
like entering data,

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.736
or something that
is boring to you.

00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:04.610
Your mind is wandering
to your next vacation,

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.430
which will be in Hawaii.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.372
You will be happier actually
if you're 100% with your taxes.

00:10:09.372 --> 00:10:11.050
I hope that's motivation
for everybody.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.720
But if you think about it,
when our mind is in the future,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.360
the emotions that
brings up is anxiety.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.150
It's negative emotions,
oftentimes-- not always,

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.994
but oftentimes.

00:10:25.994 --> 00:10:27.410
But even when
you're more present,

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.743
you're actually more productive.

00:10:28.743 --> 00:10:29.694
You can get more done.

00:10:29.694 --> 00:10:32.110
And we can actually spend a
lot of time not being present.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.422
And because of how much we
were interrupted during the day

00:10:35.422 --> 00:10:37.880
through technology, which is
a wonderful thing, obviously--

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.620
we're at Google.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.007
But on the same level,
we are interrupted

00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:43.840
a lot through text
messages, through phones,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.440
through e-mails,
through messaging.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.100
And we're constantly
being pulled out

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.710
of what we're doing,
which actually

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.680
impacts our productivity a lot.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.760
More than being interrupted,
we interrupt ourselves

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.255
by taking that phone
and checking it

00:10:57.255 --> 00:10:59.130
for no good reason in
the middle of something

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.499
that we're doing which
we were focused on.

00:11:01.499 --> 00:11:03.290
The other thing that's
a very big predictor

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.610
of our success and our
happiness is our relationships

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.740
with other people.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.450
And those are very
important in the workplace.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.880
And one thing that very
successful people seem to have

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.160
is charisma.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.530
And we often think of
charisma as this skill,

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.655
this special je ne sais
quoi that you're born with.

00:11:22.655 --> 00:11:25.030
These people just walk in the
room, and they're magnetic.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.464
And they just-- it's like a
gift or it's some kind of talent

00:11:29.464 --> 00:11:32.310
that they have.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.480
But what research shows
is that no, it's not.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.250
It's a skill.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.320
It's something you can master.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.310
So the examples are
often given of people

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.862
like Bill Clinton, who
apparently would just

00:11:41.862 --> 00:11:43.320
come in the room,
and he would make

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.512
you feel like you were the
only person in the room.

00:11:47.512 --> 00:11:49.720
So people with charisma are
often described that way.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.860
I felt like I was the
only person in the room.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.200
What does that mean, actually?

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.210
It just means that
that person was

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.450
being 100% present with you.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.490
And if you look at
charisma and research

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.950
on charisma, what
the data shows is

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.430
that it has a lot to do
with being able to be fully

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.760
present with another person.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.580
And think about it.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.200
How often is somebody
really present with you?

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.800
How often are you
talking to someone,

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.930
and they're scanning the room?

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.920
Or they're like, oh really, and
they're looking at their phone?

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.120
Or you're talking to
them, and you're like,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.260
they're not listening
to me right now.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.610
You can tell.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.509
It's so rare to
actually have someone

00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:26.550
who fully listens to you.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.040
Other skills of highly
charismatic people

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.610
is the ability to empathize
with another person,

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.700
to really understand what
they're going through.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.990
And you can only do that
if you're 100% tuned in.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.070
Our physiology is
built for empathy.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.190
That's why when you see
someone tripping down the hall,

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.370
you cringe.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.520
That's why when you look at
someone who's face crinkles up

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.970
because they're crying
or who is angry,

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.676
you mirror that person with
your own facial muscles,

00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:55.800
whether you know it or not.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.130
And that's what empathy is.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.360
But if you're not
fully present, you

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.970
don't tap into that very
natural skill that you have.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.280
So I could go on about
empathy, but there

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.250
are a lot of reasons to
why presence actually makes

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.550
us more successful and happier.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.740
And I could go more
into that later too.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.250
So focusing on the future--
yes, it's a good thing,

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:21.020
but most of the time,
we want to stay present.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.860
Next is the idea of no
success without stress,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.664
that it's just impossible not
to have stress in some capacity.

00:13:27.664 --> 00:13:29.080
And I would think
that's something

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.590
we all really buy into.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.580
And short-term
stress is fantastic.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.502
It gets us through
that deadline.

00:13:36.502 --> 00:13:38.960
It gets us across the street
when there's oncoming traffic.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.140
It mobilizes our entire
body to just move forward

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.137
towards a goal.

00:13:43.137 --> 00:13:44.720
But if you're having
it all the time--

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.580
and I'm sure you've heard
this ad nauseum because it's

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.400
been talked about so much-- it
actually breaks your body down.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.020
But it also breaks
your mind down.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.300
It impacts skills
like attention.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.660
It impacts skills like memory.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.080
It impacts skills like
emotional intelligence,

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.690
the ability to respond
to people in a way that's

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.060
really skillful.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.770
It impacts your
decision making as well.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.290
Yet, we've come to a
point where we completely

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.850
depend on that adrenaline.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.250
That's why we've
over-caffeinate.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.670
That's why we
over-schedule ourselves.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.880
That's why we wait until the
last minute to get things done.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.120
Because there's just a
sense, that's the only way.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.090
And that's why we
do all of that.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.390
And yet, that's why we burn-out.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.950
Because when you're constantly
in a state of high adrenaline,

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.190
your body is overworking
all the time,

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.910
and you are wearing
yourself out completely,

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.520
which is why-- oh, it's 2:00 PM.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.610
I need another coffee.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.200
I need another jolt
because I'm so exhausted.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.660
There's a better way
to manage your energy,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.714
and that's to tap into another
part of your nervous system,

00:14:44.714 --> 00:14:46.880
which is the parasympathetic
nervous system, to calm

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.050
yourself down.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.680
And I've worked with arguably
the most stressed individuals

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.930
in our society, which are
veterans returning from Iraq

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.150
and Afghanistan with trauma.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.259
They're locked into a permanent
state of fight-or-flight

00:14:58.259 --> 00:14:59.800
because of what
they've been through,

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.980
which was-- it's a very normal
reaction to a very unusual

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.020
circumstance of being at war.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:11.610
And working without them, I saw
that the therapies that they

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.780
were going through hadn't helped
those who were in the study,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.560
nor had the pharmaceuticals.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.750
And the intervention
we used with them

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.190
is an intervention
that taps right

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.160
into the parasympathetic nervous
system, which is a very simple.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.590
You're doing it right now.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.680
It's breathing.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.820
We don't tap into this.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.310
And it's a really
fantastic, best-kept secret

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.200
about the breath.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.950
And I go into this
a lot in the book.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.330
But just in short, when
you breathe deeply,

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:44.140
when you breathe slowly, and
when you lengthen your exhales,

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.920
you are relaxing
your entire body.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.340
Your heart rate decreases.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.600
Your blood pressure decreases.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.690
So if you remember
anything from today,

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:59.520
remember, slow, deepen
and lengthen the exhales

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.020
especially.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.936
When you're inhale, your
heart rate increases.

00:16:01.936 --> 00:16:04.270
When you exhale, your
heart rate decreases.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.240
So if it worked for them,
it can work for you as well.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.962
So it's why I'm
sharing this with you.

00:16:08.962 --> 00:16:10.920
And I also know that your
well-being group here

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.170
teaches a lot about breathing.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.920
So you should definitely
look into that.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.976
I want to tell you
a story about that.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.600
And just-- because
it sounds so simple.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.266
We've all heard it--
take a deep breath.

00:16:20.266 --> 00:16:20.810
Who cares?

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.840
Well, here's a story.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.810
A friend of mine,
Jake, was probably

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.620
on the most stressful
commute you could imagine.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:34.150
He was on a military
convoy in Afghanistan.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:40.630
He was the officer in charge
of the very last vehicle.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.470
Somehow, none of
the other vehicles

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.540
drove over this IED, the
Improvised Explosive Device,

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.300
but his did.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.840
He heard a really loud bang.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.400
When the dust settled,
he looked down

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.950
and his legs were
severed below the knee.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.650
He had learned a
breathing technique

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.200
in a book called "On Combat"
by Lieutenant Colonel

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.210
Grossman, which was
a book that helped

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:10.849
military members to learn some
skills, including breathing.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.734
He learned a
technique, which-- I

00:17:12.734 --> 00:17:15.150
think it's called the square
breath-- which you breathe in

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.960
for for, hold for four, out
for four, hold for four.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.720
He dropped right into
that in that moment.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.560
He had the presence
of mind to do that.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.130
And as he did that,
he had the wherewithal

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.490
to check on his men-- is
everybody OK-- to then give

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.340
orders to call in for help.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.800
He had the presence of mind
to look down at his legs

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.370
and tourniquet them himself,
to lift them up, prop them up.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.370
And then when he knew
that everything was done--

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.130
he had done his
duty and that help

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.750
was coming-- that's when
he laid down and passed out

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.370
at that moment.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.740
Later he was told
if he hadn't done

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.210
that, he would have bled to
death or fallen into a coma.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:56.810
So it's a very intense
example, I know.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.230
But it's also an
example that really

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.410
shows us the power we
have over our own mind,

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.950
no matter what
we're going through,

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.330
to calm ourselves-- even if
we're not saving our life.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.470
That day, we may
be saving our day.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:14.850
We may be able to resolve a
situation much, much better.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.000
So please take this with you.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.390
And so the idea is
here that yes, we

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.800
have a lot of stressful
situations that come at us.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.900
We have a lot of demands.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.060
They can be work demands.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.140
They can be personal demands.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.890
But we have the choice
of how resilient

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.170
we are in that moment.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:33.580
We do have a choice.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.560
And we've often been told, oh,
just talk yourself out of it.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.290
Or you try to talk yourself
into being more relaxed.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.370
It doesn't really work.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.190
We know that.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.300
But you can tap into your
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.850
We're so used to being
always in fight-or-flight.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.690
So just learning to actually
tap into that other side--

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.640
it's a real gift that we have.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.520
So strengthen your resilience.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.530
So the next idea is to persevere
at all costs-- just keep going.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.000
Sometimes, it means burning
the candle at both ends.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.180
Sometimes it means completely
exhausting yourself

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.250
because you just have to do it.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.250
And again here, what we're
doing is we're really

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.080
mismanaging our energy.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.800
So just as I was
saying that we choose

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.480
to tap into our
adrenaline-- we want

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.074
to be stressed in order
to get through things.

00:19:16.074 --> 00:19:17.490
We've gotten to
the point where we

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.600
think we can't get something
done unless we really

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:26.550
do have this high-intensity
life adrenaline rush.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.870
We actually think the same
thing, even in our leisure.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:35.894
So if you ask Americans
to define happiness,

00:19:35.894 --> 00:19:36.810
it's very interesting.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.540
Because happiness can be
defined in different ways.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:45.150
For example, happy emotions
include calmness, serenity,

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:45.870
peacefulness.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.810
They include emotions
on the other side

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.810
of intensity-- excitement,
thrill, enthusiasm, elation.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:56.910
If you ask Americans to define
happiness, they will say,

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:00.370
excitement, enthusiasm, thrill,
elation, which is-- there's

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.370
nothing wrong with that.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.510
It's fantastic.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.767
But we really love high
intensity at every level.

00:20:06.767 --> 00:20:09.100
We like high intensity in
terms of our negative emotions

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.058
because we think it will
get us more work done.

00:20:11.058 --> 00:20:13.780
And we like it in
our leisure as well.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.980
And again, here I'm just
talking about energy management.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.730
It's fantastic to
be enthusiastic.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.230
So in fact, I'm pretty
enthusiastic right now.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:25.020
But the idea is to
manage your energy.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.414
So when you don't
need to be giving your

00:20:27.414 --> 00:20:29.330
all, when you don't need
to be in high stress,

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.540
when you don't need to
be in high intensity,

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.757
that you don't have to be.

00:20:33.757 --> 00:20:35.840
And I'm going to share
with you a tip because this

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.330
is a working tip in terms
of energy management.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.940
But also later, I'm going to
go into why this actually makes

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.710
you more creative as well.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.450
If you have your
day in front of you

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.820
with your number of
tasks that you have,

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.760
the best way for you
to manage your energy

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.500
and to tap into your most
creative potential for that day

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:58.990
is to sandwich high and
low intensity activities

00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.576
back to back.

00:20:59.576 --> 00:21:01.200
And what I mean by
that, high intensity

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.699
is the ones that are very
intellectually rigorous,

00:21:03.699 --> 00:21:04.740
intellectually demanding.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.790
They do require all
of your attention.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.730
And then the ones that are
lower intensity are the ones

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.627
that you can do, but they let
your mind wander a little bit.

00:21:13.627 --> 00:21:14.960
They let you relax a little bit.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.940
It could be cleaning your desk.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.300
It could be entering data.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.570
Whatever those-- or maybe
administrative paperwork,

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.420
whatever it is that's
not so demanding.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.504
And when you alternate
that, not only will it help

00:21:23.504 --> 00:21:25.336
you manage your energy,
but it will actually

00:21:25.336 --> 00:21:27.880
make you more creative and more
productive in those moments

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.046
when you're doing the high
intensity activities that

00:21:30.046 --> 00:21:32.190
are very demanding.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.350
So that is all based
on some research

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.530
in organizational psychology.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.570
So the next one is
focus on your niche.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.320
This one sounds like
it really makes sense.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.520
You really have to focus.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.260
And in order to come up with
the most innovative disruptive

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.750
solutions in your
field, you really

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.002
need to be a master of it.

00:21:53.002 --> 00:21:54.960
You need to read up on
the latest developments.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.050
You need to know everything
that's going on all the time.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.570
And if you look at
what CEOs are looking

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.720
for in the incoming workforce,
the number one thing

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.760
that they say they want
in incoming employees

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.400
is creativity.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.330
Of course, right?

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.730
Because you have to come
up with novel solutions

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.020
to be the best in your field.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.420
And yet if you look at
research on creativity,

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:26.190
we are at our most creative
when our mind is very relaxed

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.460
and very idle.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.960
Have you ever had
that happen to you

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.640
when you're just about to go to
sleep, and you're lying there,

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.760
and all the sudden, you
have this great idea

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.520
about this thing
you were working on?

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.180
Or you're in the shower.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.340
And you're like, oh
my gosh, the solution

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.590
is here-- that eureka moment.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.720
And there's a lot of
data to back that up.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.840
Our brain is most
creative when it's

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.530
in delta mode, which is that
really relaxed day-dreamy,

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:59.610
idle, a little sleepy moment.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.640
And that's something that we
sometimes these days never

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.840
access-- never access.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.460
Think about it.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.960
I'm not going to
ask how many of you

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.470
sleep with your phone
under your pillow

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.150
or right there in hand's
reach, but I would probably

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.439
say most of you.

00:23:14.439 --> 00:23:14.980
I don't know.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.896
I don't want to judge.

00:23:15.896 --> 00:23:18.930
But in general, most people
do that, right, because you

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.120
have to for whatever reason.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.090
But what that means
is when you wake up,

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.840
you look at your screen.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.070
You're focused.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.540
Then you get up to do whatever.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.419
You're commuting or whatever
it is that you're doing.

00:23:30.419 --> 00:23:32.960
If you're standing at the bus,
you're looking at your screen.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.200
You're waiting for a plane.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.460
You're looking at your screen.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.640
All those-- you're
standing at the groceries.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.619
Send off another
quick e-mail or text.

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:41.910
Again, nothing wrong with that.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.159
It's so great to be connected.

00:23:43.159 --> 00:23:46.760
And yet in the past, we would
take those moments to be idle.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.800
We would wait for the bus, and
we would just wait for the bus.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.470
We would stand in
line at the groceries,

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.560
and we'd just stand in
line at the groceries.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.870
And those were moments
that were really

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:59.840
priming our mind to hove those
creative, innovative insights.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.070
We can spend our
entire day focused.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.070
Not only is this
energy mismanagement,

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.470
but it's also hampering
our creative ability, which

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.510
is arguably one of the
most important things

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:12.516
no matter in your work
or your personal life.

00:24:12.516 --> 00:24:13.140
Think about it.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.190
I don't know how many
of you have kids,

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.981
but sometimes, it takes
a lot of creativity

00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:19.810
to get them to eat some food
or to get them to sleep.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:23.150
So these are all things
that we need to-- besides,

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.590
creativity brings a lot of joy.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:28.290
And I interviewed some of the
greatest and most creative

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.540
minds when I was writing
"The Happiness Track"--

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.840
Nobel laureates,
award-winning writers.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.710
And what I found
again and again was

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.170
that they make time for
silence, walks by themselves

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.040
without a phone.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.350
They make time for
meditation and activities

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.180
that really just calm
and settle their mind.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.560
They also make time to
diversify what they're doing.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.500
Instead of focusing
only on their niche,

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.832
they're learning completely
different things.

00:24:52.832 --> 00:24:55.290
How many of you are aware of
a platform called InnoCentive?

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:03.630
Yeah, it's an online platform
in which organizations like NASA

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.060
will pose a problem.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:10.540
We need to find a new kind
of fuel made from corn that's

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.500
really efficient and
environmentally friendly,

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.300
or something like that.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.720
And when you look at-- and
so scientists and engineers

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.110
respond and they can make
some money off of that.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.160
When you look at who is
most likely to resolve

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.730
the problems posed, it's
not people in that field.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.390
It's people just outside of
it, that ability to see things

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.000
from a different perspective.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.934
And that's what
generates creativity.

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:37.600
So it's so great to
focus on your niche.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.760
Yes, be an expert.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.540
But don't limit yourself.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.410
Research on students who take
semesters abroad or do semester

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.200
at sea shows that
when they come back

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.890
after witnessing new
cultures, new ways of being,

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.770
are much more creative
than other people.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:56.960
So this should be an excuse-- an
excuse to disengage from work,

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.460
an excuse to learn those
different things that you want

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.001
to learn but that you just don't
have time for because you're

00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:06.720
so busy, an excuse to
really take some time

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.690
to just be idle and do nothing,
which is so counter-intuitive

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.100
and seems so counterproductive.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.170
And yet, it is the
most productive thing

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:17.470
you can do that also is going
to boost your well-being in so

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.234
many ways.

00:26:19.234 --> 00:26:20.900
Here's another-- play
to your strengths.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.640
So we actually really have
always learned that, right?

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.850
OK, I'm a math person.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.010
Therefore, I must do
math kind of things.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.460
Or I'm a people person.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.587
Or I'm just not a
creative person.

00:26:32.587 --> 00:26:33.670
Or I am a creative person.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:34.774
So we have this sense.

00:26:34.774 --> 00:26:36.440
And again when you
look at the research,

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.740
what does the research say?

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.990
Our brains are meant to
develop and to learn.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.160
And we know that our brain
will continuously learn.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.960
You can be 91 and you
can learn the piano.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.710
It doesn't matter
how old you are.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.450
And yet when we are married
to this idea of just playing

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:52.616
to our strengths, it also makes
us less resilient sometimes.

00:26:52.616 --> 00:26:54.740
Because as soon as we fail,
we have this idea-- oh,

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.510
I failed at this.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.030
Therefore, I must
not be good at it.

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.380
Therefore, I'm not going
to do that anymore.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.230
So research actually out of
Stanford University-- Carol

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.710
Dweck, a professor there,
has shown this with children,

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:06.500
with adults.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.810
If you believe this idea
that you have certain talents

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.320
and gifts and you don't have
other talents and gifts so you

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.160
should avoid them,
it actually makes

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.807
you less resilient
and more anxious

00:27:16.807 --> 00:27:18.890
and depressed in the face
of failure or challenge.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.890
And it makes you
less likely to grow.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:22.660
I mean, just think about it.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.860
If you stay within the box in
which you identify yourself

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.540
as a people person or a
math person or whatever,

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.420
and you don't go where you
think you're not good at,

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.110
you actually limit
yourself tremendously.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.000
And there's so much data on
that that we can go into.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.730
But it also really ties
into self-criticism.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.839
So we often think of
self-criticism as,

00:27:45.839 --> 00:27:46.880
be your own worst critic.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.840
It's really important
because then, that

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.560
will lead to self-improvement.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.970
That's another huge myth.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.690
So research on
self-criticism shows

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.930
that if you are
self-critical, you're

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.510
more likely to be
anxious, depressed.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.480
You'll have fear of failure.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.396
You're less likely to
be resilient in the face

00:28:03.396 --> 00:28:08.490
of failures, mistakes, which
we all make all the time.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:14.640
And a much better solution
to that is self-compassion.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.390
It sounds really soft, but
it's actually really smart

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.600
and supported by a
lot of hard data.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.414
Self-compassion is
simply the ability

00:28:23.414 --> 00:28:25.080
to treat yourself as
you would a friend.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.550
So let's say you
fail at something.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:33.139
Think about how you speak
to yourself in that moment.

00:28:33.139 --> 00:28:34.180
I'll give you an example.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.263
You're running a marathon.

00:28:35.263 --> 00:28:38.070
You've been training for
months-- first marathon ever.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.730
You're running along.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.500
You trip and fall.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.600
Someone on the sideline
says, you're such a loser.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.000
You can't run.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.660
Oh my gosh, you're never
going to finish this thing.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.300
How do you feel-- compared
to someone in the other side.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.040
Everybody falls.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.750
It's totally normal.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:57.670
You're doing great.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.720
You can totally do this.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.260
Just imagine how the
difference feels.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.440
We're doing the same thing to
ourselves with self-criticism.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.930
Research shows self-criticism
is self-sabotage.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.320
But the ability
to treat yourself

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.920
like that person who
is more supportive

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.740
is how you would
speak to a friend.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.290
Presumably when
your friend fails,

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:19.690
you speak to them like that.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.010
You remind them
everyone makes mistakes.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.080
It's just a human thing.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.380
And you're going to do fine.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.480
And you're being
supportive in that way.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.050
So again, it sounds
very soft, but if you

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.910
are more self-compassionate,
you are more resilient.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.300
You are more likely to
learn from your experiences.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.814
You're more
emotionally resilient,

00:29:39.814 --> 00:29:41.480
and you're more
emotionally intelligent.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.290
And you also have
better relationships

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:44.040
with other people.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.340
That better relationship
with yourself

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.839
translates into
better relationships

00:29:46.839 --> 00:29:48.980
with other people.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.820
So again, instead of playing
your strengths-- play

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:52.590
to your strengths.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.670
I'm not saying you shouldn't.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.260
But I'm saying you
should also branch out.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.009
Because only then are
you going to realize

00:29:57.009 --> 00:30:00.460
the plethora of other
talents that you can develop.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.380
And finally, this is
my very favorite one.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.490
Look out for number one.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.510
Again the idea is it's
a dog-eat-dog world.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:07.810
Sink or swim.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:11.450
Compete at all costs.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.330
There's this idea of
survival of the fittest.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.900
Anybody know who said
survival of the fittest?

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.570
EMMA SEPPALA: No,
he didn't say that.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:23.740
Herbert Spencer,
social Darwinist.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.210
He wanted to justify social
and racial hierarchies.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.682
That's why he
introduced this idea.

00:30:30.682 --> 00:30:32.140
If you look at
Darwin's message, it

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.940
was much more akin to--
what he was saying was

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.540
that sympathy is what
really led to human survival

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:42.290
over the long-run.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:43.140
Look at us.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.210
Look at our skin.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.310
We're so fragile.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.480
We're so vulnerable.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.450
There is no way we could
have lived out in the wild

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:51.840
if we didn't have each other.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.530
It's not even possible.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.050
And that's one of the things
that Darwin was saying,

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:59.650
is that that natural tendency
towards sympathy, empathy,

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:05.070
compassion is the reason
why we were able to survive.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.780
And yet, there's this idea
also in the business world

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.180
and that economists have
propagated that we are selfish.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.320
Aren't we all looking
out for ourselves first?

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.560
Again, no, if you
look at the research.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.060
If you give people
very little time

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.730
to make a decision as to
whether they should act fairly

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:25.010
and generously versus
selfishly, their first instinct

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.390
is to act generously and fairly.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.820
If you give them a little
more time to think about it,

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.370
maybe they'll change their mind.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.690
But the same is
true in children.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.190
The same is true
with animals-- rats.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.802
If a rat sees another
rat suffering,

00:31:39.802 --> 00:31:41.510
that they can help
out of their quandary,

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.560
they are going to do it.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.550
At that level of
rats-- and then we

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.910
see it in much more evolved
animals too, like apes,

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:54.750
and chimps, and human beings
as small as 2 years old--

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:58.130
they will help if they see
someone in need of help.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:01.310
It's very much within
our nervous system.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.570
It's very much a very
natural tendency within us.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:09.410
And yet, we hear that,
but aren't we all selfish?

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.257
There is a very
interesting study

00:32:12.257 --> 00:32:13.840
conducted at Stanford
Business School,

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:19.900
actually, by Dale Miller looking
at why people don't help when

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.560
they're given the opportunity.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.680
And often, people
will stop themselves

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.430
because the norm
of self-interest,

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.890
because of this idea that's out
there that we are all selfish.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:35.580
So for example in one
study, these men were asked,

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.330
would you like to support
this breast cancer event?

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.700
And they said, sure.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.350
And then later, they
changed their mind

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:44.975
when they were finding out that
they had to go to this meeting.

00:32:44.975 --> 00:32:47.030
When they were asked,
well, why, the idea was

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.660
that maybe people would
think they were there

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.540
to pick up women because it
was an all-female event, right?

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.790
So they were stopping
themselves from doing something

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:57.300
they wanted to help
because they thought, well,

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.010
everyone else is going to
think I'm doing it selfishly.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.176
There are a number of reasons
why we stop ourselves.

00:33:01.176 --> 00:33:03.930
But let's look at the workplace.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:07.770
I'll give you an example
of someone I'll call Drake.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:10.709
He worked in an investment bank.

00:33:10.709 --> 00:33:12.250
And he moved to this
investment bank.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.840
It was called Bear Stearns.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.110
It went under a
number of years ago.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.330
But he moved into that
bank from another bank.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:22.710
And when he got there, it
was such a ruthless place.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:25.192
The other people at his
level, the other MDs,

00:33:25.192 --> 00:33:26.900
wouldn't even address
him in the hallway.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.255
They wouldn't even say hello.

00:33:28.255 --> 00:33:30.130
People would compete
for each other's clients

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:33.500
and try to steal credit
for each other's work.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.940
It was completely ruthless.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.880
And when Drake arrived
there, he thought, well,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.680
I can't do anything about
the people around me.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.150
But he is a very kind person.

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:45.000
He's a very supportive person.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.440
And he wasn't going
to change his values.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.490
So he actually started
treating the associates

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.640
who worked with him
according to his values.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.890
And he treated them very well.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.750
He gave them opportunities they
wouldn't otherwise have had.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.920
The other bankers would
work the associates

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.800
into the ground on Sunday
night after coming back

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.546
from their vacation
home in Long Island.

00:34:06.546 --> 00:34:08.420
They would call their
associates and be like,

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.550
I need this by tomorrow
morning on my desk,

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.261
even if it wasn't
due the next morning.

00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:13.969
And then the associates
would be expected

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:16.610
to work throughout the
rest of the day as well.

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.394
So they would do all
these brutal things.

00:34:19.394 --> 00:34:20.310
And that was the norm.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.570
So Drake didn't do that.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.820
In fact, he gave the employees
a lot of opportunities.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.185
He took them to client
meetings, let them present,

00:34:26.185 --> 00:34:28.560
do things that they never
would have done at their level.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.230
What ended up happening is
he won one of the largest

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.530
deals in his field.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.540
And he continued
doing really well.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.219
And the associates would work
with the partners or the MDs

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:40.469
that they wanted to work with.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:42.190
So the MDs would pitch,
and the associates

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.750
could decide who they
wanted to work with.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:45.420
Usually, they would work with
the person who would usually

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.139
bring in the greatest
deals because that

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:48.263
was in their best interest.

00:34:48.263 --> 00:34:49.699
But once they
started finding out

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:51.050
how Drake was treating
people, they all

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:52.120
started working with him.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.540
And he started doing so
well, to the point where

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.969
the other MDs, for
the first time ever,

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.760
actually came up to him and
were like, what are you doing?

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.670
Why does everyone
want to work with you?

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:05.350
And so if you look at
research across the board,

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:10.190
research shows that when our
leaders and our colleagues

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.700
are more positive, are more
supportive, we're more loyal.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.220
We're more engaged.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.530
Our health is better.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:21.400
And employers often
think, well, employees

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.690
are only as loyal as the
biggest paycheck, right?

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.792
If someone next door gives
them a bigger paycheck,

00:35:26.792 --> 00:35:27.750
they're going to leave.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.690
But research shows
that no, employees

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:33.360
prefer to be happy
in a workplace

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.160
than to get a bigger
paycheck elsewhere.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.240
And that happiness is defined
by their social relationships

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.291
with other people, by the
level of kindness and support

00:35:41.291 --> 00:35:42.540
that they have for each other.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.081
And if you think about it, we
spend more and more of our time

00:35:45.081 --> 00:35:46.760
at work of the day.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:50.179
We probably spend more time at
work than with our families.

00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:51.720
So this is a place
where we obviously

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.928
want to feel that connection.

00:35:52.928 --> 00:35:55.370
We obviously want to
feel that happiness.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.360
There's so much more to say.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.440
I'm going to stop here
and I'll take questions.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.160
And I really hope
that from today, you

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.784
can take with you that
taking care of yourself

00:36:06.784 --> 00:36:08.200
is the best thing
you can do-- not

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.592
just for your own happiness,
but for your professional goals.

00:36:11.592 --> 00:36:13.800
And not just taking care of
yourself, but also taking

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.240
care of those around you.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.632
And one more thing
about that is that as I

00:36:18.632 --> 00:36:20.340
spoke about at the
beginning of the talk,

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.320
happiness can be defined as
this more pleasurable happiness,

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.887
which is very short-lived, or
a more meaningful life that's

00:36:26.887 --> 00:36:28.345
defined by compassion,
by kindness,

00:36:28.345 --> 00:36:30.310
and by caring for other people.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.350
And research shows
that when you do engage

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:35.740
in a life that goes beyond
yourself that involves

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.340
being a positive impact and
being someone who uplifts

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.510
other people, you're also
not just going to be happier,

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.200
you're going to be healthier.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.310
You're going to even
live a longer life.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:49.010
So there is so much
data to back up

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:52.210
why happiness is such an
important feature of our lives

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:55.390
and why it's also-- you don't
have to sacrifice it in order

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.220
to be successful.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.431
Thank you so much.

00:36:58.431 --> 00:37:01.317
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:08.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.180
And thanks so much
for your talk.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.510
I have a number of
questions about-- I

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:19.680
guess the first one is
stress being problematic.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:23.880
Is it due to a
level of intensity

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.170
that is beyond
someone's capacity,

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.630
or is it because
there's disempowerment?

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:32.190
Is it because you're
given problems

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.920
that you don't feel
you can possibly solve

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.630
and you get into
this hopeless state?

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.540
So kind of another
way of asking this

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:45.590
is, is it possible to work
sustainably at high intensity

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:48.380
when you don't feel
disempowered without it having

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.890
adverse effect on your health?

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:50.760
EMMA SEPPALA: Thanks
for asking that.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.520
Absolutely.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.242
The truth is we can't
control our environment.

00:37:54.242 --> 00:37:55.700
Stressful things
will happen to us,

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.940
whether we're in a stressful
work environment or not.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.060
We'll have personal
things that happen

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.101
to us that are stressful.

00:38:00.101 --> 00:38:01.160
We all have in this room.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.020
We've all had it.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.620
We all will continue to have it.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.950
The only thing we can control
is our internal resilience.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:09.600
And we can build
that resilience up so

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.530
that we are more capable of
dealing with those situations

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.150
without being so
torn up by them.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.256
So that's my point there.

00:38:17.256 --> 00:38:18.880
And one of the ways
of breathing, but I

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.770
talk about some other
ways as well in the book.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.430
But that was mine.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:25.605
Thanks for asking.

00:38:25.605 --> 00:38:26.980
AUDIENCE: So
related to that-- do

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:30.650
you know of people, for
example, who can work in Silicon

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:34.540
Valley at the pace of the
tech world sustainably,

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.470
but through breathing
techniques and other techniques,

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:41.910
they're able to avoid a
lot of the common pitfalls

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:47.137
but still keep this high
pace of work output?

00:38:47.137 --> 00:38:49.636
EMMA SEPPALA: Well, there's--
anybody know Mark [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:49.636 --> 00:38:50.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:52.000
EMMA SEPPALA: When you
say he exemplifies that?

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.570
AUDIENCE: Pretty much.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:53.800
EMMA SEPPALA: Mark [INAUDIBLE]
teaches these breathing

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.830
practices at Google.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:56.660
He's been working here forever.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:00.300
And he absolutely comes
to mind when you ask that.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.427
I highly recommend
that you all meet him.

00:39:02.427 --> 00:39:04.510
And then I guess, does he
teach with you guys or--

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:05.527
FEMALE SPEAKER: No,
it's a separate program

00:39:05.527 --> 00:39:06.540
called sky meditation.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.280
EMMA SEPPALA: He
teaches sky meditation,

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.270
which is the breathing that I
research with veterans as well.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:14.992
So I recommend taking his class.

00:39:14.992 --> 00:39:16.450
AUDIENCE: You made
a great argument

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.452
for being compassionate
towards yourself,

00:39:19.452 --> 00:39:21.160
breathing being one
way to tap into that.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:26.009
What other tools do you see
as being key to self-care?

00:39:26.009 --> 00:39:27.800
EMMA SEPPALA: Self-care
or self-compassion.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.883
AUDIENCE: Self-compassion.

00:39:28.883 --> 00:39:30.700
EMMA SEPPALA: Self-compassion.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.272
Another way is just watching
how you talk you yourself.

00:39:33.272 --> 00:39:35.510
It's a hard one, especially
because we have so much

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.980
bought into this idea that we
have to criticize ourselves.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.320
And we've heard
other people do it.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.750
And it's really just
having that internal check.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.140
And I think that's where also
practices like meditation

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.090
can help, because you can
become more aware of what's

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:49.869
going on on the inside.

00:39:49.869 --> 00:39:51.910
And then you can also do
something very concrete,

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.160
which is-- and it can
sound a little cheesy,

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.070
but it actually works,
research shows--

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.292
writing yourself a
letter in the face--

00:39:58.292 --> 00:40:00.000
let's say you've just
failed at something

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.305
and you feel completely
down about yourself.

00:40:02.305 --> 00:40:03.930
Writing a letter as
if you were writing

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.720
to a friend to
whom this happened

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.351
can be very therapeutic.

00:40:07.351 --> 00:40:08.600
So those are some of the ways.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.010
The other thing is also to
have a self-compassion mantra

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.380
or some kind of phrase that
you already know by heart

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.650
so that you can bring
it up in that moment.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.420
It could be-- whatever it is.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.620
In fact, the woman who started
research on self-compassion,

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.380
she had a child with autism.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.180
And it was a little boy.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.410
And they were on a plane, and
he was having a huge crisis.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:28.980
And the bathrooms were closed.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.840
She couldn't get
into the bathroom.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.624
She had to be there
with him, making

00:40:32.624 --> 00:40:33.790
this huge fuss on the plane.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.260
There was nothing she could do.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.835
And that in that moment,
she became very aware

00:40:38.835 --> 00:40:40.210
of the impact of
self-compassion.

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:42.340
If she could soothe
herself in that moment,

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.490
she could handle that
crisis, which there was

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.110
nothing she could do otherwise.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.812
So it's very powerful.

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:50.020
And she suggests having
these self-compassion matras,

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:53.350
so maybe just a phrase
that you bring to mind

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:55.500
and that you just know
ahead of time that you

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.150
can tell yourself.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.770
Yeah.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:58.603
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:58.603 --> 00:41:00.856
EMMA SEPPALA: Thank
you for asking.

00:41:00.856 --> 00:41:02.650
AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:03.840
Thank you, Emma, for coming.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.094
This was a great talk.

00:41:06.094 --> 00:41:08.260
I'm just looking at the
slide that you have up there

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.280
about look out for number one.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.050
What advice would you
have for organizations

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:18.460
to build a system which doesn't
encourage people to just chase

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.830
for number one and
be more cooperative,

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:25.790
inclusive, and have more
psychological safety

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:27.860
and trust with each
other as also governing

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.822
factors of success, not
just who's at the top?

00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:33.780
EMMA SEPPALA: Well, that's
one of the reasons I

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.040
wrote this book.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.220
It's categorized in the
business category for a reason.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.300
If employers, if
leaders know about this,

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.150
they will impact the
entire organization.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:47.050
And by impacting and benefiting
the entire organization,

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.540
they also benefit all of
those employees' families.

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.910
I mean, it's a
huge repercussion.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.270
And really what I would
say is, look at the data.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:58.880
There is so much data now that
shows that having a bad boss

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.390
is bad for your heart, like
it leads to heart problems.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:06.670
It leads to higher
inflammation, literally.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:07.510
This is dramatic.

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:10.260
And yet, people
don't know about it.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.460
And the opposite is true.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.470
So if you have a
organization that's

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:17.595
supported by trust,
respect, empathy, it

00:42:17.595 --> 00:42:18.970
doesn't mean you
have to be soft.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.720
It doesn't mean you
have to be a pushover.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.340
You can still give feedback.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.570
But you can do it in a
supportive way instead

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:26.120
of like in an accusatory way.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:31.396
The other day I was in the--
which newspaper was it?

00:42:31.396 --> 00:42:34.320
In the "Wall Street
Journal," there

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.120
was an article about
front-stabbing.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.292
It was this organization
that was all about,

00:42:38.292 --> 00:42:39.500
let's stop backstabbing here.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.240
Let's start front-stabbing.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.140
Give it to people.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.140
And then they'll learn.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.150
And it just goes so
against the data.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.544
I mean, that's a great way to
not just stress individuals

00:42:49.544 --> 00:42:51.710
out and bring them down and
make them want to leave.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:54.000
There are so many
reasons not to do that.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.164
But you can give feedback.

00:42:56.164 --> 00:42:57.080
You can give feedback.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.913
And you can do it in a
really supportive way

00:42:58.913 --> 00:42:59.880
that helps people grow.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.350
And it actually makes
them more loyal to you.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.411
I'll tell you a story.

00:43:04.411 --> 00:43:06.910
Actually, this is a story that
I wrote about in the "Harvard

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:10.270
Business Review" interviewing
actually my current-- my boss,

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.240
who's also a neurosurgeon.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.350
When he was a young
resident, he was

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:20.070
helping the surgeon do this
very complicated brain surgery.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.490
And he was so nervous
that he was sweating.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:26.260
And his sweat dripped
into the operation area.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.004
The surgeon was so angry at him.

00:43:29.004 --> 00:43:30.920
He just kicked him out
of the room-- basically

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:31.711
called him a loser.

00:43:31.711 --> 00:43:33.620
You're never going to
be able to do this.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.510
Now, he knows that if the sweat
has dropped into the area,

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:41.330
you can very easily irrigate
it, and it can be removed fast.

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:42.980
Now, the same
thing happened when

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.780
Dr. Doherty was
himself a surgeon

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.090
and he had a resident come in.

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:52.140
And the resident, in one
moment, did not pay attention,

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.420
and he pierced a vein
in the operation.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.400
There was blood
all over the brain.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.890
In the moment, Dr. Doherty
couldn't see what he was doing

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:03.810
and he could have cost him
the life of this person.

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:07.130
Fortunately he reached in
and blindly clipped that vein

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:09.060
and was able to save it.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:13.910
But in that moment, what he
did was he told the resident,

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:15.630
why don't you go outside?

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.660
You know, just calm yourself.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.730
And when you're ready,
you can come back inside.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.640
And we'll talk
about how we can--

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.960
and I'll teach you a few things.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.830
What a different response.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.616
Think about if you
were that resident how

00:44:28.616 --> 00:44:29.990
you would feel
toward that person

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.920
for the rest of your life.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.794
Obviously, you're
devastated by your mistake.

00:44:32.794 --> 00:44:35.147
But you'll probably be loyal
to that person forever.

00:44:35.147 --> 00:44:36.480
That's inspirational leadership.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.359
That is true loyalty.

00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:38.900
If someone else
comes along and says,

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:42.170
hey, why don't you come work for
me, they'll be like, I'm sorry.

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:45.250
I love this person--
literally, right?

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.560
AUDIENCE: So I read the intro
to your book [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.270
as far as I've gotten, and it
was really, really captivating.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:54.700
It's just this great microcosm
of that super busy tech Silicon

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:58.770
Valley life where you're just
chasing something day in,

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:00.140
day out.

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.180
So really, it kind
of just drew me in.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.660
My question is, let's
say you can get past some

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.164
of those extrinsic motivators.

00:45:07.164 --> 00:45:08.830
You start to be more
self-compassionate,

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.520
self-loving, and you
recognize that you

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.895
don't have to do everything,
accomplish everything, to be

00:45:12.895 --> 00:45:14.040
a good person.

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.910
And it's just more
about choosing.

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:19.830
Should I take the 10 minutes
before bed to brush my teeth

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:21.460
or to do some stretching, yoga?

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:22.654
Should I read a book?

00:45:22.654 --> 00:45:24.070
There's so many
things we could do

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:26.300
to improve-- learn a language.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.190
Did you encounter, in
the research, anything

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:30.610
about decisiveness or
just sort of choosing

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.082
where to apply that
self-compassion attention

00:45:33.082 --> 00:45:33.582
towards?

00:45:36.669 --> 00:45:38.460
EMMA SEPPALA: Well,
what the research shows

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.126
is that any of those
activities that you

00:45:40.126 --> 00:45:43.050
talk about that are nourishing
are going to benefit you.

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.070
It's more about choosing between
something that will benefit you

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:49.020
and something that
seems productive

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.230
but that will wear you out.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:54.011
And I think that that's really
the quandary people are in.

00:45:54.011 --> 00:45:58.250
It's like, well, but my
inbox, I could just empty it.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:02.200
There's that desire for the
empty inbox, which never comes.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.930
We all have it, right?

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.670
And yet-- yeah, so
it's more that choice.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:07.336
But I think if you're
choosing something

00:46:07.336 --> 00:46:09.870
that nourishes you
that gives you time

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:12.440
to disengage-- it gives you time
to relax-- it doesn't matter

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.250
what it is as long
as it also involves--

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:19.620
and very much as an individual,
we all know what nourishes us.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.450
For some of us, we need
to go out and be with 20

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:23.020
best friends.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:24.500
For others, we need to be alone.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.107
It just depends, so yeah.

00:46:26.107 --> 00:46:26.940
AUDIENCE: Very cool.

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:27.460
I appreciate that.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:28.060
Thank you.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.060
EMMA SEPPALA: Of course.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.812
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to ask about boredom.

00:46:30.812 --> 00:46:32.520
You were talking a
little bit about that.

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.520
We don't have so much time
sort of off doing nothing.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.930
And I think you mentioned
being bored or boredom.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:41.410
But I'm wondering, is
that sort of the goal,

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:45.340
or is it just
being more relaxed?

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.120
Because I feel like
if I'm bored, I get

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.700
stressed out about being bored.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.408
EMMA SEPPALA: Thank
you for sharing that.

00:46:50.408 --> 00:46:52.290
I need to share
with you this study.

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.710
So in this study--
in the first study,

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.970
participants were
given the choice,

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:59.320
you can either sit there
and just do nothing,

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.840
or you can sit there and
do this really boring task.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.450
People chose to do the
really boring task.

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.980
Then the scientists
looked at, OK, well, here.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.740
You can sit in this
room, do nothing.

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.710
You can either sit
there and do nothing,

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:13.640
or you can play with
that machine that

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.806
gives the electric shocks.

00:47:16.806 --> 00:47:18.930
Even those people who said
the electric shocks were

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:21.170
very disagreeable
and very painful

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:23.420
preferred to do that than
to sit there and do nothing.

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.080
So thank you for
asking that question.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:30.700
There is a profound discomfort
sometimes of doing nothing.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:34.890
And Louis CK, by the way, has
a fantastic episode on that.

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:39.240
But in some sense, it's also
because of our high pressure

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.550
lifestyle and the
anxiety that can arise.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.220
And I saw this a lot with the
veterans that I worked with.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:47.110
If I had just told them
to sit there and meditate

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:50.361
as a first thing that they do,
they may not have taken to it.

00:47:50.361 --> 00:47:52.360
Because the first thing
that we do when we stop,

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.750
especially when we used to go,
go, go, go, going all the time,

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:56.900
is we can feel a lot of
anxiety, like you are saying.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.150
Thank you for sharing
that, because you're not

00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.796
the only one.

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.580
And that's why it can
be-- but it's something

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.600
that if you sit through
it for a little bit

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.810
and if you just get
used to it, that's

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:09.930
going to be much better
than continuously trying

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:11.720
to cover that up with activity.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:15.570
Because that just continues
you into that cycle.

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:17.050
But again, I would
really recommend

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:19.090
doing the breathing,
or the meditation,

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.750
and some of the things that
are going on here-- learning

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:23.180
to just be without discomfort.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.700
Because what happens
is it goes away.

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:29.397
But if we're always covering
it up, it's still there.

00:48:29.397 --> 00:48:30.730
But thanks for bringing that up.

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:31.680
Because you know what?

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.580
I think pretty much
everyone feels that.

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:37.690
And that's probably
the reason why

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:39.280
we so much need to
distract ourselves,

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.310
even if it's work all the time.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:41.840
Yeah.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.546
But if you look at kids, kids
are great people to-- they're

00:48:44.546 --> 00:48:46.420
the most creative
individuals in our society.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.200
They come up with--
you give them nothing

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.532
and they've created a
whole kingdom out of it.

00:48:50.532 --> 00:48:52.740
And they are constantly in
that state of daydreaming.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.540
They're constantly present.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:57.485
They're constantly
connected with one another.

00:48:57.485 --> 00:48:58.860
It's just something
very natural.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.220
So that means we have it
too because we were kids

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.633
once a long time ago.

00:49:02.633 --> 00:49:03.672
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:49:03.672 --> 00:49:04.880
EMMA SEPPALA: You're welcome.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.671
AUDIENCE: So since you
brought up children,

00:49:06.671 --> 00:49:12.050
I have a question where I found
this theme among parents where

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:15.109
there's kind of a desire that,
well now that they're kids

00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:16.900
and they can do all
these different things,

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.765
this is the time to have lots
of variety, lots of-- right?

00:49:19.765 --> 00:49:21.890
Because when they get older
and they get into a job

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:23.810
they'll only do one thing
for the rest of their lives.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:26.620
So let's give them a chance now
to do soccer, tennis, swimming,

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:28.220
ballet, and everything.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:32.700
But then there's the question
of the over-programming.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.050
And I'm wondering
to what extent do

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:39.300
you think there's a benefit to
doing lots of things as opposed

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:44.375
to just doing one
thing in an open time?

00:49:44.375 --> 00:49:46.750
EMMA SEPPALA: Honestly, every
talk I've given on the book

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.120
so far, I've been asked
these questions from parents.

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.210
And it's so poignant.

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:52.970
It's such a good question.

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:56.490
I think that-- one of the women
that I last week she asked,

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:57.996
I could see pain in her eyes.

00:49:57.996 --> 00:50:00.370
She was like, I really want
my child to get into Harvard.

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:02.650
So I have to get her
to do all this stuff.

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.550
And yet, my child
is so stressed.

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:06.730
It's so sad.

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:11.290
I would say have her child
do what makes them happy.

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:15.610
And if it's one activity, and
then they give them time to me.

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:19.690
Give them time to be a
child first and foremost.

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:21.080
It's so interesting.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.360
I shared this [INAUDIBLE]
I was an undergrad at Yale

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.420
and a grad student at
Columbia and Stanford.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.722
And I worked at Stanford.

00:50:27.722 --> 00:50:29.180
And then I worked
at the University

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.510
of Wisconsin Madison,
which is all the best

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:35.600
students in Wisconsin
get into that school.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.490
But it's obviously not like
the Harvard/Yale caliber.

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:42.055
Where were the students most
balanced, most happy, most

00:50:42.055 --> 00:50:44.680
in touch with their values, most
in touch with their community?

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.250
In Wisconsin.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:51.120
And the Stanford and the
Yale students-- so talented.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:55.572
And they're geniuses
in so many ways.

00:50:55.572 --> 00:50:57.530
And they're so-- you
know, I'm sure many of you

00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:59.450
are students who have
been to those places.

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:01.480
And yet, the stress
level is so high.

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.220
They haven't learned
how to relax.

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.996
And also, there's a sense of
disconnect from the community.

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:08.370
And this is a piece of research
that I haven't shared yet

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:11.650
but that I want to share, is
that the most important thing

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:14.390
after food and shelter for our
happiness, well-being, health,

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:17.080
and longevity, is connections--
social connections,

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.890
positive connections--
with other people.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:21.411
And yet, when we're constantly
being told, achieve.

00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:21.910
Be the best.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:22.530
Be number one.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:25.170
Go, go, go-- we
are very stressed,

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:27.320
and we're really self-focused.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.250
I'm not saying we're
selfish, but we're

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:30.410
self-focused naturally.

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:33.080
And when you're stressed, your
self-focus increases naturally.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.360
This is something-- imagine
our ancestors running away

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.550
from some predator.

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:38.810
They'd better be focused
in that moment, right?

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:41.130
And yet, over time
with chronic stress,

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:43.280
and this self-focus
actually leads to misery.

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.260
One in four Americans
says they have no one

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:48.480
to speak to about
a personal problem.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.970
One in four people you
meet is profoundly lonely.

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:55.990
So I'm going to a little bit
of tangent, but not really.

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:58.100
Let's teach our
children to be happy.

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.220
Let's value their happiness.

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.330
They'll be more creative.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:02.454
They'll be more productive.

00:52:02.454 --> 00:52:04.740
They'll work because they
are interested in the topic,

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.090
not because they have
to do it because we

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.035
have to get into Harvard.

00:52:09.035 --> 00:52:10.097
You know what I mean?

00:52:10.097 --> 00:52:10.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:12.480
EMMA SEPPALA: I think it's
such an important question,

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.280
and I'm going to try--
I've been drafting

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.500
an op-ed about it
because I've received

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.850
this question at every talk.

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:21.340
And parents feel
like, I have to keep

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.894
my child on the correct route.

00:52:23.894 --> 00:52:25.810
But at the same time,
there's this disconnect.

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:27.550
So thank you for asking.

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:28.479
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:28.479 --> 00:52:30.020
MELISSA CHOBAN: But
thank you, again.

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.750
And yeah, may
happiness be yours.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.800
[APPLAUSE]
