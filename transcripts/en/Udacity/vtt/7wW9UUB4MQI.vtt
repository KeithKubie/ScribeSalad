In this scene, three viewers, A, B, and C, are looking at a point on a somewhat

00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:09.116
shiny surface, illuminated by one light source. The illumination is calculated

00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:13.244
using the BlinnÃ¢â‚¬â€œPhong lighting model. Which viewers see the brightest diffuse

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:17.582
illumination, if any? Which viewers see the brightest specular highlight, if

00:00:17.582 --> 00:00:18.150
any?
