00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.100
A lot of hay has been made about CRISPR Cas9,
the gene editing technique so precise, so

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.830
easy, so versatile it’s opened the possibility
of chopping and swapping DNA around like a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.280
molecular level Dr. Frankenstein.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.880
The implications are huge for humans and our
genome.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.140
We could alter the genes of embryos, or treat
genetic maladies in those already born.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.120
Now in 2018 clinical trials on humans are
scheduled to start for the first time.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.180
But just as they’re getting underway, there
may be a problem thanks to our immune system.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.780
To understand why our immune system is being
a jerk and preventing us from treating disorders

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.900
like sickle-cell anemia, it helps to step
back and remember exactly what CRISPR Cas9

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.900
is.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.510
It’s actually an immune response bacteria
use to protect themselves from viruses.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.910
Cas9 is a protein the bacteria make that act
as molecular scissors, cutting virus DNA to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.489
ribbons, and two of the most commonly used
types of Cas9 come from bacteria that can

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.130
cause staph infections or strep throat.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.520
These are bacteria we want our immune systems
to have a defense against.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.200
And to defend against them, our immune system
has to be able to recognize the bacteria and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.060
the various proteins they make, so they can
track them down and destroy them.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.310
Sorry I called you a jerk earlier, immune
system, you’re just doing what comes naturally.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.310
&lt;3

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.990
To see if these two versions of Cas9 were
on our immune system’s hit list, researchers

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.070
tested the blood of 34 donors for antibodies.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.939
They found 65 percent had a defense against
the strep version while 79 percent fought

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.539
the staph variety.

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.969
In another experiment with 13 blood donors,
6 of them had t-cells that attacked staph’s

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:36.969
Cas9.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.119
The findings are yet to be peer reviewed,
but one of the authors is the scientific founder

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.060
of a leading CRISPR human therapy company,
so he’s got some credibility.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.840
And if our immune systems respond to CRISPR,
it could mean more that just rendering the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.340
therapy ineffective.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.959
It could make our immune systems go haywire
and kill us, which has happened in a previous

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.600
attempt at human genetic therapy.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.319
The next question is: is this the end of the
line for CRISPR?

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.579
Good game, well played, but our bodies are
just too vigilant for this revolutionary gene

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:05.579
editing?

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.229
Hahaha, no, we’re going to science our way
around this conundrum!

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.970
There are already a few solutions to this
possible problem, like modifying Cas9 into

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.280
a form our immune system can’t recognize,
or using a different protein from the oodles

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.250
of other bacteria that have their own versions
of Cas9.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.019
Or if the protein gets attacked when it’s
in our bodies, then perhaps we could put it

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.930
to work outside our bodies, modifying extracted
cells before returning them to the body.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.370
Or Cas9 could be used in places where the
immune system is locked out, like inside our

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.739
eyes where it could treat hereditary blindness.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.870
CRISPR has way too much potential to let a
little thing like our bodies stop progress.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.719
The findings of these recent experiments are
more of a speed bump than a brick wall.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.599
Medical advances occasionally have to overcome
biological defenses.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.239
For example our blood vessels in our brains
make it really hard to deliver medicine to

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.349
our old noodle.

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.379

a good thing, check out this video here.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.780
We could talk CRISPR all day here at Seeker
so if you have any questions about it go ahead

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.270
and drop them in the comments.
