00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.211
ke that
at all, John.

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.213
No, not my style,
to be sure.

00:00:05.213 --> 00:00:09.676
That is a monstrous weapon,
absolutely monstrous.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:10.927
Reso: Oh, yeah, it is.

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:12.804
That is heavy,
especially up top.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.223
The power and the ability of
this ax is definitely at range.

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:18.017
When this hits, this is gonna do
devastating damage.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.561
To get hit in the head
with this,

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.895
I wouldn't be surprised

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:22.272
if you saw somebody
get knocked out.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.734
Now, for
the tournament sport,

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.902
you basically have
a flat piece of steel

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:29.446
that's pretty thick.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:32.157
Historically, an ax blade
actually would have a, uh,

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.033
three-dimensional
cross section to it.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.453
So you would actually --
thick along the edge somewhat.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:37.871
Then it would
thin out again,

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.956
and then it would curve up
and thicken again.

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.250
And that would reduce
the weight substantially.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.502
And the languets
would also be, um,

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:46.337
a different part
of the blade.

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:47.839
But this piece is adding

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.216
some counterbalance to it,
at least.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.677
Now, sometimes it's said
that double-bladed axes

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:55.430
were only used
in ancient Minoa on Crete.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.516
But we have combat images
of blades like this

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:01.227
being used by Franks
and by, uh --

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.647
in the 9th century --
by Germans in the 13th century,

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.900
and by the French
in the 14th century.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.402
Now, historically,
a blade like this could be used

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.906
to hook on pieces of armor
and to rend and tear it.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.283
But, uh, we don't want that
occurring in this sport.

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:16.868
Right.

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.578
In the ACL, we do not tear
pieces of armor off

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.622
because --
uh, to gain advantage,

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.081
'cause we really don't
want to send anybody home

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.541
to the hos--
to the hospital.

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.835
Yeah.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.754
How 'bout this, um --
the grip down here?

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.380
Is that something that's kind
of added,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.924
or was that something
that we actually saw in relation

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.675
to the period
that these weapons were used?

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:34.844
All manner
of grips and wraps.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:37.013
On a modern ax,
you'll see a rubberized grip.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:38.765
It's the same idea.
With a --

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.934
With a gauntlet, you do not want
your hands slipping around.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.227
This is very slippery.

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:44.312
This keeps it planted
in one hand

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:45.855
so you can maneuver
with it.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:48.399
Especially when you --
in a weapon this heavy,

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.651
when you throw it,

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.152
it's a possibility
with gauntlets

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:52.445
that it could slip
out of your hand.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.155
You don't want to
lose the weapon.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:55.698
With the second hand,
you want to be able to hold it

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:57.283
as it follows through.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.910
If you miss a shot,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.789
this ax is going to
come way out of play,

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.457
leaving you wide open.
