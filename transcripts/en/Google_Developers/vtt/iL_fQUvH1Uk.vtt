TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.930
and this is your
first update in 2018

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.030
about the coolest
developer news from Google

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.980
in the last couple of weeks.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.960
Configuring and maintaining
IP-based firewall rules

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.680
is a complex and
manual process that

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.897
can lead to unauthorized
access if done incorrectly,

00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:18.480
which is why we're
excited to announce

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.550
the support for
service accounts.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.890
They simplify the application
management lifecycle

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.230
by providing
mechanisms to manage

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.770
authentication and
authorization of applications.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.009
More details and
screenshots are on the post.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.900
You can now attach NVIDIA
K80 and NVIDIA P100 GPUs

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.140
to Preemptible VMs
for 50% cheaper

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.200
than GPUs attached to
on-demand instances.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.620
Preemptible GPUs will be
a particularly good fit

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.280
for large-scale machine learning
and other computational batch

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.940
workloads as customers can
harness the power of GPUs

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.850
to run distributed
batch workloads

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.380
at predictably
affordable prices.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.260
Ways to get started
are on the post.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.940
OK, this week is short on
news from our platform teams.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.420
So if you're looking for
some more reading material,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.700
may I recommend some
2017 recap posts,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.900
including a look back at
the most read Google Play

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.970
posts on Medium in 2017,
the end of year recap

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.120
extravaganza from
the Firebase team,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.490
and some of the most popular
Google Cloud Platform

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.780
product announcements, white
papers, and how-tos in 2017.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.030
These are all linked in
the description below.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.210
Please enjoy and remember
to look back here

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.760
every Friday for your
update on all the coolest

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.930
developer news from Google.

subscribe, and share.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.077
