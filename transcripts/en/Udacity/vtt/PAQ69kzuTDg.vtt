Well, this one's pretty simple.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.360
We simply select the article-items and

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.310
then use the .css method to change font-size to 20 pixels.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.990
After hitting Test Run, let's see how it looks.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.410
And look at that.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.309
All of the articles have much larger text.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:16.810
Very cool.
