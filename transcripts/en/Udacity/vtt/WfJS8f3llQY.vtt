00:00:00.378 --> 00:00:03.400
Typically you're going to
spend the first eight months

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.210
on some form of a road show.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.010
This is where you, you yourself, or
you and your business partners, or

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.930
just your business partner, will
travel to different investor groups,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.930
and possibly trade shows looking for new
investors, and basically do the pitch.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.830
Here's what we're doing, here's what
we believe, here's the course we're on,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.850
here's why we feel we'll succeed,
and here's why we need your money.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.000
And once you've done that for, anywhere,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.470
five to eight months,
you'll get a few bites.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.270
And those bites lead to meetings.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.550
And those meetings whittle
down to one key, core meeting.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.420
That first investor who's going
to open their checkbook and

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.500
give you a wad of cash.
