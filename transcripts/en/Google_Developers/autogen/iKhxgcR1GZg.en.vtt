it's getting very very good so when we
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.380
it's getting very very good so when we
measure performance of the generated

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390
measure performance of the generated
 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.880

applications because the speed was so
much faster so performance is good

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450
much faster so performance is good
 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.660

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550
way perfect one thing i should add about
 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.180
way perfect one thing i should add about
performance is that if you if you

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190
performance is that if you if you
 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.490
performance is that if you if you
increase performance in a platform you

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
increase performance in a platform you
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.830
increase performance in a platform you
enable new classes of applications to

enable new classes of applications to
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.390
enable new classes of applications to
run on a platform and that certainly

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400
run on a platform and that certainly

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.350
browser has just went through the roof
right and suddenly you see very complex

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
right and suddenly you see very complex
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.440
right and suddenly you see very complex
and very animated applications running

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450
and very animated applications running
 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.030
and very animated applications running
on the web and it's just due to

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
on the web and it's just due to
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.949
on the web and it's just due to
performance when you give performance to

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959
performance when you give performance to
 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.809
performance when you give performance to
programmers they'll use it especially if

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819
programmers they'll use it especially if
 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.309
programmers they'll use it especially if
you give them a hundred times

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319
you give them a hundred times
 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.720
you give them a hundred times
performance improvement that really

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730
performance improvement that really
 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.190
performance improvement that really
changes the game like things that you

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200
changes the game like things that you
 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.680

that oh and you guys are talking

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079
that oh and you guys are talking
 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.979
that oh and you guys are talking
performance already why not no great I

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989
performance already why not no great I
 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.440
performance already why not no great I

only you can go we'll probably talk
 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.560
only you can go we'll probably talk
about where else you can use dart but

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570
about where else you can use dart but
 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.630
about where else you can use dart but

see a lot of people interested there so

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940
see a lot of people interested there so
 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.490
see a lot of people interested there so
it's worth mentioning probably is the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500
it's worth mentioning probably is the
 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.189
it's worth mentioning probably is the

makes a ton of sense curves you work
 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.649
makes a ton of sense curves you work
they also it also makes much more

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659
they also it also makes much more
 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.929
they also it also makes much more
readable so given that you're serious

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:53.939
readable so given that you're serious
 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.939

about doing web applications your

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949
about doing web applications your
 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.249
about doing web applications your
application will survive for a long time

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259
application will survive for a long time
 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.290
application will survive for a long time
and you need to maintain it and refactor

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300
and you need to maintain it and refactor
 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.540
and you need to maintain it and refactor
and the more intent you have specified

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550
and the more intent you have specified
 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.070
and the more intent you have specified
in the program that easy it is to

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080
in the program that easy it is to
 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.700
in the program that easy it is to
maintain over time I guess a simple

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710
maintain over time I guess a simple
 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.839
maintain over time I guess a simple
description of that that is that we

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849
description of that that is that we
 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.059
description of that that is that we
found that people that use dart for

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069
found that people that use dart for
 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:12.769
found that people that use dart for
writing web apps I have an easier time

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:12.779
writing web apps I have an easier time
 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.390
writing web apps I have an easier time
actually taking a sample and

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400
actually taking a sample and
 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.070
actually taking a sample and
understanding what it does and finding

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080
understanding what it does and finding
 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.570
understanding what it does and finding
relevant documentation from the type of

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580
relevant documentation from the type of
 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.980
relevant documentation from the type of
notations then people that start from

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990
notations then people that start from
 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.420

JavaScript because you don't have the

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430
JavaScript because you don't have the
 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.279
JavaScript because you don't have the
types in there to tell you what to look

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289
types in there to tell you what to look
 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.689
types in there to tell you what to look
for in the documentation so it's really

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699
for in the documentation so it's really
 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.510
for in the documentation so it's really
helpful yep so other than types you it

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520
helpful yep so other than types you it
 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.010
helpful yep so other than types you it
has everything you would expect from a

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020
has everything you would expect from a
 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.559
has everything you would expect from a
modern language so packages built-in

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569
modern language so packages built-in
 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.110
modern language so packages built-in
lambdas all of those things you want to

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120
lambdas all of those things you want to
 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.179
lambdas all of those things you want to
talk about maybe synthetics sugar you

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:35.189
talk about maybe synthetics sugar you
 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:36.649
talk about maybe synthetics sugar you
feel you've mentioned it you've done a

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659
feel you've mentioned it you've done a
 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.659
feel you've mentioned it you've done a
demo and during the keynote sure I mean

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669
demo and during the keynote sure I mean
 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.939
demo and during the keynote sure I mean
that so we try not to add too much

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949
that so we try not to add too much
 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.519
that so we try not to add too much
intense and syntactic sugar but

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529
intense and syntactic sugar but
 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.499
intense and syntactic sugar but
sometimes you just want to express your

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509
sometimes you just want to express your
 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.659
sometimes you just want to express your
your code in a concise nice way without

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669
your code in a concise nice way without
 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.790
your code in a concise nice way without
repeating yourself over and over again

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800
repeating yourself over and over again
 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.159
repeating yourself over and over again
so and we've added a few things that

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169
so and we've added a few things that
 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.869
so and we've added a few things that
make it easier to construct objects and

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:53.879
make it easier to construct objects and
 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.879
make it easier to construct objects and
in a simple insane way without repeating

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889
in a simple insane way without repeating
 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.189
in a simple insane way without repeating
the field names and the parameter name

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199
the field names and the parameter name
 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.600
the field names and the parameter name
is all over the place like it's common

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610
is all over the place like it's common
 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.939
is all over the place like it's common
in some other languages and so we've

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949
in some other languages and so we've
 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.320
in some other languages and so we've
done a lot of things to just take cut

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330
done a lot of things to just take cut
 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.629
done a lot of things to just take cut
down on the boilerplate so it's we like

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639
down on the boilerplate so it's we like
 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.159
down on the boilerplate so it's we like
to call like a ceremony free language

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169
to call like a ceremony free language
 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.980
to call like a ceremony free language
you don't have to write tons of code

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990
you don't have to write tons of code
 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.600
you don't have to write tons of code
just to get your your stuff up and

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610
just to get your your stuff up and
 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.459
just to get your your stuff up and
running and the feedback from the

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:13.469
running and the feedback from the
 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.290
running and the feedback from the
products are using that so far has been

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300
products are using that so far has been
 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.240
products are using that so far has been
that it's more compact than Java and

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250
that it's more compact than Java and
 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.480
that it's more compact than Java and
it's very little very readable so so far

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490
it's very little very readable so so far
 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.950
it's very little very readable so so far
looks good it seems like we hit the

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960
looks good it seems like we hit the
 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.050
looks good it seems like we hit the
sweet spot and for what people is

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060
sweet spot and for what people is
 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.300
sweet spot and for what people is
expecting it was quite quite impressive

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310
expecting it was quite quite impressive
 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.829
expecting it was quite quite impressive
i think is that you guys pretty much

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:27.839
i think is that you guys pretty much
 

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.540
i think is that you guys pretty much
started building a real community around

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550
started building a real community around
 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.339
started building a real community around
it so because you have package

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349
it so because you have package
 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.379
it so because you have package
management you have people contributing

work on the same code base this is a
 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:32.420
work on the same code base this is a
huge step forward and of course you know

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430
huge step forward and of course you know
 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.450

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:54.389
angular team was was up on stage
 

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:56.330
angular team was was up on stage
something about how they build an

and none of them actually knew neither
 

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:08.209
and none of them actually knew neither
angular nor nor dark so this is the

angular nor nor dark so this is the
 

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:10.219
angular nor nor dark so this is the
interesting part we have been very

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:10.229
interesting part we have been very
 

00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:11.719
interesting part we have been very
conservative in designing the

the program languages there's no
surprises when using it we would like to

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960
surprises when using it we would like to
 

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.719
surprises when using it we would like to
have each construct in the language be

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:32.729
have each construct in the language be
 

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:34.909
have each construct in the language be
so natural to understand as possible so

so angular is very popular tell me more

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740
so angular is very popular tell me more

angular team so the Angela guys decided
 

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.190
angular team so the Angela guys decided
to make a dot version of angular and

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200
to make a dot version of angular and
 

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.100

you're using angular angles art and so
 

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.620
you're using angular angles art and so
there's really no difference between

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.130
angular Dart together with all the logic
written in that and it works just great

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:09.140
written in that and it works just great
 

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.490
written in that and it works just great
so yeah great so you can use dart

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500
so yeah great so you can use dart
 

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.829
so yeah great so you can use dart
develop to build web apps can you use it

00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839
develop to build web apps can you use it
 

00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:18.230
develop to build web apps can you use it
for command line service side is it even

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240
for command line service side is it even
 

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.760
for command line service side is it even
makes it's a general-purpose language so

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:19.770
makes it's a general-purpose language so
 

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.710
makes it's a general-purpose language so
you should yes it's a deal and a

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720
you should yes it's a deal and a
 

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.420
you should yes it's a deal and a
general-purpose programming language and

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:23.430
general-purpose programming language and
 

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.640
general-purpose programming language and
we always have applications that are

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:25.650
we always have applications that are
 

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.190
we always have applications that are
written outside the browser yeah yeah

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200
written outside the browser yeah yeah
 

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.040
written outside the browser yeah yeah
the done once one should mention that

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:30.050
the done once one should mention that
 

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.530
the done once one should mention that
dart to J's a command-line tool it's a

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540
dart to J's a command-line tool it's a
 

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.300
dart to J's a command-line tool it's a
compiler that takes dart code and

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:35.310
compiler that takes dart code and
 

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.740
compiler that takes dart code and
producers davis cup of course is written

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:36.750
producers davis cup of course is written
 

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.990
producers davis cup of course is written
that and of course it can compile itself

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000
that and of course it can compile itself
 

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.130
that and of course it can compile itself
of course oh yeah so you can compile the

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140
of course oh yeah so you can compile the
 

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.220
of course oh yeah so you can compile the
dart to J's compiler from dart to J's

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:46.230
dart to J's compiler from dart to J's
 

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.750
dart to J's compiler from dart to J's

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760
and run on top of a javascript engine
 

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.220
and run on top of a javascript engine
good if you like that if you're

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:52.230
good if you like that if you're
 

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.590
good if you like that if you're
interested that sort of thing so that's

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600
interested that sort of thing so that's
 

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.180
interested that sort of thing so that's
probably beyond the point but this is

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:56.190
probably beyond the point but this is
 

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:01.010
probably beyond the point but this is
one example where we have scaled sort of

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:01.020
one example where we have scaled sort of
 

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.500
one example where we have scaled sort of
tattoo run outside the browser so that

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:03.510
tattoo run outside the browser so that
 

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.720
tattoo run outside the browser so that
works really well another one is that we

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:05.730
works really well another one is that we
 

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.120
works really well another one is that we
have a performance tracking the server

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.130
have a performance tracking the server
 

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.920
have a performance tracking the server
system inside to track our increase in

system inside to track our increase in
 

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.690
system inside to track our increase in
performance the server side is all

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:14.700
performance the server side is all
 

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.030

written in Dart and that's been running

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040
written in Dart and that's been running
 

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.390
written in Dart and that's been running
a stable for one and a half years now so

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:19.400
a stable for one and a half years now so
 

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.920
a stable for one and a half years now so
it even works outside the browser it

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:21.930
it even works outside the browser it
 

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.960
it even works outside the browser it
does and that's more to come here but I

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:23.970
does and that's more to come here but I
 

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.940
does and that's more to come here but I
think it's important to focus on web

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:25.950
think it's important to focus on web
 

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.490
think it's important to focus on web
applications now this is the first area

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:28.500
applications now this is the first area
 

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.490
applications now this is the first area
where we're trying to have consistent

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:31.500
where we're trying to have consistent
 

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.010
where we're trying to have consistent
libraries and so forth yes and when that

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:34.020
libraries and so forth yes and when that
 

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.050
libraries and so forth yes and when that
all works well we will be happy to

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060
all works well we will be happy to
 

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.910
all works well we will be happy to
expand focus on that let's do that

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920
expand focus on that let's do that
 

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.270
expand focus on that let's do that
really well um so you guys have had a

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:41.280
really well um so you guys have had a
 

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.980
really well um so you guys have had a
lot of experience in virtual machines

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:42.990
lot of experience in virtual machines
 

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.680
lot of experience in virtual machines
hotspot da where were the challenges

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:45.690
hotspot da where were the challenges
 

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:50.480
hotspot da where were the challenges

of designed to be less challenging you

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.740
of designed to be less challenging you
 

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.870
of designed to be less challenging you
can say that many of the other things

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880
can say that many of the other things
 

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.820
can say that many of the other things
that we know right from ground up how

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:55.830
that we know right from ground up how
 

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.410
that we know right from ground up how
VMs work so that helps when you design

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:57.420
VMs work so that helps when you design
 

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.550
VMs work so that helps when you design
the language that you're trying to avoid

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560
the language that you're trying to avoid
 

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.660
the language that you're trying to avoid
some of the pitfalls that make it really

00:11:59.660 --> 00:11:59.670
some of the pitfalls that make it really
 

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.610
some of the pitfalls that make it really
hard to implement so we tried to make it

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620
hard to implement so we tried to make it
 

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.960
hard to implement so we tried to make it
a sign that allows us to make it go

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:02.970
a sign that allows us to make it go
 

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.490
a sign that allows us to make it go
really really fast so you could say

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:04.500
really really fast so you could say
 

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.310
really really fast so you could say
they're honoring we designed it to make

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320
they're honoring we designed it to make
 

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.040
they're honoring we designed it to make
it easier for the vm implementer so so

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.050
it easier for the vm implementer so so
 

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.500
it easier for the vm implementer so so
one thing that's we have been bothered

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:12.510
one thing that's we have been bothered
 

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.360
one thing that's we have been bothered
by in other systems is that it's very

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:14.370
by in other systems is that it's very
 

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.360
by in other systems is that it's very
hard to predict performance of an

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:17.370
hard to predict performance of an
 

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.910
hard to predict performance of an
application so the dart program legs has

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920
application so the dart program legs has
 

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.580
application so the dart program legs has
been designed so that we can predict how

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:22.590
been designed so that we can predict how
 

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.130
been designed so that we can predict how
well it performs on the vm so the

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140
well it performs on the vm so the
 

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.540
well it performs on the vm so the
programmer when writing a program he

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:26.550
programmer when writing a program he
 

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.450
programmer when writing a program he
sort of have a higgins sort of estimate

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:29.460
sort of have a higgins sort of estimate
 

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.060
sort of have a higgins sort of estimate
how fast it runs and this is great so

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.070
how fast it runs and this is great so
 

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.040
how fast it runs and this is great so
it's basically all about avoiding like

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.050
it's basically all about avoiding like
 

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.230
it's basically all about avoiding like
performing if it falls like if you if

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240
performing if it falls like if you if
 

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.940
performing if it falls like if you if
you fall off that performing cliff in

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:37.950
you fall off that performing cliff in
 

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.590
you fall off that performing cliff in
too many weird ways it makes it really

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600
too many weird ways it makes it really
 

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.970
too many weird ways it makes it really
hard to reason about the performance of

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980
hard to reason about the performance of
 

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.890
hard to reason about the performance of
your code so for instance to give a

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:42.900
your code so for instance to give a
 

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.990
your code so for instance to give a
contrast to make a more concrete indira

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000
contrast to make a more concrete indira
 

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.030
contrast to make a more concrete indira
script right you know you can use an

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040
script right you know you can use an
 

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.759
script right you know you can use an
object as a

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:48.769
object as a
 

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:52.150
object as a
as a dictionary basically and if you

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160
as a dictionary basically and if you
 

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.069
as a dictionary basically and if you
from the side get hold of an object

00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079
from the side get hold of an object
 

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:55.720
from the side get hold of an object
inside an application and start messing

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:55.730
inside an application and start messing
 

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.189
inside an application and start messing
with it suddenly the whole application

00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199
with it suddenly the whole application
 

00:12:57.199 --> 00:13:00.910
with it suddenly the whole application
runs slow and that cannot happen in the

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920
runs slow and that cannot happen in the
 

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.679
runs slow and that cannot happen in the
indata so we designed in such a way

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:02.689
indata so we designed in such a way
 

00:13:02.689 --> 00:13:05.530
indata so we designed in such a way
that's not possible and I think that

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:05.540
that's not possible and I think that
 

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.449
that's not possible and I think that
that would be great for developers

00:13:07.449 --> 00:13:07.459
that would be great for developers
 

00:13:07.459 --> 00:13:09.220
that would be great for developers
because they they can they can predict

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:09.230
because they they can they can predict
 

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.590
because they they can they can predict
how well the code runs and should not

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600
how well the code runs and should not
 

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.600
how well the code runs and should not
try to sort of guessed it whether it

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:13.610
try to sort of guessed it whether it
 

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.669
try to sort of guessed it whether it
once fast in one play on when plot fam

00:13:15.669 --> 00:13:15.679
once fast in one play on when plot fam
 

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:17.710
once fast in one play on when plot fam
or the other so this is good so

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720
or the other so this is good so
 

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.179
or the other so this is good so
performance by the way is not just the

00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:19.189
performance by the way is not just the
 

00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:21.669
performance by the way is not just the
app runs fast it's also about the a pro

00:13:21.669 --> 00:13:21.679
app runs fast it's also about the a pro
 

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:23.410
app runs fast it's also about the a pro
starting fast you know in the web that

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:23.420
starting fast you know in the web that
 

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.809
starting fast you know in the web that
actually makes a lot of sense so this

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:25.819
actually makes a lot of sense so this
 

00:13:25.819 --> 00:13:29.019
actually makes a lot of sense so this
work I understand or around that in the

00:13:29.019 --> 00:13:29.029
work I understand or around that in the
 

00:13:29.029 --> 00:13:31.569
work I understand or around that in the
dart VM terms of fast startup yeah we

00:13:31.569 --> 00:13:31.579
dart VM terms of fast startup yeah we
 

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:33.069
dart VM terms of fast startup yeah we
have we have snapshot snapshot so

00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079
have we have snapshot snapshot so
 

00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:35.289
have we have snapshot snapshot so
snapshot is a simple mechanism where you

00:13:35.289 --> 00:13:35.299
snapshot is a simple mechanism where you
 

00:13:35.299 --> 00:13:39.280
snapshot is a simple mechanism where you
basically start up the program until

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:39.290
basically start up the program until
 

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.859
basically start up the program until
you're about to execute main and that

00:13:41.859 --> 00:13:41.869
you're about to execute main and that
 

00:13:41.869 --> 00:13:43.960
you're about to execute main and that
point you take the whole heap and say I

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:43.970
point you take the whole heap and say I
 

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.939
point you take the whole heap and say I
said and put into a binary format on the

00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:45.949
said and put into a binary format on the
 

00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:48.879
said and put into a binary format on the
file system and you can use that as a

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:48.889
file system and you can use that as a
 

00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:50.199
file system and you can use that as a
starting point when you start the

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:50.209
starting point when you start the
 

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:51.819
starting point when you start the
application and it's really you get a

00:13:51.819 --> 00:13:51.829
application and it's really you get a
 

00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:53.799
application and it's really you get a
factor of ten spot a start-up in

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:53.809
factor of ten spot a start-up in
 

00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:55.869
factor of ten spot a start-up in
start-up performance that means that if

00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:55.879
start-up performance that means that if
 

00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:57.939
start-up performance that means that if
your application would take sort of a

00:13:57.939 --> 00:13:57.949
your application would take sort of a
 

00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:59.829
your application would take sort of a
second to start up now is only hundred

00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839
second to start up now is only hundred
 

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:04.859
second to start up now is only hundred
milliseconds and as soon as the dart VM

00:14:04.859 --> 00:14:04.869
milliseconds and as soon as the dart VM
 

00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:08.679
milliseconds and as soon as the dart VM
appears in chrome yeah then really then

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:08.689
appears in chrome yeah then really then
 

00:14:08.689 --> 00:14:10.509
appears in chrome yeah then really then
you'll hopefully see a very snappy

00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519
you'll hopefully see a very snappy
 

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:12.460
you'll hopefully see a very snappy
startup of web applications already now

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:12.470
startup of web applications already now
 

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.499
startup of web applications already now
we're using these snapshots when

00:14:14.499 --> 00:14:14.509
we're using these snapshots when
 

00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:16.419
we're using these snapshots when
starting up dart to J's to make sure you

00:14:16.419 --> 00:14:16.429
starting up dart to J's to make sure you
 

00:14:16.429 --> 00:14:18.789
starting up dart to J's to make sure you
the tools are have a fast start up in

00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:18.799
the tools are have a fast start up in
 

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:22.720
the tools are have a fast start up in
our toolbox yeah great so when can we

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:22.730
our toolbox yeah great so when can we
 

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.609
our toolbox yeah great so when can we
are you starting to talk to the chrome

00:14:24.609 --> 00:14:24.619
are you starting to talk to the chrome
 

00:14:24.619 --> 00:14:26.829
are you starting to talk to the chrome
guys to get it in of course you have a

00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:26.839
guys to get it in of course you have a
 

00:14:26.839 --> 00:14:28.780
guys to get it in of course you have a
chromium build with the document which

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:28.790
chromium build with the document which
 

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:29.829
chromium build with the document which
is what you mentioned for the

00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839
is what you mentioned for the
 

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:33.009
is what you mentioned for the
development cycle next step is obviously

00:14:33.009 --> 00:14:33.019
development cycle next step is obviously
 

00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:34.569
development cycle next step is obviously
to make it available as many to many

00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:34.579
to make it available as many to many
 

00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:36.009
to make it available as many to many
people as possible and people just

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:36.019
people as possible and people just
 

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:37.869
people as possible and people just
realize that the app is running faster

00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:37.879
realize that the app is running faster
 

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:40.210
realize that the app is running faster
