00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.900
Let's say that we have
a sheet of cardboard

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.620
that is 20 inches by 30 inches.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.535
Let me draw the cardboard
as neatly as I can.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:13.810
So it might look
something like that.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.846
So that is my
sheet of cardboard.

00:00:16.846 --> 00:00:18.720
And just to make sure
we know the dimensions,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.150
there's 20 inches by 30 inches.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.240
And what we're
going to do is cut

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.050
out the corners
of this cardboard.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.960
And all the corners are
going to be squares,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.870
and we're going to cut
out an x by x corner

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:39.380
from each of the corners of this
piece of cardboard-- x by x.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.034
Over here, x by x, and
then over here, x by x.

00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:48.200
And what we'll do is after
we cut out those corners,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.260
we can essentially
fold down the flaps.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.240
Let me draw the flap.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.740
So you could imagine we
can fold right there,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.210
we could fold right there,
we could fold right there,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.600
and we would form a box.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.950
I guess you could imagine a
box without a bottom to it,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.170
or you can view a box
without a top to it.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.130
So if we were to
fold everything up,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.490
we would get a container that
looks something like this.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.770
Let me make my best
attempt to draw it.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.340
So it would look like this.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.500
This is one flap folded up.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.920
You can imagine this
flap right over here,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.170
if I were to fold
it up like that,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.230
it now would look like this.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.580
It would now look like this.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.190
The height of the flap is x.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.180
So this distance
right over here is x.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.690
And then if I were to fold
this flap, if I were-- let

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.920
me do that a little bit neater.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.460
If I were to fold this
flap right over here,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.735
if I were to fold that up,
then it would look like this.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.420
Let me make my best
attempt to draw it.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.970
It would look like that.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.460
And then I would fold
that back flap up.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.896
So the back flap would
look something like that.

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:08.690
That would be the back flap.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.690
It would look
something like that.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.940
And then this flap
over here would--

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.930
if I fold it up would
look something like that.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.620
And then of course, my
base of my whole thing,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.590
so this whole region right over
here of my piece of cardboard,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.300
would be the floor of this
box that I'm constructing.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.530
And what I want to do
is I want to maximize

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.240
the volume of this box.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.840
I want to maximize
how much it can hold.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.980
And I want to maximize it by
picking my x appropriately.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.540
So let's think about what
the volume of this box

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.784
is as a function of x.

00:02:45.784 --> 00:02:47.200
Well, in order to
do that, we have

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.620
to figure out all the dimensions
of this box as a function of x.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.600
We already know that this
corner right over here,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.510
which is made up of when
this side and this side

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.684
connect when you fold
these two flaps up,

00:02:59.684 --> 00:03:01.600
that's going to be the
same height over there.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.516
That's going to be the
same height over there.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.770
The height of this
box is going to be x.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.490
But what's the width?

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.672
What is the width of
this box going to be?

00:03:11.672 --> 00:03:13.130
Well, the width of
the box is going

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.440
to be this distance
right over here.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.970
And this distance is going
to be 20 inches minus not 1x,

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.930
but minus 2 x's.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.285
So this is going
to be 20 minus 2x.

00:03:27.285 --> 00:03:28.410
You see it right over here.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.030
This whole distance is 20.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.990
You subtract this x,
you subtract this x,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.370
and you get this
distance right over here.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.670
So it's 20 minus 2x.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.260
Now, the same logic, what
is the depth of the box?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.990
What is that distance
right over there?

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.030
Well, that distance is this
distance right over here.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.090
We know that this entire
distance is 30 inches.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.870
If we subtract out this x
and we subtract out this x,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.910
we get the distance
that we care about.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.280
So this is going
to be 30 minus 2x.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.420
So now we have all
of the dimensions.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.850
So what would the volume
be as a function of x?

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.120
Well, the volume
as a function of x

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.490
is going to be equal
to the height, which

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:24.430
is x, times the width, which
is 20 minus x-- sorry, 20

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.230
minus 2x times the depth,
which is 30 minus 2x.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.460
Now, what are possible values of
x that give us a valid volume?

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.390
Well, x can't be less than 0.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.970
You can't make a
negative cut here.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.780
Somehow we would have to add
cardboard or something there.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.680
So we know that x is going to
be greater than or equal to 0.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.370
So let me write this down.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.440
x is going to be greater
than or equal to 0.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.700
And what does it
have to be less than?

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.270
Well, I can cut at
most-- we can see here

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.270
the length right over here, this
pink color, this mauve color,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.330
is 20 minus 2x.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.170
So this has got to
be greater than 0.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.200
This is always going to be
shorter than the 30 minus 2x,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.460
but the 20 minus 2x has to be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.870
You can't cut more
cardboard than there is.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.720
Or you could say that 20 has to
be greater than or equal to 2x,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.720
or you could say
that 10 is going

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.910
to be greater than
or equal to x, which

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.510
is another way of saying that
x is going to be less than

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.570
or equal to 10.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.190
That's a different
shade of yellow.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.950
x is going to be less
than or equal to 10.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.800
So x has got to be
between 0 and 10.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.850
Otherwise we've cut too
much, or we're somehow

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.940
adding cardboard or something.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.430
So first let's think about
the volume at the endpoints

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.860
of our-- essentially of
our domain, of what x

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.860
can be for our volume.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.670
Well, our volume when x is
equal to 0 is equal to what?

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.331
We can have 0 times
all of this stuff.

00:06:01.331 --> 00:06:02.330
And it's pretty obvious.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.060
You're not going to
have any height here.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.684
So you're not going
to have any volume,

00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:07.440
so our volume would be 0.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.120
What is our volume
when x is equal to 10?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.060
Well, if x equaled 10,
then the width here

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.820
that I've drawn in
pink would be 0.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.984
So once again, we
would have no volume.

00:06:19.984 --> 00:06:22.025
And this term right over
here, if we just look at

00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:23.870
it algebraically would
also be, equal to 0,

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.150
so this whole thing
would be equal to 0.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.160
So someplace in between
x equals 0 and x equals

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.080
10 we should achieve
our maximum volume.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.120
And before we do it analytically
with a bit of calculus,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.150
let's do it graphically.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.100
So I'll get my handy TI-85 out.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.600
So let me get my TI-85 out.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.140
And so first let me set
my range appropriately

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.460
before I attempt to graph it.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.260
So I'll put my graph function.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.910
Let me set my range.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.990
So my minimum x-value,
let me make that 0.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.980
We know that x cannot
be less than 0.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.190
My maximum x-value, well,
10 seems pretty good.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.980
My minimum y-value,
this is essentially

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.100
going to be my volume.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.683
I'm not going to
have negative volume,

00:07:04.683 --> 00:07:06.500
so let me set that equal 0.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.320
And my maximum
y-value, let's see

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.050
what would be reasonable here.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.010
I'm just going to
pick some a random x

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.720
and see what type
of a volume I get.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.540
So if x were to be 5, it
would be 5 times 20 minus 10,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.650
which is 10.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.340
So that would be--
did I do that right?

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.320
Yeah, 20 minus 2
times 5, so that

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.620
would be 10, and then times
30 minus 2 times 5, which

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.740
would be 20.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.560
So it would be 5
times 10 times 20.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.300
So you'd get a volume
of 1,000 cubic inches.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.510
And I just randomly
picked the number 5.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.960
So let me give my maximum
y-value a little higher

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.300
than that just in case to
that isn't the maximum value.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.466
I just randomly picked that.

00:07:45.466 --> 00:07:48.610
So let's say yMax is 1,500,
and if for whatever reason

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.330
our graph doesn't
fit in there, then

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.290
maybe we can make
our yMax even larger.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.980
So I think this is going
to be a decent range.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.170
Now let's actually input
the function itself.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.250
So our volume is
equal to x times 20

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:08.930
minus 2x minus 2x
times 30 minus 2x.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.990
And that looks about right.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.620
So now I think we can graph it.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.000
So 2nd, and I want to
select that up there,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.040
so I'll do Graph.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.580
And it looks like we
did get the right range.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.720
So this tells us volume is a
function of x between x is 0

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.730
and x is 10, and it does look
like we hit a maximum point

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.000
right around there.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.696
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:35.950
to use the Trace function
to figure out roughly

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.360
what that maximum point is.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.559
So let me trace this function.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.070
So I can still go
higher, higher.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.570
OK.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.490
So over there my
volume is 1,055.5.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.990
Then I can get to 1,056.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:54.930
So let's see, this was
1,056.20, this is 1,056.24,

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.060
then I go back to 1,055.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.950
So at least based
on the level of zoom

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.450
that I have my
calculator right now,

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.760
this is a pretty
good approximation

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.650
for the maximum value that my
function actually takes on.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.530
So it looks like my maximum
value is around 1,056,

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:15.110
and it happens at
around x equals 3.89.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:23.020
So it looks like
my volume at 3.89

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:28.630
is approximately equal
to 1,056 cubic inches.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:33.010
Or you could say that
we hit a maximum when

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:39.150
x is approximately
equal to 3.89.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.880
So far, we've just set up
our maximization problem,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.480
and we've looked
at it graphically.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.930
In the next video, we'll
try to solve it analytically

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.870
using some of our
calculus tools.
