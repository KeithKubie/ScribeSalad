00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.760
Hi, I'm Pete, a developer
advocate at Google.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.620
I use a lot of different devices
to browse the web-- my desktop,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.154
my tablet, my phone.

00:00:11.154 --> 00:00:12.570
Now some of these
sites look great

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.970
across all these
different devices.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.010
But other sites?

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.860
Not so much.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.260
When a site isn't
optimized or designed

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.300
to work across the
multi-device web,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.570
it requires panning,
zooming, trying to hit those

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.760
tiny buttons.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.780
It's just no fun.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.690
And those same sites
when viewed on my TV

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.000
can be just as awkward.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.020
The buttons may be
bigger, but touching my TV

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.940
is just going to
leave a fingerprint.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.680
It's not going to do anything.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.690
Building sites that work
well on the multi-device web

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.700
isn't hard, but it does
require a shift in the way

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.420
that we think about it.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.900
Small screens aren't just
zoomed-in big screens.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.790
Instead, we need to tailor
our content and styles

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.460
for the multi-device web.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.420
The easiest way
to get started is

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.950
by designing for a small
screen, and then building up.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.530
So let's give it a shot.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.110
I've already created a page that
looks great on a small screen.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.400
It has all my content, the
styles for the small screen,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.480
and it includes the
meta viewport tag.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.650
The meta viewport
tag is important

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.850
because it tells
the browser to adapt

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.270
the content to the
size of the device.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.290
It's important to set
width=device-width,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.730
and initial-scale=1 to establish
a one-to-one relationship

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.850
between CSS pixels and
device-independent pixels.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.010
Without the meta viewport
tag, mobile browsers

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.230
lie and pretend that they're
980 pixels wide-- desktop width.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.940
Our content looks
weird because it's

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.780
scaled to fit on a 980
pixel-wide display,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.020
resulting in a page
that's just way too small.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.640
With our viewport
properly set, we now

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.450
have our site
optimized for mobile.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.650
So let's make it look
better on a bigger screen

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.210
by adding a breakpoint.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.940
A breakpoint is used to display
different styles depending

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.560
on characteristics of
the device, like device

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.820
width or device pixel density.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.300
We can apply different
styles using media queries,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.470
giving us a completely
responsive experience.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.460
Media queries only
apply their styles

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.990
if the device matches the query.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.620
You can either specify the query
by adding a media attribute

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.740
to the linked CSS file,
or directly in the CSS.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.350
For most designs, you'll
find the min-width query

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.230
to be the most helpful.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.440
Min-width rules are applied
for any browser width

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.070
over the value
defined in the query.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.110
Defining breakpoints
based on specific devices,

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.450
products, brand names, operating
systems, anything like that,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.140
will always result in a
maintenance nightmare.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.300
Instead, use the content to
find the right breakpoint.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.370
Let's expand our
page and see where

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.840
a breakpoint becomes necessary.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.750
500 pixels looks like a
good place for a breakpoint,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.980
so let's go ahead
and add one there.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.970
I've added a new style
sheet with a media query

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.710
that tests the browser width.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.940
If the browser is at
least 500 pixels wide,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.710
then the styles in
weather-large.CSS are applied.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.580
Great.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.400
Now our base styles are
applied on smaller screens,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.380
but on screens over
500 pixels wide,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.390
the media query
kicks in, giving us

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.310
a great look for wider screens.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.940
Now in addition to
choosing major breakpoints,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.930
it's also helpful to
add minor breakpoints.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.770
Let's tweak some little things.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.090
For example, I've added
a minor breakpoint

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.430
at 400 pixels that adjusts
the margins and paddings, ups

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.660
some font sizes, and changes
the layout of a few items

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.110
to make things fit
more naturally.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.270
If you want to learn more
about minor breakpoints,

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.899
have a look at the
web fundamentals site.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.829
Now obviously,
there's a lot more

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.510
to say about building
awesome multi-device sites.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.360
But if you start small,
add the meta viewport tag,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.780
and then resize your browser
until the content tells you

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.740
that a breakpoint's necessary,
you're already well on the way.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.110
Thanks for watching.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.440
Go build something awesome.
