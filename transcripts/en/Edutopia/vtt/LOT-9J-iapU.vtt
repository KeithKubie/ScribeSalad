00:00:08.586 --> 00:00:11.486
&gt;&gt;Trey Joyner: At Normal
Park, we focus largely

00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:14.546
on creating an atmosphere
for the students

00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:17.946
to give them an outlet,
give them an opportunity

00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:20.816
to exhibit the work that they've
been doing, the learning.

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:26.656
&gt;&gt;Emily Pittman: Exhibits are
the way that we allow students

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:28.126
to take ownership
over their learning.

00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:29.926
&gt;&gt;Jamie Tipton: So, each
year, the students will put

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:32.956
on four different exhibits,
and they work with all four

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:35.516
of their teachers on that
team to have a cohesive theme.

00:00:36.146 --> 00:00:38.046
In each one of the
exhibits, there is a piece

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:40.946
from the math class, the reading
class, the language arts,

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:42.076
social studies, and science.

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:43.126
They all work together.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:45.606
In addition to that, we
work with related arts teams

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:51.446
to add visual arts, art pieces,
Spanish pieces, German pieces,

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:54.526
and the library will even write
text and books with the kids.

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.736
Each quarter, we sit down as a
team and we assess what needs

00:00:58.736 --> 00:01:01.856
to be learned, and from
that, we create the big ideas

00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:04.686
or essential questions, and
so, for the entire quarter,

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:06.436
students are presented
at the very beginning

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:07.806
with the essential questions.

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:12.466
They learn in art class ways
to incorporate art pieces

00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.466
to showcase one of the
essential questions.

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:19.456
In writing, they will expand and
write persuasive pieces or poems

00:01:19.456 --> 00:01:22.276
to express that, and at
the end of the eight weeks,

00:01:22.596 --> 00:01:23.766
we put the exhibit on.

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.126
The exhibit is a way to
show every understanding

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:26.956
that the kids have.

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:29.126
&gt;&gt;Jill Levine: Teachers
look at the big ideas

00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:31.316
and then the knowledge and
skills, what the students have

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:32.686
to know and be able to do.

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:35.346
Then they look at, how are
we going to assess that?

00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:37.656
For us at a museum
magnet school,

00:01:37.656 --> 00:01:40.046
those assessments
are our exhibits.

00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:42.926
They are often the labels
that go with the exhibits.

00:01:42.956 --> 00:01:45.026
&gt;&gt;Jamie Tipton: Students
create exhibit labels

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:47.056
for every single piece
that's on exhibit

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:50.096
to let the audience know what
this is and why it's important.

00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:51.676
Inside the exhibit label,

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:55.316
you should see the academic
vocabulary, a connection

00:01:55.316 --> 00:01:58.266
to the content or the piece,
and then a personal connection.

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:01.686
&gt;&gt;Carrie Willmore: When I'm
asking them to write a label,

00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:04.716
I want to make sure
that they remember all

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:07.726
of the academic language that we
talked about, all of the things

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:11.266
that we studied, so that they
can really show their best

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:13.806
understanding of that
essential question.

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:17.426
&gt;&gt;Jill Levine: After
the exhibits go up,

00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:20.846
we have a faculty meeting in
which teachers walk through all

00:02:20.846 --> 00:02:23.506
of the exhibits and they look
for evidence of understanding,

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:26.116
and then we'll share those
out at the faculty meeting.

00:02:26.116 --> 00:02:28.186
That really helps to get
everybody on the faculty

00:02:28.186 --> 00:02:31.276
on the same page in terms of
our expectations for exhibits

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.086
and what are true
understandings.

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:36.836
Every nine weeks, we have this
big celebration of learning,

00:02:36.926 --> 00:02:39.736
and the halls will be filled
with parents and children

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:42.916
who are all here to
celebrate what their children

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:43.786
have accomplished.

00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:46.366
For me as a principal, I
like to go up to students

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.066
and have them explain an exhibit
to me so that I understand,

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:50.116
did they get the big idea?

00:02:50.116 --> 00:02:52.606
You know, did they
just do a project,

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:55.626
or did they really understand
what they did, why they did it,

00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:58.236
and what it means in terms
of the bigger picture?

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.376
I think have lots of
schools have ballgames

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:01.976
and plays and concerts.

00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:03.936
This is a way to
celebrate what goes

00:03:03.986 --> 00:03:06.026
on in the classroom
day in, day out.
