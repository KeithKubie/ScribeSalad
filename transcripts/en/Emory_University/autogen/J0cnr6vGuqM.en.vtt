that the brain that the adult brain
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.650
that the brain that the adult brain
could recover from any kind of serious

literature suggesting that women recover
better from brain injury from traumatic

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
better from brain injury from traumatic
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.250
better from brain injury from traumatic
brain injury and stroke than do males

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
brain injury and stroke than do males
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.529
brain injury and stroke than do males
and we began to follow that line of

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
and we began to follow that line of
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.180
and we began to follow that line of
investigation simply because it was it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
investigation simply because it was it
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.040
investigation simply because it was it

was interesting to us in the context of
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.020
was interesting to us in the context of
looking at recovery of function this was

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
looking at recovery of function this was
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.369
looking at recovery of function this was
long before we actually got interested

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
long before we actually got interested
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.160
long before we actually got interested
in progesterone percent but to cut to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
in progesterone percent but to cut to
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.600

the quick when we did that work in

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
the quick when we did that work in
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.300
the quick when we did that work in
laboratory animals we actually used

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
laboratory animals we actually used
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.610
laboratory animals we actually used
laboratory rats with we damaged the

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620
laboratory rats with we damaged the
 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.470
laboratory rats with we damaged the
frontal cortex which is very similar to

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480
frontal cortex which is very similar to
 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.120
frontal cortex which is very similar to
the types of injury that people get when

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
the types of injury that people get when
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.290
the types of injury that people get when
they go through the windshield of a car

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300
they go through the windshield of a car
 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.810
they go through the windshield of a car
for example and we found that indeed

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
for example and we found that indeed
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.290
for example and we found that indeed
females did recover better than males

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300
females did recover better than males
 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.930
females did recover better than males
but what we noticed as we progress with

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940
but what we noticed as we progress with
 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.300
but what we noticed as we progress with
our work was that it depended on where

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
our work was that it depended on where
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.820
our work was that it depended on where
the female was in her estrus cycle at

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830
the female was in her estrus cycle at
 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.590
the female was in her estrus cycle at
the time of an injury the estrus cycle

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
the time of an injury the estrus cycle
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.220
the time of an injury the estrus cycle
in a rat is like the menstrual cycle in

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230
in a rat is like the menstrual cycle in
 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.440
in a rat is like the menstrual cycle in
a human female and what we discovered

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
a human female and what we discovered
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090
a human female and what we discovered
through a series of experiments was that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
through a series of experiments was that
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.290
through a series of experiments was that
when the animals were high in

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300
when the animals were high in
 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.880
when the animals were high in
progesterone and we could measure this

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
progesterone and we could measure this
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.650
progesterone and we could measure this
very precisely when they were high in

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660
very precisely when they were high in
 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.450
very precisely when they were high in
progesterone at the time of injury the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460
progesterone at the time of injury the
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.760
progesterone at the time of injury the
outcome was much better than if the same

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
outcome was much better than if the same
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.260
outcome was much better than if the same
injury occurred when they were high in

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
injury occurred when they were high in
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.960
injury occurred when they were high in
estrogen so then we began to rule out

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
estrogen so then we began to rule out
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.790
estrogen so then we began to rule out
what would you know how did this work in

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800
what would you know how did this work in
 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.530
what would you know how did this work in
the animals that were high and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540
the animals that were high and
 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.270
the animals that were high and
progesterone at the time of injury they

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
progesterone at the time of injury they
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160
progesterone at the time of injury they
virtually had no brain swelling no

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
virtually had no brain swelling no
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.320
virtually had no brain swelling no
cerebral edema this is a major cause of

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330
cerebral edema this is a major cause of
 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.060
cerebral edema this is a major cause of
death in a lot of people that suffer

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
death in a lot of people that suffer
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.680
death in a lot of people that suffer
from traumatic brain injury so this was

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690
from traumatic brain injury so this was
 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.330
from traumatic brain injury so this was
a pretty exciting finding and those

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
a pretty exciting finding and those
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.550
a pretty exciting finding and those
initial that initial work actually got

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
initial that initial work actually got
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.619
initial that initial work actually got
published in the journal science and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
published in the journal science and
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.259
published in the journal science and
when we gave males similar doses to what

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269
when we gave males similar doses to what
 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.270
when we gave males similar doses to what
we were giving to females we worked out

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280
we were giving to females we worked out
 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.400
we were giving to females we worked out
all those dose levels and stuff we found

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
all those dose levels and stuff we found
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.740
all those dose levels and stuff we found
that the male's performed just as well

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
that the male's performed just as well
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.350
that the male's performed just as well
as the females despite the fact that in

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360
as the females despite the fact that in
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.330
as the females despite the fact that in
normal males with brain injury that

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
normal males with brain injury that
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.190
normal males with brain injury that
didn't get any treatment their outcomes

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200
didn't get any treatment their outcomes
 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.989
didn't get any treatment their outcomes
were much worse than females in general

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:26.999
were much worse than females in general
 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.619
were much worse than females in general
that's because

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629
that's because
 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.470
that's because
males make much less progesterone one of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480
males make much less progesterone one of
 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.880
males make much less progesterone one of
the things that I do want to point out

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890
the things that I do want to point out
 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.190
the things that I do want to point out
it's that is that progesterone it's not

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200
it's that is that progesterone it's not
 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.929
it's that is that progesterone it's not
just a female home and that's really a

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939
just a female home and that's really a
 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.759
just a female home and that's really a
big mistake in thinking about it that

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769
big mistake in thinking about it that
 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:39.119
big mistake in thinking about it that
way

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129
way
 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.009
way
males make it we make it in the brain

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019
males make it we make it in the brain
 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.839
males make it we make it in the brain
just like females do we just make a lot

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849
just like females do we just make a lot
 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.990
just like females do we just make a lot
less of it most people thought it was

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000
less of it most people thought it was
 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.630
less of it most people thought it was
nuts they didn't believe that what they

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640
nuts they didn't believe that what they
 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.270
nuts they didn't believe that what they
then called a female hormone basically

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280
then called a female hormone basically
 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.250
then called a female hormone basically
involved in reproduction could have

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260
involved in reproduction could have
 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.960
involved in reproduction could have
these kinds of beneficial effects on

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970
these kinds of beneficial effects on
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.149
these kinds of beneficial effects on
brain function I had moved to Emory

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159
brain function I had moved to Emory
 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.800
brain function I had moved to Emory
University I came here as the Dean of

University I came here as the Dean of
 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.929
University I came here as the Dean of
the graduate school I had my lab and was

working in the lab as well as doing the
 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.979
working in the lab as well as doing the
administration and I got to know dr. art

Kellerman who was then the chair of
 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.849
Kellerman who was then the chair of
emergency medicine and he brought on

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859
emergency medicine and he brought on
 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.409
emergency medicine and he brought on
board a young physician by the name of

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419
board a young physician by the name of
 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.199
board a young physician by the name of
dr. David Wright who came to the lab and

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209
dr. David Wright who came to the lab and
 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.119
dr. David Wright who came to the lab and
started working with me as an emergency

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129
started working with me as an emergency
 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.129
started working with me as an emergency
medicine doc and together we began to

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139
medicine doc and together we began to
 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.960
medicine doc and together we began to
demonstrate more mechanisms of how

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970
demonstrate more mechanisms of how
 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.789
demonstrate more mechanisms of how
progesterone works and by that point we

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799
progesterone works and by that point we
 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.800
progesterone works and by that point we
had enough data not only from our lab

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810
had enough data not only from our lab
 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.089
had enough data not only from our lab
but from a couple of other labs around

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099
but from a couple of other labs around
 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.819

just a brain disorder

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060
just a brain disorder

these are systemic diseases when you

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190
these are systemic diseases when you
 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.070
these are systemic diseases when you
have a brain injury almost every organ

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080
have a brain injury almost every organ
 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.409
have a brain injury almost every organ
of your body is going to be affected and

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419
of your body is going to be affected and
 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.690
of your body is going to be affected and
so you need a you need an agent a drug a

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700
so you need a you need an agent a drug a
 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.520
so you need a you need an agent a drug a
hormone whatever you want to call that

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530
hormone whatever you want to call that
 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.500

the entire organism not just focusing on
 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.960
the entire organism not just focusing on
one small part of the brain and so

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970
one small part of the brain and so
 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.580
one small part of the brain and so
that's what that's where progesterone

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590
that's what that's where progesterone
 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.830
that's what that's where progesterone
really shines as well and is why one of

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840
really shines as well and is why one of
 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.200
really shines as well and is why one of
the reasons why I think it's very likely

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210
the reasons why I think it's very likely
 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.570
the reasons why I think it's very likely
to be successful in these clinical

to be successful in these clinical
 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.310
to be successful in these clinical
trials so one of the other things you

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320
