00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.450
On Judy's way home from
school yesterday, she

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.430
ran for half the distance.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.700
Then she skipped for 1/4
of the remaining distance

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.260
and walked the rest
of the way home.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.840
She walked for a total 360 feet.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.070
What is the distance between
school and Judy's home?

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.149
And they say write the
answer in the yards.

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:26.940
So this is a little
tricky right over here.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.250
They say, 360 feet, write
the answer in yards.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.000
And we have to remind
ourselves that one yard is

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.230
equal to 3 feet.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.730
So just so we make sure we don't
make that careless mistake,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.220
let's put all of our
information in yards right now.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.180
So 360 feet is how many yards?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840
Well there's 3 feet per yard.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.510
So we're just going to
divide 360 feet by 3.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.990
And so 360 divided
by 3 is 120 yards.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.500
And now we can do the whole
problem in terms of yards.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.710
So let's think about it.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.340
So let me say that this
is her entire distance.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.150
This is on her way
home from school.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.110
And then let me draw a line that
shows the distance all the way

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.130
home.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.610
So I want to draw this
as large as possible,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.670
so we have room to
write inside of it.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.060
So that's school.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.770
And that is home.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.370
And they first tells us that
she ran for half the distance.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.660
So let's split this in two.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.110
Let's split that in two.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.410
And so she ran for
half the distance.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.720
This is the distance
that she ran.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.150
It's half the total distance.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.380
Then they say, then
she skipped for one

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.460
fourth of the
remaining distance.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.180
So let's be clear,
the remaining distance

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.110
is what I haven't
filled in orange yet.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.090
So let's mark that off into
fourths of the remaining

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.590
distance.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.214
So that is half the
remaining distance.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.466
That's just 1/4, 2/4, 3/4.

00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:05.840
So we took the
remaining distance

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.910
and we divided it into fourths.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.270
And they say, then
she skipped for 1/4

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.200
of the remaining distance.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.300
So this is the remaining
distance after running.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.110
She skipped for 1/4 of it.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.980
And then she walked the
rest of the way home.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.060
So she walked to the
rest of the way home,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.990
this is the distance
that she walked.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.900
And this distance right
over here is 120 yards.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.420
What is the distance between
school and Judy's home?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.369
So there's a bunch of ways that
you could think about this.

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.160
When we talked about
the remaining distance

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.770
after running, so this
was the remaining distance

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.790
after she ran, after this
orange part right over here.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.140
You see that this
blue section is

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.990
3/4 of that remaining distance.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.220
120 yards is 3/4 of
this remaining distance.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.280
So this is equal to 3/4
of the remaining distance.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.690
So how much is 1/4 of each
of those remaining distance?

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.140
Well since this is 3/4, 1/4
is going to be 1/3 of this.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.840
1/3 of 120 is 40.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.000
So this distance
right over here is 40.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.280
This is 40.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.090
This is 40.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.030
Notice 40 plus 40
plus 40 is 120.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.510
And this right over here
is also going to be 40.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.690
These are all in terms of yards.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.050
So the remaining distance is
going to be 40 times 4 or 160

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.780
yards.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.320
So this is 160 yards.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.290
Now, what is the total distance?

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.130
Well this 160 yards,
the remaining distance

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.620
after she ran, that's half
of the total distance.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.630
So this is 160
yards, then this is

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:03.290
going to be 160 yards as well.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.120
So 160 yards plus 160 yards?

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.061
Gives us a total distance from
school to home of 320 yards.
