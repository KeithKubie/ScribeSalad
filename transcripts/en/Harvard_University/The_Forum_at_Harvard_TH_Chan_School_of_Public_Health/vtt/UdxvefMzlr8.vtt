welcome to the forum live streamed
worldwide from the leadership studio at

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.940
the Harvard th Chan School of Public
Health I'm Dean Michelle Williams the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.349
forum is a collaboration between the
Harvard Chan School and independent news

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.570
media each program features a panel of
experts addressing some of today's most

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.939
pressing public health issues the forum
is one way the school advances the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.649
frontiers of Public Health and makes
scientific insights accessible to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.840
policymakers and the public I hope you
find this program engaging and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:51.549
informative thank you for joining us

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.480
welcome to today's forum on the health
and economic concerns of rural Americans

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.490
I'm Joe Neal I'm a deputy science and
health editor at National Public Radio

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.200
NPR and I'll be your moderator today
we're going to be discussing a wide

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.820
range of concerns that rural Americans
told us about in a recent poll that we

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.040
conducted with the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation and the Harvard Chan School

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.159
you're going to be hearing some
surprising results today from that poll

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.690
and I hope it will lead to a spirited
discussion we're also going to talk

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.640
about some innovative solutions that
could help out many rural communities

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.590
and I should also point out the next
Thursday November 15th is National Rural

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.470
Health Day so it's an auspicious moment
that we convene this panel before I go

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.580
any further let me introduce our panel

Foundation in the Harvard Chan School
we're streaming live on the websites of

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.330
NPR and the forum and we're also
streaming on forum and YouTube I'm sorry

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.099
on Facebook and YouTube we'll have a
brief Q&amp;A at the end so there's still

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.879
time for you to email your questions the
address for that is the forum at HS pH

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:05.160
at Harvard sorry the forum at HS PHS
harvard.edu you can also participate in

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.310
a live chat that's happening on the
forum site right now

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.800
now to our panel the poll I mentioned as
rural Americans what they see is the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.569
biggest problems in their communities
today we ask this toward the end of the

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.170
summer in over several weeks we expected
to see that jobs in the economy would be

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.910
among the top concerns and we did indeed
find that but we were also surprised to

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.739
see the magnitude of concern about
opioids and drug abuse the federal

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.290
government has recently expanded funding
for drug prevention and treatment as you

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.380
may know and so we wanted to bring you
the government's point of view first

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.810
about that program and what it is aimed
to do so we'll have a clip now from the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.420
US Department of Agriculture

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.140
every day about a hundred and
seventy-five Americans died of drug

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.720
overdose and the majority of these
deaths are caused by opioids the opioid

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.470
epidemic is truly the crisis next door
it's really like pushing a boulder

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.269
uphill and with the addiction crisis
we're seeing kids as young as nine years

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.020
old that are using that's the population
that we're losing 15 years ago if you

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.280
told me that we were gonna have to have
a drug task force and tactical response

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.960
team at Green County I looked at you and
told you you're not we can no longer

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.960
pretend that all over America is Friday
Night Lights

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.830
there are a lot of challenges in the
rural areas from a transformative

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.900
standpoint there's got to be modern
connectivity from healthcare access

00:04:49.900 --> 00:05:10.709
telemedicine to many other types of 21st
century needs

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.850
this issue is a very high priority for
the administration secretary Purdue

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.389
really sees this as more than a health
issue this is a matter of rural

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.850
prosperity in these communities working
together we will end this stigma of

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.979
addiction defeat the opioid epidemic and
overcome the crisis next door

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.730
of course that was a clip from the
federal government's US Department of

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.770
Agriculture well no we we will no doubt
be hearing more about that response in

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.540
our discussion today and rural America's
views toward getting outside help from

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.140
various sources the federal government
state governments and/or other

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.300
organizations but first let's find out
more about the specifics of the poll Bob

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.490
what what are the main findings
so first the survey is quite unusual

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.590
it's aimed at giving voice to people's
lives so it doesn't ask about the

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.860
country it asks about your own life your
kids and the community to live in so all

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.550
the questions are about that
and so the findings are surprising if

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.200
you're in the polling world you rarely
ever see people say that the biggest

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.760
problem in their community is a health
problem and that's the opioid thing is

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.140
just quite unusual and my colleagues
here said I don't know we did expect

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:52.890
this but actually it's not this is very
very unusual if we can have the first

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.980
just PowerPoint we'll do these very
quickly so this is again people are

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.630
asked in their own words no list or
anything what is the top problem in the

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:10.680
community you live in and as you could
see opioids and drug abuse and economic

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.570
concerns are top and in Appalachia I've
been trying to learn to pronounce it in

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:21.650
the middle western way for that
it's the overwhelming problem so this

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.370
epidemic which ten years ago you just
would not have been discussed moving

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.800
away through one in four people we
interviewed knew somebody personally

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.260
that was suffering from opioid and drug
abuse and the second thing is economic

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.190
concerns which is what most people if
you watch the elections that people talk

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.750
a lot about and we are talking about
people when asked about their the

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.680
community they live in fifty five
percent of them said the economy where

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.080
they lived was fair poor so these are
people looking across the street and not

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:03.270
seeing very hopeful point of view but
Minh you actually talk to people so

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.500
if you follow the national news and no
disrespect to some of my colleagues

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.630
there's an impression that everybody is
despondent living this community so we

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:19.140
just have the next PowerPoint so it
turns out that half the people living

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.310
there believe that these very big
problems can be resolved in five years

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:31.980
there they are much more optimistic and
the other half don't so a big critical

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:37.530
issue is again when you interview in
rural America there's a great sense of

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:42.360
self reliance on neighbors communities
church groups and you ask people are you

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.480
going to need outside help and you
actually expect the answer is no we are

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.980
going to deal with this it turned out
when you think about opioids and the

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.950
economy the answer is yes so most of the
people who thought something he turned

00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:01.500
around wanted outside help and the next
PowerPoint is is a surprise if you

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.660
follow politics you would have sort of
expected that they would have thought

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.130
private groups or companies or something
would be where the outside help that's

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:16.290
what they would want and basically six
out of ten people said we expect to have

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.450
the outside out principally from
government a state was the largest but

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.750
essentially this is a political
environment that isn't very high on

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.840
government but when it came to their two
top problems they actually expect

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.530
government to play a much larger role at
for it and I think that's what the panel

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:40.440
is going to discuss about what it is
they couldn't do and the last is we took

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.450
a number of reports which had governors
and commissioners on we'd said how do

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.960
you turn around life in rural America we
just gave them a list and said which

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:57.360
ones are the most important a last power
point so what you have is that the top

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.240
two are something which would create
long term job opportunities and was very

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:09.690
clear people are not looking for
short-term startup some jobs for WPA

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.350
they want something that really sticks
and the second thing is they want

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:17.160
something done they would help their
schools out the next year

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.790
people check a box called improving
access to healthcare and if you don't

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.450
follow it and you talk to people it's
usually three things so in this case

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.950
they're worried about their words going
on there so that Falls secondly they're

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.830
worried about medical groups that they
went through last year they're not going

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.250
to be there and thirdly a sheer rural
America doesn't have enough health

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.690
insurance to pay their bills and that
falls and the last is and the pounds go

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:46.110
to discuss this people know they need a
set of skills to be viable economically

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.980
ten years from now I don't think they
know what those skills are they just

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:55.860
know they need something so that is the
really big takeaway the opioids is an

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.540
incredible finding if you surveyed
across America that just doesn't usually

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:05.870
show up but the priorities economically
and the fact the they're so concerned

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.230
they're want to know what's the other
sources of government that's pretty much

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.440
the take away but they didn't know how
to go beyond this to solve the problems

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.610
they faced thank you Bob
so what you're saying let me just follow

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:22.440
up briefly what you're saying if you did
a national survey of all Americans

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.040
opioids wouldn't show up but when you
focus in just on rural America like we

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.810
did in this poll it was a surprising
find you know when you ask people about

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:35.400
the top problems facing the country it
does not show up as the top problem

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.260
anywhere it's on a way down or a list
now people think about their own

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.540
communities differently so for it but it
just it you would expect it on a list

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.390
where you ask people now tell me about
your health problems you would think

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.470
that was ranked high not that when you
would face everything else the community

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.610
would face it would be tied with
economies which have been depressed my

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:02.430
name for for many years so this epidemic
is having an impact on how people see

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:08.010
things locally which is just not been
recognized unless you're very close to

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:12.540
these communities well that that leads
me to Ted you were Governor of Ohio and

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.850
you saw firsthand the impact of opioid
abuse and other drugs of abuse the loss

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.830
on rural communities tell us about your
experience well coming from Ohio and

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:29.370
especially growing up in Appalachia I I
was not surprised at these results

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:38.460
nationally according to the CDC in
nineteen or in 2017 we lost about 72,000

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:46.720
Americans to drug overdose deaths in
Ohio today we are losing about fourteen

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:55.090
people per day and the sharpest increase
obviously has been in in most recent

00:12:55.090 --> 00:13:03.520
years the use of fentanyl and synthetic
opiates so it's a huge problem I think

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:09.520
it's a national public health problem
and in my judgment it hasn't been

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:18.000
sufficiently recognized as such so I'm
not surprised with your results bob

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.340
i-i-i i believe that rural areas have
particular problems when it comes to

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:31.420
these kinds of issues both healthcare
and economic opportunities we need

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.320
treatment
we need medically assisted treatment we

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.360
need long-term treatment we need trained
treatment professionals but there are

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.960
other aspects to this problem that are
related but equally important housing

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:53.890
issues transportation issues food
insecurity problems all of these are

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.660
characteristics of rural areas
especially the Appalachian area and I

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:06.010
think at least tangentially if not
absolutely directly related to the to

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:12.400
the opioid problem recently we had in
Ohio a ballot initiative which would

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.740
have dramatically changed how
individuals who were apprehended

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:24.610
arrested for drug offenses would be
handled that they would be dealt with

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:33.940
locally they would not in most cases be
charged with a felony and initially

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.650
there was strong support for that and
then questions came about regarding how

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.430
it be implemented in and whether or not
it would be good for

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:48.339
state the bottom line is it failed in
the most recent election but I am

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:54.360
absolutely convinced that that both
political parties and an array of

00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:01.350
Ohioans recognize that at least the way
our state is dealing with these problems

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:07.529
need to be really given careful thought

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:15.250
because when a person is caught up in an
addiction there is no there is no quick

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:23.230
easy answer a treatment effective
treatment tends to be long and arduous

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:29.260
there are relapses and and it is
affecting and we're going to hear more

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:35.560
about this I think from David it's
affecting the economic conditions in all

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:40.540
parts of Ohio and that's certainly true
in the Appalachian area well I think our

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.260
poll did show that the - well it didn't
show but it highlighted that the two are

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.490
very interconnected and David you've
studied what it takes to reinvigorate

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:52.750
local economies what have you learned
about what does and doesn't work well I

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:58.390
think that first thing we need to
address is there is a train of thought

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:03.459
and I think it's a very valid train of
thought that the opioid crisis is really

00:16:03.459 --> 00:16:08.140
a symptom of a lot of other deep-seated
issues including the economy the local

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.700
economies and there are several reasons
for that and while we can't ignore those

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:19.029
that the symptoms of not only the opioid
crisis but other public health issues in

00:16:19.029 --> 00:16:23.650
rural communities we really still need
to understand and deal with that root

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:31.150
cause of the local economies and for
many many years decades that default

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:37.680
mechanism is the mindset that if we just
create jobs that'll solve our problems

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:46.390
and the evidence is showing that this
enterprise of the business attraction in

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:53.709
and of itself is not the panacea for
communities there are a lot of other

00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:56.380
deep said other issues that when you
didn't deal

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:02.320
and we're not saying that job attraction
should go away that activity should go

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:11.410
away it should be dealt with and pursued
maybe at different levels but you can't

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:16.120
have successful job attraction and
unless you have strong viable

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:22.929
communities and and the bottom line is
is the evidence is showing that jobs go

00:17:22.929 --> 00:17:27.610
to where the people are it's not people
go to where the jobs are

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:32.770
that's switched somewhere in the 70s and
the trends are stronger and stronger as

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.500
we move on jobs go to where the people
at the booth are people want to live in

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:43.809
viable communities that have a strong of
civic infrastructure strong physical

00:17:43.809 --> 00:17:51.190
infrastructure and strong and robust
schools the research shows that time

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:56.230
after time strong robust schools are
critical that along with along with

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:04.570
those other infrastructure components
and as an aside we are finding that

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.460
people will pay for that
when you talk about tax issues but

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:14.650
that's another issue for sure Katrina
your work at the Robert Wood Johnson

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:19.480
Foundation focuses on issues that affect
health and well-being in rural America

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.950
and community development what do you
see in these poll results and what do

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:28.510
they suggest to you about how to move
forward so in addition to the issues

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.929
that have been already discussed quite a
bit I think with the opioids and

00:18:31.929 --> 00:18:36.970
Economic Opportunity needs which are
certainly important I want to make sure

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.630
that we elevate one other finding that I
think is really important from this poll

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:44.200
which is the importance and strength of
social connection in rural communities

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.299
across the country and we know from
research that social connectedness

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:53.110
between families and neighbors and
neighbors looking out for each other and

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:58.299
helping in times of need really leads to
better health and longer longer lives

00:18:58.299 --> 00:19:04.960
and better health and well-being then
those folks that are facing greater

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.100
social isolation and so that social
connectedness I think is a really

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.560
important find
to elevate from this poll although it

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:18.280
doesn't stand out as highly in some of
the the top findings that that get a lot

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.840
of the national attention and I would
also elevate that that social

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.560
connectedness is really important and
connected to economic opportunity and

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.220
economic mobility so for example if we
look at Raj Shetty's data from the

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.750
opportunity Atlas and some recent
studies that have been that have been

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:42.130
looking at that data folks might assume
that kids that grow up having better

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:47.640
opportunity than their parents have been
thus having greater economic mobility

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.480
what might be coming from urban and
suburban areas but actually generally

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:58.750
speaking rural youth are have greater
economic opportunity than in other

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:04.990
places and that is in large part because
of better social connectivity and job

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:09.670
matching which really points to the
strength and opportunity of local

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:15.730
solutions local policies and solutions
that drive that opportunity thank you

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:20.650
before we move to our open discussion
the next part of our hour here with you

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:25.120
all today I want to set the stage with a
short clip about improving opportunities

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.190
in rural communities in innovative ways
the clip comes from the Robert Wood

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:34.630
Johnson Foundation and it shows how
business owners in Allen County Kansas

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:39.130
which is not far from where my family
settled way back in the 1800s I should

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:44.050
point out are addressing the needs in
their community we're going to hear

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:52.600
first from a man named Joe works Joe
works has a servant's heart in 2010 when

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:58.540
the national economy was in recession
his company BMW trailer hitches saw a

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:05.540
dramatic drop-off in sales
what Joe chose to do rather than lay his

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:11.120
friends and neighbors off he put them to
work in the communities I think the

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:18.080
desire to give back to the community
came before BMW I think that was just

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:24.590
part of the way our family was built and
that's something that's contagious that

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:35.000
is influenced ray Moloney INLA harp I
have a recycling center and we do

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.190
everything from aluminum cans to
combines if it's metal we'll buy it well

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:46.460
I looked around the area and decided
that we needed some workers in around

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.570
here you know people that knew how to do
things with their hands so he put his

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:57.560
money where his mouth is by buying a
former lumberyard complex and donating

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.180
buildings on that complex so that it
could become the regional world

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.740
Technology Center well it took some
prodding you know to get this thing

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:13.580
going so when we go through here we're
gonna have our 21 inch boards run past

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.900
our 17 inch boards well right now we
have construction trades going on

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.160
sponsored by Fort Scott Community
College thanks to a grant from the goth

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:28.100
group Neosho County College is on board
with welding I know we have 20 kids in

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.640
the construction program and I know
there's both classes of welding or full

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:36.590
okay like 27 and the welding is yeah
keep the jobs here keep them here that's

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:41.620
what we're hoping to do train kids and
try to keep them home well that's

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.790
particularly important in a county like
Allen County which has lost about a

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:52.070
thousand people over the last decade
it's down to about 13,000 people it's a

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:58.250
very sparsely populated part of Kansas
Katrina can you talk more about the

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.820
rural Technology Center and other
innovative programs like we just saw in

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:06.830
the clip yeah well I would highlight
that Allen County is is one example and

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:11.120
we've we've elevated through our culture
of Health Prize several communities and

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.290
actually many rural communities that
bring to life different solutions

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:18.590
that really address social and economic
opportunity and advance health so I

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:23.750
think they are great local stories to
learn from there are a few other

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:28.310
examples that I'd like to lift up as
particularly promising models that that

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:33.320
could be learned from one is project ago
which is at elementary program was

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:40.060
originally designed to provide expand
access to specialty care for hepatitis C

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:46.040
tella mentoring being providing training
over to professionals in very specific

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.530
specialty areas and it was originally
developed for hepatitis C but has been

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.910
expanded across many different issue
areas and that started in New Mexico it

00:23:55.910 --> 00:24:01.520
did and it's gone across not just the
country but across the world and has

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.330
expanded outside of health care issues
into things like special education and

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:10.610
different specialties and right now it's
being used in 30 states across the

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:15.290
country specifically to increase access
to quality care for treatment for opioid

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:21.590
addiction and drug abuse and but I think
it's it's a very useful model to expand

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:28.970
and it's an evidence-based model to
expand a issues and and care specialty

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:35.480
across rural areas in particular but
aside from thinking about health care

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:42.200
models and and and health care settings
in particular I also wanted to elevate a

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.540
group of organizations that's working
across rural America they are calling

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.380
themselves the persistent poverty
working group and it's a group of

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:55.100
community development institutions and
economic development institutions across

00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:01.100
the country that are working in the deep
south to close banking deserts as we

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.090
talk about food deserts there are places
that nobody has access to a bacon

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:09.320
counter or credit there folks working
along the us-mexico border and

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:15.320
unincorporated areas to provide
solutions that counteract predatory

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:21.530
payday lending and actually provide some
access to to credit in those ways and

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:27.190
folks working in the center of the US
and Arkansas and the and the south to

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.630
address some
the greatest infrastructure needs around

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:35.220
water and sewage that you can't do much
development in a community if you have

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:41.070
sewage running down your your streets
and and folks working to increase

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:45.750
capacity and and increase access to
affordable and quality housing for

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:50.450
example and Native communities across
the country and in Central Appalachia

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:56.309
and so I think we've seen that these
organizations that are working at

00:25:56.309 --> 00:25:59.970
regional scale across jurisdictional
lines across issue areas across racial

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:05.669
ethnic groups have found solutions that
work in those places and so if there are

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:13.890
ways that national or state or or other
folks can can connect to and support and

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:18.600
enable those local solutions that are
already that are already underway and

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.690
showing a lot of promise and could just
use more enablers David you and I were

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:30.860
talking before we came in here today
about automation and the link between

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:39.419
automation and opioids is there a link
we think there is and just to give a

00:26:39.419 --> 00:26:46.020
quick explanation that works the we need
to understand employing the mix of

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:54.780
employment people actually working jobs
in rural areas the largest component in

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.330
the largest percentage of people working
still primarily work in manufacturing

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:04.770
and that's around depending and
especially in the survey area and we're

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:10.410
looking at Appalachia Midwest and South
it's still around twenty-five to thirty

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:15.299
percent of the workforce works in
manufacturing or some components of that

00:27:15.299 --> 00:27:24.840
and that's diverged more than the rest
of the states if you look at the

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:30.150
employment mix it's probably around ten
percent or less the rest of the state

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:35.030
works in manufacturing or statewide less
than that so you see a preponderance of

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:42.460
still in manufacturing and then we also
have to look at

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:47.840
jobs job losses and there's been a lot
of news the last couple of years about

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.470
that but the fact of the matter is
different studies show different numbers

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:57.770
but really anywhere from sixty to eighty
percent of job losses are really due to

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:03.440
automation not due to offshoring that's
due to automation and we estimated

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:10.670
closer to the eighty percent number and
so that's that's there so we're also

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:17.450
taking a really hard look at occupations
that are vulnerable to to automation and

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:23.330
also occupations vulnerable to
offshoring but the the bigger risk for

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:29.330
occupations is in the automation up to
sixty percent in a lot of counties those

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:34.730
occupations are vulnerable to automation
and that the concentration is in

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:38.420
manufacturing so you have manufacturing
in rural communities vulnerable

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:45.350
populations to to automation and the
segment of the population that's most

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:52.310
vulnerable or the the segments that have
the least education that the studies are

00:28:52.310 --> 00:29:00.050
proving us out so you can see it and
then we've also just published a study

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:09.530
that that does show just the stress of a
threat of automation as spiraling

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:14.240
impacts on the family and on the
community so these are all real

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:20.570
challenges the community has to face and
so that is you know you know we're just

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:27.430
exploring what this all means but a very
quick answer is robust education and

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:31.250
looking at those kinds of things so
that's a quick explanation of the

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.190
impacts of automation I just want to
follow up on the study you just talked

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.240
about when you said that just the stress
of automation coming how are people

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:48.230
aware that that's about to happen I mean
is how did you measure that the the way

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:54.740
it's I mean you we know that the we know
the automation threat is there people in

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.930
the workplace are aware
of the automation it's a threat it's the

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:05.330
way it's treated they see equipment come
in and they think well that's time it's

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:10.040
my turn mm-hmm and it's it's a very
visceral we were talking very modulus

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.240
cars - and driverless starts and
driverless trucks and that that's

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:23.060
another policy issue that that really
folk forces us to understand yes there

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:28.280
is a tactical need for example truck
drivers there is a tactical need and a

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.730
lot of states and communities are
putting millions of dollars into

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:39.380
training for truck drivers but we also
know that strategically we are going to

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:45.590
get driverless technology sooner than
later and so what are we doing to

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:50.180
address the tactical need that
strategically preparing that workforce

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:57.860
for whatever other job demands might be
out there and I'm wondering if we're

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:02.840
paying enough attention to that
strategic imperative of really

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:08.090
well-rounded training and education
basically learning to learn or that

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:12.890
broader set of skills that the you know
the reasoning skills and comparative

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:17.780
analysis skills the critical math skills
and those types of things I want to get

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:22.880
to opioids in a minute but before I do
Ted one one solution that's often talked

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.340
about is and tried our economic zones
and tax breaks in various states you

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:33.530
know how is that working is that a
viable solution still doesn't have an

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:37.970
effect you know I think part of the
problem is that we tend to try to

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:45.830
compartmentalize the answers to the
complex problems that we face and when

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:50.000
it comes to economic development and
when it comes to health care and when it

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.110
comes to dealing with the opioid crisis
I think we need to understand that we

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:03.470
need a more comprehensive holistic
approach I would use the phrase provide

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:09.230
wraparound services it has been
estimated that

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:15.830
in terms of rural healthcare and this
this data comes from the nationalization

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:23.330
of state offices of rural healthcare by
the way they say that about 20% of the

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:30.140
healthcare related problems are
attributed to access to healthcare about

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:39.230
30% can be attributed to behaviors
health behaviors and perhaps up to 50%

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:49.460
as a result of socio-economic and
environmental factors and so I think we

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.230
need an approach that is that that
understands the breadth of the problem

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:59.030
and I would I would try to illustrate
that by just sharing with you a an

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:05.840
experience I had a few months ago I was
driving on a cold day from Columbus Ohio

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:11.000
to Athens Ohio to teach a class
I passed a fellow standing alongside the

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.390
road hitchhiking I stopped and picked
him up and we chatted as we were driving

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:23.630
along he told me he was trying to get to
drug treatment he told me he had just

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:29.270
recently got gotten out of prison he
told me he was alienated from his

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:36.320
daughter and he said to me you know I
wish I had a car because if I had a car

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:43.640
it'd be easier to get a job and you know
I think about that fella a lot I share

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:50.110
that story a lot because here's an
individual who has a life situation

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:56.960
having been caught up in drugs having
gone to prison having gotten a felony

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.220
which makes it difficult to get a job
once you're out of prison not having a

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:09.700
car having to hitchhike to drug
treatment on a cold winter morning and I

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:16.640
think you know I think he illustrates
part of the problem that so many people

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:22.820
in rural areas face there are
transportation difficulties job

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.830
lack of job opportunities lack of access
to technology we were talking earlier

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:34.040
about so many communities not having
access to broadband technologies and and

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:42.710
and and and so I think I think we really
need to not focus just specifically on a

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:52.070
person's drug behavior but I think we
need to look at at at services that

00:34:52.070 --> 00:35:00.400
provide support many people I think most
people who do get into drug treatment

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:09.680
have periods of relapse and and so a
short-term answer is is not likely to

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.750
solve the problem we need to look at
this problem holistically

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:23.000
comprehensively and and understand that
there are there are many factors that go

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.270
into a person's getting caught up into
this kind of addiction and many factors

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:37.240
that go into their efforts to get out of
this and and and to live a healthy life

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:42.620
well we saw in the the video earlier the
government's pouring more the federal

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.840
government is about to pour a lot more
money into treatment and prevention yet

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.220
Bob you and I were talking about public
support for treatment is actually fairly

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:56.870
low what do we know about public support
for that kind of treatment that that

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:02.900
governor Strickland is advocating so in
the middle of an epidemic there's a lot

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.590
of public support at the moment for
throwing some money at this but there's

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:10.670
not a great deal of understanding of
what the it is so large share of the

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:16.040
public thinks this is a short-term
treatable problem and so it's some time

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.910
they're gonna wake up and find out that
this is very long-term and want to know

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:26.900
why about that an issue of race later
but let me raise it very quickly because

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:34.040
it's very worrisome in the long term we
asked in another survey people about how

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.440
would you measure the success of
treatment

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.280
and the number one thing was well going
back to work well those of you familiar

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.740
if you are recovering alcoholic you are
protected by federal and state laws your

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:50.000
employer if you've slept can't fire you
at the moment a very large number of

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.470
employers do not have to rehire you back
and can easily fire you if you slip back

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:58.160
so we're talking about in the public's
mind spending hundreds millions of

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.170
dollars and you're gonna go back to work
but we haven't found the employers that

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:08.480
are willing to take people who tested
positive on a drug issue so we're at a

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.170
point of view this is a crisis that
people want to spend money on but

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:15.710
there's not an understanding about Ted
said about the long-term nature of the

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:22.310
treatment what they are for this and
also the employment implications if

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:25.790
we're going to solve rural America
people have to go back to work and they

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:30.710
have to be protected if they're in
treatment so you could find a public

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:34.550
backlash three or four years down the
line if they think this is something

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:39.560
that's close to antibiotics three months
of treatment you're back when in fact

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:43.400
it's not and that is just the worrisome
thing you don't see it on the front

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.630
because the president said it's crisis
let's spend money on it but it could be

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:52.069
three or four years from now if there's
not a better understanding and also if

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:55.819
people who are in treatment can't go
back to work that could be a very big

00:37:55.819 --> 00:38:00.500
political issue but isn't the arc I'm
looking at a question we have we got

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:07.819
from online isn't the arc of in our
political system right now you the three

00:38:07.819 --> 00:38:11.780
billion dollar expansion notwithstanding
isn't the arc toward more

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:17.900
criminalization or supporting more
punitive measures against producers as

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.960
well as go the other way around
they do that they're closer to the

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:26.030
governor oh they are so we actually
compared attitudes towards when we had

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:32.270
the big cocaine and other outbreaks and
they're all shift the majority of people

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:36.050
say treatment and not prison that's
different if you're saying you're

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:41.510
selling large sections of it but there's
been incredible even though and that's

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.839
the problem they don't know what the it
is but they've absolutely decided by

00:38:44.839 --> 00:38:47.930
filling people filling prisons office
night is not the answer so they're

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:51.800
definitely been a societal shift
the treatment well then why did the Ohio

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:58.730
measure fail so badly
well it was it was probably not crafted

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:05.840
as as it should have been but the idea
behind it is as a sound idea I believe

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:12.080
and I it is my hope that the Legislature
will you know will take this up but if

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:18.950
we can prevent people from getting
felony records if if we can deal with

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:25.310
them at the local level rather than
sending them to a state prison if we can

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:36.470
have an array of appropriate data-driven
medically assisted treatments if if we

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:44.000
do those things I think we can have an
impact it is it is very very difficult

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.780
I've worked in a prison for a temper of
years as a psychologist it is very

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:53.180
difficult if you have a prison record
and you're looking for a job

00:39:53.180 --> 00:40:01.400
it just is and and we have massive
numbers of our citizens now who who have

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:10.340
felony records and and and so the idea
is to is to try to recognize that these

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:20.180
addictions are are are medically related
medical conditions and I think one of

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:27.980
the reasons Bob that you say that people
are now more big shift shifting toward

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:33.170
treatment rather than prison is that it
has impacted so many people and and

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:39.320
we're talking today about rural Ohio and
and you know and maybe some of the more

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:45.740
economically distressed areas of our
country but but this addiction problem

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:53.119
has affected every strata of society and
I think more and more individuals are

00:40:53.119 --> 00:41:00.710
coming to recognize that if they aren't
at risk as an individual their family is

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:06.320
at risk their neighbors
at risk and and we're not going to

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:14.210
punish our way out of it we we need to
provide appropriate treatments before I

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:20.870
move off of opioids and drugs our poll
found in rural America somewhat to me at

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:24.410
least surprising number of people who
said they had been personally affected

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:27.860
by the opioid crisis and we should not
forget

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:33.490
Methos resurging and main part of the
country what did what did the poll find

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:40.100
so you had one in four people who were
somebody that they really knew what for

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:47.540
there is an age difference yes I mean
younger people are much more frequent a

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.490
quick clarification many people
particularly if they're older can

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:58.670
separate out the type of drug that
you're using so in Kansas meth is a much

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:03.620
bigger issue and people were worried
well they didn't say meth people just

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.460
say my god they have a drug problem
they don't go down and look at what the

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:13.340
test results are so but this explains
why we lumped all of these because it

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:17.240
was an open end equation and so people
want exactly what is the brand that

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:22.370
they're addicted to absolutely and
people know very much personally and

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:26.570
they're very worried about it because
it's spreading among people that they

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:32.540
really know and without getting whether
or not it causes the economy or others

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.280
it's just very hard to envision

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:41.030
economics things coming back if you
somehow together can't get that under

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:46.580
control because it's so spreading across
so many communities right let me turn to

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.550
another question from the web before I
go to the audience

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:55.160
Roger Valdez I hope I have that
pronounced right his director of Seattle

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.990
for Growth wrote in and said in
Washington state whorl counties have

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:04.910
higher levels of poverty lower vacancy
rates older buildings lower wages and

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:09.280
higher rates of unemployment however
state level subsidies are going to fund

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:15.690
nonprofit housing construction in urban
areas especially Seattle can you can

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:20.250
someone on the panel comment on this and
discuss a bit about housing and what can

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:24.119
be done to address this growing problem
among people living and working in rural

00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:29.910
areas I'll take an attempt at that in
Indiana

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:35.010
which we of course study more closely
but I think this is typical of what

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:43.140
we're seeing there is that there are two
things going on there there is a demand

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:48.510
in rural communities a perceived demand
in rural communities of market-rate

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:56.970
housing that people are talking about
new home construction and and so we have

00:43:56.970 --> 00:44:02.910
task forces and different initiatives
trying to address that but we also have

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:14.250
a really really high population or stock
of abandoned homes and he's in these

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:20.520
communities and you could have both at
the same time but what we're beginning

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:28.980
to understand is that huge oversupply of
stock impacts the cut the the price of

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:37.710
the house and in 41 of the rural
counties that we studied the cost of

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:45.990
building a new home is higher than what
it can sell for and unless we deal with

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:54.480
that stock of homes that Realtors don't
count but the market counts that that's

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.310
that's one of the first things we have
to do so communities are trying to get

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:03.210
ahead of that and trying to deal with
that stock first so that that's from the

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:10.020
market mechanism approach and I know
especially after the are and the the

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:14.369
recession and the the programs were that
there was a lot of effort to deal with

00:45:14.369 --> 00:45:19.680
that issue but that's still a huge issue
that we need to deal with and then we

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.250
also have to look at different these are
state level issues in community level

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:29.490
issues what kind of tax structures are
inhibiting the ability to

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:38.730
rent homes and you know that could be a
response to a proactive response to

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:47.070
threats with gentrification and we this
is something that it's kind of like the

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:52.380
jobs issue we know there are issues
there housing is an issue but there are

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:58.220
so many layers we have to uh that we
really need to understand hmm all right

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:03.060
do we have any questions from the
audience please wait for the microphone

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:09.930
which Lisa mera what's our great
producer is bringing there you go

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:14.400
hi my name is Leila Romani I'm a program
manager here at the Chang school I

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:23.430
really commend Bob Strickland what you
said on the approach to address us not

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:29.880
with incarceration but with dealing with
this issue locally I have a question for

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.020
both of you actually
what research has been done or

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:38.190
conversations have been had about this
change in mentality of how to approach

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:43.500
this issue compared to minority
communities elsewhere in history in the

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:49.950
US and the fact that incarceration was a
big part of addressing the crack

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:58.230
addictions in the 1880s how could it has
that been a frank conversation I think

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:05.540
what you're referring to is some people
believe and I think correctly so that

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:12.750
when the crack epidemic exploded that
was a very hard line a lot of people

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:20.070
were incarcerated and and you know our
drug laws and our punishments have not

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:26.130
always been consistent I mean that was
obvious in the discrepancy between crack

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:31.500
cocaine and powder cocaine for example
and now there does seem to be a shift as

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:38.430
bob said and maybe he can speak as to
why he thinks that has occurred more

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:43.360
toward treatment less toward punishment
I would hope that that's big

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:49.000
we have come to realize that punishment
and the approach that we've used in the

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:57.240
past it's not worked very well I hope
it's not because as as some believe that

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:04.050
it's the kind of population that is most
caught up in the current epidemic versus

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:09.190
versus the populations that were most
associated with the use of crack cocaine

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:15.910
I can't argue I understand your question
and and I I cannot give you a definitive

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:20.380
answer I don't know if Bob would we
simply say that but we have to be

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:25.710
straight and honest minority communities
believe that the first epidemic which

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:30.130
impacted them much more greatly got a
different response from the president

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:36.310
down to this epidemic which is much more
widespread demographically people say

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:40.540
well it's only an epidemic affecting
white Americans turns out Latinos rate

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:45.040
this is a very very serious concern we
can't answer the question but from the

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:50.380
president down in that other epidemic
locked them up it was the national

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:55.090
policy and it was supported on the
ground through pulse and now we're the

00:48:55.090 --> 00:49:01.660
other way around people want to try
alternatives but you can answers Ted

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.860
said is filling prisons you know
thousands thousands of people and the

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:10.870
end of the day it didn't solve it that
could have been as big a factor as oh

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:15.190
it's in one group or another but it just
looks like if people are convinced that

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:19.840
filling prisons and you can find very
conservative communities where the

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.500
political leaders are saying we've got
to get out of the prison that's not the

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:27.520
way to deal with this and then when
you're back this other question is Ted

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:32.110
hit well we have to help them recover
and be employed they'll never be

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:35.970
employed again so I think people have
really understood the consequences of

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:40.960
fighting a drug epidemic by putting
built in prison but there's real tension

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.520
between minority communities the poll is
elicited comments from people saying I

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:50.080
wish they would have worried in this
other error when it's so impacted Harlem

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.590
or here or something like that the
political people didn't talk about it

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:55.950
but there actually has been a very real
shit

00:49:55.950 --> 00:50:00.940
right can we have another question from
the audience we're going to go a little

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:05.470
past one o'clock just for people who are
my name is Nam I'm a health policy

00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:07.990
student here at the chance school thank
you all so much for sharing your

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:14.710
insights my question is for Katrina you
spoke a lot about or elevated some

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:18.400
telemedicine approaches that are meant
to address some of the accessibility

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:24.700
issues that we've been talking about do
we see this as a real comprehensive

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:30.720
approach or is this more a band-aid to
address you know the real

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:35.230
infrastructural issues with the rural
health system should our money be

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:40.809
diverted towards enhancing that system
or is telemedicine the way forward I

00:50:40.809 --> 00:50:44.499
love that you asked that question
actually I think it's really exciting

00:50:44.499 --> 00:50:48.970
because I think what we've all talked
about is that there's no single silver

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:55.509
bullet right the opioid crisis is an
urgent crisis that's that folks are

00:50:55.509 --> 00:51:00.430
dealing with on a daily basis that we
have to take on and this is one just one

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:06.130
part of how we can take it on certainly
the hospital closures and that the

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:10.989
healthcare crisis across the country is
another issue that that we are working

00:51:10.989 --> 00:51:16.299
on and and is important for to be dealt
with but I think also it's important to

00:51:16.299 --> 00:51:22.569
elevate what folks have said before
about how healthcare is actually just

00:51:22.569 --> 00:51:26.529
one small part also of how we think
about what what creates the opportunity

00:51:26.529 --> 00:51:31.569
for folks to be healthy and live long
and good lives and so it's really

00:51:31.569 --> 00:51:36.700
important for us also to remember as
we're taking on those those kind of in

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:41.529
our face issues to think about the
social opportunities the economic

00:51:41.529 --> 00:51:47.249
opportunities that are really critical
the public infrastructure education jobs

00:51:47.249 --> 00:51:53.589
that are that are really critical to and
I think also what what you mentioned

00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:58.299
governor is that we have to also
remember I think often as we have these

00:51:58.299 --> 00:52:02.920
national conversations we can become
very siloed in our certain issue area or

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:07.480
our certain sector but in real life we
all know that actually all of this is

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.819
very much connected we can't talk about
house

00:52:09.819 --> 00:52:12.910
without thinking about how that relates
to transportation and how that relates

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:17.469
to access to our job
and how that relates to education and

00:52:17.469 --> 00:52:21.880
all of those pieces and so those that
are working on these issues in their

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:28.239
communities and finding those solutions
are that it all weaves together so it's

00:52:28.239 --> 00:52:32.259
not just working across sectors and
across issue areas but also across

00:52:32.259 --> 00:52:38.410
jurisdictional lines and into regions of
scale so I think just again it certainly

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:45.309
it's not tell it you know telehealth is
one piece we can't do it without it but

00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:52.509
it's only one piece thank you I think we
have a few more minutes left for one

00:52:52.509 --> 00:52:58.900
more question
looking through them here we have a lot

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:07.589
of questions about opioids of course and
rightly so in this question comes in

00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:12.880
from it doesn't say here but when it
comes to the opioid crisis in rural

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:17.109
America pill mills are a huge problem in
West Virginia which I believe has the

00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:23.049
highest rate of opioid prescriptions and
deaths we have a pill mill crisis what

00:53:23.049 --> 00:53:27.339
regulations can realistically be put in
place to increase scrutiny at the local

00:53:27.339 --> 00:53:31.839
state and federal levels to stop this
type of illegal over prescribing by

00:53:31.839 --> 00:53:38.079
doctors and pharmacists anyone want to
take that one well we had a huge problem

00:53:38.079 --> 00:53:40.619
with pills

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:48.640
I followed what I call dirty doctors
from community to community over a

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.859
period of months working with with the
FBI and local law enforcement we were

00:53:53.859 --> 00:53:58.390
finally able to to close down these pill
mills Portsmouth Ohio it went time they

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:04.319
say had about seven pill mills and
people would stand in lines to get in

00:54:04.319 --> 00:54:11.859
pay is $75 and come out with a
prescription I would just suggest that

00:54:11.859 --> 00:54:22.329
your caller contact the the authorities
in Ohio and find out how we did it but

00:54:22.329 --> 00:54:26.470
we actually
the pill mill problem hasn't been

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:33.250
totally solved but largely solved in in
in Ohio now but it took it took great

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:38.590
effort and it took law enforcement and
and a lot of time to get it accomplished

00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:42.580
I know I see a report almost every week
from states across the country of

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:47.500
another pill mill shutdown so it still
clearly as flourishing well in these

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:52.060
last few minutes I'd like to give the
panel an opportunity to give us one

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:56.560
takeaway message from what you've
learned from the poll what we've

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:03.510
discussed here today and I'll start with
Katrina so I think what I want to

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:08.350
highlight then is something I haven't
heard us talk a lot about today that the

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:13.480
poll did highlight and and we've learned
through our other message testing that

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:19.150
we've been doing a lot of in the past
six months is that it's easy for us to

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:24.910
talk about these issues about opioids
about economic development and Economic

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:30.270
Opportunity and in a way that makes
rural America seem like a monolith and

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:34.120
really what the poll highlights for us
too

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:39.580
yet again is that you know there is very
diverse perspective very diverse

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:44.740
experience very diverse assets and
problems in different rural places

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:49.870
across the country and so as we think
about solutions or needs and priorities

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:54.220
it's really important not just to look
to the findings from this poll but to

00:55:54.220 --> 00:56:00.490
connect with the local leaders working
in these places and so that sit down

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:05.110
with data and I'll just highlight a
couple of resources that might be useful

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:10.200
in that is County Health Rankings
provides county level data related to

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:17.260
jobs education opportunity health help
different health issues and housing and

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:23.530
other issues at a county level across
the country and recently we released a

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:30.730
u.s. a leap data which provides life
expectancy at birth for every census or

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:34.330
almost every census tract across the
country and census tract is like the

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:37.609
neighborhood level so it gives you much
more specificity

00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:43.400
so I would just elevate the importance
of recognizing that that nuance and

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:47.089
sitting down with local leaders and
local data to identify the priorities in

00:56:47.089 --> 00:56:53.299
the individual communities and that the
real importance lifted up through some

00:56:53.299 --> 00:56:57.049
of our other research in partnership
with the Noor qual Center and building

00:56:57.049 --> 00:57:03.309
relationships and Trust with with folks
in in place so that we're not

00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:12.499
reinforcing the narrative about division
thank you David I want to build on that

00:57:12.499 --> 00:57:18.589
a little bit but but I think the one
thing that we really need to understand

00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:23.660
and it's really kind of in response to
the poll is that the communities we've

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:30.109
observed really succeed are the
communities that own the issues and they

00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:36.619
understand and they try to access the
databases and those types of things and

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:41.329
they know that they're going to need
outside help but they they aren't

00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:46.880
looking for the troops to come in and my
observation and having worked in state

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:51.710
government is States are more willing to
come into the communities that figure

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:56.960
out how to help themselves and because
they're showing that vested interest in

00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.619
that and the other component of it
especially when you look at economic

00:58:00.619 --> 00:58:02.690
development and also something that's
solving some of these problems

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:08.569
especially in the areas that that we're
talking about in regional areas we

00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:14.239
haven't really talked the the
agglomeration of labor markets and the

00:58:14.239 --> 00:58:19.039
synergy between communities and even the
rural urban divide it's really not a

00:58:19.039 --> 00:58:24.319
divide it's a continuum and most rural
communities in this area are within

00:58:24.319 --> 00:58:31.369
commuting distance of either
micropolitan area or a metropolitan area

00:58:31.369 --> 00:58:37.460
and they're not little islands unto
themselves and we need to get over that

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:44.150
and that barrier that psychological
barrier of the community as a solvent

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:48.319
for themselves so we need to look at
that and regional approaches to and

00:58:48.319 --> 00:58:57.740
where the communities can add value
the region bub well um not talked to we

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:12.799
talked about Ted Bob as long as I can
talk I don't care what you call me so we

00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:18.440
we talked about the fact that people in
these areas know they need help a

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:23.420
federal level state that will help and
and local level help and I think that's

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:31.010
really true and I would just point out
that Ohio we expanded Medicaid seven

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:36.049
hundred thousand Ohioans now get access
to health care because of that and much

00:59:36.049 --> 00:59:41.720
of the treatment for people who have
these addiction problems is being paid

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:48.260
for through Medicaid and just an example
of how important that is I visited a

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:54.230
small 25-bed critical care hospital in
Appalachia just within the last couple

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:58.190
of weeks
and I was told that seventy-five to

00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:05.359
eighty percent of the resources coming
into that Hospital were Medicare and

01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:12.380
Medicaid and so I think that's a
terrific example of how states and the

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:17.299
federal government's can work together
to try to help these rural areas deal

01:00:17.299 --> 01:00:23.980
with this addiction problem all right
now the real Bob

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:29.920
so surprised when we asked people watch
what should be done there's a big

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.810
investment a big belief in doing
something with the schools in advanced

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:40.750
training and technology the real problem
and they would service this what should

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:44.530
they be training their kids for for 10
years from now and I think if we had a

01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:49.390
follow-up question they wouldn't have an
answer to that they would say maybe it

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:52.480
shouldn't be truck towers but what
should it be maybe I should be doing

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.250
artificial intelligence but if you're
gonna help people help themselves they

01:00:57.250 --> 01:01:01.630
have to have some sense of what the
future education we had a significant

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:05.350
number of people who wanted to go back
and get advanced training but I think if

01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:08.920
you ask the second question they'd be
scared that what they took would never

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.480
get them anywhere and so people are
gonna need advice if you were really

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:18.369
trying to get your local school to make
sure your kids don't have to leave what

01:01:18.369 --> 01:01:22.270
is it you'd focus on and at one end you
can have stronger liberal arts at the

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:27.220
other you can have stem programs but I
was really concerned that people look at

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:31.330
training and schools is the answer
without knowing what should be in those

01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:37.720
schools that's take away from those well
I want to thank everyone for joining us

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:42.760
today thanking thank our panel for being
here you can continue the discussion on

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:48.880
the forum website the chat is still
going on and that concludes our panel

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:54.590
for today thank you
