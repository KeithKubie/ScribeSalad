00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.857
Last in our series of the three main types of selectors,

00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:06.860
you can also select elements by ID.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.620
Unlike tags or classes, IDs are specific to single elements, so

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.700
we should expect to see a jQuery collection with only one DOM element returned.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.630
Selecting by ID is easy.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.440
Simply put a hashtag or pound sign or whatever you want to call it in front of

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.220
the ID name inside quotes so you've got a string and you'll be selecting by ID.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.880
For this quiz, set the nav variable equal to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.740
the jQuery collection of the DOM element with ID of nav.
