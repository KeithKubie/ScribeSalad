00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.463
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.750
&gt;&gt; And now I am very pleased
to introduce the next author.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.163
You've seen lots of
good authors today.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.363
Well, Anita Silvey knows all
about good children's books.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.016
She served as the publisher
of children's books

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.146
for Houghton Mifflin and as
the editor of The Horn Book,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.356
which is the magazine about
children's literature.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.913
Her books include 100
Best Books for Children

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.520
and 500 Great Books for Teens.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.266
Her latest book is Everything
I Needed To Know I Learned

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.593
From A Children's Book,
which seems pretty true.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.900
And she's currently working on
the Children's Book-A-Day Almanac

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.080
as well as an illustrated biography
for children called Henry Knox:

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.333
Bookseller, Soldier, Patriot.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.936
She has said only the very best

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.863
of anything can be good
enough for the young.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.370
Lucky for the young Anita
Silvey is one of the best.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:49.096
Please join me in welcoming
Anita Silvey.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.510
[ Applause ]

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.820
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Thank you.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.353
Do I have any book lovers out here?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.753
Do I have any book lovers?

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.580
This is for book lovers.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.806
You know we talk about
[inaudible], vivre, V-I-V-R-E,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.020
it's [inaudible] at
this event, okay.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.553
It's joy of books, and
I must admit as I was,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.570
I was in a little go
cart and, you know,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.270
I was coming from the
Capitol going to the Monument,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.143
and I sort of had a
heat hallucination,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.380
and I was thinking
about how I got here.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.876
And I am somebody who had a lot of
detours on my way to being an author

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.656
and for those in the audience, you
know, if you think you're in detour,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.163
I can only tell you my story.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.466
In 1970, I arrived in Boston and I
wanted to teach and I couldn't find,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.876
no one would hire me, and at that
point in time there was an opening

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.836
in the children's book department
at Little Brown and Company,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.376
and I said, oh, gee, if I can't
teach kids, wouldn't it be fun

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.483
to work on books for them?

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.793
It was sort of like in Citizen Kane
he says, "Oh, I think it will be fun

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.416
to run a newspaper," you know, it
just and with that spirit I walked

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.226
into the children's book department
and I fell in love right away

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.000
because I was making
books, I was creating books.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.723
I spent the next 32 years
helping other people make books

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.926
and my dream was that
someday I could make my own.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.010
And in 1995, I finished my first
reference book for children.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.946
It was called Children's
Books and Their Creators.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.246
I was published at Houghton
Mifflin when it came out,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.750
and I remember the day that it
arrived and by the way I started big

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.810
and have gotten smaller, and I
recommend that, too, okay, you know,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.506
do your ambitious project
first and then get smaller.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.993
It was 800 pages, you know,
it's a great door stop.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080
It really is.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.726
I used to say it was the cheapest
in the industry for its weight.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.300
It weighed around three pounds, and
when I saw that book and I held it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.330
in my hands that night,
I just broke down sobbing

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.163
and I said this is what
I've always wanted to do

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.590
and I've got to find a way to do it.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.663
So, I saved a lot of money and in
2001 I took that vow of authorship;

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.760
perseverance, determination,
poverty.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.110
[Laughter] That is the author's vow.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.950
You have to be willing to go the
distance, not to worry about money

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.336
if you want to do what
you want to do.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.536
And so I have now had about 10 years
of writing books both for children

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.933
and writing what I
love to do is I love

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.993
to write about children's books.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.776
Five years ago one of my best
friends in publishing called me up.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.050
It was a cold winter's day.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.053
It was so far from this that
it amazes me to think about it,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.670
and she said I'm going to run
a title by you and I'm going

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.023
to run a concept, and she said
the title is Everything I Needed

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.156
to Know I Learned From A
Children's Book and the concept is

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.806
that you're going to interview 100
some people none of whom you know

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.550
or who necessarily want to talk
to you about the children's book

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.206
that influenced their lives
and we're going to choose these

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.686
from among the leaders in society.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.736
I believe that it took me a
fraction of a second to say,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.586
you've got me, I'm on board.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.320
I would love to do this.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.673
Because everywhere I go and
every place I talk to people one

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.296
of the things I always ask people
is what did you read as a child

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.103
and what do you remember about
it and who gave it to you?

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.943
And so I began, I want to say it
was easily the happiest two years

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.160
of my creative life setting up
interviews with people, my editor

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.763
and I came up with a list.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.240
We came up with a list of the
500 people in the United States

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.953
that if we could get interviews
with them that's who we'd want,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.380
and I began person after person
after person to try to talk to them

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.396
and to try to hear what children's
book had affected their lives.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.883
It was an amazing experience, you
know, I'd wake up in the morning

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.110
and the first thing I'd think of is,

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.196
is this the day I talk
to Julianne Moore?

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.556
Is it Kirk Douglas today?

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.756
Who's on docket today?

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.163
And I began to have this series
of interviews with people

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.293
that changed me and changed
the way I look at books

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.330
because I always would have told you

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.790
that I think books have
profound influence,

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.503
but I never realized
what that influence was.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.796
I never had the evidence.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.093
One of the things that people often
ask me is they often say what was

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.030
your biggest surprise
in the interviews?

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.086
And I have to say I was
talking to Kirk Douglas

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.673
by the way had just turned 90,
and I had been led to believe

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.260
that he loved Mike Mulligan
and His Steam Shovel.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.080
And so I was preparing
for Mike Mulligan

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.960
and his Steam Shovel interview,
and he picked up the phone

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.603
and I gave him the title of the
book and he said, oh, that's easy.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.083
He said the book I want to talk
to you about is The Bobbsey Twins.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.790
I said, oh, you've
got to be kidding.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.886
I think I laughed, you know,
because I was so unprepared for that

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.430
and I said, well, why
the Bobbsey Twins?

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.350
And then he told me and
it made perfect sense.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.773
He said my family was
an immigrant family,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.353
my parents did not read English,
my sister was the first person

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.220
to read -- his sister, Betty -- and
he said that was her favorite book

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.513
and when I was a little
boy she sat me on the couch

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.886
and she read me the Bobbsey Twins.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.590
And he said because of the
Bobbsey Twins I learned to read

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.556
and if had not learned to read,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.453
I would have had no
career as an actor.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.050
And those were the kinds of
testimonies again and again

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.416
and again, you know, it's not
only people who love books

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.346
who are affected by them;

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.293
it's everyone who reads
a children's book.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.866
The dancer, Edward Villella,
said I only think I read one book

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.923
as a child, but I remember it as
it if were yesterday and the book

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.400
that affected him not surprisingly
is the Little Engine That Could.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.186
He was a man, a testimony
to overcoming things as was

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.183
by the way the sportscaster
Tiki Barber

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.496
that was his favorite
book as a child.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.620


00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.670
I was shocked to find out how
many people chose careers based

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.703
on children's books.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.570
I would not have thought that.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.416
I would not have thought that
you pick up a book, you read it,

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:01.390
and you know what you want to do
for your life's work and yet again

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:04.640
and again people gave
me that testimony.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.273
David McCullough, the historian,

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.790
said that when he was age 9 he
met his first alternate historian

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.080
in a book by Robert Lawson called
Ben and Me, and he said I knew

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.786
from that book on that I
wanted to write history in just

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.663
as exciting way as Robert
Lawson could write it.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:33.336
Robert Kennedy, Jr., picked up a
book when he was around 9 or 10,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.246
and it was Jean Craighead
George's My Side of The Mountain.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.666
He was so taken with this book
and for those who know the book

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.326
by the way there's a young boy
in there who becomes a falconer

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.513
and so Robert wrote to the
author, Jean Craighead George,

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:54.683
and basically the letter
read something

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.876
like I want to get a falcon.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.520
Can you give me any lines that
I can use on my mother, Ethel,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.613
to get her to give me one?

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.040
[Laughter] Okay, so he wrote
to his favorite author.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.320
Evidently Jean gave him the
justification that his mother needed

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.040
and he got a falcon, and he said
that working with a falcon led him

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.043
to a career in environmental law

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.103
and in pursuing preserving the
wilderness, and he said when I went

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.070
to school all of the kids in my
class all admitted that the book

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:30.160
that had had the most profound
effect on us was My Side

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.376
of the Mountain and by the
way the beauty of that,

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:35.550
by the way Jean Craighead
George just turned 90 this year,

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.650
and the beauty of that is that later
on in their lives they came together

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:47.303
and he was able to tell her that
story and so I was able to record it

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.000
for the book, which is a
wonderful thing to have.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.133
Robert Ballard, who
raised the Titanic,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:54.643
anyone want to guess what
his favorite book was?

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.210
&gt;&gt; 10,000 Leagues.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.876
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Absolutely.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.943
10,000 Leagues Under The Sea.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:03.356
He said I'm a modern-day
Captain Nemo.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.996
He went to his parents and he
said how do I get to do this?

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.833
And they said you need to pursue a
degree in oceanography and he said

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.506
so I went and I got a degree

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.706
and then I asked them
how do I do other things?

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.010
And they told me other things to do.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.870
As he says in his essay,
all children have dreams

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:24.883
and what we need are adults to tell
us that we can live these dreams,

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.470
that we can have these dreams.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.456
I wasn't surprised, I've
always aside that children read

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.933
for two things; they read for
character and they read for plot.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.526
And so there were a lot
of people who talked to me

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:42.670
about their favorite character
out of children's books.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.410
For Judy Bloom, for writer Judy
Bloom, that character was Madeline,

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.206
and she so loved the Madeline
books that she hid the one

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.330
from the library under her pillow
so her mother would not return it

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.370
and so if you were Judy
Bloom's librarian, she's sorry,

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:04.023
but she never did bring it back.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.933
It was, she said I now know my
mother might have bought it for me,

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.113
but I loved that book
too much to give it up.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.240
There is one character
out of fiction

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.566
that has probably influenced
more people than any other;

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.373
Simone de Beauvoir, Julianne Moore,
Hilary Clinton, Judy Woodruff,

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.313
Bobbie Ann Mason and that is
from Little Women, Jo March,

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.776
has had a profound effect
on generations of women.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:34.423
And one of my favorite stories came

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.490
from country western singer
heartthrob Brad Paisley,

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.493
who had a baby about two years
ago, and he and his wife were

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.950
in disagreement about how to name
the baby because Brad Paisley wanted

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.073
to name the baby after his favorite
character in children's books,

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.843
and his wife clearly
didn't want to, okay,

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.483
so they argue throughout the
hospital stay and eventually

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:04.696
on the way home they
have to make a decision

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.830
and so Brad Paisley said I got
the certificate and I wrote

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.646
on it the name of my son and he
said I kept the pen because I wanted

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.063
to give that pen someday
to my son and say

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.153
with this pen my favorite
author wrote a book

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:22.570
and with this pen we gave
you a name based on that book

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.026
so that you can have
it and hence we have

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.353
in this world William
Huckleberry Paisley.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.743
So, Huck Finn is alive and
well in the Paisley family.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.633
Some of the interviews were
absolutely spectacular.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.323
I think my, I had two
favorites I must admit.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.503
I'm in love with Pete Seeger.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.016
I just admit it outright, you
know, I don't hide it at all,

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.830
and I spent two hours on the
phone with him and he sang

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:55.016
to me while I was on the phone.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:57.393
He sang me his favorite
songs from childhood.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:12:59.533
I couldn't record that, but
it was a wonderful interview,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.346
but I had one of the last interviews
with the painter N.C. Wyeth,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.746
and he had, painter Andrew
Wyeth, the son of N.C. Wyeth,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.316
and his staff had been protecting
him, and I didn't realize

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:16.040
that he was sick but when we
got on the phone that day,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.100
he started to talk about
his father's legacy to him.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.936
He said when he was a little boy
his father put him on his lap

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.276
and he read Treasure Island to him

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.296
and he showed him the
images that he was creating.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:32.966
Wyeth said the day that I saw the
image of blind [inaudible] groping

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.466
down the row in Treasure
Island he said that was the day

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.786
that I knew I wanted
to become an artist.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.116
He said my father passed on
the idea of creating art to me.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.186
Other times it's a single line
in a book that people remember.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.490
Jay Leno's favorite book was Mike
Mulligan and His Steam Shovel,

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.426
and the line that he loved from
it was the line where it says,

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.210
"the harder Maryanne dug, the
more people who came the harder

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.726
and faster Maryanne dug."

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.316
And Jay Leno said I was always
a show off and I realized

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:22.096
that that the more of a crowd I
had the more of a show off I was.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.470
William DeVries here of Walter
Reed, by the way in this city,

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.343
is the first doctor to
insert the artificial heart,

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.420
and his line that he had remembered,

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.316
he said I have remembered it
every professional day of my life

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.000
as a doctor and it was a line
from the book his mother gave him,

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.593
it was Wizard of Oz, and his line
where the tins woodsman said,

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:56.096
" I would bear all the unhappiness
in the world if only I had a heart,"

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.096
and he said I have
carried that line with me

00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.576
through everything that I've done.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.643
The testimonies were testimonies
about family, about sharing books

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.473
with children that had
been shared with them.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:18.950
Scott Simon of NPR talked about his
new Chinese daughters that he had,

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.073
you know, they had
adopted and when he's away

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.136
from them he reads Goodnight Moon
on the telephone to them at night,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.863
and he said we always fall
asleep under the same moon.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.883
And Linda Johnson Robb,
L.B.J.'s daughter,

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.526
gave one of the loveliest
testimonies.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.436
Her mother and a woman named Sel
[phonetic] Marshall were college

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.550
roommates and as Linda said
Sel's little boy, Jimmy,

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:49.463
went on to create children's books.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:51.463
That is, of course, James Marshall,

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.130
and he did the classic
Miss Nelson is Missing,

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:00.663
and so Linda said we got those
books as a child, we shared them

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.730
with our children, and she said
they're on my shelf right now

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:05.546
for when we have grandchildren
and we will pass them on.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.253
And she said that books tie the
generations of my family together.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:15.053
When I touch this book, I'm with my
mother, I'm with my own children,

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.953
I'm in my own childhood, and
now someday I will pass that on

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.346
and that is really what
great children's books do,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.186
but I have to say that the thing
that was remarkable of every one

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:36.100
of these interviews people would
say to me you'll remember the name

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.543
of the author, I've forgotten
it, but I remember the name

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.633
of the person who gave it to me.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.910
They're very important people.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.046
They remember the name of
their second grade teacher,

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.436
the public librarian or the school
librarian that handed them the book,

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.976
the parent, anyone who
gave them those books they,

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.526
all of these memories were not just
a memory of a book they were memory

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.293
of the book and the person
who had brought them together.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.130
And as they talked about this,

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:15.170
I have to say that
their voices got softer.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.576
My first interview
was with Steve Forbes.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.233
I was terrified of him.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.566
He's been known to eat the
press for lunch, and when I said

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.976
to him did you like reading as
a child he said I hated to read

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:30.686
as a child, and I thought, oh, dear,
this isn't off on a very good foot

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.886
and what are we going to do?

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.353
And then he said but you
know I loved being read to

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:39.670
and my mother would take me in
her lap and she would share books

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.656
with me and suddenly
his voice got very soft

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:52.783
and he became a young boy again and
it was a totally different interview

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:52.980
as he talked about what
his mother had done

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.526
for him sharing books with him.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.126
So for those of you who
are passing on books

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.383
to children you are becoming
part of their best memories,

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.410
you are becoming part of what
makes them a human being,

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:10.806
and you are giving them
something very precious

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.220
and something very
vital to remember,

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.993
but it will take the children

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.386
in your life a long time
before they'll tell you this

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:21.690
and they maybe can't tell you
this, but I'm really here today

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.843
because what I hope is
that all of you will find

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:28.643
that this glorious festival some
great children's books to pass

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:36.223
on to your children and someday
hopefully if I live long enough

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:37.463
and I don't stay in too many
heat waves like this one,

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.703
I have a better chance of it.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.863
When I'm interviewing them, they
will be able to tell me about a book

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.640
that you put in their hands
of something you gave them,

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.740
of something you passed on to them
because you remembered to make sure

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.736
to get the right book for the
right child at the right time

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.176
and that is what my
book is all about.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:02.396
Thank you so much, and I'd
love to hear from all of you.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.510
[ Applause ]

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.873
This is your chance to ask
questions, to tell me your,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.246
and somebody is going to I hope
tell me your favorite books

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.180
and whatever you want to know.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.180
All right.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.246
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what children's
book or line was it for you

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.846
that really inspired you?

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:26.846
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: What
book was it for me?

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.313
I have to say, you know,
tell me, give me an age

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.046
and I have a different book,

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.273
but I will tell you the one that's
the most important to me over time

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.153
and it sits right next to
my desk and it was purchased

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.543
by my mother's great aunt.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.010
She was born in 1865 at
the end of the Civil War.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.263
She read it, she inscribed it to my
mother, my mother passed it on to me

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.903
and every time I touch
that book everybody I,

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.020
all the women in my family are there

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.713
and that's Frances Hodgson's Burnett
The Secret Garden and that is still

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.056
to this day I must admit
it's my favorite book.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.263
What's your favorite book?

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.330
That's what I want to know.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.930
&gt;&gt; Uhm, I have a lot.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.130
I probably can't decide.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.996
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Okay.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:13.530
All right.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:15.930
[Laughter] All right.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.530
Thank you, yes?

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:18.930
&gt;&gt; I'm with you on
The Secret Garden.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:21.463
That and Anne of Green
Gables is my favorite.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.996
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Yeah.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.996
&gt;&gt; But I'm sort of an
aspiring children's book author

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.530
and the book I've been working

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.596
on for some time doesn't
really fit a category,

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.863
and I keep hearing things like
unless you show a character growth,

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.396
unless you do this or do that
your book won't be published,

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.530
and I guess I'm looking for some
kind of comfort that as long

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.196
as the book is good enough that it
will have a shot at being published.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.996
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Yeah, you're going
to hear that from me because one

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.926
of the things that you find, you
know, this is the sense of writers.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.000
There are a lot of
rules for writers,

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:45.736
and if you go to conferences,
go to conferences

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:49.026
because you can learn things,
they'll give you all those rules

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:52.563
for writers and the only
thing that's true of rules

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:55.423
for writers is they're
meant to be broken.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.850
Almost every single
classic that we have

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.460
for children breaks the
standard convention of the day,

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.373
but what the author had to have
was a willingness to persevere.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:16.990
So, we know, for instance, Dr. Seuss
is our most rejected classic writer.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.593
He was rejected somewhere around
the range of 25 to 27 times

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.180
and people didn't like him because
they didn't like rhymed verse

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.176
and nobody published
rhymed verse at that time,

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:29.716
and he didn't have
any morals or messages

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.623
and everybody was publishing
very message-laden books.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.863
One day after his 27th rejection
he was walking down the street

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:40.630
and he ran into an old
Dartmouth classmate,

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:46.690
and he was singing his tale
of woe and that classmate said

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.833
to him this is really
quite wonderful, you know,

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.023
they've just made me the
children's book editor at Van Guard

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.760
and I'm going to publish your
book and Seuss said, yes,

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.420
but I've just told you
every one has rejected it;

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.173
don't you want to read it?

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.646
And his friend said I
wouldn't know a children's book

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.500
if it bit me by the ankles.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:11.056
[Laughter] But I need one and
you have one so we are on board,

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:11.530
and he gave him a contract that day.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.396
Okay, so, persevere, what do you
need to write, listen to people,

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:20.366
listen to feedback, but write
the book you need to write

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:21.813
because that's the
most important book.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:23.680
I absolutely encourage
you with that.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:25.413
That's how we get great writers.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.280
Thank you.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.280
Thank you.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.280
Yes, over here?

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.146
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my favorite book, E.B.
White had the same problem.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.346
Charlotte's Web.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:37.480
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Charlotte's Web.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.880
And how did you find it?

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.746
&gt;&gt; My father bought it for me and
it's the first book he ever bought

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:43.613
for me so that's why I remember it.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.746
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Okay.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.880
&gt;&gt; Anyways my question for you is,
what's something to really remember

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.080
and consider when recommending
books to reluctant readers?

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.680
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Recommending books
to reluctant readers, you know,

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.880
first of all get help, you
know, in your local library.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:55.833
They know what's working
in that area, you know,

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.793
we just have Jeff Smith here.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.926
One of the things I saw is
graphic novels are books, you know,

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.503
Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Jeff's books,

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:07.443
these are making great
strides with reluctant readers.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:10.036
So don't judge the kind of
literature; just get them something

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.943
that engages them and, you know,

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.356
there are for each age group
I think a good librarian

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.586
or good bookseller could give you
something that we know is working,

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.100
but it's important
to honor their taste;

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:25.636
not to put our taste
on top of it sometimes.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.803
Sometimes all they're reluctant to
read is what we want them to read.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.090
They're not reluctant to read the
books that they find exciting.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.446
I have parents say to
me, oh, my kids only want

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.333
to read information books.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:42.896
How do I stop them?

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.630
And I say you don't stop them.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.583
You give them more
information books to read.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.256
So, you know, it's, you
know, people get going again.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:52.013
J.K. Rowling turned
people back into readers;

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:54.923
Jeff Kinney is turning
people back into readers;

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:57.656
Stephenie Meyer has turned teenagers
back into readers; we've got a lot

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.966
of great people going now so
just don't give up with it.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.640
All right.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:05.840
And I have another question here.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.486
&gt;&gt; I personally like
reading by myself best,

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.993
but do you like someone reading
to you or you reading by yourself?

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.500
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Oh, boy,
if anybody reads to me,

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:20.766
that's a real privilege,
and you know,

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.096
people as you get older they don't,
but I love to listen to tapes

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:25.816
where people read, but I
like to, I just like to curl

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.790
up with a book, you
know, I always have.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.603
I did when I was your
age and I do now.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.156
Either way it's great.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:38.623
If they read to you,
it's great or, you know,

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.490
if you read it, it's great.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.156
So just keep doing it.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:44.956
Just keep doing it.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:46.690
Thank you.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.090
All right, over here.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.423
&gt;&gt; Hi. I also have been writing for
children and heard what you had said

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.090
to the previous person here, but
what about publishing on your own?

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:54.776
I know more and more people
are trying to do that.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.176
What advice can you give and
then I'll tell you my book.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.696
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Okay.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.163
One of the things that I, I
teach publishing in the Simmons,

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.260
I even have former students here.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.466
It's hard to believe they'd come
to hear me again, but anyway one

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.533
of the things I say to my
students I believe that publishing

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:12.450
on your own is becoming
more and more legitimate.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.890
All that is needed
is a review source

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.280
that would actually review
those books, and we would be

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.880
in a whole other place with them.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.496
So, I know so many success stories
of people who just didn't want

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:30.790
to beat their heads against
the brick wall anymore went

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:34.396
and published their
book on their own.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:36.703
There are some good places to do it
through like iUniverse that help you

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.156
with the process, and you
know, if the book works,

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.266
you can always sell those
rights to publishers.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.240
So, it's not I'll publish on
my own and I'll never be able

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.176
to have another go at it.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:56.543
So, I think we're just at that time
period where we're going to see more

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.116
and more and more publish on their
own and then publishers will pick

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.330
up some of the more
successful books.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.890
So, don't write it
off as a possibility.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:09.496
&gt;&gt; Thank you, and my favorite book
is very old, it's [inaudible].

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.036
Is Sally Goes to The Circus Alone.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.983
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Oh, okay.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.383
&gt;&gt; It's very, very old,
but a sneaky little girl

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.450
who managed to go off on her own.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.886
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: And
go to the circus, yeah.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:22.553
I'd love to go to the
circus right now.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.753
An air conditioned circus.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.020
All right.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.620
Yes? Somebody over here.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:30.486
&gt;&gt; My question is,
who was your mentor

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:32.153
when you were in your childhood?

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.820
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: I'm sorry?

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.553
&gt;&gt; Who was your mentor?

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:38.553
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Oh,
who was my mentor?

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.360
In publishing, you know, I
never, this is an honest story,

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.946
I left publishing when I was 53
years old, and I never had a mentor.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.220
I had bosses, but they
were sadistic.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.726
[Laughter] No, no, I mean they were
my bosses, you know, they got a lot

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.020
of work out of me, but they
were never mentoring me.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:02.723
At age 54 I edited the book of
Howe Miller, who was the former CEO

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:05.230
of the company that I worked for,
and I got my first mentor at the age

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:14.010
of 54, and he is now by the way
he's 87, and I tell him he's got

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.706
to keep hanging in
because I can bring

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.243
to him all those questions
as a writer that I need.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:20.176
So, as a writer, I've had
a mentor but as somebody

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:23.883
in publishing I never had one
so, you know, it's never too late

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.040
for a mentor, you know, it's also
never too late for a happy childhood

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.046
as we all know so thank you.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.783
That's a good question.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.250
Yes?

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:36.916
&gt;&gt; I'm a school counselor and
I'm always using books to,

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.450
you know, encourage the children.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.650
I've read your book the 100
Best Books For Children,

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.716
and I agree with a lot of them and
there's one that wasn't in there.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.116
I was going to email
but now I can tell you.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:45.783
I think it's the Five
Chinese Brothers.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.250
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Oh, yes, yes.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.250
&gt;&gt; I love that, and I
was surprised it wasn't.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.940
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Yeah, when you only
have a, by the way 100 Best Books

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:54.770
for Children was the most sadistic
book that I ever did because I love

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:02.350
to do 800 pages and 100 was just
too short and so I had to leave

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.526
out so many great things.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.096
I believe it's in the
reading list, but I just had

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.756
to leave out so many things.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:11.223
Thank you very much.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:12.023
Okay. One more question I think.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:14.423
&gt;&gt; Yes. I grew up reading
Mary Poppins.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:16.023
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Oh, a good one.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:18.623
&gt;&gt; All these stories
from other countries.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:20.803
I am also a great aunt to boys
growing up in sports-oriented homes

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:27.043
as well as academic homes but
sports so it is a challenge

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:27.710
to not give them what I want
but what they would enjoy.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.070
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Yes, yeah.

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:37.203
To remember the mantra is the
right book for the right child

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:41.010
at the right time and that
is honoring the child.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:41.746
That is very important
to do in all reading.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.026
We honor who they are
as human beings.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.646
Okay. Thank you.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:50.590
One more question.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.056
I think we have one more.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:54.390
Quick one.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:55.990
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was wondering
I have a question

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.460
about what your advice would be
for inspirational writers who would

00:28:59.720 --> 00:28:59.893
like to pursue writing as their job

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.010
but considering how
what the competition is

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.483
for trying to publish a book.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:08.076
&gt;&gt; Anita Silvey: Yeah.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.743
One of the things that I say to
all writers write what you have

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:11.183
to write, look every now and
then at what's published,

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:15.503
but don't get consumed by it.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:16.736
Find your own voice, find what
you have to say, keep going,

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:24.210
perseverance is everything okay
so just keep doing it and don't,

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:25.436
there's that voice
that's always going

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:27.503
to say they don't need my book,
they don't need me, I have nothing

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:30.853
to say, I am insane, in fact,
to be doing this in my pajamas

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.223
at whatever hour, 3 in the morning,
okay, that voice is always there.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.146
Don't give in to it, keep
writing what you need

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.153
to because you know what I finally
realized is I could do books

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.670
about what I loved, which
was children's books

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:48.800
that had never occurred
to me so just keep going.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.340
That's always my advice.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.740
Keep going.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.740
Thank you all.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.813
Thank you very much.
