00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.489
Mm, I love a glass of pinot noir during work.

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:06.460
Mmm...notes of blackberry, chocolate, and
Ooo.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.460
What’s this?

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:19.050
Ah, yes, a no-so-subtle bouquet of stink bugs.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.880
Hello winos, it’s Natalia for DNews!

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.440
When it comes to producing wine, vineyards
have many elements to contend with like rainfall,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.689
soil conditions, and... stink bugs that hitch
rides into the wineries.

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.120
Yes, brown marmorated stink bugs enjoy feeding
on grapes and end up becoming “one with

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.399
the wine” as they are hard to find and remove
because they’re a similar color to the grapes.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.329
And when stressed during the pressing process,
the stink bugs, true to their name, emit an

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.559
unpleasant smelling compound, (E)-2-decenal.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.680
It is said to smell like cilantro or coriander.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.310
Researchers from Oregon State University have
now determined that there can be up to three

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.920
stink bugs per bunch of grapes before the
levels of (E)-2-decenal negatively affect

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.690
a tasty bottle of wine.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.400
You think that’d keep me from drinking wine,
but it won’t.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.369
Almost no commercially produced food is going
to be completely devoid of ‘filth’.

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:16.450
The FDA says, quote, “it is economically
impractical to grow, harvest, or process raw

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.159
products that are totally free of non-hazardous,
naturally occurring, unavoidable defects.”

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.829
So what other undesirable critters are in
your food?

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:25.950
I hope you’re not eating.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.950
The “Filth” in our food includes insect
fragments, grubs, rodent hairs, and rodent

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.950
excrement.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.570
For example… aphids love to get into your
garden, so it should come as no surprise they

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.049
are in your produce.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.660
The FDA estimates that there are about 60
aphids per 100 grams of frozen broccoli, and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.439
30 aphids per 100 grams of brussel sprouts.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.179
And that jar of peanut butter in your cupboard
has, on average, 30 insects fragments and

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.209
1 rodent hair per 100 grams.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:49.130
The FDA states there is an average of 9 mg
of rodent excrement pellets and pellet fragments

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.899
in one kilogram of wheat.

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.280
Anyone want a sandwich?

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.979
To make sure food remains safe for public
consumption, the FDA has regulations in place

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.850
to ensure commercially produced food isn’t
brimming with these undesirables.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.669
But even treated water can have a certain
degree of fecal matter in it.

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:07.619
I mean it’s a very minute amount, but I
still call it poo water.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.069
You ok there, buddy?

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.800
All this talk of insects in our food begs
the question, is eating insects so bad?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.180
Maybe it’s ok to eat a little bug or three.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.900
Heck, maybe it’s even good for us!

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.390
According to anthropologist Julie Lesnik,
entomophagy, or eating insects, is not only

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.269
an excellent source of protein, it’s also
something our human ancestors did.

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.410
Researchers hypothesize that eating insects
contributed to brain growth, or encephalization,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.019
in primates, including our hominin ancestors.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.840
In terms of nutritional value, dried crickets
are roughly 60% protein and have more calcium

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.850
than milk!

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.060
Because of these stats, cricket flour has
become all the rage recently, with cricket

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.819
protein bars and baked goods being sold throughout
the US.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.140
In fact, it seems the US is behind the times
because people throughout the world have been

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.060
eating insects for centuries, from crickets,
to mealworms, to locusts, to flies.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.879
In 2013, the UN urged people to eat insects
in hopes to curb worldwide hunger stating

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.510
that at least 2 billion people were already
using insects as a dietary supplement.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.540
Perhaps we ought to reconsider the idea that
eating insects is unclean or gross.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.200
So next time you’re at a restaurant let
your waiter know you’d like that extra fly

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.680
in your soup.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680
Love insects?

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.799
Wanna know how they go number 2?

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.170
Check out this video!

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.170
And what about you?

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.849
Would you or do you eat insects?
