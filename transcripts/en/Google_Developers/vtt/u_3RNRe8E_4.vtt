EDUARDO SILVA: My
name is Eduardo Silva.

00:00:02.136 --> 00:00:04.420
And the name of our
organization is Monkey Project.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.240
Our organization just
focuses on web technology

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.830
to create a good communication
improving resource and trying

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.840
to optimize as much as possible.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.020
This year, our project got
four slots for students.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.480
And they were working
in different areas,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.850
which was not related.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.820
One of them was working
on proxy reverse staff.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.880
Another one was working
on creating interfaces

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.040
to connect to databases.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.890
And another one to create SSL
interface and different futures

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.070
for the whole technology,
which runs on HTTP.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.900
In the future, I would like
that Monkey Project sees more

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.000
than technical futures.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.560
I would like to see a summit
between the volunteers, people

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.430
working on GSOC and,
obviously, the core

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.020
contributers to try to create
some synergy between us.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.890
Our organization,
Monkey Project,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.470
has been participating
on GSOC on 2012

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.910
and this the present year.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.120
And personally, I have
been the organization admin

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.350
for this project in
conjunction, obviously,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.886
with the core team
of the project.

00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:11.760
It's a big community.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.080
We are always open to
receive new volunteers.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.850
And at the beginning, we don't
care about technical skills,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.120
because the project was born
because we were rejected

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.110
to participate in
something similar.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.210
And we did not have the skills.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.080
So it was like,
you don't know C.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.220
You cannot participate on this.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.125
So we don't reject
because of skills.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.650
The success key to join our
project is to be motivated.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.830
And I think that the best thing
that we look on the students

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.934
is that they must be motivated
to contribute on this.

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:50.850
If they're motivated,
they are going to learn.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.000
They are going to try.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.130
They're going to ask.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.841
We don't care if some person
does have many programming

00:01:56.841 --> 00:01:57.340
skills.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.580
If he's not motivated, he's
not going to do a good job.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.800
Part of GSOC, for me, it has
been a very important phase

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.050
on my life, because I was a GSOC
student before in 2006 and '07.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.950
And I said, this was awesome.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.910
I was running this open-source
project on that moment.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.610
And we say as developers, A,
we need to move this forward.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.280
We can engage more people.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.270
We can talk about this.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.570
We can motivate people.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.690
And after three
tries, we did it.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.390
And we continued working on it.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.300
So personally,
the best reward is

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.100
about to see students
giving the best of them

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.050
and trying to learn things that
are not common in our project.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.870
For example, they need
to lead with networking,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.780
with sockets, Linux performance.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.970
And they're not common staff.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.260
So I think this is a
very special market

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.580
for this project.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.000
I feel very happy to
see them moving forward

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.860
on this direction.
