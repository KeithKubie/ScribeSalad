00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.340
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: My
name is Jason Steinhauer.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.760
I'm a program specialist
at the John W. Kluge Center

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.670
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.330
Today's program is presented
by the John W. Kluge Center

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.170
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.720
The Kluge Center is a vibrant
scholar center on Capital Hill

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.130
that brings together scholars and
researchers from around the world

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.670
to stimulate an energize one
another, to distill wisdom

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.380
from the library's rich
resources and to interact

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.650
with policy makers and the public.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.110
The center offers opportunities
for senior scholars

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.450 position:56%
and post-doctoral fellows as well as
Ph. D candidates to conduct research

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.720
in the Library of Congress
collections.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.680
We also offer free public
lectures, conferences, symposia

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.810 position:56%
and other programs such as this one.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.900
And we administer the Kluge Prize

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.790
which recognizes lifetime
achievement in the study

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.470
of humanity, which
was recently awarded

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.930
to philosophers Jurgen
Habermas and Charles Taylor.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.000
For more information
about the Kluge Center,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.380
please visit our website,
LOC.gov/kluge.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.980
I invite you to sign up
for our email list which is

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.710
on the table on the way out.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.470 position:56%
Today's program is titled Migration,
Asylum and the Role of the State:

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.700
Defining Boundaries,
Redefining Borders.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.660 position:56%
The event is part of a new program
series that we inaugurated last year

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.570
which we've titled
Kluge Conversations.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.000
It's one of the wonderful
aspects of the Kluge Center

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.380 position:56%
that we have a diversity of scholars

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.490
from around the world
under one roof.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.940
And there are some wonderful
synergies that emerge.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.220
And when scholars from different
disciplines are researching diverse

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.560
topics and begin to
speak to one another,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.010
it is remarkable how many
commonalities can emerge.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.120
In this instance we have a
Latin American historian,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.880
an African historian and a
scholar from American studies.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.950
Whose work it turns out
all investigate issues

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.870
of migrations, borders
and the state.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.170
Hence the title.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.580
This is also a topic that is much
in the news today, as we know,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.160
both in the US and abroad.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.650 position:56%
And so the focus of our conversation
and the genesis for this event.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.060
A word about how the
program will run.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.510
We've asked each of our three
scholars to offer a brief overview

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.800
of their work at the Kluge Center
and their research project.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.630
The scholars will then
engage in a conversation

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.280
that will take approximately
20-30 minutes.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.890
After which we will
open up to you for Q&amp;A.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.520
And the scholars are eager to
engage you in this conversation.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.340
So we'll leave plenty of time
for questions and we'll conclude

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.170
at approximately 5:00 PM.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.590
We are also testing out for the
first time our new sound systems.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.020
So hopefully everyone can hear us.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.320
And if there are any problems

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.300
with the sound system during
the event, please let us know.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.980
We will try to correct them.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.620
And we'll also be eager to hear
your feedback on the systems

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.930
so that we can use
it for future events.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.240
Finally, before we begin, brief
bios about each of the scholars.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.390
Longer biographies
are on the handouts

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.460
which are available actually at
the front table when you come in.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.940
But for the sake of future viewers

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.420
of this webcast I'll
also state the bios now.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.520
Julia Young is an assistant
professor of history

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.510
at the Catholic University of
America here in Washington.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.980
Her research and teaching
interests include Mexican

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.450
and Latin American history, the
history of Mexican migrations

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.850
to the United States, global
migrations, origin and diaspora.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.250
She recently published her first
book, Mexican Exodus: Migration,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.150
Religion and the Long Legacy
of Mexico's Cristero War,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.190
which was written and
researched at the Kluge center.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.320
The book examines Mexican migrants

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.070
who supported the Catholic church
during Mexico's Cristero War

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.800
in the late 1920's.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.240
She has published articles
on the topic in the Americas

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.310
and the Catholic Historical Review.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.500
She received her Ph. D in 2009
from the University of Chicago.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.340
She is currently a Kluge
fellow through the center.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.300
Ivan Chaar-Lopez is a Ph. D
candidate in the department

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.940
of American culture at the
University of Michigan.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.120
His work traverses the boundaries
of digital studies, Latino studies,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.450
history of technology
and US history.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.480
He is currently a Kluge
fellow in digital studies

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.450
at the John W. Kluge center.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.860
A relatively new fellowship
which we just launched in 2013.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.190
He is the third holder
of that fellowship.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.370
Katherine Luongo, we call her Kate.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.530
Kate Luongo earned her Ph. D
at the University of Michigan

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.030
and is an associate professor of
history at Northeastern University.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.150
She studies legal systems in
colonial and contemporary Africa,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.770
particularly the intersections
of the supernatural and law.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.350
Her work also examines
belonging in Africa

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.220
and in the global arena of asylum.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.600
Her historical ethnography of
Kamba witchcraft was a finalist

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.480
for the African Studies
Association's Bethwell Ogot Prize.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.580
And for the American Historical
Association Martin A. Klein award.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.600
She is the coauthor of Obama
in Kenya: Contested Histories

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.410
of Politics and Belonging.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.300
Which will be published by Ohio
University press in spring of 2016.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.460 position:56%
This book is the first scholarly
work to examine the history of Kenya

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.210
through the experiences
of the Obama family.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.300
She is currently a Kluge Fellow
at the John W. Kluge Center,

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.990
completing her second monograph,
Witches and Bureaucrats:

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.250
African Witchcraft
and its Intersection

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.590
with Global Asylum Seeking.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.270
So we will begin without
further ado.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.870
We'll go in chronological order
from most distant to most recent.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.500
And we'll begin with Julia.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.800
&gt;&gt; Julia Young: Thank you.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.260
Thank you, Jason, and thank you
to the Kluge Center and thank you

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.700
to all of you for being here.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.610
IT's lovely to participate
in this conversation.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:19.400
From 1920-1930 the population
of Mexico was on the move.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.490
Hundreds of thousands of
Mexicans took to the railroads

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.160
and the highways to migrate

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.280
across the northern border
to the United States.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.400 position:56%
This migratory flow was so
enormous that the Mexican population

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.730
in the United States -- the
Mexican origin population --

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.650
doubled from about 500,000 to
about a little over 1 million.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.160
There were several causes for this.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.450
One of them was the 1910-1920
Mexican Revolution which sort

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.010
of decimated the countryside
and forced a lot

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:55.100
of people off their lands in
search of jobs and safety.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.150
There was also population growth,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.570
especially in the most
populated central part of Mexico.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.910
There was a decline in
agricultural production.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.810
Some environmental causes.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.080
There were low wages in Mexico.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.380
There were new transportation
networks, highways and railroads

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.260
that offered quicker
and easier ways to get

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.860
from Mexico to the United States.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.530
And then in the United States
there were higher wages

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.690
and there were numerous
new jobs available

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.680
to Mexican migrants in particular.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.050
Especially in agriculture.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.620
So the cotton fields
and the sugar beet farms

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.740
of the Southwest and Midwest.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.480
And in industry.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.050 position:56%
Steel factories, meatpacking plants.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.340
And this was particularly
true in cities in the Midwest

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.650
and also in the US Southwest.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.720
There was another cause though of
Mexican migration during the 1920's

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.950
and this one is a little
bit lesser known.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.830
And this is the topic
that I work on.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.390
It's a war now called
the Cristero War.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.760
This was a very violent,
blood conflict

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.950
between Mexican Catholic partisans
and the Mexican government,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.810
which was at the time, as a
result of the Mexican Revolution,

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.440
enacting very strict
anti-clerical legislations.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.030
Legislation that forbade people

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.590
from essentially practicing
their Catholic faith in public.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.930
It sound strange because
as you probably know,

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.620
Mexico is a vast majority
Catholic country.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.240
But it's also a country where the
church and state had struggled

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.740
for really centuries
up until this time.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.580
So this was an outbreak
of church state violence.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.570
During the war, these catholic
partisans became militant

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.840
and they went to battle
against the federal government.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.490
You know, armed with rifles but
also with crosses and scapulars

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.900
and religious medallions.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.590
And they launched themselves
into battle with the battle cry

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.120
of viva Cristo ray, or
"Long live Christ the king."

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.660
And that's why they're
known as Cristeros,

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.500
or I guess it would be
Christers in English,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.260
which doesn't sound very good.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.560
They believed that they
were in a holy war and that

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.920
when they died they would become
martyrs, Catholic martyrs.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.240
And so my book, which actually
somehow you got an old title

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.500
for my book, so I'll give you
the new title, the real title.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.800
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: I'm sorry.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.100
&gt;&gt; Julia Young: No, no, no.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.400
It's floating out there somewhere.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.940
It's called Mexican
Exodus: Emigrants,

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.220
Exiles and Refugees
of the Cristero War.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.630
A little bit simpler.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.890
So my book examines the ways that
this Mexican migration overlapped

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.760
with this religions
conflict that was going on.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.360
And I find that the war actually
had a really significant impact

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.640
on this migrant community.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.790
Partly it was just
coincidence, the geographic

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.220
and chronological coincidence.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.860
The war happened at the same time
that this migration was happening.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.240
And it happened in the
same place that most

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.810
of the migrants were
leaving: west/central Mexico.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.900
The states -- for those
of you who know Mexico,

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.240
if you drew a big circle
around the city of Guadalajara,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.880
that would be the region.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.830
So it also impacted migration
in some more specific ways.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.110
It created a refugee flow.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:17.140
During the war, the Catholic
clergy, so priests, nuns, bishops,

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.480
were often actively persecuted
by the Mexican government.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.480
And so they either
were forced into exile

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.530
or sought refuge in
the United States.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.180
So there were about 2,000
members of the Catholic clergy

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.700
that migrated to the United States.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.210
There was also a flow of political
exiles, Catholic activists who felt

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.230
that they had to leave the country
because they were in danger.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:43.530
And these groups joined the
existing flow of economic emigrants

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.120
that were leaving the area already.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.100
That left the area before the
war started and after it went on.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.850
And it's this last group,
the sort of economic --

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.870
what we think of as
economic migrants --

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.980
that I think is of interest
for this particular discussion.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.820
I'll bring up two cases in
particular very quickly.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.050
One is a man named Miguel Vanegas.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.890
I think these cases are sort of
indicative of the larger group

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.060
of people I'm talking about.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.360
So Miguel Vanegas was the owner

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.400
of a general store in
the state of Jalisco.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.630
Its capital city is
Guadalajara, Cristero hotbed.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.250
He and his family were
strong Cristero supporters.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.350
His brother joined the
Cristero troops and eventually,

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.300
ultimately died in the conflict,

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.300
was considered a martyr
within the family.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.740
And he himself was also
a Cristero supporter.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:37.610
When federal troops came to his
town, they were aware of his

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:38.910
and his family's sympathies.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.410
And they let it be known that
he better leave the state

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.450
or he would potentially be killed.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.120
So he went into hiding and
ultimately he went to Los Angeles

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.670
where he started a
grocery store very similar

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.240
to his general store
back home in Jalisco.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.290
In Los Angeles, I think by the time
he left Mexico he had four children

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.860
and ultimately he and his
wife would have 10 children.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.400
He raised all of these 10
children in Los Angeles.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.850
The grocery store supported
the family.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.180
And they stayed in the United
States after the war ended.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.100
In fact, the descendants of
Miguel Vanegas still live

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.730
in Los Angeles to this day.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.840
But he raised his children
to be good, devoted Catholics

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:26.730
and to remember and support this
Cristero cause back home in Mexico.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.270
He and his family participated

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:34.150
in anti-government Catholic
activism from Los Angeles.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.270
And they continued to view
themselves as Cristero supporters,

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.590
both during the 1920's
and afterwards.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.730
Another quick case is the case of
Saradino Lopez, also from the state

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.180
of -- actually from
the state of Michoacan

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.000
but lived in the state of Jalisco.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.370
He was a journalist who
wrote critical articles

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:55.230
about the Mexican government while
the Cristero war was going on.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.800
He also was told that
he better leave

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.390
or he would find himself in danger.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:04.390
And so he had friends who
were living outside of Chicago

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.540
in the growing Mexican
community outside Chicago.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.150
And they told him,
"Well, come on over here.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.660
There are jobs and you
can make a new home here."

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.280
So he came to Chicago,
he made it his home.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.030
And he started a newspaper just
like the one he had run in Mexico.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.660
And that newspaper was critical
of the Mexican government

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.850
and it actually was a tool

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.010
that rallied Cristero
support in the United States.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.400
Through the newspaper he
got people to donate funds

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.810
which he then sent back to
the Cristero troops in Mexico.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.940
But he too and his family
stayed in Chicago after the war,

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.100
made a living there,
raised children there.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.160
One of his sons became a Catholic
priest who eventually went back

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:47.080
to Mexico when that
was legal once again.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.630
And so these are migrants.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.740
I know of many cases
of them but don't have

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.540
as many stories like this.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.950
But there were thousands of
people like this who left

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.820
because of the war
for political reasons,

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.550
but also for economic reasons.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.080
They couldn't maintain
their businesses

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.590
in Mexico during this conflict.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.680
And so when they relocated
to the United States,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.630 position:56%
became business people in the United
States and made a living there.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:19.270
So how do we classify
these types of migrants?

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:23.320
Typically, Mexican migrants
from this period are thought

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.200
of as labor migrants,
as economic migrants.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.140
And we as historians have
talked about them in terms

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.770 position:56%
of their economic motivations, their
economic interests and their labor.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:39.400
And what I argue in my book, I call
this group the Cristero diaspora.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.470
A scattered group of people

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.930
that supported the Cristero
cause from the United States.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.480
And what I argue in my book is

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.970
that this story tells us something
important about Mexican migrants.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.440
It tells us that Mexican
migrants were political actors.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.720
That they rallied around
causes within their homeland.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.670 position:56%
That they had religious motivations.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:04.170 position:56%
And by the way, not all of Mexican
migrants supported the Cristero War.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.630
Lots of them actually supported
the Mexican government.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.720
And these people fought with
each other in the United States.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:16.310
So Mexican migrants, you know,
need to be viewed outside

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:21.260
of this limiting lens of
economic or labor migration,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.350
is my argument both
in the book and here.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.370
And I think it helps us think
about something that we'll talk

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.890
about a little bit more
today, which is, you know,

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.330
how do these categories that we
try to stuff migrants into --

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.960
you know, are you an
economic migrant?

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.260
Are you a refugee?

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.600
Are you a political exile?

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.810
How can we blur these categories
in creative ways to think

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.670
about migrants differently?

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.200
So I'll stop there.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.700
&gt;&gt; Ivan Chaar-Lopez: Thank you.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.320
So thank you all for coming.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.550
It's exciting to talk about my
project in large part because I'm

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.200
in the process of research
and writing it.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.130
So I'm at a different
stage than my peers.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.550
And right now my dissertation
project is titled Drone Techno

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.100
Politics: A History

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.640
of the Datafication of
the US-Mexico Border.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.050
And it traces the long and
complicated trajectories

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:18.350
of databases and computers
as instruments

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.150
of empires since the 1960's.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:27.130
Databases and computers I think
help us understand how drones later

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.840
on in the 2000's become
the technological choice

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.940
for border surveillance operations.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.470
Now contemporary debates, as
Jason mentioned, demonstrate --

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:44.120
contemporary debates about the
border demonstrate a pressing need

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:52.060
to take a critical look into what
people call technological fixes,

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.850
or so-called technological fixes.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:59.760
Doing so sheds light on how the
border operates as a laboratory

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.010
for modes of governing and
administering populations.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.180
More precisely, the border I think

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.320
and I argue throughout
my project is a zone

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.190
where noncitizens become
expendable subjects

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.800
in the experimentation
of biopolitics.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.580
My goal in the end
is to contextualize

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.130
and interrogate the
techno political fixation

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.460
on data, both big and small.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:31.210
As well as on digital technologies
as end-all, solve-all solutions

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.440
to border policing and
immigration enforcement.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.070
To do this I don't only
inquire how computers,

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.280
databases and drones are imagined.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.210
I also open the technological
black box if you will,

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.000
to examine its internal operations.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.400
So what do technologies
do, how do they do it?

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.000
What are their methods
for acting upon the world?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.650
The way that I'm going about my
project right now is writing what I

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:03.330
call historical snapshots of
specific technological fixes,

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.550
or that question specific
technological fixes.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.450
So the study begins with
a database system known

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.690
as the Alien Documentation
Identification

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.260
and Telecommunication System.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.880
It's a mouthful so I say it slowly.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.900
But ADITS, as it was known, created
in the 1970's, was at the center

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.300
of INS, or immigration
naturalization service.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:33.140
The center of INS is the
process of automation.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:37.770
It was really a very
important project.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:43.880
And I look into this system
from 1975 and then I finish

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:50.770
with the Arizona Border Control
Initiative of 2004-2005 which is --

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:57.480 position:56%
what I found so far is the first use
of drones in the US-Mexico border.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.330
Now each snapshot follows a variety
of actors in federal government,

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.380 position:56%
private industry, academic research.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:11.130
It also looks into
journalism and activism to try

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:18.850 position:56%
to trace the different types of
state work that computers, databases

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.780
and drones are imagined to perform.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.020
And just to give you a little
sense of what I'm talking about,

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:29.280
which might sound a little bit
abstract, I have a few images

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.850
that I would like to share.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:35.230
So this is just an aerial
take of the Santa Fe bridge.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.980
This is the port of entry in
El Paso, in El Paso and Juarez.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:45.300
And the added system would
be used in a port of entry.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.450
So it's an identification system.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.690
It's just a regular ID, alien card.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:55.610
And it has a magnetic stripe and
different biometric data on it.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.830
And it would be used
in the port of entry.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.170
So I'm looking into
that kind of technology.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.670
But then there's this
whole realm of the border

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.660
that is very remote
and hard to access.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.990
And for that kind of terrain
the INS developed other

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:15.290
different technologies.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.720
Or incorporated actually
military technologies.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:28.200
And to give you -- so actually I'm
not going to pay attention to that.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.130
So this is an example of it.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.720
So this is a system
of connecting sensors,

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.990 position:56%
electronic sensors, seismic sensors.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:44.880
And it connects the sensors
to computers at headquarters

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.970
that sends information down
to patrol agents to try

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:55.190
to catch what they call
intruders from entering the US.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:00.780
And this system, as I explain,
is developed to try to patrol

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:07.350
and control this remote area,
this remote borderlands.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:12.230
And this is just a take,
a picture of the kind

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.380
of control headquarters
or control center.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.390
It's showing the integration
of different screens.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.500
Among them computer screens.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.550
And it's kind of the first
moment where these kind

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.380
of technologies are
used on the border.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.660
And I move from that to the drone,

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.430
which a lot of people
are familiar with.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.350
But for the most part people
are familiar with drones

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.310
as a military technology
used for drone strikes.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:50.000 position:56%
Or what I think the Intercept papers
call the assassination complex.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.460 position:56%
But rather than paying attention to
that kind of development I'm looking

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.880
into drones within the US.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.980
Military drones, not the quad
copters that are also very popular.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.350
But the military drones
use on the borderlands.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.420
And as you can see from this
diagram, it's very, very,

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:15.370 position:56%
very similar to the previous diagram
I showed in the sense that the ways

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.260
that these technologies are being
imagined is very, very close.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:24.540
So I'm trying to understand how did
that happen and what's behind kind

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.220 position:56%
of the thinking of these different
government officials and researchers

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.040
when they come up with the
project or with their systems.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.840
And yeah, we'll leave it at that.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.850
&gt;&gt; Katherine Luongo:
Okay, thank you.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.150
Thank you, Jason.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.840
Thank you to the Kluge
Center and to our audience.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.180
Like Ivan, I am in the midst
of writing up my research

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.790
and doing some research
as I continue to write up.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:52.470
So today I'm going to open by
offering a couple of brief synopses

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.670
of cases that I have collected.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:59.040
And then I'll talk a little
bit about the larger categories

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.820
that I think these cases
are representative of.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:09.160 position:56%
So in 2006 a man from Nigeria sought
asylum in Canada on the grounds

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.970
that the Nigerian state
did not offer protection

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.160
to the particular social
group that he belonged to:

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.970
persons accused of witchcraft.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:22.160
The immigration and refugee board
of Canada rejected his claim

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.920
on the grounds that the documentary
evidence in this situation --

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:32.580
country conditions report -- showed
that "despite apathy and reluctance

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.090
on the part of the police, people
have been arrested by the police

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.140
and convicted before judges."

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.140
The claim was denied.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.890
The asylum seeker appealed to
the federal court of Canada

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.530
for a judicial review of his case.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:51.550
The judge noted that the board
had relied on documentary evidence

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:54.710
which dealt with people convicted
for practicing witchcraft.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:24:00.560
I have noted the report "could
not constitute state protection

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.640
of persons wrongly
accused of witchcraft."

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:09.660
The asylum seeker was granted
a new hearing in this case.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.830
In 2012, Namibian asylum
seekers, a mother

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.490
and her minor son, came to Canada.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.670
They made the argument
that they belonged

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:23.670
to a particular social group at
risk for harm from witchcraft.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:27.460
The mother explained that her
son faced a high risk of death

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.970
from witch doctors in Namibia.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.110
The death of her parents had
been linked to witchcraft.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:36.770
Competing for her inheritance,
her relatives had cursed her

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.320
and said she would
die like her parents.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:45.120
Her brothers had respectively found
a big snake on their front porch

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.700
and another one found
a bowl of blood

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.210
with an owl on his front porch.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:56.040
They took this as evidence of black
magic being practiced against them.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.270
The asylum seeker said that
he'd never sought out protection

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.250
from state authorities
because her family was going

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.040
through witchcraft problems.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:09.990
And as she explained "the state
cannot protect us from witchcraft."

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.570
The immigration and refugee
board rejected her claim,

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.310 position:56%
saying that the harm that she feared

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:19.050
over her inheritance was
definitely a family matter.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.390
It rejected the claim that her son,

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:25.880 position:56%
who suffered from a condition that's
actually redacted in the decision,

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.510
did not face from witch doctors.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:34.290
People suffering from his condition
were not killed in Namibia.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:38.820 position:56%
And they also rejected her claim
that the state offered no protection

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.590
from witchcraft and
cited a range of evidence

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:46.370 position:56%
that Namibia was a democratic state.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.960
So these cases are
exemplars of the archive

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.830
of nearly 40 cases
that I put together.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:57.950
And what I'm examining is cases
in which African asylum seekers

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:02.210
who are coming from Anglophone
Africa to commonwealth countries.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.880
To Canada, the UK and Australia.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.290
Alleged that being accused
of witchcraft or targeted

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.870 position:56%
with witchcraft makes them a member
of a particular social group subject

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:17.550
to persecution and eligible
for refugee protection.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.330
So I think that these
cases offer avenues

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:24.810
to explore some key categories
in refugee status determination.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:29.160
But also in the legal history
of witchcraft and the management

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.450
of witchcraft related crime
on the African continent.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.290
So when I am talking about
witchcraft in these cases,

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:41.530
I'm talking about an embodied
capacity, an object or a practice

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:48.440 position:56%
that mobilizes an invisible,
malevolent power to harm the person,

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.790
property, psyche or kin of another.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:58.120 position:56%
Asylum seekers have to show that the
state doesn't offer protection form

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.480
the kind of violence that they
allege that they have suffered

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.390
or that they will suffer if they
return to their country of origin.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:10.440
So part of my project is to
inquire into the deep jurisprudence

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.210
about witchcraft on
the African continent,

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:19.240
and to establish a history to
these claims of the absence

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.190
of state protection from
witchcraft-driven violence.

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:27.160
Asylum seekers also have to show
that they meet one of the criteria

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.160
for refugee status that's laid

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.710
out in the 1951 UN
convention on refugees.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:36.730
So these criteria are race,
religion, political opinion,

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:41.490 position:56%
nationality and of course membership
of a particular social group.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:45.970
And this convention
is really the lynchpin

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:49.440
of the refugee status
determination process.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.100
So my project is taking
witchcraft-based asylum cases

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.000
as an avenue through which
to explore the expansion

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.670
of the social group criteria.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.680
And this is the only
criterion of the UN convention

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.000
that has been expanding
in recent years

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.820
as asylum authorities have been
more inclined to hear arguments

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.650
that a social group
can be constituted

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:17.130
around cultural practices,
beliefs and perceptions.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.290
This project also offers an avenue

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:23.170
to investigate how
expertise is constituted

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:26.640
and mobilized in legal settings.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.750
In the colonial cases
that I am examining,

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.800
a category of intermediary,
native assessor,

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.600 position:56%
typically men who were taken from
the local community that the parties

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:44.640 position:56%
to the case belong to, operated as
interpreters of culture and language

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.360
between the parties to the
case and British justices.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.760
They explained the
finer points of culture

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.910
that were brought up in cases.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.520
They explained particular
vernacular terms.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:02.350
And they bona fide or denied the
participants in the case's claims

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:06.290
about how culture operated
in their cases.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:08.880
So something that I
found very striking is

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.980
that in asylum cases
today, social scientists,

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.390
very often anthropologists,
serve in the role

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.080
of a modern day native assessor.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.920
As expert witnesses, they
serve as intermediaries

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.500
between the asylum claimants
and the asylum adjudicators

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.600
who are hearing the cases.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.450
And they occupy many of the
same kinds of roles of cultural

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.810
and linguistic translation.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:39.190
So some of the core questions that
I'm applying in doing this research

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:43.180
and in writing it up
is in the question of,

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.760
can the law effectively
intervene in witchcraft?

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.490 position:56%
How is reasonableness constituted in
state courts and in asylum venues?

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:58.320
And what are the limits of cultural
relativism in asylum settings?

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.720
So I think that these cases
open up a lens through which

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:08.080
to consider the really global
reach of local forms of violence.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.380
Thank you.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.680
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: Okay.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.980
Great, thank you all.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.340
I'm going to take a little bit of
time to generate some conversation

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.970
between the three scholars
before we open

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.780
up to everybody else
in the audience.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:24.040
And I want to touch on what all
three of you have alluded to

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.690 position:56%
and mentioned, which is this idea of
labels, definitions and categories.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.660
And that's something that we all
talked about amongst ourselves

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:36.330
when we initially thought
up the idea for this event.

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:39.980
And I believe it was Kate who
actually used this phrase,

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.660
which I loved, which was the
bureaucratization of experiences

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.130
into state-defined categories.

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.060
Which is kind of a mouthful.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.360
But thinking about we
have people who are moving

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:55.550
for all various reasons in
history from places to places.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:56.950
Sometimes we call them migrants.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.310
Sometimes we call them immigrants.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.060
Sometimes we call them refugees.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.290
Sometimes we call them
asylum seekers.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:07.620
And at each point, some body, some
state body, some governing body,

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.430
some global body has to make a
definition and a designation.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:15.120
And each of you have come up
against this in your research.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.030
So maybe we could star
there and talk a little bit

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:21.140
about these terminologies and
how they factor into the stories

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:26.570
that you're uncovering and the
research that you're doing.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:27.870
&gt;&gt; Julia Young: Yeah.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.170
Well, your comment
just made me think

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:34.960
about an interesting development in
the historical study of immigration

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.080
which people may or may not
know about, which is, you know,

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.250
in US immigration history --

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:44.300
so the history of immigration
to the United States.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.820
One of the seminal, earliest
studies of migration is a book

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.710
by Oscar Handlin called
The Uprooted.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:59.960 position:56%
And it presents this image of
migrants as people who are the poor,

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:05.380
the downtrodden, people who are
uprooted from their local context

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:12.900
and then flung into their new land
and forced to recollect themselves

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.410
and reconstruct their lives.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:22.600
Essentially it treats immigrants
almost as handicapped people,

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.720
people that are almost
a blank slate or people

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.020
who are without a background.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.100
And the historiography on
immigration is changing

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.900
and has changed over
the 20th century

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:37.280
and it's increasingly recognizing
immigrants as people who come

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:43.630
with a political context, who come
with a background of their own.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.630
And that they bring with them,

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.900
that they don't leave
in their home country.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.370
They're not uprooted people.

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:52.640
They might be transplanted people,
or there are other metaphors

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.810
that people have come up with.

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:58.330
And I think that's a
positive development,

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.090
but I'm not sure it's translated

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.040
into public discourse
on immigration.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.610
And I'm not sure it's translated
into the immigration courts, right?

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:10.120
These are people with
a real understanding

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.970
of the context which
immigrants left.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:14.610
So I'll stop there.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:18.640
&gt;&gt; Katherine Luongo: Yeah, I think
this issue of context is really key

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.680
in refugee status determination.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.090
Because we have this popular
image of the refugee as someone

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:29.290
who has experienced some form of
trauma that makes it impossible

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.310
for them to stay in their home.

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:34.930
And therefore they leave and
they seek sanctuary elsewhere.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:38.360
Hopefully they're welcomed
by the receiving state.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.960
But there are very precise
legal definitions and categories

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.410
that a person has to show that
they conform to, to be eligible

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.480
for the rights and
protection of formal

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.250
or conventional refugee status.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:55.310 position:56%
And part of achieving that status is

00:33:55.310 --> 00:34:00.090
as the asylum seeker
narrating your own experience.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:05.840
But the legal systems are not
prepared to hear the deep context

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.300
that really illustrates
the different categories

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.530 position:56%
to which refugee experiences belong.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:16.950
And it's also complicated by,
as Julia has just suggested,

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:19.560
that very often there are
cross-cutting categories

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.460
that refugees belong to as well.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.760
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer:

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:28.750 position:56%
In your research did your notice a
shifting language as you looked back

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.380
from the '50's, '60's,
'70's to today

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.230
in who the technology
is being implemented

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:37.450
to keep out or to monitor?

00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.010
Is it immigrants, is it migrants?

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.310
Is it refugees?

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:41.610
Is it all of the above?

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:44.710
&gt;&gt; Ivan Chaar-Lopez: Well one of
the concepts or terms that comes

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:49.990
across a lot in the literature
is the idea of intruder.

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:53.500
And I'm not necessarily
sure of its genealogy,

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.230
but for sure there
is some relationship

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:01.430
to the Vietnam War as it's ongoing.

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.760
Particularly because of the
sensors that they're using.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.250
They're bringing sensors
from Vietnam and this kind

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:13.450
of line simulation system
that I showed the diagram.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:19.660
That is a kind of deployment of
a lot of Vietnam technologies

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.990
in the context of the
US-Mexico border.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.690
So a lot of these different --

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:29.460 position:56%
a lot of categories such as intruder
becomes kind of repositioned

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:34.760
because of the context to
signal particular subjects

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.620
especially migrants.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:43.180
But there's also border
smugglers that are included

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.020
in the category of intruder.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.760
Because you have to think that the
1970's -- the end of the '60's,

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.580
the beginning of the '70's
also marks the beginning

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.890
of the war on drugs.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:36:01.190 position:56%
And there's a lot of these different
technologies are employed as well,

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:07.500 position:56%
not just to capture or to try to
target immigrants, but also to track

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.950
and capture border
smugglers of different kinds

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:15.570
of things, as well as humans.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:16.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: I'm also struck

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:21.480
about how there are some
things that we can't keep out.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:28.680
We go through all these
machinations to keep people out,

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.120
but there are things
that transcend borders

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.100
and that cross borders no
matter how hard we try.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.490
There's religions and ideologies.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.360
And as you were talking
about, there's politics

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.160
and political leanings
that we can't keep out.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:50.920
Can we talk a little bit about
some of the things that are porous,

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:56.660
that spread across borders even
as there are these categories

00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.890
that are meant to keep various
elements out of various places?

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.250
You've already mentioned
some of them.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:05.590
&gt;&gt; Julia Young: Yeah, I mean I
would just say political conflicts.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:10.230
You know, I've seen this in my
own work but also in other groups.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:14.200 position:56%
Someday I would like to write a book
comparing different migrant groups

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.820
who sort of brought their
homeland conflict with them.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.310
I think it's more the rule rather
than the exception actually.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:24.980
You can look at Armenians
or multiple other national

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.500
or ethnic groups who in some ways
not only bring their conflicts

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.870
with them -- or their
political causes with them.

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:34.230
But their political causes
become even more important

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.530
in the United States.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:38.130
The Irish are an example of that.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:42.140 position:56%
Where that political cause or
conflict becomes a part of identity.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.400
So that's something
that's very portable.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:49.720
Somebody was talking about
portable nationalism.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.020
We were talking about that.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.650
We were talking about that in
the halls of the Kluge Center.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:56.680
&gt;&gt; Katherine Luongo:
Yeah, I think I can answer

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.870
that question abstractly
and concretely.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.460
So more abstractly,
I think we can talk

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.890
about narratives being
born across borders.

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:11.380
So as I think I suggested earlier,
the refugee's testimony really

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.540
about his or her own
experience really forms the core

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.340
of an asylum case.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.810
And a lot of the literature

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:22.110
on refugee status determination
has talked about the culture

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:26.350
of disbelief with which many
asylum adjudicators approach

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:27.660
these narratives.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:33.040
And one of the reasons is that
there are narrative brokers.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.900
So you can go in your
home country to someone

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.310
who will tell you a story
that's been shown to work

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:42.120
in the asylum setting
where you're heading.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.050
And you can adapt it a
little to make it kind

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.490
of your own legend almost.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:51.530
More concretely, beliefs and
practices are born across borders.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:57.800
So there have been cases in the
UK of witchcraft-based killings.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:03.700
And I've also seen some
cases of human trafficking

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.460
where Nigerian women have been
taken to Europe and held enthralled

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.030
by their captors who have told them

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:15.990
that they have essentially
witch doctors on call at home

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:19.480
to curse the trafficked
women's families if they try

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.960
to escape from their traffickers.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.230
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: Interesting.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.870
Ivan, there was an article

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:34.380
in the New Yorker recently
chronicling a Syrian refugee

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:40.430
and how he made it first to
Cypress and back and then to Turkey

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.830
and Greece and eventually
all the way up to Sweden.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:44.760
And as I was reading that
article I was thinking of you

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:49.150 position:56%
because it talked about all of the
various ways that he used technology

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.400
to subvert border protection.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.020
And I was thinking about your
research and all the investments

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:58.190
in technology that we have made
to enforce border protection.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:01.280
Is that something that you
think about in your research,

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:06.910 position:56%
how people have also subverted these
technologies using perhaps less

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:11.440
sophisticated or more
naïve modes of technology?

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.390
&gt;&gt; Ivan Chaar-Lopez:
So the ADITS system,

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.840
as I mentioned, produced a card.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.030
The goal was every alien resident

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:23.920
in the United States would
have this card as a mode

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.450
of identifying his or herself.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:33.840 position:56%
And that came about because the
original green card as it was called

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.320
that was actually used
since the 1940's,

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.040 position:56%
there were different versions of it.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.320
So there was no standard
version of a green card.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.670
So they wanted to create
finally a standard version of it,

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:50.790
because a lot of migrants
crossing the border --

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.090
not through the checkpoints,

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.930
but even also through the
checkpoints themselves.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:59.580
They carried what the
government thought were falsified

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.340
or fraudulent identifications.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:06.770
So they were trying to kind
of police that practice.

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:13.700
And so the short answer is
these different technologies

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:19.070
that are created to remediate
maybe a transgression by a migrant

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:25.580
or by a group of people
are not perfect.

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.030
And even the same computer
engineers --

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.870
for example there's
an electrical engineer

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:32.520
that was working on the sensors.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:37.770
He talks of how these systems,
not only are they not perfect,

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:42.210
but that they're also producing new
problems that need to be addressed,

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.290
need to be kind of
thought about constantly.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.950
And that's just from
the researcher side.

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:51.790
And then the implementation
also leads to you know,

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:56.120
people creating false
documents, et cetera.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.890
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: I'll throw
one more food for thought question

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:03.220
out there and then we'll
hear from everybody here.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:08.750
When we originally spoke
we talked about how earlier

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:14.840
in human history there were
migrations happening all the time.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.190
I mean, if we go way, way back,

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:19.900
people crossing the Bering
Strait or from Africa.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:23.900
But even in more recent human
history, migrations across space,

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.150
across geographies,
across boundaries

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:30.260
that went largely unchecked
or unfettered.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:34.800
But it seems to be sort
of correlated to the rise

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.720
of the nation state and the
modern day boundaries and borders

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.560
that we've drawn that we see the
migration of people from point A

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.520
to point B as a problem
that needs to be solved.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.410
Or that needs to be somehow
mitigated in some way.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:55.670 position:56%
I was wondering if, as you think
about your own research and the work

00:42:55.670 --> 00:43:01.860
that you're doing, how this idea of
the border and people crossing it

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.330
as a problem that needs to be
solved or an issue that needs

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:07.680
to be confronted -- how
you have seen that evolve.

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.770
How that has been talked
about by the various actors

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.450
and agents in your research.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:14.750
Or if there's any other insights

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:18.890
on that very general theme
that you want to share.

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:22.780
Kate, you want to go first?

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.190
&gt;&gt; Katherine Luongo:
Yeah, that's fine.

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:27.220
So I think that the apparatus
around controlling the flow

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:30.450
of people has gotten more
and more complex over time.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.670
So the cases that I'm looking

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:36.820
at have occurred primarily
in the last 20 years.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.250
And I've been reading them in
conversation with the refugee law

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:43.590
in the places in which the
asylum is being sought.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:46.240
And it seems to me those
bureaucratic institutions

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.950
and their mechanisms are
becoming ever more complex.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:56.140
At the same time there's a real
push and pull that's quite apparent

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.490
between a kind of humanitarian
impulse

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:01.330
and then a desire for
resource control.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:07.070
Which is really I think at the
root of this problem of migration.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.430
&gt;&gt; Ivan Chaar-Lopez: Let me see.

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:17.060
So in the case of computers
and databases,

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.480
I would also say the same
thing in the sense that a lot

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.670
of the systems have grown more
complicated and more nuanced.

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.640
A lot of these computers early

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:31.280
on could only just perform
one particular task.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.000
And you know, a lot
of the research was

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.380
that the computer could perform
the task as quickly as possible.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:41.600
It was all about speed and
make it as fast as possible.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:49.210
But today computers have
multiple functions and do plenty

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.860
of things simultaneously.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:57.380
And what I'm studying or trying
to figure out is how algorithms,

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:00.980
the development of
certain algorithms,

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.920
complicate the practice
of sovereignty.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:08.150
And I don't have an answer to that.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:12.240
That's really like the big
question behind my project.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.270
But just to give you a taste of
it, not really from my project

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:21.110
but from another experience.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:24.200
So the NSA uses kind of
a citizenship algorithm.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:28.130
This comes from the research of one
of my advisors, John Cheney-Lippold

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:32.090
So the NSA uses this citizenship
algorithm that determines

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:35.010
if the person that is being
surveilled is a citizen or not.

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:38.020
And if you are identified
by this algorithm

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:41.340
that you are 51% considered
noncitizen,

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.640
then you could be surveilled.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.870
So citizenship becomes a gradation.

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:46.580
It's not a yes or a no thing.

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.820
Although it is a yes or now thing,
but it's quantified in such a way

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:56.030
that makes it almost possible
for anybody to be noncitizen.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:00.610
So yeah, trying to figure out that.

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:07.530
&gt;&gt; Julia Young: So my research
is really focused on the 1920's

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:12.260
and 1930's, but of course I
voraciously read all news having

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.560
to do with migration now.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.830
And so I think a lot
about what has changed.

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:19.460
And you know, one thing that
hasn't changed is there were lots

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:22.040
of Donald Trumps in the 1920's.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.630
Really so many saying
such similar things.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:29.960
And that's both depressing and
also sort of like reassuring

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.350
because all things will pass.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.050
That's my hope anyway.

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:38.590
But in terms of you know, the
actual control of the border,

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:40.450
the 1920's is a really
interesting period

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:43.570 position:56%
because it's really the first decade
that the US tries to get control

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:48.400
of the border between
the US and Mexico.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.840
And it's not only to get control

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.600
over the Mexican migrant
population --

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.800
and we hear about this from
Ruth Watson a couple weeks ago.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.740
Mexicans were not included
in the quota system

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:04.500
that restricted migrants during
the 1920's, this new quota system.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.420
Neither Mexicans nor other migrants
from the western hemisphere.

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.250
And so they were technically
fee to cross the border.

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:14.330
But the Chinese and other Asian
groups were excluded completely.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.680
And so the rise of the
border patrol and the efforts

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.860
to control the southern
border were initially meant

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.370
to control that population.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:24.970
But very soon after, that control
began to be applied to Mexicans

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:30.050
and Mexicans began to be
seen as an invader group.

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:32.500
I don't know if I would use
the word invader for them.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.930
But you know, as an
illegal alien group.

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:40.490
And May Nie has written sort
of the book on the policing

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.450
of the border and how that goes.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.820
But it wasn't very
effective in the 1920's.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.210
I mean the border is huge
and for the first few years

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:51.120
of the border patrol there
were 20 or 30 officers I think

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.730
and they're patrolling this
3,000-kilometer border.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:57.340
There was no chance.

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:01.070 position:56%
And you could pretty easily -- you
were subject to certain restrictions

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:03.590
when you crossed, but you
could pretty easily bypass them

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:04.890
and just walk across.

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:07.270
And it really remained that
way for most of the century.

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:12.000
That's different now and you're
telling us how different that is.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.870
That's become very different
since the '60's and that's

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:16.320
because of this new technology.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.220
And I would say the
major difference is

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.720
in how many people are dying
trying to get across the border.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.860
And how much the border
has now become a site

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:26.660
of real human rights
tragedies in the way

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.660 position:56%
that it really wasn't in the 1920's.

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.000
And I know there's one human
rights group that's trying

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.060
to get cell phone towers
installed along the borders

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:39.800 position:56%
so that migrants themselves can make
use of wireless technology the way

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.390
that they're doing in
Europe to find themselves

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:44.210
when they're lost in the desert.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:50.600 position:56%
And there's resistance to doing that
from Donald Trumpians and their ilk.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.970
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: Well I think
I've asked enough questions.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:56.270
So I think it would be great
to hear from the audience.

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:57.810
Travis has a microphone.

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:00.710
The trick to that microphone is
I have to turn off my microphone

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:04.920
for it to work, which ensures that
I won't ask any more questions.

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.550
&gt;&gt; Than you all very much for that.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:16.910
That was fabulous.

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:24.550
So I wondered if any of you had a
kind word for national sovereignty.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:32.230
It seems to me that in national
sovereignty is somewhat defined

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.310
by the ability to control
one's borders.

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:38.660
And there's a traditional
value and expectation of that.

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:44.430
Usually we're not thinking of
migrants when we're saying that.

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:48.420
But a number of Jason's
questions went to legitimacy

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.870
of the exercise of sovereignty.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:54.160
The reason for categories, the
reason for asylum and you know,

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:58.590
not an economic migrant,
but an asylum seeker.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:01.710
People attribute certain
values as legitimate

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:03.450
to exercise of sovereignty.

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:07.490
And then they find another value
which will trump sovereignty.

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:08.790
No pun intended here.

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:16.140
Relax. What I'm wondering is --
I've talked to others in this field

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.220
and they actually answer my
question "Do you have a kind word

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.080
for national sovereignty?"

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.420
with "No, we don't."

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:27.460
That borders are destructive
of movement that's essential

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:31.560
if you truly value human life
in many parts of the world due

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.200
to conflict and other things.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.440
I wondered how each of
you looked at sovereignty

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:39.100
and its legitimate exercise.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.680
&gt;&gt; Julia Young: I can start.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.640
I mean, I regard migration as
a fundamentally positive thing.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:55.330
And I think that the way to
address if there are concerns

00:50:55.330 --> 00:51:01.040 position:56%
about a particular population that's
coming, it's not very effective

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.520
to address them at the border.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.100
We talked earlier about
how migrants manage

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.460
to find ways around restrictions.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:08.930
Maybe one day we'll get to a point

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:14.930
where states can actually
enforce true control over borders.

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:19.220
But up until this point,
migrant ingenuity has trumped --

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:24.360
again that word -- state
enforcement of the border.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:28.230
But yeah, I mean I've asked myself
this question and I think I'm

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:30.060
in favor of open borders.

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:33.810
But I'd be up for a debate on that.

00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:37.410
&gt;&gt; Katherine Luongo: Yeah, I think
it's a really complicated question.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:41.380
And I'll go back to what I said
before about the push and pull

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:45.610
between the humanitarian impulse
and then resource allocation.

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:48.630
And I think that with the
specter of Donald Trump,

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:52.950
one of the questions underpinning
sovereignty is what the citizens

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:58.120
of the sovereign state believe
immigration is doing or not doing.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:02.670
And I don't think that there
are very accurate understandings

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:07.950
of how immigrant populations
come to be in a particular nation

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:12.230
and the kinds of things that
they do once they arrive there.

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:24.490
&gt;&gt; I don't have a question
for each person.

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:28.700
I don't have a comprehensive
question.

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.500
I just have a quick
question for each if I may.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:33.090
So for Julia, historians saw your
migrants as economic migrants.

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:37.460
But how did they come in?

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.000
Did they come in as asylum seekers?

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.350
Were they mostly given asylum?

00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:44.960
Do you have any idea?

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.810
&gt;&gt; Julia Young: Should
we answer one-by-one?

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:51.790
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer:
Let her ask Ivan.

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:57.850
&gt;&gt; For Ivan, on technology, I'm
just wondering about changes

00:52:57.850 --> 00:52:59.630
and new technology changes.

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:09.930
The people employed to do the
work, to use the technology.

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:17.550
And then finally for Kate,
a question about the legal.

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:24.640
Whether the asylum seekers who
seek asylum under the category

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:31.520
of witchcraft, whether they
have legal representation

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.820
for the most part and
what difference that makes

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.120
and how it helps you
understand something

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.420
about the social economic
background.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.720
Thanks.

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.020
&gt;&gt; Julia Young: Thank you.

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:39.320
That's a really good question.

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.620
And the answer is that it was messy

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:44.550
because the legal frameworks were
just being developed at this time.

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:50.880
And like Kate said, the
refugee law didn't really exist

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.100
until after 1951.

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:57.410
So a lot of the Mexicans
that I talk about,

00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.830
there are multiple ways to come in.

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:01.900
Some people came without documents.

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:05.810
Some people came -- you
could come in without a visa

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:08.120
if you said you were going to
stay for less than six months.

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.140
So some people came in that way.

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:15.830
But there was a small group of
people who did come in in a sort

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:19.270
of quasi-refugee status,
and that was the clergy.

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:21.660
The US Catholic church
was very aware

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.040
of this conflict, as
you would imagine.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.520
And they actually had
an immigration bureau.

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.400
Because the US Catholic church is
another very interesting story,

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.110
but they were very invested
and interested in immigration

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:35.280
and immigration policy at
this time, as they still are.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.290
And so they had an
immigration bureau in El Paso.

00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:43.180
And the personnel there actually
helped these refugee priests

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:46.420
and nuns apply for visas
and get them visas.

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.190
But they weren't called refugees.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:50.590
They didn't really use the
term refugees and asylum.

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:55.080
But they did get them visas on the
basis of their being persecuted.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.170
And so they came in as sort of
like recognized legal migrants.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:02.900
But for a lot of people the
categories are much more slippery.

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ivan Chaar-Lopez: So with regards

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:09.940 position:56%
to how technology changes the people
employed to do the border work,

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.240
one of the things that
I'm trying to tease out --

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:17.870
and I'm actually in the midst
of writing this chapter --

00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:23.100
is how borders are
produced through technology.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:27.290
So how boundaries are demarcated
from the technology itself.

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:33.350
To give you a specific example, in
the 1940's a group of researchers

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:37.620
in different places in the
United States become invested

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:41.390
in what later becomes
known as cybernetics.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:44.450
And cybernetic theory
blurred the boundary

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:49.420
between living organisms
and machines.

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:56.060
And in the blurring of that
boundary, when you have an office

00:55:56.060 --> 00:56:02.430
of planning and evaluation and INS
implementing new automated systems

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:07.940
into INS work, what they're doing
is imagining all the different

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:11.170
components of the system
as a machine.

00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:15.880
So humans in some way become
machines or little machines

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.210
within the machine itself.

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:24.950
And in that way I think that that
is changing how the officials are

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:30.690
imagined or are thought of
by different policy makers.

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:38.550
And yeah, that would be my initial
response, is in the way that humans

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:42.400
and machines are thought
of within government.

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.840
&gt;&gt; Katherine Luongo: Yeah, on the
question of legal representation,

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.780 position:56%
it's quiet, inconsistent and ad hoc.

00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:55.440
And asylum seekers
can acquire attorneys

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.300
through various mechanisms.

00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:00.930
In some cases there are
NGO's that specialize

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:04.960
in matching asylum
seekers with attorneys.

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.200 position:56%
Large law firms will often have some

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.580
of their pro bono work
dedicated to doing asylum cases.

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:17.270 position:56%
And of course if you have an
attorney you're in much better shape

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:20.720
in crafting the narrative that
you're going to be presenting

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.450
to the asylum adjudicator.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:27.650
But it also gives you much
wider access to expert witnesses

00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:31.180
who can support some of the claims
that you're making in your case.

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.260
&gt;&gt; So actually my question
was how many

00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:39.120
of those cases have
legal representation?

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.420
Is it common or not so common?

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:46.310
&gt;&gt; Katherine Luongo: It really
depends on -- it really depends.

00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:50.580
So I haven't broken it down,
but there are variations really

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:54.780
on a state-by-state basis
in Canada for instance.

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:57.640
But I would just say it's
inconsistent and ad hoc

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.470
to answer quite generally.

00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:01.770
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer:
We're approaching 5:00

00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:03.070
so we have time for one more.

00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:04.650
You can take the last one.

00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:05.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:07.490
Thank you for talking
about your work,

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:09.400
and Jason for being
such a wonderful host.

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.740
I have a question for everybody.

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:15.270
It's provoked by Ivan
and I have some thoughts

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:19.010
about it with respect to Ivan.

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:25.260
You developed borderlands as a
concept, and I wonder how it helps

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:30.300
or how it works in your papers
to conceptualize the site

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:33.610
of contestation as a borderland,
as opposed to a border.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.770
And as I'm sure you know, sort
of in the borderlands literature,

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:42.000
borders aren't finite spaces
that you jump across, right?

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.970
But are fluid spaces
within which identity

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:50.920
and agency is produced
and contested.

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:56.270
And so if that's the case,
you know, Ivan it almost seems

00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:58.240
at war with your topic, right?

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:04.360
Because the topic sort of seems
to sort of conceptualize this kind

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:09.060
of hard border with all of the
work happening on one side.

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.620
I wonder what you think about that.

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.090
And also whether the real
sort of agency and identity

00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:15.680
that is being produced --

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.370
is it essentially living
within the machine?

00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:22.540
You know your last answer
was just so provocative

00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:27.910
and I wonder whether you want to
think through sort of the agency

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:32.650
of the machine being
produced in this borderland.

00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:35.690
&gt;&gt; Ivan Chaar-Lopez: So
that's a great question.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.600
Let me see how to tackle it.

00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:46.860
So going back to the, for example,

00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:51.160
the different electronic
sensors on the border.

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:57.200
These sensors do not successfully
identify every time there is a

00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.800
migrant passing by.

00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:05.430
But it's actually giving signals
for different kinds of beings.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:09.680
Because it's not responding
to, I don't know, to human skin

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.030
and saying, "Oh, there
is a human touching me."

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:15.230
But it's actually just sending
an electric signal with a sound

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:20.980
to the home base saying, "Oh,
there's something going on here."

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.280
And they send people there.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.580
And what happens?

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:25.230
They find an animal.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.530
They find a dog.

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:30.350
They find another organism there.

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:34.320
So these machines are
constantly failing.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.330
Even though they're
working effectively,

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:38.350
in their effective
operation they're failing

01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:42.440
to successfully differentiate
between the human and nonhuman.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.630
So that's why I think the
borderlands framework is

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:50.020 position:56%
so productive to look at technology.

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:55.460
Because it is not so neatly as
I've probably been showed it to be.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.760
It's actually not.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.160
It's actually failing constantly.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.110
I can think of for example drones.

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:04.740
Drones are not flying
all of the time

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.800
as they're supposed to be flying.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.590
But they're flying I think
a little bit over 50%

01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:12.650
of what they're supposed
to be flying,

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:14.310
of the time they're
supposed to be flying.

01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:16.590
So they're way down and that's one

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:19.610
of the reasons why
the inspector general

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:24.160 position:56%
for Homeland Security is criticizing
the drone program and saying,

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.720
"This costs too much and
it's not doing the work

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.420
that you guys say it is doing."

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:35.220
But there are a lot of
different players that want

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:37.600
to see the drone program continue.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:43.310 position:56%
And that's why, you know, my
approach which is an actor approach,

01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:44.700
looking into different actors.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:51.190 position:56%
You have to not only look at the
state but also look at the engineers

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:53.540
and look at the companies
behind these technologies

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:56.150
that are also really invested.

01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:57.610
Quite literally they're invested

01:01:57.610 --> 01:02:04.290
in these machines being
bought and being deployed.

01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:08.820
And that's why I think the
comment of the electrical engineer

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:13.030
from the 1970's, I thought
his comment was brilliant

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:14.400
in this article I read.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.740
And he's saying, you know,

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:20.110
these machines are
generating new problems for us.

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:24.260
And I included it because
I wanted to kind

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:29.600
of highlight how they're not
perfect and they're failing.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.260
Yeah, sorry I went everywhere.

01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:38.640
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer:
Any last questions?

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.200
Okay. Well I think we ought
to leave it there then.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.510
Please join me in thanking
all three of our scholars.

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:53.040
[ Applause ]

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.520
Just a quick bit of administrative
business before concluding.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.580
We are conducting an
institution-wide survey

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.120
about our events.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.120
That survey is on the
table right when you exit.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.410
And we'd love to get your feedback
on this event and any other events

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:09.970
that you've been to
at the Kluge Center.

01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:12.460
We hope to do more types
of these conversations

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:14.810
when scholars are working on topics
that intersect with each other.

01:03:14.810 --> 01:03:16.860
So please do sign our email list.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.140
And we at the Kluge Center are
on break for a couple weeks,

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:24.760
but we are back December 10th with
Mary Dubjack, our current chair

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.470
in American law and governments.

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:30.360
She will be sharing a
lecture about her research

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.900 position:56%
on America's entry into World War I.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:35.420
So please do join us for
that and thank you again

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:38.290
for being here this afternoon.

01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:41.990
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:44.370
