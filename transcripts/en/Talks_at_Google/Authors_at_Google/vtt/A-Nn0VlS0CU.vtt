SPEAKER 1: Thank you
all for being here.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.150
And let's begin.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.970
So first off, Judith, we
just want to start with that,

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.520
beginning with, what
exactly is an empath,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.440
if you could speak upon that?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.940
JUDITH ORLOFF: So
I just want to say

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.490
how excited I am to be here.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.590
The energy here
is so incredible.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.880
It's so beautiful.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.010
As an empath, I'm
an emotional sponge,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.550
and I tend to absorb other
people's emotions, or even

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.030
physical symptoms, or the energy
of a place into my own body.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.170
But when it's like this,
it's a true pleasure.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.130
It's a beautiful
work environment.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.560
So I'm very grateful to be here.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.270
I'm a psychiatrist in Santa
Monica, and I'm also an empath.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.300
And so I combine traditional
psychiatric skills

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.560
with my ability to intuit what's
going on in the environment.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.170
And being an
empath, somebody who

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.920
is very sensitive, very
intuitive, very open,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.390
but they tend to take on
the stress of the world

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.200
because they don't have the same
filters that other people have.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.750
And so I feel everything,
which can be a plus and minus.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.300
And so I wanted to write
the "Empath Survival

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.160
Guide," to give
people skills how

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.250
not to absorb the stress
of others, particularly

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.510
in the work environment.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.280
If you're next to
people, perhaps you're

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.650
uncomfortable with, how to
just hold a space for them,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.200
but not take it on.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.940
Because empaths take it on.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.830
And as a result, I
can get exhausted,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.290
or when I was a
child, I couldn't

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.660
go into shopping malls
or crowded places

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.690
because I'd go in fine
and then I'd walk out

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.410
with an ache, or pain,
or anxiety, or exhaustion

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.860
that I didn't have before.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.690
And I didn't realize then, as a
little girl, that I was picking

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.700
up the energy and the
emotions of other people,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.430
that the whole phenomena
of emotional contagion that

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.980
can happen that we know so
much now that-- for instance,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.340
if you're in a
children's ward, a baby

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.500
ward in the hospital, if
one baby starts crying,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.510
the rest of them start crying.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.550
Or if you're in a
work environment

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.780
and somebody has very negative
energy and is a downer,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.080
it can spread to the rest
of the people like a virus.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.560
And so as an empath, that's
particularly intense.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.290
And so I want to say
that this is a gift,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.110
and we need to learn how
to manage it as well.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.150
SPEAKER 2: So I
think you answered

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.580
part of my second question,
or the second question

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.720
that we've put together, but
it was, how did you become

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.540
involved in studying empathy?

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.680
And then, because
this group is very

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.380
curious and
science-minded, I wondered

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.260
if you could speak
about the science that

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.680
has come out about empathy.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.440
JUDITH ORLOFF: The science
behind empathy is fascinating.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.220
It is believed that there's
a spectrum of empathy.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.590
Whereas ordinary empathy,
which is so beautiful--

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.930
it's where you can feel
something for someone else

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.480
as they're going through
it, but you don't actually

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.590
take it on in your own body.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.510
So up higher on the spectrum
are the highly sensitive people

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.640
who have sensitivity to light,
sound, noise, like to be alone,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.040
like to be in nature,
replenish themselves

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.820
by themselves rather
than in crowds of people

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.120
or going to parties.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.730
And then on the high
end, is the empath

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.760
who absorbs energy
from other people

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.890
and is extremely empathic.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.370
And the science behind
it includes mirror neuron

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.800
research, where it's
thought that with people

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.400
with extreme empathy-- the
mirror neurons, the compassion

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.870
neurons of the brain,
are hyperactive.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.890
Where they're just
working overtime,

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.300
where we feel compassion
for everything,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.270
and everybody, and the world.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.080
And it could get to be too much.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.050
But it's thought that the
mirror neurons are really

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.690
working overtime as compared to
a narcissist or a sociopath who

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.180
have empathy deficient
disorder, meaning

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.770
they don't really have
empathy as we know it.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.330
Their mirror neurons are
thought to be hypoactive,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.810
meaning they're not really
functioning at full tilt.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.490
And then there's
the whole phenomena

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.070
of emotional contagion,
which I mentioned.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.740
It's that emotions
can be catchy,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.800
and we are sensitive to
how people are around us.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.970
Their emotions affect us,
even if we're not empaths.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.490
Somebody else's emotions,
if they come into your work

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.130
environment and
they're a drama queen,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.070
or they're a chronic
talker, or they're

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.530
a victim where they
always want to talk

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.720
about themselves and
their victim status,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.580
it brings you down.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.550
If you're an open-hearted
person, if you're open

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.980
and you feel all this,
your energy goes down.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.250
So it's important to
understand emotional contagion.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.550
And also, the concept of
dopamine, where dopamine

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.230
is a pleasure hormone.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.180
And it's thought
that empaths need

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.390
a smaller amount of
dopamine to feel good

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.380
than extroverts who get their
dopamine fix from going out

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.020
with big parties, and big
events, and football games.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.840
You get a large
dopamine hit with that.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.660
But empaths get satisfied
by very little interaction.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.770
For instance, as an empath, I
love one-to-one interactions.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.160
I really enjoy them.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.860
But when it gets to
be a lot of people,

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.930
it gets overwhelming for me.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.450
I love to connect.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.790
And too many people, on a
personal level, is hard for me.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.430
I speak to large groups,
and that's a bit different.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.170
But on a personal
level, I prefer

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.000
to have small gatherings.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.410
And it could be the dopamine
explanation in research,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.810
because I require very little.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.990
I get filled very
easily by happiness.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.650
And I get drained if I stay in
a social situation for too long.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.100
It's too much for me because
I get overstimulated.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.710
And too much is coming in too
fast with sensory overload.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.670
So if you're an empath or
you're a sensitive person,

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.100
it's good to look at
the science behind it.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.790
It's thought, also, the
electromagnetic energy

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.760
from the heart and the
brain gives off information.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.000
And so we're
transmitting information.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.880
And if you're sensitive,
you're an empath,

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.170
you can feel all of this.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.850
But the problem
is, empaths don't

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.300
know how to manage all this.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.600
And I think if you
break down the science

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.740
and you begin to look at the
various aspects of the science,

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.880
it's very useful in terms of
explaining what you're feeling

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.210
and why you're feeling it.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.130
SPEAKER 1: Thank you, Judith.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.140
In relation to
some of the things

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.872
you have talked about
with the science behind it

00:06:40.872 --> 00:06:42.580
and some of the
terminologies that you've

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.810
used with regards to
extroverts and introverts, that

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.350
is a question that Wendy
and I having, read the book,

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.580
had talked a lot about.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.770
Because in the book, it feels
as if you have given your story

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.200
as an introverted empath.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.450
As some of you may know,
I'm extremely extroverted.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.970
So I'm more of an
extrovert empath.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.700
And so could you talk
to us a little bit

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.260
about these differences
in terms of--

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.770
I do love going to parties,
and I do love talking to people

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.320
and being out there.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.840
And that fills me up,
versus if I'm alone,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.940
all the energies
that I've picked up

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.050
tend to make me really
feel just more alone.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.550
I can't get out of the loop.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.867
So can you speak on that?

00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:33.700
JUDITH ORLOFF: Yeah.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.670
There are both
introverted empaths

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.450
and extroverted empaths.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.080
I happen to be introverted.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.090
What are you?

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.750
SPEAKER 2: I am definitely the
introverted type of empath.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.990
JUDITH ORLOFF: And
there is extroverted.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.130
And most empaths
are introverted.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.700
But some are extroverted.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.310
And by introverted, I
mean, I like to be alone.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.500
I'm a writer, and I
like to be in my room

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.740
alone, with my own
energy, just allowing

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.360
the creative flow to happen.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.290
I enjoy that.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.100
That's the epitome of my life
experience, at that moment.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.030
But extroverts, they
tend to go out more.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.030
And I go out, but I
don't go out that much.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.120
And that's OK with me.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.610
I'd rather be in nature.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.110
I'd rather be in quiet, tranquil
environments, or one-to-one.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.180
But you're an
extroverted empath,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.340
so you go out into environments.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.850
But my guess is you need
to decompress afterwards.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.797
Is that-- at some point?

00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:31.380
SPEAKER 1: I think
one of the things--

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.970
I sleep really deeply.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.090
And I have a feeling that part
of the reason that I sleep

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.690
deeply is because I
process it in my sleep

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.870
versus out and
about in the world.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.930
And I just felt that--

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.830
some of the things in the
book talked about some things

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.760
to help an extrovert empath, if
any of you can relate to that,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.110
is going to meetings with other
people who also experience it.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.870
Because then you're
amongst other people.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.890
Because that was
my big thing, is I

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.410
can't function to
take it all in and be

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.581
by myself taking it all in.

00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:13.080
JUDITH ORLOFF: Well,
it just varies.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.140
You might identify with
various levels of this.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.470
And so it just depends
how you process things.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.270
And I just want
everyone to know,

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.970
if you identify with any of
this, you're not neurotic.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.930
You're not crazy.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.740
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.100
It's a sensitivity
level that I believe

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.750
is important to develop.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.030
And certainly in
massage therapy,

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.890
you're feeling what's
going on in other people.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.070
And so the sensitivity is there.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.360
And we need more empathy in
our world today, desperately.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.680
In places like Google to
have empathy for each other,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.110
and to make your work
environment really positive

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.350
and caring, I think,
is a wonderful thing.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.260
And have empathy for
the world and to bring

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.950
that in is something I'm
really passionate about.

00:10:01.097 --> 00:10:02.180
SPEAKER 2: Thanks, Judith.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.200
I feel very privileged
to be in this company

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.340
because there is such a spirit
of inclusion and respect

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.930
for diversity.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:20.330
And I also know that I have
my own characteristics where

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:25.910
I get frustrated or feel
victimized by things

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.320
that happen to me in my day.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.870
And so when I was
reading, I thought,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.680
I wonder sometimes if I'm
also an energy vampire.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.470
Do I flip between
these two things?

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.760
What if I'm the source of
drain for somebody else?

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.900
And how do I reconcile that
with also being an empath?

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.870
Because once I get
through my mood,

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.600
I'm kind of back to myself.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.790
But one of my goals for
this year is meditation.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.760
And I've done a good job and
I feel like it's helping me,

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.660
but I really don't want to
be that to other people.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.760
So how do I work on that?

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.510
And how does an empath
reconcile also sometimes

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.321
being the energy vampire?

00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:14.570
JUDITH ORLOFF: Great question.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.520
That's a very humble
question, actually.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.710
If we can all ask that--

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.530
There's a chapter in the
book on combating narcissists

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.240
and other energy vampires.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.110
And it's important if
you're sensitive to identify

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.840
who are the drainers, especially
in the work environment.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.510
You can have a lot of
different kind of drainers,

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.760
from the drama queen,
to the chronic talker,

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.650
to the narcissist, to the
passive aggressive person.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.590
So there are many kinds
of energy vampires.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.410
And yes, we can all be drainers.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.020
We can all be energy vampires.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.150
So not to think about it as,
oh, them, or him, or her,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.590
but when we get in
to our lower selves

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.830
and we get our buttons are
pushed, and we're triggered,

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.080
and we're tired, and we're
not in our best selves,

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.870
then we can be victims.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.950
Or we can be talkers,
or we can be just people

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.940
who bring others down.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.700
And that's OK.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.960
That's part of being human.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.360
And it's great to
recognize it in yourself.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.910
That's so great that
you asked that question.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.440
And it's wonderful also
because you can catch yourself.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.340
With the awareness,
when you start

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.900
getting into those
energy vampire states,

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.510
you can say, OK.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.300
Or if you're a coworker,
I hope has the freedom

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.620
to point it out.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.830
It's a little touchy subject,
but to say, I love you,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.580
or I respect you so much,
I love working with you,

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.919
but you're complaining
a lot today.

00:12:38.919 --> 00:12:40.460
I don't know if you
have the freedom.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.060
Do you?

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.538
SPEAKER 1: Well, Googlers
tend to be extremely kind.

00:12:51.538 --> 00:12:52.900
JUDITH ORLOFF: Good.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.850
SPEAKER 1: So I'm sure
there are conversations

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.404
like that that are done very--

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:00.570
I don't know what the word--

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:01.444
SPEAKER 2: Tactfully?

00:13:01.444 --> 00:13:02.989
SPEAKER 1: Tactfully, thank you.

00:13:02.989 --> 00:13:04.280
SPEAKER 2: I think that's true.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.090
People here are very
kind and exhibit

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.510
a lot of tolerance and tact.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:15.770
We always need to work on
feeling like we can bring up

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.880
a challenging situation
and discuss it

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.890
in a non-threatening
way with people.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:22.730
JUDITH ORLOFF: Yeah.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.920
I hope that that's the case.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.630
Because somebody who is rolling
with being an energy vampire,

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.980
it can really bring down
the work environment.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.700
So it's really a
toxic influence.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.460
So I feel that that needs to
be addressed, as you said,

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.420
compassionately and lovingly.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.820
Because sometimes we don't know
when we get into those states.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.950
And it could just go
on, and on, and on.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.960
And you don't want that
in a work environment.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.450
You optionally want
positive energy

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.530
in your work environment.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.260
You want it to be easy and
fun so your mind can just

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.950
go to creative places
and really envision

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.230
amazing things for yourself.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.780
And an energy vampire
is important to identify

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.060
because they could
bring it down.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.770
And so to address it not
punitively, but lovingly,

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.260
I hope that there is
a way to do that here

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.680
and to recognize not to
get angry at the person,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.490
but that they need
understanding.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.060
SPEAKER 1: Not to tell somebody
they're an energy vampire,

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.710
basically.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:29.060
So in moving on
with the questions,

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.140
we wanted to ask,
related to that,

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:37.130
a person who may be
not just in a phase

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.410
in that moment as
an energy vampire,

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.090
but that's their personality.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.500
They're full on complete
narcissist or something

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.910
lacking.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:50.660
Neuroplasticity teaches that
our brain's neural circuitry

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.920
is malleable.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.920
And studies have shown that
mindfulness meditation, that

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.050
includes loving kindness
that you talked about,

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.090
can rewire the brain.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.770
So is it possible that
somebody who could possibly

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:09.890
have a full blown on low empath
narcissist trait, personality,

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.970
change with that?

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.720
JUDITH ORLOFF: It's very hard
for narcissists to change.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.620
However, I just want
to say, narcissists

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.960
can be really creative,
and productive,

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.520
and have great ideas,
and be very intuitive.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.600
So they're not all negative
in a work environment.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.292
It's just the problem
comes in personally,

00:15:29.292 --> 00:15:30.500
where you interact with them.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.180
Because they just
think of themselves,

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.270
and they don't really
care about what

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.980
you're feeling because
they lack empathy.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.130
The full blown narcissist,
who are self-absorbed--

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.980
they become cold, withholding,
and punishing when

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.540
you don't do things their way.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.530
So it doesn't make for a
great management style.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.710
It really doesn't.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.600
And so hopefully, there
are not too many here,

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.840
in terms of narcissists, because
it doesn't foster creativity.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.890
It shuts people off.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.740
It makes people feel small,
and damaged, and not heard,

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.700
and not listened to.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.060
And it's so important
if you're sensitive

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.590
and you're an empath--

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.800
you care.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.870
You really care about others.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.660
And you don't want
to be shut off.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.850
But if you do have
narcissists here,

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.180
just take advantage of
all their strengths.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.460
Nobody's all bad.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.400
There's a Buddha and a
demon inside everybody.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.620
It just depends on what we feed.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.590
We want to feed the best
parts of ourselves, the most

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.800
sensitive, the most loving,
the most compassionate.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.860
And then understand that we can
be energy vampires sometimes.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.041
We can go through a bad period.

00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:37.540
So I think with a
narcissist, if you

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.540
look at what they can
give to a work environment

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.220
and not expect them to
be your best friend--

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.460
a lot of patients who come to
me have narcissistic bosses.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.920
And that's really hard,
because you really

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.700
have to frame things in terms of
how it will serve them for them

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.440
to be on your side.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.410
And it's tedious,
ego-stroking, and it's

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.120
hard for sensitive people.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.900
But if you want to have a
vacation, you don't say,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.110
I'm so tired.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.016
I really need a break now.

00:17:05.016 --> 00:17:06.099
They won't give it to you.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:09.250
But if you say, this
will serve the business.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.960
Then, a narcissist
will say, oh, OK.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.710
How?

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.619
And so then it would make more
sense to give you a vacation.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.599
So ideally, you don't
have to do that,

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:20.920
but in case you're ever
faced with it, that's

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.369
one tactic that will work.

00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:27.069
SPEAKER 2: I think that
leads really nicely

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:30.340
into the next part
of our questions,

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.670
which really involve,
how do we work

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.560
with these tendencies
in a workplace?

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.550
What are some
solutions when we're

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:45.400
faced with small personal
space, lots going on,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.900
lots of distractions?

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.730
And then we want to be able
to be as creative as possible

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.260
and work at our highest level.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:04.029
So what can we do as
empaths to foster that?

00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:06.070
JUDITH ORLOFF: One thing
I noticed here at Google

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.390
is the high ceilings.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.990
I mean, that helps to
have a feeling of space.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.675
And it's very beautiful to me.

00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:14.050
I feel like I
could breathe here.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.850
I don't feel claustrophobic.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.500
Everywhere I look
it's high ceilings.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.610
So I'm not-- do you have low
ceilings other places here?

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.020
SPEAKER 2: Not so many, no.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.145
JUDITH ORLOFF: Yeah, so
that helps with the feeling

00:18:25.145 --> 00:18:27.190
of spaciousness.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.160
But in terms of
techniques to use,

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.720
I really suggest meditation.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.350
There's a three
minute meditation

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.200
where you can just check in
with yourself for three minutes.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.890
Close your eyes,
focus on your heart,

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.060
focus on something really
positive in your life,

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:50.410
and breathe out stress,
and focus on the positive.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:54.160
And during those three minutes,
you can recalibrate yourself

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.930
and you could come
back to your center.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.790
Because part of
the skill of being

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.680
an empath in an
environment is learning

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.320
how to come back when
you start to swirl,

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.900
or when somebody pushes your
button and you're triggered,

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.654
or you're disappointed
by something,

00:19:06.654 --> 00:19:09.070
or if something happens in
your personal life and suddenly

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.550
you go down.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.470
To recenter yourself through
this three minute quick

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.560
meditation is a
form of coming back

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.590
to you that a lot of people
don't know how to do that.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.260
Once you swirl, they
just start swirling.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.510
And so learning how to breathe--

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.580
the breath is very powerful.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.720
Because the breath-- you
can breathe out stress,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.710
and you can breathe in
clarity, or calm, peacefulness.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.290
But to breathe out stress,
the breath actually

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:42.140
carries the stress out
of you, out of your body,

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.520
which is what you want.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.880
So these regular
meditation breaks

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.420
I really suggest to
help you feel better,

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.790
and to help you reconnect
with your creativity.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.940
I keep coming back to
that with this audience,

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.490
that creativity is
so important for you

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.370
to be able to
really play up here.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.800
And to play and to
feel comfortable,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.360
you have to be in
a good environment.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.485
And you mentioned that you
have a close environment

00:20:06.485 --> 00:20:08.590
in some places?

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.391
SPEAKER 2: That there are a
lot of people in a small space

00:20:11.391 --> 00:20:11.890
oftentimes.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.860
JUDITH ORLOFF: A lot of
people in a small space.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.294
How much room do you
have between you?

00:20:17.294 --> 00:20:19.460
SPEAKER 2: I'm not the best
person to speak to that,

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.350
because I work in
a spacious place.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.600
JUDITH ORLOFF: That much room?

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.380
OK.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.660
That's not much room.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.666
And so you need to create
your own personal space.

00:20:28.666 --> 00:20:30.040
At least you have
that much room.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.870
It is an open space environment?

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:32.860
OK.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.980
That's particularly challenging
for sensitive people.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.840
And so you have to make your
desk your spiritual station,

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.230
your energy station, however
you can be comfortable there,

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.070
with pictures of people.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.600
I wear the Kuan Yin
around my neck, who's

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.490
the goddess of compassion.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.000
She really sets a
tone of compassion.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.330
Sometimes gemstones are
important to put around

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.690
the desk, or
whatever centers you.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:02.584
It could be anything.

00:21:02.584 --> 00:21:04.250
It doesn't have to
be spiritual objects.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.550
It could be anything
that you love

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:10.960
to create a circle of
safety around your desk,

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.960
like a bubble of
invisibility, if you

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.220
feel like being invisible.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.950
And visualization is
very important for that,

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.810
if you have an open
space environment,

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.690
to visualize a protective
bubble around your environment.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.270
And although you
see other people,

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.660
and you hear them talking,
and they're moving,

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.630
you're in your safe place.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.620
And so what you're doing is
summoning your own inner power

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.740
to create a visualization
for yourself.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.260
You're not helpless
in this environment.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.950
And when you begin
to experience that,

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.420
you'll feel incredible relief.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.810
So then you can focus.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:50.260
When I learned to meditate, I
learned how to do it in a room

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.840
where next door,
it was a Sunday,

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.230
and they were having
prayer meetings with songs.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.240
And so when I was
learning how to meditate,

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.910
I had a lot of external
distractions, which

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.420
was really helpful for me.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.590
I learned how not
to be thrown off.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:09.190
And that's part of this path
of empowering sensitivity,

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.080
is how do you learn
to center yourself

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.240
amidst distraction and chaos.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.200
And so you can look at
it as a fun challenge.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.430
And I don't know--

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.970
can you hear other people
talking next to you?

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.050
You can hear them.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:23.860
All right.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.640
Are you allowed to
wear earbuds here?

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.060
OK, well, sometimes that's
helpful in playing nice music.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.380
So you can use these techniques.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.470
But most important,
energetically, you

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:39.100
want to just focus on your
own energy, your own space,

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.730
your own creativity, and
not on somebody cracking

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.450
their gum next to you.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.700
Us empaths are very
sensitive to that.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.100
Coughing, cracking of gum,
clearing of the throat, all

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.110
that.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:57.620
It's important to focus
on yourself so that you

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.010
can screen out external
distractions so you

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.720
could be in your best place.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.690
SPEAKER 1: So on that note,
talking about the things

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:10.440
that we can do in our
workplace, one thing

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.980
that I have told clients
that I know that they find

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.460
their peace on weekends out
in nature, I've told them,

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.970
go get a picture of that and
put it in your work space

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.395
so that when you're feeling
that overwhelmingness

00:23:24.395 --> 00:23:29.220
and your mind's just racing and
everything's distracting you,

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.820
look at that picture
to calm that down.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.900
And on that note, talking about
the different types of empaths,

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.120
you do speak of
that in your book.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.200
Would you like to go over
a few of those for people?

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.470
Because once you recognize--
this is what I took away from

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.130
the book--

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.890
what type of empath
that you are,

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.540
there's going to
be different tools,

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.370
obviously, that
will work for you

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.164
better than for a
different type of empath.

00:23:56.164 --> 00:23:58.580
JUDITH ORLOFF: Yeah, there are
different types of empaths.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.020
And some empaths are
emotional empaths,

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.420
where you're especially
sensitive to other people's

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.530
emotions.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.450
For instance, if
somebody is angry,

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.780
and they come in to work
angry, you take it on.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.660
Or if somebody is depressed, you
can be sitting next to somebody

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.490
and suddenly your
energy is going down,

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.710
and you're starting to
feel a little depressed.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.500
And you pick up their emotions.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.320
And so empaths are
sensitive to emotions,

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.470
and some are even sensitive
to physical issues, where

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.650
you can pick up-- let's say
your coworker has back pain.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.110
And suddenly, your
back begins to ache.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:35.460
So it's just something to
watch out for in yourself.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.610
And then there is empaths
called intuitive empaths.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.960
And these empaths are very
open to their intuition.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.950
They're really tuned
into intuition.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.060
I personally feel, as a
psychiatrist and an empath,

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.540
that it's so vital to
listen to that inner voice.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.430
And empaths have it a little
bit more open than other people,

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.590
but everybody can connect
to their intuition.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.960
And that's the still
small inner voice

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.370
that comes through gut feelings,
or the enteric nervous system.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.460
In the gut has actual
neurotransmitters

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.350
that convey information
like the brain.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:15.580
So what's going on in your
gut can convey information.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.910
And so as an
intuitive empath, you

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.580
can train yourself to
listen to your gut feelings

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.720
about somebody.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.030
Let's say you're
hiring somebody.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.670
And they look totally
good on paper.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.750
They look amazing.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.850
But when you're sitting
across from them,

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.080
your energy is going down.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.320
What is that telling you?

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.870
It could be that this
isn't a good match

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.820
for your particular environment.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.100
You want to have people who
are energetically harmonious.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.580
And when you hire people and
when you interview people, when

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.410
you're an intuitive empath,
you can develop intuitive

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.160
skills in terms of-- you look
at what they present on paper,

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.320
but you also can feel
what's going on in them.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.980
So you listen to
your gut feeling.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.960
You listen to a hunch.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.890
You listen to an "aha,"
knowing that it can be waves

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.660
of goosebumps that say, yes.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.770
This person is right.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:08.820
This is exciting.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.800
This is going to
be a great match.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.710
Or you can feel a
downward thud, or a wall,

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.210
or something that's unpleasant.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.700
But when you train
yourself as an empath

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.760
and as a human being to
listen to your intuition,

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.800
it can give you
extra information.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.500
And so that's really essential.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.210
But what happens
is sometimes people

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.340
don't listen to their
intuition and they second

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.990
guess themselves.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:37.110
Particularly, in a very
linear environment,

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.060
where you're given
information but something

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.270
doesn't feel right,
I really encourage

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:46.440
you to weigh that in
your relationship choices

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.870
and in how you deal
with your coworkers.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.640
Because it will
tell you, maybe I

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.710
should stay away from
this coworker today.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.110
Maybe they need
a bit more space.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:58.290
And it's a gift to give
them that and to honor that.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.820
They seem to be in
their own world.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.864
They seem to want
to go into a cave.

00:27:01.864 --> 00:27:02.530
All right, fine.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:03.488
I'll give that to them.

00:27:03.488 --> 00:27:06.060
And I won't talk to them
that much, if possible.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.050
So you can really have deep
compassion for your coworkers

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.340
and for others by developing
the skill of intuition

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.670
that many empaths have.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.720
And some of the specific
types-- some empaths are animal

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.520
empaths.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.380
I see there's a doggie in here.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.150
That's so great.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.160
You're allowed to
bring dogs here?

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.240
Oh, that's amazing.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.890
SPEAKER 1: We're
a big dog culture.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.420
JUDITH ORLOFF: You are?

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.990
Empaths have a
communing with animals.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:39.090
With dogs, with cats, with
wild animals, with birds,

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:43.320
some feel a very deep
connection to animals.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.050
And some have a deep
connection to the natural world

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:46.830
and plants.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.980
They love to have plants,
they love to garden.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.030
And some have, as you said, a
connection to their dream life.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.490
Where some empaths are
dreamers and they could

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.700
tune into their dreams to
get guidance in the morning

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.320
by remembering your dreams.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.820
So these are all
intuitive outlets

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.400
that you can really
explore and play

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.000
with as a sensitive
person, as opposed

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.900
to being a disembodied head
who's just a linear person, who

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.230
lives up, from here up.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:21.010
I'm really advocating being
in your mind, and reasoning,

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.400
and in the body, listening
to your intuition

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.750
and your sensitivities.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.530
You can be both.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:31.840
And sometimes, there's a
bias against men doing this.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.090
And I have a Facebook
empath group,

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.340
and it's over 11,000 people.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:41.800
And it may be 85%
women and 15% men.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.154
So it's harder,
sometimes, for men.

00:28:45.154 --> 00:28:46.570
I don't know how
it is-- there are

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:50.470
a lot of men in this
audience, which is fantastic.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.100
If it's harder to
come out and say,

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.630
I'm an intuitive feeling
person, and I'm also

00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:00.490
really intelligent, and smart,
and creative, and grounded--

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:03.280
so to balance everything
for both men and women

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.180
who are empaths.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.180
SPEAKER 2: So there
was one other empath

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.050
that I wanted to ask you about.

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.770
And I'm also looking
at time and want

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.312
to make sure that we
leave some time for people

00:29:16.312 --> 00:29:17.520
who have questions out there.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.557
So you had spoken
about being in nature.

00:29:20.557 --> 00:29:22.140
Actually, I think
it was you, Heather,

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.320
but it came up again
when Judith was speaking.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.290
And you speak about
earthing, or write

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.060
about earthing in your book.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.360
And I often will tell my
clients after their session,

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.930
you may want to take a few
minutes close to the beach,

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.550
or find a patch of grass.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.220
And take your shoes off,
stick your feet in it.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.050
Can you speak to
how that helps us?

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.160
JUDITH ORLOFF: That so
helps us in so many ways.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.940
To get out in nature and take
your shoes off, and go barefoot

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.580
in the grass, or go
barefoot on the ocean,

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.250
just feel yourself,
what that feels like.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.230
And just the freedom,
it often reminds

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.500
you of how you were as a child,
if you had the opportunity

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.420
to be in nature as a child.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.890
And to reclaim that, and
to just go play and feel

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.430
what's coming up, the electron
exchange with the earth--

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.010
I have very strong
feelings about the earth,

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.370
and preserving our
environment, and how

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.830
we connect to our
environment, and how

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.380
our bodies are intimately
connected to the earth.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.180
So of course, we're going to
feel if the earth is harmed.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.200
And so the mission
of helping the earth

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.790
needs to be number
one, above all things,

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.200
as far as I'm concerned.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.710
And it's difficult for
empaths in this day and time

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.290
with the support of the
earth not really being there

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:38.670
in our social environments.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.550
It's just devastating
for me when

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.100
I hear about certain
ravages of the earth.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.150
However, you can
go out and connect.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.196
People aren't trained
to connect to the earth.

00:30:50.196 --> 00:30:52.320
And if you stay in an office
for too long-- or it's

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.400
not actually an office.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.150
It's an open air environment.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.060
But if you stay
closed up too long,

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.340
if you stay at your
computer too long,

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.880
you can get sealed
off from the world.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.080
And you want to connect.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.810
You want to take a break from
the computer and your work,

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:07.500
and go out.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.330
You're so close
to the beach here.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.060
You could take a walk
and go down to the ocean,

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.920
see all the seagulls, and
get into your child again.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.870
I know you're adults,
and you work at Google,

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.080
and you have very
important jobs,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.080
and you really are playing a
role in bettering the world.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.120
But it's good to also let
that down and go and play,

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.660
if you can.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.610
Just go and connect
to the earth.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:33.930
And you could lie on the earth.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.400
You could climb a tree.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.150
You could meditate by a tree.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.860
But to have that playfulness
and not-- empaths

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.390
tend to get overly serious.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.000
And life is short.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.340
So you don't have
as much playfulness

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.070
as you possibly can, to
remind yourself of that.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.060
Because you deserve it.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.970
I kind of live
with the philosophy

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.760
of, this is the day I'm
given, the eternal now.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.040
And I don't know about
tomorrow, necessarily.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.630
I know about today.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:03.036
And I want to make
it the best possible.

00:32:03.036 --> 00:32:05.160
And that isn't just work,
work, work, all the time,

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.930
though I've always
been a workaholic.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.660
I've always loved to work.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.940
When I was a little
girl, my report card--

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.300
the teacher said I need to
take the pressure off myself.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.580
I'm seven years old.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.620
My parents didn't give me that.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.610
I was born that way.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:24.450
And so it's important for
me to find the balance,

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.080
because I could get
lost in my writing,

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:33.780
in patience, and the internet,
going on Google and Googling

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.729
things all the time.

00:32:36.729 --> 00:32:37.520
And so it's impor--

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.770
SPEAKER 1: Don't forget dance.

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:42.670
Dance is a good way, too,
to get the body moving

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.467
so you're in your body.

00:32:45.467 --> 00:32:46.300
JUDITH ORLOFF: Yeah.

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.110
But just moving--
being in the body

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:50.730
is an important way to balance.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:57.180
But I just want to
acknowledge this environment,

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.080
how creative it is,
and what an opportunity

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.982
you have here as
employees of Google

00:33:05.982 --> 00:33:09.210
to really create and
change the world.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:12.510
It feels like changing
the world is here.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:18.680
It just feels so
important to be here.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.630
SPEAKER 2: So you
brought up children.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.640
And I know there's a section
in your book about that.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.460
And I guess part of
changing the world

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.650
is also making sure
that we influence

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.910
our children to be good
human beings as they

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.450
impact the world themselves.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:35.720
JUDITH ORLOFF: Absolutely.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.530
It's so important to support the
sensitivities in our children.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.980
Because they're going
to save the world.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:47.060
They need to be raised in a
way where you look at them

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.500
and you say, you're sensitive.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.730
You're open.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.080
And that's beautiful.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.580
And that's nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.140
And just because
you may not want

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.120
to be on the football
team, and you

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.180
may want to go into the
forest and meditate,

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.150
that makes you
unique and beautiful.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.670
You don't have to
fit these children,

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:07.030
these sensitive children
or Indigo children,

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.800
these new children that have
a certain consciousness coming

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.840
into the world, you
don't want to fit them

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.449
into some arbitrary mold.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:17.550
You want to really help
them and support them.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.280
And a lot of times,
as children, you

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.940
might not have been supported
in your sensitivities

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.199
or intuition.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:25.280
And that hurts.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.139
I know, as an empath child.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:31.469
I had two physician parents
and 25 physicians in my family,

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:35.330
so I came from this long
lineage of scientific thinkers.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:36.770
And I was a feeler.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:37.909
I would feel things.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.020
I would know things.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:43.400
I would process it differently
than a traditionally scientific

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.440
person, although I did
go through medical school

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.070
and I conquered that, to
balance both the intuitive

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.500
and the scientific.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.000
But it wasn't how I was born.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.900
And so I've had to reclaim
that as a psychiatrist

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.590
and as an adult. And that's what
I am inviting you all to do,

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.050
is to be as linear
as you want, to be

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.630
as inventive in your minds.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:09.410
But also, reclaim your
sensitivity, and your openness,

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.260
and your playfulness, and
your connection to the earth.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.110
We can be everything.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.450
SPEAKER 2: I love that.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.994
Shall we--

00:35:17.994 --> 00:35:18.660
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.460
SPEAKER 2: --pass
around the ball?

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.070
SPEAKER 1: So we do have
about 10 minutes or so,

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.450
if people have questions.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.390
Just go ahead and
raise your hand,

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.490
and we'll be glad to throw you--

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.702
SPEAKER 2: Are you
good at catching?

00:35:31.702 --> 00:35:32.410
I'm not, usually.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.860
JUDITH ORLOFF: Even
that's so creative.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:42.580
She threw the mic in a
little box over to him.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.382
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:44.382 --> 00:35:45.090
I had a question.

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.630
I noticed in your bio it
mentioned energy awareness.

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:51.727
And through my process,
understanding the human energy

00:35:51.727 --> 00:35:54.060
system and how to work with
it, has been really valuable

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.780
for me.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.220
I did it through Medical Qigong.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.700
I'm just curious what kind of
energy awareness techniques

00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:58.820
you used.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.580
JUDITH ORLOFF: Hold that
up, please, a little bit.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.080
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious what kind

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.080
of energy awareness techniques
you use in your practice.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.830
JUDITH ORLOFF: Can you
repeat that for me?

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:10.340
SPEAKER 1: So he wanted to know
what kind of energy awareness

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.340
techniques that Judith
uses in her practice.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.362
And he found it through,
I'm sorry, was it Qigong?

00:36:17.362 --> 00:36:18.320
AUDIENCE: Qigong, yeah.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.870
SPEAKER 1: Qigong.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:22.730
JUDITH ORLOFF: Qigong
is a wonderful way

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:23.690
to center your energy.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.420
It's a movement where
you center your energy,

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.900
and you feel the universal
energies in your body.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.785
And that's a beautiful
energy technique.

00:36:32.785 --> 00:36:35.870
You could even do
Qigong here, to go out

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:40.220
somewhere and practice here,
and just do a few movements.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.980
What I use in my
practice is that I

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.500
teach people to meditate.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.960
And I also work on
them energetically,

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.930
where I put my hands over
their various chakras

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:55.907
to balance it, and teach
them to open up their hearts.

00:36:55.907 --> 00:36:56.990
SPEAKER 1: Shameless plug.

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:02.690
We offer Tai chi, which has
Qigong elements in it, weekly.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.800
SPEAKER 2: One way or another.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.216
JUDITH ORLOFF: One
way or another.

00:37:08.216 --> 00:37:11.600
SPEAKER 1: So I brought
an instructor weekly,

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.280
and you can join us at the
LAX Tai chi group in emails.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.900
And it's Mondays
from 4:30 to 5:30.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.390
There is a cost because I've
brought in the instructor,

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.520
but we meet over in
the Bin 5 courtyard,

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.730
or inside the bunker
when it's cold.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.580
JUDITH ORLOFF: That's fantastic.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:36.150
AUDIENCE: A lot of people
who are not empathic--

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:39.150
they might be kind, they
might be changing the world,

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:42.900
they might not be
necessarily narcissistic.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.640
Is there some tool, some
kind of Myers-Briggs

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.000
personality test so
that they recognize

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.569
that they're not empathic?

00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:54.360
JUDITH ORLOFF: Yes.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:58.170
AUDIENCE: And if there is one,
then what do we do with it?

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:02.100
What's we know that a
person is not empathic, what

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.770
other actions, apart
from meditation,

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:09.180
can a person take
to develop that?

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.550
JUDITH ORLOFF: That's
a great question.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.430
How do you identify it
somebody doesn't have empathy?

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.210
And then how do
you deal with it?

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:17.760
OK.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.640
The best way is to
provoke a small conflict.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.110
Because if you
provoke a conflict,

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:25.300
you can see how
they deal with it.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.686
If they have-- why
are you laughing?

00:38:29.686 --> 00:38:30.810
SPEAKER 2: I hate conflict.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.250
JUDITH ORLOFF:
You hate conflict.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.962
SPEAKER 2: So now I'm
going to creed that that

00:38:33.962 --> 00:38:35.180
would be really hard for me.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.950
JUDITH ORLOFF: Well,
a little conflict.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.481
They say, let's
meet today at 10:00.

00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:42.230
And you say, well, I
can't do it at 10:00,

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:43.560
but I'll do it at 11:00.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.350
Even just a little
thing like that,

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:48.210
somebody who
doesn't have empathy

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:51.000
is going to become cold,
withholding, judgmental,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.660
punishing, and change
their very nice personality

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.340
into a different one.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:00.270
And so narcissists
who don't have empathy

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:04.110
don't like it when you
don't do things their way.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.430
Have you met people like that?

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.310
AUDIENCE: No, I just meant
to say that maybe there's

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.830
another classification out
there, which is basically

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:12.505
kind people, not narcissists.

00:39:12.505 --> 00:39:13.630
JUDITH ORLOFF: Kind people.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:15.660
AUDIENCE: But they
are not empathic.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.290
They don't have
that mirror neurons.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.960
They do not understand
what are you going through,

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.380
so they cannot relate
to you in general.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.520
They are sympathetic,
but not empathic.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.520
JUDITH ORLOFF: They're
very kind people, though.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.270
Not narcissists.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:31.559
AUDIENCE: But they are not--

00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:33.600
they cannot understand
what you're going through,

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.090
your emotional state.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:39.450
Let's say you come in,
and you look very sad.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:40.730
And you don't want to work.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:42.480
Let's say it's a manager
or somebody else.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.240
But he doesn't recognize that.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.990
And you're thinking, why
does he not recognize that?

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.690
So they lack empathy.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:52.549
They don't know that they're
trampling over somebody.

00:39:52.549 --> 00:39:53.340
JUDITH ORLOFF: Yes.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.340
Let me make the distinction of
lacking empathy versus someone

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.050
just being in their heads.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.174
Because sometimes,
people are self-absorbed

00:40:00.174 --> 00:40:01.590
or in their heads,
and they're not

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:03.274
tuning in emotionally to you.

00:40:03.274 --> 00:40:04.690
AUDIENCE: And
that's what happens.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.150
JUDITH ORLOFF: But that
doesn't necessarily

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:07.390
make them a narcissist.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:09.360
And they could be
the kindest person,

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.130
but they can also be out of
touch with their feelings.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:14.670
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:17.172
I see a lot of
people, in general,

00:40:17.172 --> 00:40:19.380
are very kind, sympathetic,
want to change the world.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.330
But when it comes to
personal relationship,

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:25.560
because they are
very smart in brains,

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.420
they don't tune in to
their empathic centers,

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.960
or they do not have
developed empathetic center.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.659
They just relate to your brain.

00:40:32.659 --> 00:40:33.450
JUDITH ORLOFF: Yes.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:35.010
Yes, but they're kind people.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:36.260
AUDIENCE: They're kind people.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.680
They don't want to harm anybody.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.010
But they do not
understand their actions

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:44.164
affect other human beings.

00:40:44.164 --> 00:40:46.080
JUDITH ORLOFF: Do you
find that that's common?

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:46.820
AUDIENCE: That's common.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:47.570
JUDITH ORLOFF: Really?

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:48.250
OK, well that--

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.630
AUDIENCE: They are not
narcissists, necessarily.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.270
JUDITH ORLOFF: Right, right.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.090
That leaves an opening
on emotional training

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.940
and intuitive training
for people here.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.620
It's something that's
really important

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.350
to train in a safe environment.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.740
And if that's the
case, a lot of times

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.200
it's something to think about.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.680
But in terms of your
expectations of them,

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.309
you could come in
with a broken heart

00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:10.600
and they probably won't see it.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.570
It happens.

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:14.962
JUDITH ORLOFF: And to
not take that personally.

00:41:14.962 --> 00:41:16.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I understand.

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:18.380
But is there a way--

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.220
I was thinking
more in terms of--

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.910
in Myers-Briggs test, you
go take an online test,

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:26.490
and it tells you
what letters you are,

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.830
ENTP, ISTP, whichever
might be the case.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:31.710
So it there an online
test I can go and say,

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:32.970
hey, you're not empathic.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:37.360
Your empathy is out
of 1 to 100, 30 or 20.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.080
So that we know, and we
can say to each other,

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.880
oh, we are 20, 100.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.882
So we know each other
in some objective way.

00:41:45.882 --> 00:41:47.340
JUDITH ORLOFF: In
an objective way.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:48.390
That would be in--

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.370
and you would want to
pass that around and have

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:51.260
everyone take it?

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:51.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.269
That would be the
Google way of doing it.

00:41:55.269 --> 00:41:56.310
JUDITH ORLOFF: All right.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.620
Well, there's certainly
a self-assessment test

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.800
at the beginning of this
book with 20 questions

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.450
that people can take,
and determine where

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:06.240
they are on the empathy scale.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.850
But there could be other
ways to do it, too,

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:13.080
in terms of creating more
formal tests and scores.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.510
But that's a good idea.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.250
But I think the goal
would be, really,

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.680
to help people recognize.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.850
AUDIENCE: Recognize, right.

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:22.725
JUDITH ORLOFF: Yeah,
because the more empathy

00:42:22.725 --> 00:42:24.870
you have, the better
your work environment

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.040
is going to be because
you're going to feel safe.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.230
You don't want to ooze it.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.300
You don't overdo it.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:35.214
Sometimes empaths can help too
much and they give too much.

00:42:35.214 --> 00:42:36.630
They want to be
too compassionate.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.713
And they're looking at you
in the eyes too deeply,

00:42:38.713 --> 00:42:41.200
so it feels intrusive.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.030
That kind of thing.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:43.560
You don't want to become that.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.860
But you want to become
smart, intuitive, caring,

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:47.940
and blend it all.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.352
And that takes some training,
sometimes, to do it.

00:42:50.352 --> 00:42:51.810
And hopefully, the
book will do it.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:53.002
But trainings can help.

00:42:53.002 --> 00:42:54.710
AUDIENCE: But first,
if you recognize it,

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.570
at least you can know that this
person's at least like that.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:58.190
It's OK.

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.207
We can be inclusive.

00:42:59.207 --> 00:43:00.290
JUDITH ORLOFF: Absolutely.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:03.110
But also, to recognize
that being a good person

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.310
is the best thing
anyone could do.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:09.710
And even though they might
lack other abilities,

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:14.290
if you're a good person, that's
a beautiful, beautiful thing.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:15.040
It really is.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.540
So to recognize that in each
other, and to affirm that--

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.840
namaste, I respect
the spirit within you.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.580
To be able to say
that to each other,

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.680
even with all your faults--

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.480
We have tons of
faults, all of us.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.870
We're not perfect.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:34.420
But if we do the best we
can and we're loving people,

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.910
give people credit
where credit is due.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:38.740
And when you can
affirm that in others,

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.750
the whole environment
in the work environment

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:44.410
can just increase the vibration,
increase the frequency,

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.450
when you do that, as
opposed to looking at all

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:48.170
the negatives in someone.

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:51.310
It's much easier to look at the
negatives and criticize them

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:52.630
and what they're doing wrong.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.760
But the shift in
consciousness in terms

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.950
of awareness of
empathy is trying

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.010
to see the best in
people, not their worst.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.800
You want to bring out
the best in people.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.870
AUDIENCE: When we
talk about empathy,

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:08.020
normally we talk about
social with other people.

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.220
So I have a separate
question, a little different.

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.500
Here, I'm engineer.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.490
I think a lot of other
engineers, and even Judith,

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:21.670
yourself, you said
you like to work,

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:23.440
like writing, by yourself.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:27.400
Sometimes I feel the stress,
actually from the work,

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.660
not with interacting
with other people.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.520
When you have
something difficult,

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:37.040
something you don't
understand for a while,

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.260
especially later of
the day, you tired,

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:46.510
or your cognitive
capability tends to be down.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:49.770
And in my personal experience,
sometimes in that situation,

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.570
I start to have self-doubt.

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:56.250
And it's become a
downward spiral.

00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:02.230
And that negative energy
I can bring with me home,

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:04.540
even though I'm
already out of work.

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.310
I still think about it.

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:11.350
But maybe after a night, the
next day, I look at it again.

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:12.880
I can figure it out.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.740
It seems so simple.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:19.310
So what can you suggest
to do to prevent just

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:23.770
to bring the negative
frustration out of work

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:29.060
when you want to not think
about it at that time?

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.560
JUDITH ORLOFF: A
very good question.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:34.300
How do you not take
the work energy home?

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.317
And you mentioned self-doubt?

00:45:36.317 --> 00:45:36.900
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.990
JUDITH ORLOFF: Did you
mention self-doubt?

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because
I can't figure this out.

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.252
Maybe I was not good enough.

00:45:43.252 --> 00:45:44.710
JUDITH ORLOFF: All
right, well, I'm

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:47.260
a big believer in affirmations.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.070
And so it's important
to really affirm,

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.510
every day, what you did well.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.150
And at the end of the day, you
can make that a ritual, to just

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:56.620
say, what did I do well today?

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:57.650
What did I contribute?

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:59.080
And it could be
the tiniest thing.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.130
It could be a big thing.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.240
It doesn't matter.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.210
But instead of--
the self-doubt, when

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:07.300
I talk about the demon
and the Buddha inside,

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.360
the self-doubt comes
from more the demon side,

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.660
where you have to work with it.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.990
Everybody has self-doubt.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:15.910
We all have self-doubt.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:17.020
When you affirm--

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:19.240
I did this well today.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.220
I did that well today.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.810
I was breathing today.

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:23.830
I was walking today.

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:24.680
I came to work.

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.260
I had a day of life.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:30.880
Really, you could always get
back to that, to affirm that.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.250
And also to have a
closure meditation when

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.470
you are ready to leave work--

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:37.840
to actually sit,
close your eyes,

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.050
breathe, center
yourself, say thank you

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:42.830
for this opportunity
of work today.

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:44.290
And now I'm leaving.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:49.630
And so to have an official
ritual of closure, and to let

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:51.970
go of what happened at work.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:53.980
And that will help you.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.530
When I've finished
with my patients,

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:58.930
usually I forget about it.

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.150
I go on to the next
thing, unless there's

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:04.090
something in particular
that I need to think

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:05.560
about a little bit more.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.490
But I go on.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.810
I'm 100% present
when I'm working.

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.140
Like with here,
I'm 100% present.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:14.670
But when I go on, I want
to grab the next moments

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:16.600
and inhabit the next moment.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.730
So it's good, as a
sensitive person,

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:22.524
to be present in the moment,
and then keep moving.

00:47:22.524 --> 00:47:23.440
It's like the warrior.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.490
You make your yell,
and then you move.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:27.550
And that's it.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:31.450
And so that's important to think
about, to be in the moment.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:33.490
And how do you be in the moment?

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:34.750
You can have a mantra, even.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:36.290
Let it be.

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:38.590
I'm being in the now.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.720
And to bring your
mind back-- because we

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.230
have control over our thoughts,
our attitudes, and our mind.

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:46.000
And so when we go
into self-doubt,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.320
you go, ah, self-doubt.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.640
I know you.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.450
Instead, I am going to breathe,
I'm going to focus on my heart,

00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:54.930
and I'm going to look
at what I did well.

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:57.400
And let's say I need
improvement in something.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.710
I will work on that.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.540
We all are constantly
works in progress.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.670
And so to have a
lot of compassion

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:07.490
for yourself every day,
and what you go through--

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.890
we all go through so much.

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:15.290
As a psychiatrist, I know well
how much we all go through.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:17.690
And so just give people a break.

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:19.100
See the best in them.

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.910
And try and be empathic
for what they go through,

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:26.780
even if it's not something,
maybe, you can relate to.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:30.260
But if you're empathic
and your heart goes out,

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.490
that's a good thing.

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.140
It's really a beautiful
thing to relate

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.272
to one another in that way.

00:48:35.272 --> 00:48:37.150
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:39.130
Along those same
lines, I find what's

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:42.880
really emotional draining for
me is being constantly connected

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.210
via my phone or social
media, things like that.

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:48.460
Do you find that it's
important, especially

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:51.610
for sensitive people, to have
that time to disconnect, maybe

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.190
have a day without their phone?

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:56.184
Is there tips and tools
that you'd recommend?

00:48:56.184 --> 00:48:58.600
JUDITH ORLOFF: I think it's
important to have a technology

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:04.540
fast, and not go on social
media, and turn off your phone,

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:08.230
and leave your phone at home,
and go for a walk on the beach

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:11.440
so that you're not
tethered to the phone.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.690
Even in the gym,
sometimes I bring my phone

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:18.400
and I put it on the treadmill,
and I have to talk to myself.

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.210
Just leave it in the locker.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:21.340
Don't bring it.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.520
Your world can exist for
a short period of time

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.870
without that phone.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:28.410
But it's very
addictive technology.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:32.770
So you have to really make that
extra effort to say no to it.

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.720
And it makes me feel
so much better when

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.510
I'm not near anything.

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:41.035
There's a monastery that we
go to sometimes in retreat,

00:49:41.035 --> 00:49:42.880
Tassajara Monastery.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.290
They don't even
have electricity.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:46.990
They have no cell phone covers.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.130
They have no electricity.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:49.600
Kerosene lamps.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:53.520
So you're forced into
a beautiful retreat

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.100
without technology.

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.850
So I think that makes you
better when you come to work,

00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:59.490
when you have those breaks.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:02.320
Because if you keep checking,
and checking, and checking,

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.170
it puts you in a
zombie-like state.

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:07.120
And that's not in the body.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.940
And so to put it down a
little bit and go dance--

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.840
I think dancing, what you
mentioned, or movement,

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:17.080
any kind of movement,
the Qigong movement,

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.800
dancing, walking,
exercising, looking up

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.170
at the stars and the sun,
it's just replenishing.

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:27.610
It's very important
without technology.

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:29.800
SPEAKER 1: I just want
to add one thing on that,

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.840
is when we talked
about the children

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:35.650
and what we're teaching our
kids that are our future,

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:39.040
is we're teaching them
this importance of how

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.720
much our phones are.

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.160
And they will say, what do
you mean you lost your phone?

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.890
What are you going to do?

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:50.620
Even they, as young as five, are
picking up on our attachments

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.390
to our phones.

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.130
SPEAKER 2: I had my
daughter very worried

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:56.350
one night because my
husband went out for a walk

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.210
and didn't have his phone.

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:00.790
And I thought, oh, this is--

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:03.720
A Day Without a Phone, I
think it's a new G to G class.

00:51:06.412 --> 00:51:08.620
JUDITH ORLOFF: And thank
you both, Heather and Wendy,

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:10.030
for having me here.

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.905
And thank you all for coming.

00:51:12.905 --> 00:51:13.780
SPEAKER 2: Thank you.

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.900
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you all for coming.
