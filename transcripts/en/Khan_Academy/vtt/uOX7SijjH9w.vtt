00:00:01.054 --> 00:00:01.887
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

00:00:01.887 --> 00:00:02.979
So now that we have an intuition

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:05.044
for what divergence is
trying to represent,

00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:07.454
let's start actually
drilling in on a formula.

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:08.713
The first thing I want to do

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:11.665
is just limit our perspective to functions

00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:13.927
that only have an X component, or rather,

00:00:13.927 --> 00:00:18.010
where the Y component of
the output is just zero.

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:21.004
So this is some kind of vector field

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:22.341
and if there's only an X component

00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:23.838
what this means it's going to look like

00:00:23.838 --> 00:00:26.294
is all of the vectors
only go left or right,

00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:30.595
and there's kind of no up or
down involved in any of them.

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:32.935
So in this case, let's
start thinking about what

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:35.800
positive divergence of your vector fields

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
might look like near some point X-Y.

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:41.323
So if you have your point,

00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:44.847
this is that point X-Y sitting
off somewhere in space,

00:00:44.847 --> 00:00:48.159
two cases where the divergence
of this might look positive

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.052
are, one, where nothing
happens at the point.

00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:55.219
So in this case P would be
equal to zero at our point.

00:00:56.182 --> 00:00:59.095
But then to left of it things
are moving to the left,

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:02.773
meaning P, the X component of
our vector valued function,

00:01:02.773 --> 00:01:03.773
is negative.

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:07.863
That's why the X component
of this vector is negative.

00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:10.148
But then to the right,

00:01:10.148 --> 00:01:11.982
vectors would be moving off to the right.

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:14.679
So over here, P would be positive.

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:16.682
So this would be an example of a

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:18.432
positive divergence circumstance

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:20.922
where only the X component is responsible.

00:01:20.922 --> 00:01:21.755
And what you'll notice here,

00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:23.290
this would be P starts negative,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.515
goes zero, then becomes positive.

00:01:25.515 --> 00:01:27.669
So as you're changing in the X direction,

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:29.591
P should be increasing.

00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:33.655
So a positive divergence
here seems to correspond to

00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:37.988
a positive partial derivative
of P with respect to X.

00:01:37.988 --> 00:01:39.363
And if that seems a little unfamiliar,

00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:41.746
if you're not sure how to
think about partial derivatives

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:44.563
of a component of a vector field,

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.904
I have a video on that
and you can take a look

00:01:46.904 --> 00:01:48.735
and refresh yourself, how
you might think about this

00:01:48.735 --> 00:01:51.011
partial derivative of P with respect to X.

00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:52.436
And once you do, hopefully it makes sense

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:55.078
why this specific positive
divergence example

00:01:55.078 --> 00:01:58.515
corresponds with the positive
partial derivative of P.

00:01:58.515 --> 00:01:59.646
But remember, this isn't the only way

00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:01.184
that a positive divergence might look.

00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:05.351
You're gonna have another
circumstance where, let's say,

00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:09.731
your point, X-Y,

00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:11.208
actually has a vector attached to it.

00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:14.875
So this here again
represents our point X-Y.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.794
And in this specific example
this would be P is positive.

00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:22.223
P of X-Y is positive at your point there.

00:02:22.223 --> 00:02:24.452
But another way that positive
divergence might look

00:02:24.452 --> 00:02:27.433
is that you have things
coming in towards that point

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:30.034
and things going away,
but the things going away

00:02:30.034 --> 00:02:31.729
are bigger than the ones coming in.

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.189
But again, this exhibits the
idea of P increasing in value.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.434
P starts off small, it's a
positive but small component,

00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:40.822
and then it gets bigger and
then it gets even bigger.

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:42.944
So once again we have this idea of

00:02:42.944 --> 00:02:45.661
positive partial derivative
of P with respect to X,

00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:47.054
because changes in X,

00:02:47.054 --> 00:02:49.443
as you increase X it
causes an increase in P,

00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:52.066
seems to correspond to
positive divergence.

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:54.226
And you can even look at
it if you go the other way

00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:58.336
where you have a little bit of
negative component to P here.

00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.495
So P is a little bit negative,

00:03:00.495 --> 00:03:03.375
but to the left of your
point it's really negative,

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:06.207
and then to the right it's
not nearly as negative.

00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:07.670
And in this case it's kind of like

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.364
as you're moving to the
right, as X is increasing,

00:03:10.364 --> 00:03:12.105
you start off very negative,

00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:13.490
and then only kind of negative,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.054
and then barely negative.

00:03:15.054 --> 00:03:17.341
And once again that
corresponds to an increase

00:03:17.341 --> 00:03:20.491
in the value of P as X increases.

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.501
So what you'd expect is that
a partial derivative of P,

00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:26.684
that X component of the
output, with respect to X,

00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:28.785
is gonna be somewhere
involved in the formula

00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:33.000
for the divergence of our
vector field at a point X-Y.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.420
In the next video I'm gonna
go a similar line of reasoning

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.846
to see what should go on
with that Y component.
