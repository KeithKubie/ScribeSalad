00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.054
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.054 --> 00:00:01.887
Hello, Rosie.

00:00:01.887 --> 00:00:02.909
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.991
- [Voiceover] So, today
we're gonna be talking about

00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:07.788
subject, direct object,
and indirect object,

00:00:07.788 --> 00:00:10.418
and identifying those within a sentence,

00:00:10.418 --> 00:00:12.008
but first, I suppose we should figure out

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:13.131
what those things are.

00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:14.735
So, we've talked about
what subjects are before,

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:16.440
but let's review it again really quickly.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.727
So, a subject is a noun or a pronoun

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:22.490
that performs the verb in a sentence.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.419
So, in the sentence,

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.033
Chris ate cereal,

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:27.123
Chris is the subject,

00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:29.329
because Chris is the noun or pronoun

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.546
that is performing the verb, ate.

00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:34.618
Rosie, what is a direct object?

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:36.673
- [Voiceover] So, a direct object is

00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:40.583
the main thing in the sentence that is

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:42.349
being acted upon,

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:45.125
so in this sentence, Chris ate cereal,

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:47.472
cereal would be the direct object,

00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:49.185
because it's the thing

00:00:49.185 --> 00:00:51.238
being acted upon, it's being eaten.

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:53.551
- [Voiceover] So, every
sentence has to have a subject,

00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:55.739
so subject is critical,

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.489
but direct objects and
indirect objects less so.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.876
- [Voiceover] Right.
- [Voiceover] So, you know,

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:02.047
as a sentence, we could just
have "Chris ate", right?

00:01:02.047 --> 00:01:02.880
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.362
- [Voiceover] But if we want
to bring in this direct object,

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:06.660
we can say Chris ate cereal.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.574
So, who's doing the eating?

00:01:08.574 --> 00:01:09.407
Chris.

00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:11.461
What is the thing that was eaten?

00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:12.294
Cereal.

00:01:12.294 --> 00:01:15.350
So, this seems like it would cover

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.482
most interactions between
objects and people,

00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:21.770
but then we have this other
thing, indirect object.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.078
What's that about?

00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:27.001
- [Voiceover] So, an
indirect object is often...

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.188
It's kind of signifying
a recipient of something,

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:32.928
so it's like another thing in a sentence

00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:35.098
that might be acted upon.

00:01:35.098 --> 00:01:36.207
- [Voiceover] So, let's
see if we can come up

00:01:36.207 --> 00:01:38.999
with some examples for that,

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.064
cause we have this direct object,

00:01:40.064 --> 00:01:41.842
which is this thing being acted upon,

00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:44.675
and then the indirect object
is also being acted upon,

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:48.555
but it's being acted upon
in, like, a giving way?

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:50.290
Let's see if we can figure this out.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.167
Alright, so we have this
sentence, straightforward,

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:53.815
Althea threw a frisbee.

00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:55.506
So, we've got subject here,

00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:57.194
and we've got direct object here.

00:01:57.194 --> 00:01:58.292
Who's doing the throwing?

00:01:58.292 --> 00:01:59.125
Althea.

00:01:59.125 --> 00:01:59.984
What did she throw?

00:01:59.984 --> 00:02:00.817
A frisbee.

00:02:00.817 --> 00:02:02.882
But, what if we have the sentence

00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:05.842
Althea threw me a frisbee?

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:08.020
Well, we know from context,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.118
because we have the word frisbee in here,

00:02:10.118 --> 00:02:13.078
that Althea is not
hurling me, bodily, right?

00:02:13.078 --> 00:02:15.762
She's not chucking me across
a field for a dog to catch.

00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:17.741
But we do know that the
subject of the sentence

00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:20.441
is Althea, and we know
that the direct object

00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:23.074
of the sentence is frisbee,

00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:24.514
but where is that frisbee going?

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:26.090
Well, it's going to me.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.745
Okay, so we've got this,
is the direct object,

00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:30.517
this is the subject,

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:33.028
and this is the indirect object.

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:35.844
So, the pronoun, me,

00:02:35.844 --> 00:02:39.440
is the recipient of the
direct object, the frisbee.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.925
Rosie, would you read me
this sentence, please?

00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:44.438
- [Voiceover] Wanda
gave Louie a gift card.

00:02:44.438 --> 00:02:45.817
- [Voiceover] That's very nice of her.

00:02:45.817 --> 00:02:46.650
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.415
- [Voiceover] Okay, so,
walk me through this, then.

00:02:49.415 --> 00:02:51.066
What is going on in this sentence?

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:52.083
What are the relationships

00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:54.321
between the components of this sentence?

00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:55.154
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:56.498
So, we have two people,

00:02:56.498 --> 00:02:59.441
and the first person listed is
the subject of the sentence,

00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:01.456
because she's doing an action.

00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:02.605
- [Voiceover] Right,
she's doing the giving.

00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:03.794
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:03.794 --> 00:03:06.801
Then we have the direct
object, which is a gift card.

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:08.971
- [Voiceover] Okay, that's
the object that she gave.

00:03:08.971 --> 00:03:10.625
- [Voiceover] Yeah, that's
something she's giving.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:14.385
She has a direct relationship
with that, but she...

00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:18.384
The gift card has a
recipient, and that's Louie,

00:03:18.384 --> 00:03:20.338
and he's the indirect object.

00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:21.374
- [Voiceover] I think
another way to identify

00:03:21.374 --> 00:03:23.768
whether or not a word is the
indirect object in a sentence

00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:25.724
is to see if you can pull it out

00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:28.031
and stick it on the end of the sentence,

00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:30.057
as it currently stands,
with a preposition,

00:03:30.057 --> 00:03:32.724
and see if it still makes sense.

00:03:33.754 --> 00:03:36.946
In this case, to Louie is
no longer what we would

00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:39.807
traditionally consider an indirect object.

00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:41.140
So, if we've got

00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:43.757
Wanda gave a gift card to Louie,

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:47.228
Wanda is the subject, gift
card is the direct object,

00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:48.811
and then we can see

00:03:49.976 --> 00:03:53.991
to Louie is now this
adverbial prepositional phrase

00:03:53.991 --> 00:03:55.842
that modifies gave.

00:03:55.842 --> 00:03:58.378
It's the manner in which
she gave it to Louie,

00:03:58.378 --> 00:03:59.889
and if we switched it out,

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.896
if we said Wanda gave Louie to gift card,

00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:05.919
that doesn't make sense at all.

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.280
So, to review, the subject is the noun

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.454
or pronoun that performs
a verb in a sentence.

00:04:11.454 --> 00:04:12.754
- [Voiceover] The direct object

00:04:12.754 --> 00:04:14.471
is the thing that's acted upon.

00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:15.802
- [Voiceover] And the indirect object is

00:04:15.802 --> 00:04:18.433
the recipient of that direct object,

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:21.472
it's the thing that
gets the direct object.

00:04:21.472 --> 00:04:24.527
In the case of Althea threw me a frisbee,

00:04:24.527 --> 00:04:27.417
the pronoun me is the indirect object.

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:29.958
In the case of Wanda
gave Louie a gift card,

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.781
Louie is the indirect object.

00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:34.773
He gets the gift card, I get the frisbee.

00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:35.606
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:36.537
- [Voiceover] But, as subjects,

00:04:36.537 --> 00:04:38.134
direct object, and indirect objects,

00:04:38.134 --> 00:04:39.311
you can learn anything.

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:40.144
David out.

00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:42.144
- [Voiceover] Rosie out.
