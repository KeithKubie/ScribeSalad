00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.829
Another key resource are people.

00:00:02.829 --> 00:00:05.769
We sometimes use the fancy word of human resources or HR

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.609
and I kind of think of people in a start up as two separate categories.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.969
One is finding qualified employees. The other is for you to find them.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.729
How do you find mentors or teachers or coaches or advisers for you.

00:00:18.729 --> 00:00:20.799
What's the difference between all of these?

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:22.909
Well let me start with the last first.

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:28.088
Mentors, teachers, and coaches advance your personal career.

00:00:28.088 --> 00:00:32.639
If you want to learn a specific subject you find a teacher

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:39.639
but if you want to hone specific skills or reach an exact goal, I suggest you hire a coach.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:44.569
That is a specific subject as a teacher, specific skills as a coach.

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:48.539
So for example if you want to learn something more about ??? architectures,

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.698
You can bring in a teacher or take a class

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:54.699
but if you want to hone specific skills like how to create great presentation

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.419
or how to manage people, you hire a coach but the one that sometimes founders forget

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:04.679
is that you want to get smarter, better over your career.

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:08.689
You want to find someone who cares enough about you to be a mentor.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.499
Mentors are very different from teachers and coaches.

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:15.690
Mentors are actually a two way street.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.479
The only people who tend to want to help you are those who personally think

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.729
they could actually learn something from you and then they simply liking you.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.788
So most of you in your career would have to go on to be mentors

00:01:26.788 --> 00:01:30.949
but think about the type of people who you've encountered in your career.

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:36.778
Implicitly you have been giving something to them while they have been giving something to you.

00:01:36.778 --> 00:01:40.579
The last category in mentors, coaches, teachers are advisers.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.589
Now advisers are people you need to help advance your company success.

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:50.919
Mentors, teachers, and coaches know about your personal success as a founder

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:54.728
but advisers really kind of bring generic advise.

00:01:54.728 --> 00:01:58.579
Sometimes to you but also to your VPs and your staff etc.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.529
So what you want to have is experienced advise

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:05.488
to help you figure out whether your vision is a hallucination

00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:10.779
but getting specific you want to put together as early as possible an advise report

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:18.739
and that's really the idea of expanding your circle of accumulated wisdom as just your investment.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:26.800
A mistake that founders make the first time is thinking that ??? or ??? investors ???.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.619
Yes they are your advisers but they are also your boss

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:34.679
and so you want to be very careful about limiting your advise to just that circle

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:38.759
and they may not have this specific domain expertise you need.

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.677
So make sure you're expanding your series of advisers available to your company

00:02:42.677 --> 00:02:47.716
and typically that's done by offering them a small percentage of equity

00:02:47.716 --> 99:59:59.000
in exchange for some of their time.
