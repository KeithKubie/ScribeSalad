00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to teach you about another tag--this one is called the "em" tag.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It stands for "emphasis", and it makes things italic.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It looks like this:

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you've got the opening em tag, contents--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then the closing em tag, with a slash.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Same structure as the tag, nothing too complex here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's try it out in a browser, really quick.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Okay--so here we are in our browser again.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's make the word "learn" italicized.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So all I do is I put an opening tag,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and then I put a closing tag--and I hit Update.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And that took the word "learn" and made it italicized.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What I'd like you to do is

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
take the whole phrase below and make it italic.
