00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.240
MATT PARKER: Today I'm gonna show you a... amazing number,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.880
and some of you may have come across this before.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.140
It's an absolute classic, but I still think there's a lot to be said about the number

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.640
9609393...

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.420
...four, nine --this is where it gets quite interesting actually,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.700
'cause it goes nine, eight, two...

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.660
...three, eight, zero, nine, six, --you'll notice, actually, this is one of the more boring parts of the number--

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.900
seven, six, zero...

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.340
Every time I mess this bit up, hang on, that...

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.940
that bit shouldn't be there; I put that in by accident.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.620
Sorry. Where was I?

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.800
...forty-seven, one, nine!

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.640
And there it is; that's the number I'm going to talk about today.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.060
I still find this number absolutely fascinating,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.860
and the reason this number is so great is because it relates to a fantastic inequality.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.020
A formula if you will, which I will put underneath here.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.000
So, the formula we're gonna look at is:

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.900
½ less than the floor function of the mod function of

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.020
the floor function of the y-coordinate on 17,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.580
—floor function— times 2 to the power of negative 17 times the floor function of x

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.220
subtract the mod of the floor function of y again.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.300
Oop, that's floor, sorry.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.760
And that is mod 17, so I close that mod there

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.980
and then this whole thing, once you've got that,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.520
you then -- that open mod is 2; close that, and then close the floor function.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.000
OK, so now we have ridiculous number and we have ridiculous equation.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.500
To show you how the two are linked, I thought I would show you the plot of this inequality,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.760
because what they're saying is: if you have an x,y axis

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.620
and you put—for each point on that plane—you put in the x- and y-coordinates into this formula,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.840
it would tell you whether or not you should colour in that point.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.660
So, in fact, this tells you which part of an x,y plot should have a dot, and which shouldn't.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.780
And I've got a printout I have done of that formula,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.820
and, so, if you plot that formula, you get this plot here.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.260
So, this is the plot of that formula, and,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.320
in case you're wondering what is particularly astounding about this,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.320
the formula, when you plot it, is itself.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.540
It is its own form--

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.140
The formula is its own plot. The plot is the formula.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.940
This is called Tupper's self-referential formula,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.220
and when you plot it, you get itself,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.160
and that, for me, is one of the freakiest, most bizarre parts of mathematics.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.460
A formula which is its own plot.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.080
Okay, there is, however, one slight cheat

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.120
it does-- it actually does that; if you plot this formula, you get itself

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.420
as its plot, but the cheat is this 'k' down here,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.400
because I haven't actually specified where we are on the vertical y-axis.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.700
You can see on the x-axis we're zero to 106; fairly normal territory.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.220
But here we're like "'k', what on earth is that?"

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.660
That k value is this number here.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.760
Basically, we are a long way up the y-axis right now.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.580
If you go a huge distance up the y-axis of this plot,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.140
and you ignore everything else below it, and there's more after it; ignore everything above it.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.100
At this one particular zone between this number and this number plus 17,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.280
is where you get the equation that we were using to plot them.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.200
What's actually amazing about Tupper's self-referential formula

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.120
is not that it plots itself — it's that it plots everything.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.180
As you go up the y-axis, it plots every single 106x17 grid of white and black pixels.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.700
So, anything that fits in that grid is somewhere on this plot.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.640
So, not only is Tupper's formula in the plot,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.720
but also every other formula you can fit into that size.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.980
In fact, I found a different value of k which is where it's the same formula, but smiley faces instead of the word 'mod'.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.840
And so, that's a slightly different value of k, gives you the smiley-face version of this formula.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.160
Also found the point where Pac-Man is eating the formula, as chased by a ghost.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.160
And so, that one is... I think that one's gonna be higher up as well

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.100
It's... yes. It's not far off, though.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.180
And so, anything you can possibly fit into one of these appears in there somewhere.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.720
And I can actually show you how you can get from any picture you want to that number.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.000
The way it actually works is you take the pixelated form of your equation,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.400
so let's get our original one.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.380
Let's do... Where's the proper one? None of these ridiculous ones.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.760
Okay, here were go, right. So there's...there's the original one.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.720
And what you do is you start in the bottom left-hand corner,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.240
and if you want that to be a black pixel, you put a 1.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.480
And then you go to the one above it. And that's black as well, so you put another 1.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.660
And the one above that is white, so you put a 0.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.900
The one above that is white; 0.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.560
1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.380
0. Is that two or three? Looks like three. 0. 1. 0.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.300
And then you carry on.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.400
And you scroll up the first column, and then up the second column, and up the next one.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.900
And you write it off as a binary number.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.460
And you end up, at the very end, with a very long binary number.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.540
You then put that into base 10.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:18.720
You multiply it by 17, and that gives you the k value for where that plot appears on the graph.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.660
In fact, this is a bitmap function.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.360
And what Jeff Tupper was doing was looking at using equations and being able to plot them automatically

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.960
using software, he's a computer scientist at the University of Toronto.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.880
And this is a kind of a side-effect, it's an interesting outcome of the legitimate proper research he was doing.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.080
In fact, Brady, I got you a present.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.600
I took the Numberphile logo, pixelated it, turned it into a binary number.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.640
Multiplied it by 17.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.940
Put it into base 10. And there it is down there.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.280
So that is the k coordinate, of the Numberphile logo, on Tupper's plot.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.760
Okay, so, when I wrote my book, Things To Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.220
Brady: Woah, woah you happen to have it on you?
Matt: I happen to have it with me at all times as you

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.420
know Brady. I wanted to put in Tupper's self-referential formula, and so in the book, ah here it is.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.100
In the chapter on functions I put in a picture of it, and I'm all like "oh wow that's amazing" and then later on

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.080
in the book when I get to digital images, because it is just a bitmap (where is it, there we are) here we go

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.400
I've got it again and I explain the system. So there's the actual plot, there's if you turn it into 0s and 1s

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:34.860
And there's when you multiply it by 17. Except, that's not actually the correct number. So the plot's correct,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.260
the binary number's correct but this is not, because I thought it would be hilarious to put in a different number.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.340
And so if anyone ever does take that number --  and I've never told anyone, Penguin don't know this,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.880
FSG who published it in the US don't know this. I've not revealed it to anyone -- this is the first public release

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.900
of this information. If you reverse that number you get a different plot, I have defaced the plot for that number.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:06.440
This is the world's slowest, longest running troll you'll ever come across. So hopefully, you know, years from now

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.440
someone may finally get around to doing it. And they will not be faced with that plot.
