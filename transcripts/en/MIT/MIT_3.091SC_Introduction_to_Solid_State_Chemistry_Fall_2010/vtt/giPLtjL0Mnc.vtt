00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.650
PROFESSOR: So, a couple
of announcements.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.750
Tomorrow we've got Quiz Two.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.360
Based on Homework Two
And then, Thursday,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.230
we'll have the
periodic table quiz.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.680
I give you the numbers,
you give me the letters.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.850
And Friday is the last
day for the contest.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.930
I'll have office hours.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.471
I know when others
have office hours.

00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:46.520
I'll be available 4:30 to 5:30
down the hall in my office.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.170
Where is Grant's, who's
buried in Grant's Tomb?

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.730
Grant.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.880
Where are my office hours held?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.492
In my office.

00:00:53.492 --> 00:00:55.260
Good.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.645
Last day.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:57.145
Last day.

00:00:57.145 --> 00:00:58.103
It was a rough weekend.

00:00:58.103 --> 00:01:00.030
I can't get a smile,
can't get a laugh.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.850
So, last day we looked at the
validation of the Bohr model.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.190
And we had two pieces
of experimental data.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.540
First were the hydrogen
spectrum lines,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.760
measured in 1853 by Angstrom
and fit to an equation by J.J.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.000
Balmer in 1885.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.800
And, secondly, we saw the
Franck-Hertz experiment,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.910
in which we were able to
get the sense that energy

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.000
levels within a multi-electron
atom, like, mercury,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.020
those energy levels
are also quantized,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.240
which gave credence to
the quantum condition.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.700
Which said that the movement
of an electron, the movement

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.340
of an electron, is quantized.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.210
And then we started looking
at the limitations of the Bohr

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.350
model, problems
with the Bohr model.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.370
And I said, in two
words, fine structure.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.230
And we started looking
at fine structure.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.340
We see that the 656
nanometer line in hydrogen,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.040
in point of fact, is a doublet.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.300
It's actually two lines
very closely spaced.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.050
Bohr model is incapable
of explaining this.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.810
Zeeman looked at
gas discharge tube,

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.470
measured hydrogen spectrum
in a magnetic field,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.280
and found line
splitting proportional

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.940
to the intensity of the field.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.090
Stark did similar experiments
only in an electric field,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.300
and also found line
splitting, the degree of which

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.345
was proportional to the
intensity of the field.

00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:27.390
And the Bohr model is
incapable of explaining this.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.150
Sommerfeld, in 1916, put
a patch on the Bohr model

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.790
and proposed that
the electron moves

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.820
not only in a circular orbit
but also in elliptical orbits.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.860
And there's a plurality
of these orbits.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.565
But overall, the distance from
the nucleus to the electron

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:51.320
orbits is more or less given by
the principal quantum number n,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.725
and the degree of
eccentricity is tiny.

00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:58.110
But, more or less,
described by n.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.360
And then to further
depict what's going on,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.800
he introduced the
orbital quantum number

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.900
or, as your book calls it,
the azimuthal quantum number.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.310
And the magnetic quantum number.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.420
And further said that the
energy of the electron

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.410
is given by the specifications
according to all three quantum

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.310
numbers.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.410
And then, lastly, in
order to get completeness,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.100
we jumped ahead in
time to 1922 with

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.870
the Stern-Gerlach experiment,
which was the beam of silver.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.110
Atoms through a divergent
magnetic field, the beam

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.070
split in two symmetrically
about the point

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.850
at which the beam would land
on the slide in the absence

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.980
of a magnetic field.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.080
And that can led to
some deeper thinking

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.700
by two graduate students in
Leiden, Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.340
who proposed the notion
of electron spin.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.980
And from that came the
fourth quantum number,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.900
s, and we're going to
throw that into the mix

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.100
even though Sommerfeld didn't
give it to us back in 1916.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.260
But I just want to move
forward with all of them.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.980
And we recognize
that s could take

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.660
on two values,
plus or minus 1/2,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.920
or we could call it
spin up or spin down.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.160
And, as you're going
to learn in 802,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.180
the convention in
electromagnetism

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.490
is the right-hand rule.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.750
That is to say, the thumb
indicates the vector

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.570
and the curl of the fingers
indicate the rotation.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.040
So we would argue that
this is an electron

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.790
spin from looking top-down
anticlockwise and then

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.130
vice versa.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.960
So that's as far as we got.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.410
And so now what
I'd like to do is

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.520
to take a look at
the periodic table

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.950
and get a sense of
electron filling.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.310
And whether that explains the
trends in the periodic table.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.600
And for that I'm going to go
to table 6-3 in your reading.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.710
And all we're going
to do, basically,

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.960
is say, well can we can we
use this idea of n, l and m,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.600
and explain the order of
filling in a periodic table.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.530
So when n equals 1,
l must be equal to 0.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.150
And the m must be equal to 0.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.350
So that means there's
only one orbital.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.800
And, in that orbital, we
can have two electrons.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.760
So we've got the possibility of
two different electrons going

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.100
into the 1s orbital.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.830
Then we go, n equals 2.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.610
l can take a value of 0.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.080
Which is the same as
what we had before.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.550
Just one orbital
in that subshell.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.750
Or we can have l equals
1, in which case m can

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.660
take three different values;
minus 1, 0, and plus 1.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.400
So there's three orbitals there.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.070
3 plus 1 is 4.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.910
And that gives us
the possibility

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.680
of putting 8 electrons in.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.110
Because this is n, l, and m.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.230
And then we've got the choice
of s plus or minus 1/2.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.180
And we'll do one more.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.420
We'll go to n equals 3.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.430
So at l equals 0,
we just have 1.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.500
When l equals 1, we
have the same thing

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.770
as we had with the 2p.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.690
And then when l equals 2, we
have what's known as the 3d.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.710
Remember the
spectroscopists there.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.200
They don't like numbers.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.330
So they use s, p, d, f.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.030
But we're smart.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.680
We can go 0, 1, 2.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.700
It didn't hurt us.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.770
And we go minus 2,
minus 1, 0, 1, 2.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.610
So there's 5.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.080
So 5 plus 3 is 8, and 9.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.880
9 times 2 is 18.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.320
Now let's go to
the periodic table

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.030
and see if this reconciles.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.830
So, when we have 1s,
there's hydrogen, helium.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.390
And then the next is n equals 2.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.740
So that should give
us 4 times 2 is 8.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.140
So, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.940
So there's the 8 different
electrons that get us

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.000
all the way over to neon.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.760
And now let's go to n equals 3.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.750
So, I have 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.300
And then I'm over to 4.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.350
4s.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.450
But look, this is
saying I should have 18.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.610
18 electrons in n equals 3.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.670
So what I'm pointing out here
is that there's a disconnect,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.440
there's a disconnect between
the populating of electrons

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.790
just in ascending
quantum number,

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.570
and the way the elements are
arranged in the periodic table.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.120
There's some other
factor at work here.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.810
So we want to take a look at
what that could possibly be.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:39.360
And, so what we need is to
go to a modified energy level

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.360
diagram.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.560
A modified energy
level diagram, that

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.880
can explain what the
filling sequence is

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.300
in the periodic table.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.020
And the modified
energy level diagram

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.156
is drawn on the basis
of the Aufbau principle.

00:07:59.156 --> 00:08:00.030
The Aufbau principle.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.560
Aufbau, German,
meaning construction.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.130
I think it actually
means out-build.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.720
But, anyways, it generates
the filling sequence.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.540
So, there are three parts
to the Aufbau principle.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.370
And the Aufbau principle
is going to govern,

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:25.770
it's going to govern or direct
the electron filling sequence.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.890
Directs the electron
filling sequence.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.870
So, the first component
of the Aufbau principle

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.910
is the Pauli
exclusion principle.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:43.770
Pauli exclusion principle.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.270
Wolfgang Pauli was an Austrian.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.720
He did his Ph.D under
Sommerfeld in Munich,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.130
and then he post-docced
with Born in Gottingen

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.690
and on to Niels Bohr Copenhagen.
These people worked together.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.140
They traveled from
lab to lab, and it

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.660
was a very vibrant
conversation going on.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.930
Eventually, he became a
professor physics in Hamburg.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.500
And the Pauli exclusion
principle, simply stated,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.380
is that in any electron
system, each electron

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.650
has a unique set of
four quantum numbers.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.390
A unique set of four
quantum numbers.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:35.870
Any atom set, four
quantum numbers

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.370
are unique for each electron.

00:09:44.492 --> 00:09:47.220
For each electron.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:53.530
So you can think of this
as the set of n, l, m and s

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.300
as sort of the social
security number,

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.730
if you like, for each of
the electrons in the set.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.439
And he eventually gets the
Nobel Prize for this, in 1945.

00:10:04.439 --> 00:10:05.980
Virtually everybody
I'm going to talk

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.480
about today, with the
exception of Sommerfeld,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.790
gets the Nobel Prize.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.790
Sommerfeld is a very
interesting character, though.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.050
While he himself never won
the Nobel Prize, many, many

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:21.350
of his students and proteges
won Nobel Prizes, to which you

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.850
must include that there
was something very, very

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.710
special about the quality of
the mentoring that he gave,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.070
that so many of his proteges
went on to win the Nobel Prize.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.670
So this is the first part
of the Aufbau principle.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.750
The second part is
that the electrons fill

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.830
from lowest to highest energy.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:43.820
So electrons fill orbitals.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.280
You can think of the
orbitals as placeholders.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.820
They're really energy concepts.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:53.710
But we populate orbitals from
lowest to highest energy.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:11:00.345
From lowest to highest energy.

00:11:00.345 --> 00:11:02.220
Or if I wanted to be a
wise guy, I would say,

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.540
I'm going to define
energy in such a way

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.855
as I get that as the
filling sequence.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.880
One's got to fit the other.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.210
And the energy is
itself a function

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.240
of the four quantum numbers.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.320
So energy, once I
specify n, l, m, and s,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.950
you can give me the
energy and away we go.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.910
And the thing is that
you need to realize

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.750
that the energy levels are
actually a function of electron

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.690
occupancy.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.440
So you can look
carefully, if you get down

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.700
into the d orbitals
and the f orbitals,

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.130
as you add one more
electron moving one element

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.750
to the right on
the periodic table,

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:49.470
sometimes you see the
population not adding by one,

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.020
because the addition
of an electron

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.200
changes the relative energies
of the various orbitals.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.930
So let's remember that,
that energy is a function

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:05.130
of electron occupancy.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.520
Energy is a function
of electron occupancy.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.720
And then the third part
of the Aufbau principle

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.070
is called Hund's rule.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.440
Hund's rule.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.550
Now, Hund is German for dog, but
this isn't named after a dog.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.590
This is named after Friedrich
Hund, a professor of physics

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.200
at Frankfurt.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.590
He taught for many years.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.080
He died at the
tender age of 101.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.430
And he spoke about degeneracy.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:40.660
Not societal degeneracy,
but degeneracy in an atom.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.570
And this degeneracy
is the condition

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.910
where you have a plurality of
orbitals at the same energy

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.800
level.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.150
So, in orbitals of
equivalent energy,

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:58.510
in orbitals of
equivalent energy,

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.265
we strive for
unpaired electrons.

00:13:01.265 --> 00:13:02.140
This is filling, now.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.280
This is how to direct
the filling sequence.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:14.390
Strive for unpaired electrons.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.820
Let's say unpaired
electron spins.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.640
Let's make it a little clearer.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.420
Unpaired electron spins.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.230
So I'm going to
give you an example,

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.460
work through an example.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.180
So, what have we got here?

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.540
Here's carbon.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.720
And if you look at any
element on the periodic table,

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.150
you'll see this green.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.670
And this is the
electronic configuration.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.620
This tells you what
the sequence looks

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.230
like for that particular element
in the neutral form, et cetera,

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.520
et cetera, subject to
many, many considerations.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.910
So let's look at carbon.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:59.350
So if we look at carbon, it
tells us 1 s2, 2 s2, 2 p2.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.400
So what's all this mean?

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.150
Well, it's all written
in code for us.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.340
So the first number
here is the n number.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.650
So this means n equals 1.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.030
s is the spectrocopist's
notation,

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.740
so this means that l equals 0.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:20.780
And then the 2 here means
2 electron occupancy.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:27.650
So the 1s orbital is filled
to the tune of two electrons.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.750
And the 2s orbital
has two electrons,

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.620
and the 2p orbital
likewise has two electrons.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.970
So now we want to do is
put these electronics

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.270
into their orbitals.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.500
And we can use, there's
a variety of notations.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.600
This is one I'll use today.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.550
This is a box notation.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.180
So this is 1s.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.040
This is 2s.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.210
And then this is 2p.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.850
If you recall, 2p there's
going to be three of them.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.990
If you go back here,
2p has three orbitals

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.200
in that sub-shell.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.240
And we said that
this is the one time

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.730
that m makes some
sense with respect

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.150
to Cartesian coordinates.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:19.910
m is -1, 0, +1 so we can call
this 2p x, 2p y, and 2p z.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.330
And I don't know which is which.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.659
I don't know what the arbitrary
standards of x, y, and z,

00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:26.700
I don't know where the
origin of the universe is,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.908
so I can't tell you all this.

00:15:27.908 --> 00:15:30.481
But, arbitrarily, if
I choose one as x,

00:15:30.481 --> 00:15:32.980
I know where the other two are
according to right-hand rule.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.420
So let's start filling.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:40.010
This says 2, so I'll put in
one spin up, and one spin down.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.570
Now it says 2s 2.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.340
One spin up, one spin down.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.490
And now here's where
the Hund rule comes in.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:50.330
I've got to put two electrons
into these three boxes.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.735
Now, I could be a librarian
and start left to right,

00:15:53.735 --> 00:15:55.750
and make them nice and neat.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:02.360
Or, I could just put
them in wherever I want.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.720
What the Hund rule says is,
strive for unpaired electron

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.220
spin.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.390
So for the Hund rule, you'd
put them in both same spin

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.284
and in different orbitals.

00:16:13.284 --> 00:16:14.700
And then when you
get to nitrogen,

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.960
nitrogen will have
a third one here.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.430
And when you get
to oxygen you've

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.240
got three plus the fourth one's
going to be one of these three

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:21.950
and I don't care.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.879
I mean, some people are
really anal about it,

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:25.670
and they want you to
go from left to right.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.840
As long as you've got two of
them unpaired and one of them

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.510
paired for oxygen I'll be happy.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.390
So now we can use
this concept and look

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.990
at the energy level diagram
for multi-electron atoms.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.790
And this is taken from the book.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.340
So this is different
from the energy level

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.780
diagram for
hydrogen, because you

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.710
can see some compression here.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.270
And I want you to know first
of all, all of these values

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:53.870
are negative.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.620
It's true that energy
increases vertically,

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.140
but the zero is way up here.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.130
So these are all
negative values.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.390
And I want to zoom in here.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.960
Because the energy difference
between 1s and 2s is large.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.924
And we know in hydrogen it's 3/4
of the total energy difference.

00:17:10.924 --> 00:17:13.340
Because there's some compression
in a multi-electron atom.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.320
But nevertheless,
n equals 1 to n

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.260
equals 2 is a huge
energy difference.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.180
So let's zoom in on here.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.520
And what do we see?

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.300
Well, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p and look.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.070
4s lies below 3d.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:29.880
4s lies below 3d.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.720
So that tells us, there's my 3s.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.570
3s 1, 3s 2.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:40.710
There's 3p x1, 3p
y1, 3p z1, 2, 2, 2.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.020
And now what's next?

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.190
It says go to 4s.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.670
So potassium is 4s 1.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:46.880
Calcium's 4s 2.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.000
And scandium is 3d 1.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.930
So this energy level
diagram is the map.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:57.770
It tells you how to put
electronics in sequence.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:03.530
So, this now gives us
the rational basis for e

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.220
equals n, l, m and s.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:06.720
All right.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.470
Well this is nice.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.140
It's been graphical, and so on.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.340
Now I want to go to
the same position.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.160
I want to get back to this, I
want to get back to this point.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.130
But I want to go
by different route.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.300
I want to go by different
route, and for that we're

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.810
going to go by wave mechanics.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.340
So, same destination.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:30.230
Same destination,
via wave mechanics.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:35.140
Now, you don't have partial
differential equations

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.412
as a prerequisite
for 3.091, so I'm not

00:18:38.412 --> 00:18:39.620
going to go through the math.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.370
I'm going to give you the
features of the wave mechanics.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.930
So that later on you're going
to spiral around and study this

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:45.720
again.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.550
You'll have seen it before.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.010
And again, there's going
to be people involved,

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.300
and they're all giants
in modern physics.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.050
The first one is de Broglie.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:00.520
The first one is
Louis-Victor de Broglie.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.380
Let's get his name on the board.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:11.710
Louis-Victor de Broglie, he was
an aristocrat from Normandy,

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.380
who had gone to the Sorbonne.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.840
He was studying humanities.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.870
Political science,
literature, and around

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.780
about the time of his
senior year he decided

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.070
to switch horses
for graduate school

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.070
and forget about a career
in the diplomatic corps,

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.320
do a Ph.D in physics.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.050
So, he did a Ph.D in physics.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:35.460
And in 1924 he published this
Ph.D thesis, beautiful piece

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.430
of elegant writings.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.880
Less than 30 pages long.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.590
And I'll give you sort of the
summary, the one-liner that

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.730
summarizes his Ph.D thesis.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.900
Most of you are going to
have to write a thesis.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.930
The word thesis comes from the
Greek, and it means, sort of,

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.070
my position.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.810
My statement.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.030
Before I have a thesis, I have
something that is not a thesis.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.350
It's my trial balloon.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.030
That's a hypo-thesis,
a hypothesis.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.990
Now, the key to
writing a good thesis

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.760
is to ask a really
good question.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.090
If you ask a
pedestrian question,

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.950
you're probably going to get
some pedestrian answers and ho

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:16.630
hum.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.380
If you ask a really
interesting question,

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.790
you give rise to the possibility
of interesting answers.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.410
And what de Broglie did is,
he asked a really interesting

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.090
question.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.600
So here's his question: He
says, if a photon, which

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.670
has no mass, photon's
just an energy packet.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.810
If a photon which has no mass
can behave as a particle,

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.050
and we've seen.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.240
We model ray optics
as particle beams.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.370
And a photon, and Max Planck
said equals h nu got no mass,

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.610
but we can think of it in our
little anthropomorphic brains

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:51.110
as, photon photon photon.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.330
So if a photon, which has no
mass, can behave as a particle,

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.030
does it follow that an
electron, which has mass,

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.060
can behave as a wave?

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:01.847
It's beautiful.

00:21:01.847 --> 00:21:02.930
Let's do it one more time.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.030
If a photon, which has no
mass, can behave as a particle,

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.705
does it follow that an
electron which has mass,

00:21:08.705 --> 00:21:09.580
can behave as a wave?

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.530
So he asked the question.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:15.720
And he answers it.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.410
In less than 30 pages.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.870
So, let's get this on the board.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.630
Because this is beautiful.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.390
It's like, ask not what you
can do for your country.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:39.010
If a photon, which has no
mass, can behave as a particle,

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:44.240
or can be modeled as a
particle, behave really means,

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.120
so that the theoreticians
can model it as a particle,

00:21:48.120 --> 00:22:05.750
does it follow that an
electron, which has mass,

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.750
can behave as a wave?

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.090
See, if you understand
the question then

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:21.020
the impact of the answer, and
the answer is, if it does,

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.150
this is what its
wavelength is going to be.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.830
So de Broglie said, the
wavelength of an electron,

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.170
if it were to behave
as a wave, would

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.350
be given by the ratio
of the Planck constant

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.650
to the Newtonian momentum,
which you know from 8.01

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:43.730
is simply h over the product of
electron mass and its velocity.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.784
So that's de Broglie's thesis.

00:22:45.784 --> 00:22:47.700
So let's take a look
what we can do with this.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:54.210
Now, you remember in the
Bohr model, recall Bohr.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:58.130
Well, Bohr taught us that mvr,
that's the quantum, condition,

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:03.080
mvr equals the ratio
of h over 2 pi times n,

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.980
where n takes on
the discrete values.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.400
1, 2, 3, et cetera.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.700
That's the quantum condition.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:16.010
Now let's take this
idea of de Broglie.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:20.866
And first of all we have to
put the electron in its orbit.

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:23.540
So we'll put the
electron in its orbit.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.280
And now I'm going to
have it behave as a wave.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:31.330
So if it behaves as a wave,
I'm going to draw it as a wave.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:36.330
Now, why did I draw it this way?

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.580
There's two kinds of
waves in this world.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.705
There's standing waves and
there's traveling waves.

00:23:39.705 --> 00:23:41.780
Now, this orbit's station,
it's in this orbit.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.470
So it better be a standing wave.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.910
I think there's a
cartoon in the book.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.944
There you go, standing wave.

00:23:49.944 --> 00:23:51.610
In order for this to
be a standing wave,

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.730
there's a geometric
constraint on this.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.720
Listen carefully
geometric constraint.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.540
I'm not saying anything
about quantum mechanics.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:09.470
Geometric constraint,
the geometric constraint

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:16.407
for a standing wave is what?

00:24:16.407 --> 00:24:17.990
You know what this
distance is, right?

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.450
I mean, this is not to scale.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.240
This should be
10,000:1, in which case

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.030
these ripples are
barely visible.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.245
But here it looks
kind of exaggerated.

00:24:27.245 --> 00:24:28.490
This is a hyper wave.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:32.890
This is emphasis added in proof.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.040
So that means that the
circumference here, 2 pi

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:42.000
r, the circumference must be an
integral number of wavelengths

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.540
for a standing wave.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.040
But we know that
from de Broglie,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:55.200
I can write n lambda
as n h over m v. I've

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.720
just put in de Broglie's
definition of the wavelength

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.420
of an electron.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:07.040
And now I can
cross-multiply and I get mvr

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:16.059
equals h over 2 pi times n.

00:25:16.059 --> 00:25:17.475
Which is Bohr's
quantum condition.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:25.110
So we've got validation
of the Bohr model,

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.840
so that's a pretty
compelling case

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.930
that maybe the electron
really does behave as a wave,

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.860
and that explains why we
have the quantum condition

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.405
that we do.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.510
So de Broglie, that's
his Ph.D in 1924.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.610
Einstein read the
thesis, loved the thesis.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.580
But we don't care
what Einstein says,

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.200
because he's a theoretician.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.110
So one theoretician praising
another theoretician.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.400
That's not how science works.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.190
How does science work?

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.860
Data.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.670
We need data.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.830
And the data come in 1927.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:04.332
1927, at Bell Labs
in New Jersey.

00:26:04.332 --> 00:26:09.070
At Bell Labs in New Jersey
come the critical data.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.705
And they were taken by
Davisson and Germer.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.360
Davisson and Germer.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.840
Davisson and Germer
were studying crystals.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.940
They were studying crystals
of various elements,

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.825
and in particular
metal crystals.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:33.790
Metal crystals,
by X-ray analysis.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.380
And in order for
you to appreciate

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.162
what I'm going to show you of
Davisson and Germer's work,

00:26:41.162 --> 00:26:42.870
I'm going to take you
back to high school

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.550
to those thrilling days
with the wave tanks.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.040
Remember the wave tank?

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.000
This is the top view, this is
the side view of the wave tank.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.840
And you might have some kind
of a mechanical device here

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.060
that has a paddle.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.810
And it starts
vibrating up and down,

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.370
and it starts sending
waves into the tank.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:02.320
So the waves come like
this, from the edge

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.370
it looks like this.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:05.170
Remember that?

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:06.210
Sure you do.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.510
You're toying with me.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:10.160
Oh, I don't remember
anything, we never did that.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.920
Sure you did.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.170
OK, so you can send waves down.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.820
Now, what we can do is,
we can put a dam here.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.960
I'm going to put a dam.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.840
And depending on, if
this is the wavelength,

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.990
this is the wavelength,
it's the distance

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.910
between two successive crests.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:35.560
And, if this spacing
here, the gap

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.020
between the wall and
the edge of the dam, d,

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.950
if d is greater than
lambda, the waves

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.910
just propagate but
for the place where

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:47.450
they're blocked by the dam.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.575
So you get, you
essentially cast a shadow.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.380
You've seen that.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.460
And so I could model
this system as a beam.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.800
This is a beam.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.850
This is a water beam.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.300
This is a water beam shadow.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.750
And this is equivalent
to ray optics.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.930
Straight lines, if something
gets in the way it's opaque.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.140
Blocks transmission.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.420
End of story.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.020
So you've seen all that.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.890
But you also did this other
experiment, I'm willing to bet.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.665
So let's do the
other experiment.

00:28:22.665 --> 00:28:24.040
We're going to do
the same thing.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.520
I'm going to send
waves down here.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.320
Only, this time we're going
to make the dam a little bit

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.310
different.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:35.620
This time we're going to bring
the dam in from the wall.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.470
And we're going to
put a tiny opening.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.540
And I'm going to go
some more into the tank.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:42.890
And then another tiny opening.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:43.794
It could be the same.

00:28:43.794 --> 00:28:45.835
It's probably best to keep
it the same dimension.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:59.030
Now, in this case, the spacing,
d, is much less than lambda.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.960
d is much less than lambda.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.590
And what happens in this case?

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:05.430
When d is much less than lambda,
you don't get the shadow.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.780
You don't get something
like this instead, remember.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.760
You've got the rings.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.170
This is called diffraction.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.880
Diffraction.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.620
And there is no way to
explain diffraction modeling

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.750
water as a beam.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:28.500
You must implore the
wave-like behavior of water

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.450
in order to explain diffraction.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:40.010
Explain only by invoking
wave-like properties.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:47.370
So with wave-like properties, we
get something that makes sense

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.160
in terms of the data.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.320
Now, let's do this
same experiment,

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.790
let's do this same experiment
on a metal crystal.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.940
So if you go back to
the gas discharge tube.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.120
Remember the gas discharge
tube that we were looking

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.020
at for lecture after lecture?

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.280
If you take a look and go
through the energetics of it.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.740
If you put one volt
across the plates,

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.240
you know the energy is going
to be a product of charge times

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:13.870
voltage.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.210
And that's equal
to 1/2 mv squared.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.250
Which you know from 801
is p squared over 2m.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.670
And p is equal to h over lambda.

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:26.580
Pretty soon you can come
up with the wavelength.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.240
And that will give you the
wavelength of the electron.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.410
This is a ballistic
electron now.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.640
See what I'm doing?

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.860
See, once I said
that this indicates

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.980
that the electronic
in stationary orbit

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.450
can be modeled as a wave
of a certain wavelength, so

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.750
now the free electron.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.680
It's got m, it's got v,
there's Planck constant.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.130
I can go ahead and
compute its wavelength.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:52.630
I can compute the
wavelength of a baseball.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.130
So, you go through it.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:58.970
And you get a value
of about 12 Angstroms.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:59.850
12 Angstroms.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:05.080
Now, if I want to see whether
there's wave-like properties,

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.850
I need to have a condition
that gives me diffraction.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:09.670
So I'm going to have
to find something

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:13.160
that gives me a dam
with an opening that's

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.840
less than 12 Angstroms.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.960
If I'm going to use 1 volt.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.170
So what can I do?

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:24.190
Well, turns out you're going
to learn this in greater detail

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.200
later, but if this is
a crystal of nickel.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.890
Crystal of nickel, the atoms
are arranged in regular arrays.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:34.550
And this is what the face of
nickel looks like, 4 atoms each

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.410
at the corner.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.190
And one in the
center of that face.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:41.040
This distance is 3.53 Angstroms.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.490
Perfect.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.170
Perfect.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:49.230
So what Davisson and Germer
did is, they irradiated this.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:54.590
They irradiated this first with
X-rays on the order of lambda,

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:58.090
on the order of,
say, 10 Angstroms.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.960
And what did they get?

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.230
This is the output.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.130
This is the output.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.620
You get a diffraction pattern.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.940
It's a set of rings,
concentric rings.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:13.090
So this is the
X-ray diffraction.

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:17.520
This is the X-ray
diffractogram, if you like.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.140
And then, what did they do next?

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:25.325
They irradiate the same
crystal with an electron beam.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:32.930
lambda of the electron
beam, 10 Angstroms.

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:35.230
And what did they get?

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.220
Are you ready?

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:36.910
Drum roll.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.140
Now, there is no way
that you can get a ring

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:49.670
pattern from a beam of electrons
acting as a particle beam.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.550
The only explanation for
this is that the electrons

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:58.020
were behaving as
waves of this value

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.260
to give us the same spacing
as we got with X-rays.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.430
And you're comfortable
if I say that X-rays

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:07.050
are a type of light.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.680
So, therefore, it's got
wave-like properties.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.280
And it's got
particle-like properties.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.700
Well, now I've
just made the point

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.820
that this is the
electron diffractogram.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:21.710
So this is evidence of
electron diffraction.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.210
And this shook the world.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.680
Because now it's real.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.190
There's no way you can
get this otherwise.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:31.970
This is electron diffraction.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:33.720
This was 1927.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.110
1929, de Broglie
gets the Nobel Prize.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:42.540
1937, Davisson gets
the Nobel Prize.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:47.710
So this means the wave-particle
duality is complete.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:52.130
It applies not only to light,
but it applies to matter.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:57.200
So, wave-particle
duality, they call it.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.665
Wave-particle
duality is complete.

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.640
Matter can act as waves.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.710
Electromagnetic radiation
can act as particles.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:12.230
So, sometimes people refer to
de Broglie's accomplishment

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.370
as matter waves.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:15.974
Matter waves.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:23.530
And what do you call the
behavior of billiard balls

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:24.700
banging around and so on?

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.500
We call that mechanics.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.850
So now we're going
to use what might

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:32.930
seem as an oxymoron,
contradiction, wave mechanics.

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:36.120
Wave mechanics.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.680
That means matter
behaving as a wave.

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.480
But still behaving as a matter.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.200
So this is the dynamic.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:48.170
So that's pretty
good for de Broglie.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.650
So let's go to number two.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:51.649
I said there were going
to be three people here.

00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:54.270
Number two is Werner Heisenberg.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.020
Werner Heisenberg.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.640
Heisenberg studied with Pauli.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.960
Sommerfeld.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.290
Did his Ph.D in Munich in 1923.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:14.750
Got his Ph.D with
Sommerfeld at the age of 22.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.765
And then he decided to
take a postdoc with Bohr.

00:35:17.765 --> 00:35:19.890
And he was working with
Bohr for a couple of years,

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:22.020
he was feeling a
little bit burned-out.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.820
And decided to take
three weeks off.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.590
Went up to a deserted island
off the coast of Norway.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:31.450
Came back three weeks later with
the mathematical formulation

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:33.700
of quantum mechanics.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.950
I'm not kidding you, that's
what he did in his time

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:39.330
off, to kind of unwind.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:44.650
And so one of the things that
he used as a critical piece

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:49.350
of this derivation is that
the position and velocity

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:53.000
of an electron cannot
be fully specified.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.470
They cannot be fully specified
below certain limits.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:59.590
There's a threshold
below which we can't go.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.500
This is sort of
like, if I asked you

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.960
to time a 100-meter
sprint, which typically

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.670
takes less than 10 seconds.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.680
But I give you a clock, and
the nearest unit on the clock

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.910
is the minute.

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.740
So you wouldn't be
able to distinguish.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.020
So, he says-- and
the reason for this

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.580
is, it's a consequence
of quantization.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:20.340
Light itself is quantized.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.770
So, at some point you're asking
for a continuous splitting

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.400
and splitting and splitting into
finer and finer time segments.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.400
And you can't get there.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.650
So we already knew
this from Planck.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:35.580
And so one of the ways that
he expressed the inability

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:41.360
to go below a certain threshold
is the uncertainty principle.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.220
The uncertainty principle.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.820
And that's
unfortunate that, see,

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.580
it was originally
published in German.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:51.170
And the idea really is the
indeterminacy principle.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.220
But, English says uncertainty.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.350
So it's a limit to
determination, but there it is.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:59.410
And so one expression
of this is,

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:01.310
the product of the velocity.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:03.284
Only, he wrote it in
terms of momentum.

00:37:03.284 --> 00:37:04.700
So the mass isn't
going to change.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.460
So, think of this as the
uncertainty and the velocity.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.350
And the uncertainty
in the position.

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:13.290
So this is the
x-coordinate of particle.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.780
You can break its
trajectory into three

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.910
orthogonal components.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.030
So the uncertainty
in the x direction

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:23.290
of the momentum times the
uncertainty in the position

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:27.550
is greater than or equal to
the Planck constant divided

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.940
by 2 pi.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.800
The Planck constant
divided by 2 pi.

00:37:33.725 --> 00:37:35.800
And so what this
means is that we're

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:41.635
going to see a transition in
models from individual atoms.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.810
If we want to describe what
happens with individual atoms,

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.330
we need what is known as
a deterministic model.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:51.790
Sort of, Newtonian mechanics.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:54.025
You tell me the initial
position and velocity.

00:37:54.025 --> 00:37:56.570
You tell me the forces, and I
can predict where it's going

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:57.695
and where it's going to be.

00:37:57.695 --> 00:38:01.460
So that's deterministic models.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.730
So, deterministic models
describing individual atoms

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:13.790
are going to give rise
to probabilistic models.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.390
Probabilistic models.

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:21.110
And probabilistic
models obviously

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.970
can't be talking about
individual atoms.

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:25.760
Must be talking about
ensembles of atoms.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.560
So I can't say where any
individual atom will be,

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.240
because I don't have
the ability to do so.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:36.280
But I can tell you, if you
give me a large number of them,

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.440
I'll tell you roughly
what the expected outcome

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.680
could be in terms of energy.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.670
And ultimately predict
the spectrum, and so on.

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.280
So instead of chicken
and egg we have

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.810
now chickenality and egg-ness.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:51.060
Everything is just sort of
getting a little bit murky.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:51.890
Little bit murky.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:53.770
You can do a
calculation on this.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.490
You can do a calculation on
this, a very simple take.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:00.110
Take the Bohr model and take
the ground state electron

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:03.127
in hydrogen. n equals
1 in atomic hydrogen.

00:39:03.127 --> 00:39:04.960
And you know this is
about half an Angstrom.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.180
So the distance across
here is 1 Angstrom.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.610
So make 1 Angstrom
your uncertainty,

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:19.040
and you'll find that the
uncertainty in the momentum

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.100
is on the order of 15%.

00:39:24.005 --> 00:39:25.880
But what this is saying
is, when you get down

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:29.200
to atomic dimensions, you
can't just shine light on it

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.734
and reveal what's going on.

00:39:30.734 --> 00:39:32.650
Because you're going to
disturb the very thing

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:34.240
you're trying to measure.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.870
Some people say
that, every time you

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.750
try to work at the
atomic level, it's

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.510
as though you're trying
to take a picture

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:43.185
with the sun at your back and
your shadow is in the picture.

00:39:43.185 --> 00:39:48.445
So you can't get there without
disturbing the very thing.

00:39:48.445 --> 00:39:49.820
Another way to
think about it is,

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.847
the photons that are
capable of this resolution

00:39:51.847 --> 00:39:53.680
are going to have such
high energies they'll

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.070
knock the very thing
you're trying to measure.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:56.570
All right.

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:00.680
He gets Nobel Prize in 1932.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.140
And then the third one
is Erwin Schroedinger.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.130
Let's get him up here.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:11.810
Erwin Schroedinger.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.640
Also an Austrian,
University of Zurich.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.480
He too was burned out.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.320
They get burned out, these guys.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.940
So at Christmastime,
1925, took a vacation.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.100
At Villa Herwig, in Aurora.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:31.580
And comes back two weeks
later with the wave mechanics

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:35.150
formulation, of
quantum mechanics.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:37.940
See, sometimes going
away on a vacation.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:41.720
So he took de Broglie's notion
of the electron as a wave

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.770
and wrote equations to
model wave-like behavior.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:48.535
So, let's look at
how to get there.

00:40:48.535 --> 00:40:51.850
And here's what he did.

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:54.630
So, you know, for
example, that we could

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.820
start with a violin string.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.660
And it has a
geometric constraint.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.560
It must be fixed at both ends.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.750
And if I pluck
that string, it can

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:07.485
vibrate as long as it conforms
to the geometric constraint

00:41:07.485 --> 00:41:08.600
of a standing wave.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.210
So here's one possibility.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.160
Wherein we would
call this n equals 1.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.410
I have simply the
entire string vibrating

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.930
in the matter that's shown.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:20.600
But here's a second possibility.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.030
I could have it vibrating
as is shown here,

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:24.880
n equals 2 with a
node in the middle

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.530
where that node
doesn't move at all.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.620
The string is stationary
at its mid-point.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.460
And what's the
characteristic here?

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.160
This is operating at
a certain frequency.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.650
Let's say it's middle C.
And this is the overtone.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.400
This is the first harmonic.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.530
And it's going to
be an octave higher,

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:47.050
because it's as though we
have two strings, each fixed.

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.830
See, from a physics
standpoint I could literally

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:53.100
cut this string in half and
fix it there, and this is now n

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.380
equals 1 for the half-length.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:58.140
So it's going to have the
same pitch as the half-length.

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.425
Which means that this
is an octave higher,

00:42:00.425 --> 00:42:02.990
and this is going to be two
octaves higher, and so on.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.520
And all of these conform.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.110
So you get a plurality
of solutions.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.890
You get a plurality
of solutions.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:13.780
And the solutions look
something like this.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:20.700
They'll eventually teach you
the string as a simple harmonic

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.700
oscillator.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:27.960
Simple harmonic oscillator.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.540
And it has equations
that look like this.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.165
If you want to
plot its position,

00:42:33.165 --> 00:42:38.250
this is x going from 0 to l.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.650
And this is the y-coordinate.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:44.060
So you can, for example,
write something like this.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:48.380
So, the function
will look like this.

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.320
Some pre-multiplier
times cosine of kx

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.190
plus another pre-multiplier
b times the sine of kx.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:01.620
And the geometry will
dictate that the value of k

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.720
is n pi over l.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.020
So, pi over l is the geometry.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:10.430
And n takes multiple values.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:13.940
Just as you see here, there's
not a unique solution.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.470
So listen carefully.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:19.690
Wave equation,
plurality of solutions.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:22.330
But subject to some constraints.

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:23.670
Subject to some constraints.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:27.250
So what Schroedinger did
is, he wrote a wave equation

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:33.720
to describe the motion
of electron in its orbit.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.210
And guess what he gets?

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:37.860
He gets a plurality
of solutions.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.670
And when you look at the
plurality of solutions,

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.870
the plurality of
solutions ultimately

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:50.970
map into what we know as the
distinct values of n, l, m

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.180
and s.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.030
See, this is the
one-dimensional.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:57.990
So this is giving us
n numbers. n equals 1,

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.210
this is now n equals 2.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:02.020
So I'm getting
quantum numbers here.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:04.130
Now, if I did this
in three dimensions,

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:06.040
I'd have a plurality
of quantum numbers.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.480
And Schroedinger gets us all
the way to n, l, m and s.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.010
And so here's what
it looks like.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.320
This is the equation,
it's a wave equation,

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.480
so there's a double
derivative in space.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.700
There's a forcing function.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.070
And this is i, square root of
minus 1 in a time base here.

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:26.610
So it's a harmonic
kind of equation.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.249
Psi is the wave function,
it's an abstract concept

00:44:29.249 --> 00:44:31.040
but we'll show you how
to make sense of it.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.940
And these are the
various solutions,

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.480
the plurality of solutions.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.930
And we can now map those into
what we know as 1s, 2s, 2px,

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.720
2py, 2pz, et cetera, et cetera.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.090
And you see this number a sub 0.

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:46.660
That's our Bohr radius.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.710
Comes right out
of the equations.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:51.890
0.529 Angstroms.

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:54.910
So, this is quite good.

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:58.770
But, as I said, the psi
is the wave function.

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:00.620
Or psi, however you
want to call this.

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.090
This is called
the wave function.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:04.530
Wave function.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:07.005
And we have plurality
of solutions.

00:45:10.542 --> 00:45:11.750
We call these Eigenfunctions.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.840
Eigenfunctions.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.860
And the closest we can
get to something physical

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:24.110
is the product of psi and
its complex conjugate.

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:27.240
And that is related
to the probability

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.560
of finding the electron.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.222
Probability of
finding the electron.

00:45:33.222 --> 00:45:36.180
Which, in essence, gives the
boundaries of the orbitals.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.030
So now I'm going to put, we're
going to get a Cartesian shape.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:40.480
I told you, 1s, 2s.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.530
What do they look like?

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:42.900
Here's what they look like.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.696
So these are the square of
the wave function plotted.

00:45:46.696 --> 00:45:48.570
So this is in a radial
distribution function.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.220
It's only in one direction,
out from the radius.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.590
Now, if you whip
this around in 3-D,

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:55.680
you'll generate the surface.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.737
But already you
can see, here's 1s,

00:45:57.737 --> 00:45:59.320
and it peaks at about
1/2 an Angstrom.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.240
And here's 2s, and it peaks
at 4 times the Bohr radius.

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:07.020
And psi squared
3s about 9 times.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.750
This is from your book.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:09.830
So it's a maximum.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:11.040
But there's some uncertainty.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:16.040
See, it's not a simple line
fixed at 0.529 Angstroms.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.490
This is another way of plotting.

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:19.120
So these are spherical.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.190
What we were calling circular
now becomes namely spherical.

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:25.400
And there's this node here.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.500
This is the p orbitals.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.960
They're dumbbell-shaped.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.400
With two lobes.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.210
And if you have a
single electron,

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:34.520
it doesn't reside in one lobe.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.755
It can jump from one
side to the other.

00:46:36.755 --> 00:46:39.380
You might say, well, how does it
get from one lobe to the other

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:43.875
when halfway between,
there's a nodal plane.

00:46:43.875 --> 00:46:46.900
It has zero probability.

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.660
Well, it's behaving as a wave.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.630
Behaves as a particle, you
can't get through a wall

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:55.320
that says zero permission.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.000
That's how, you can transfer
energy from here to here

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.010
and have that node's
perfectly stationary.

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:03.140
Anybody skip rope?

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.919
You know how this works.

00:47:05.919 --> 00:47:07.710
Now, this is where I
quarrel with the book.

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:09.560
This is another drawing.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.706
But I'm uncomfortable
with the fact

00:47:11.706 --> 00:47:13.080
that they chose
different colors.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.190
Because I think to the
first time learner,

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:17.830
you might be tempted to think,
well, one electron lives here

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:19.250
and the other
electron lives here.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.660
No, the electron,
if there's only one,

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.020
it can go from one to the other.

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:25.186
If there are two, they can
go from one to the other.

00:47:25.186 --> 00:47:28.020
And, see, they do this
all the way through.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.645
So please don't start
rationalizing in your mind that

00:47:31.645 --> 00:47:34.490
one electron goes in the yellow
and the other electron goes

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:37.440
in the grey.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.080
There's the d.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:38.871
Aren't they pretty?

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:47.700
If you find the f
orbitals, that's wild.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.660
So I think this is probably
a good place to stop.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.119
We've got a few minutes here.

00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:53.910
If you want to read
more about uncertainty,

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:56.350
this is a very nice
book by David Peat that

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:59.930
goes into the meanings,
including this indeterminacy,

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.210
and so on.

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:04.050
Good book here on hydrogen.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:05.200
Please, I don't want noise.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.170
We've got, still,
a few more minutes.

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:10.170
Still got a few more minutes.

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:12.000
This book here talks
about hydrogen.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.500
Goes right back to Democritus.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:19.980
One chapter is a beautiful
thing on the use of hydrogen

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.400
as a potential fuel.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.670
All the Bohr and whatnot.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:27.120
This is a play that won the
Tony Award in the year 2000.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.040
Written by Michael Frayn.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:34.350
And it's about the fact that
Niels Bohr was the mentor

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.140
to Werner Heisenberg.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:41.500
And now it's 1941, the
Nazis have invaded Denmark.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:45.530
And Bohr is essentially
waiting to get out

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:52.560
of Denmark before the war
overtakes the rest of Europe.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.970
Meanwhile, Heisenberg is now
the head of the Nazi equivalent

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:57.550
of the Manhattan Project.

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:00.770
And he goes to Copenhagen
to visit his old mentor.

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:01.942
That's a fact.

00:49:01.942 --> 00:49:02.650
They have dinner.

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:03.800
That's a fact.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.730
They go for a walk.

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:05.780
That's a fact.

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.090
They never speak to each
other after that night.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:09.490
That's a fact.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.290
So the question is,
what went on that night.

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:15.680
And that's what Michael Frayn
uses as the dramatic point

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.720
of departure.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:21.450
So, did Heisenberg go to
Bohr to get Bohr's opinion

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:23.250
about nuclear weaponry?

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.280
Did he try to find out
whether the Allies were

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.590
working on a bomb?

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:29.870
Did he go to say, look, we
should on both sides not

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.620
develop nuclear weaponry?

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.530
What went on in
that conversation?

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:37.610
And so you see
Bohr at the center.

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:40.560
There's Heisenberg
who's the one electron.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.860
And there's Margaret,
who is Bohr's wife, who

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.100
was the observer.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.940
And so there's the play
between the uncertainty

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:50.835
in quantum mechanics and the
uncertainty in human relations.

00:49:50.835 --> 00:49:53.090
It's a really nice play.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:55.790
Here's a rendition of it.

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:59.680
This is Stephen Rea playing
Bohr, Francesca Annis playing

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.230
Margaret Bohr, and playing
Werner Heisenberg is, do you

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:12.260
recognize him,
it's Daniel Craig.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:16.080
This is a book that came out not
too long ago about Heisenberg.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.100
A lot of controversy about him.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.480
Some people accused him
of being a collaborator.

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.330
Other people say that he
was absolutely brilliant

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:27.450
in the right amount
of foot-dragging.

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:29.720
He did not want to give
Hitler nuclear weapons.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.670
If he'd been a total
disaster he would

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.230
have been replaced
by somebody who

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:37.100
might have been more zealous.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.610
And if he went too fast,
he might have figured out

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:41.430
how to make nuclear weapons.

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:45.690
So, very interesting
book about him.

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:47.140
And here's a nice photo.

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:47.937
This is Bohr.

00:50:47.937 --> 00:50:49.020
This is Werner Heisenberg.

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:50.960
And this is Wolfgang Pauli.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.430
Undoubtedly talking
about what goes

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:56.260
on when you pluck that string.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.693
So we'll see you on Wednesday.
