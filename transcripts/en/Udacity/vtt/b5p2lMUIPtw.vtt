00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.780
Now that we've seen
notifications in action,

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.220
let's step through the sample to quickly
refresh your memory as to how they work.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.320
We'll need to understand how this works
before we can start adding wearable

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.770
extensions.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.006
So let's open up Application
&gt; Java &gt; the Package, and

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.667
then open up MainActivity.java.

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:21.090
So let's now work through the code.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.490
Notification ID here is the unique
identifier for the notification.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.600
Each notification we generate
has a unique value and

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.030
if we issue two notifications with
the same ID, we override the first one.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.598
The interesting code is in
sendNotification, which is here.

00:00:37.598 --> 00:00:40.340
This creates an intent that is fired
when the notification is clicked

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.560
by the user.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.800
We need to create a new
pendingIntent here, so

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.950
that the notification service can
run the intent later on for our app.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.070
We need to setup a builder for
NotificationCompat objects.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.650
We'll call methods on this to set it up.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.720
This sets up the icon to show for
the notification.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.170
This tells the notification what pending
intent to use, which we created earlier.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.470
And this here makes the notification
automatically disappear when it's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.870
clicked on.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.440
This here is a different kind
of icon used on the left side of

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.420
the notification in
the notification shade.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.890
These three lines configure
the main title, the main text, and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.180
also some subtext, all of which are
shown in the notification on the phone.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.740
This grabs a reference to
the notification manager.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.930
And this takes the builder and

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.690
generates a notification compound
object using the .build method.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.871
And passes it to the notificationManager
using the NOTIFICATION_ID value.

00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:34.334
The NOTIFICATION_ID value must be unique
amongst the other notifications you

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:35.270
might want to create.
