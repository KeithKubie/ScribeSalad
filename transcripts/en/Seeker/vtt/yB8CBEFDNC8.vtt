00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.540
Sometimes science comes to light that challenges
even our most basic assumptions about the

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.540
universe.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.510
But don't fret, 'Standard Model of Physics,'
QUANTUM LAW WILL PROTECT US.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.630
BAH BAH BAH!

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.110
Hi there you lovely lumps of degenerate matter!

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.570
Trace here for DNews.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.180
You may remember your schoolbook definition
of friction: a resistive force that counteracts

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.250
the motion of an object across a surface.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.790
For example: you can feel friction from the
air when running, and friction from your hands

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.940
when you rub them together…

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.810
But, if a pulsar is spinning in the "vacuum"
of space, which is full of, well, nothing,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.360
then what the heck could be causing friction?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.980
Hold on to that thought.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.000
We'll come back to it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.510
First, we have to talk neutron stars.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.960
These collapsed stars are stellar husks of
densely packed neutrons, the tiny particles

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.649
that you find in the nuclei of atoms.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.000
They form after a big star goes boom.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.900
That’s right, when a star of a certain mass
a few times bigger than our sun runs out of

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.320
hydrogen fuel and explodes as a supernova,
a tiny ball of dense matter only a dozen miles

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.240
across is left in its wake.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.110
Because there’s so much matter crammed into
such a small space, gravity becomes so powerful

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.880
that these neutrons are compressed into one
of the densest forms of matter possible in

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.280
nature -- this is called degenerate matter.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.310
I can't really emphasize enough how dense
this stuff is.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.200
A shot glass filled with neutron star matter
would weigh as much as Mount Everest!

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.070
A SHOT GLASS.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.369
Needless to say, these objects are extreme.

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.240
Stars, just like planets and, well, everything
in space, are spinning.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.240
Neutron stars retain the spin and magnetic
field of their parent star, and often turn

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.549
into pulsars -- which are basically rapidly
spinning uber magnets!

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.970
Powerful radiation blasts into space from
the magnetic poles of the neutron stars, and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.150
if, by chance, those poles sweep past Earth
as the pulsar spins, we see an intense pulse

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.110
of radiation occurring at very precise intervals
(even though we're many millions of miles

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.110
away).

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.049
The pulses are so regular, that some astronomers
think these pulsars are better time keepers

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.140
than the most precise atomic clocks on Earth.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.689
However, research published in the Astrophysical
Journal suggests that there’s something

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.569
slowing the spin of these pulsars...

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.609
And now we're back to friction in space!

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:15.790
You see, the thing with “empty space”
is that it’s not actually “empty”.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.909
Even if you could grab a volume of space-time
and completely suck out all the particles

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.719
of gas and dust, the vacuum still wouldn’t
be empty; it’s buzzing with particles appearing

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.299
and disappearing from our universe.

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.549
This is known as the “quantum vacuum”
and after decades of quantum physics theories,

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.749
scientists have finally realized the quantum
vacuum is brimming with what they call “virtual

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:37.859
particles.”

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.299
Virtual particles are like ghostly apparitions
that pop into existence from the vacuum but

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.730
then immediately vanish.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.730
It's kinda freaky.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.060
It sounds like this should break some kind
of sacred law of physics, right?

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.659
Well, it turns out these virtual particles
appear and disappear so fast that they do

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.650
nothing wrong in the eyes of the law.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.650
Quantum law, that is.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.650
Damn.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.569
I wish that was a late-night science fiction
show.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.890
I would totally watch that.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.029
Though these particles are technically called
"ghosts," they have a very real impact on

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:05.879
spacetime and the objects in it.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.730
A good example is Hawking radiation.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.650
Hawking Radiation is a phenomenon which causes
black holes to evaporate because these virtual

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.870
particles pulls mass from the black hole.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.760
Don’t take my word for it, my bae Stephen
Hawking says so.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.879
And, if they can do that, it doesn't seem
too large a stretch to think these virtual

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.950
particles may also create friction in the
vacuum of space, making pulsars slow their

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.159
spin as they sap them of energy.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.909
This happens because the virtual particles
may have their own tiny magnetic fields, which

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.029
could interact with the pulsar's magnetic
field, slowing it down.

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:41.309
So, it's not like friction as WE understand
it, but it's definitely out there, they think.

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:45.129
Another question is: can this quantum friction
be measured?

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.470
According to critics of this theory, the friction
would be so slight that it probably can’t

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.699
be detected, and other slowing mechanisms
might be at play, such as magnetic radiation

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.790
that would totally have a stronger slowing
effect.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.359
But still, it’s cool to think that even
in the vacuum of space there may cause friction

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.220
on objects, proving, once again, just how
strange our universe is.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.329
Don't take assumptions for granted.

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.569
When I want to have OTHER people tell me more
about space, I like to binge on How The Universe

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:12.849
Works and Through the Wormhole.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.620

But what about if YOU were thrown into the
vacuum of space?

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.680
What would happen to your body?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.290
Good news - i looked into that here.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:44.270
Did this 
blow your mind a little bit?

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.270
Too much?

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.470
Should we do more of these complex higher-level
DNewses?
