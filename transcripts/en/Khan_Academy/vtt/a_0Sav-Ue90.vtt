00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:01.927
- [Voiceover] What are all the solutions

00:00:01.927 --> 00:00:04.594
to the equation above?

00:00:04.594 --> 00:00:09.075
So we have four x squared is equal to 52.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.329
Well, if we wanna solve for x,

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.232
we can just divide both sides by four.

00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:16.250
And then we get, x squared is equal

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.877
to 52 divided by four, is 13.

00:00:21.637 --> 00:00:23.587
So x could be equal to,

00:00:23.587 --> 00:00:25.259
if x squared is equal to 13,

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.069
that means x could be the
positive or the negative

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.276
square root of 13.

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:31.551
So x is going to be equal to the positive

00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:35.127
or negative square root of 13.

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:36.544
And you could check your answer.

00:00:36.544 --> 00:00:40.218
Take positive 13, if you, if you take,

00:00:40.218 --> 00:00:43.161
or take positive square root of 13,

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:45.436
well, if you square it,
you're gonna get 13,

00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:46.435
and then multiply it times four,

00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:47.991
you're gonna get 52.

00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:49.894
Take the negative square root of 13,

00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:51.148
well, when you square it,

00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:52.843
you're going to get 13,

00:00:52.843 --> 00:00:55.575
'cause a negative times
a negative is positive.

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:56.271
And then you multiply it times four,

00:00:56.271 --> 00:00:57.827
and you're gonna get 52.

00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:01.371
So x could be negative
square root of 13, and, or

00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:03.922
or, x could be, x could be,

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:05.442
or the two solutions are

00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:06.836
x is the negative square root of 13

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:09.831
and x is equal to the
positive square root of 13.

00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:11.224
So that's our choice,

00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:13.634
right over there.
