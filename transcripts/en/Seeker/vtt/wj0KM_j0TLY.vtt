00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.050
Space travel takes a really long time.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.210
And as much as I love board games and asking
my mom if we’re there yet, hanging out and

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.980
eating snacks may not be the best strategy
for killing time on our way to the red planet.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.929
That’s mostly because being awake for that
long means we’re gonna need to eat and drink

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.230
and do all those normal human things – which
means bringing a LOT of supplies with us.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.230
Not super practical.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.300
But, if we’ve learned anything from movies,
the solution is to sleep our way through space.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.039
But is long-term snoozing like Ripley in Alien even
possible?

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.369
To tackle this space-sleep conundrum, let’s
start with the basics, without the assistance

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.120
of sedatives or fancy chambers, we have to
know how long humans can sleep on our own.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.030
Typically we only sleep about eight hours
per night, and though that can vary, it’s

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.730
unusual for healthy adults to regularly sleep
over 10 hours.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.270
But, in the 1960s two volunteers put sleep
duration to the test.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.969
They were monitored as they lived, isolated,
underground for several months.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.520
In the absence of daylight, their sleep cycles
got real crazy.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.359
One guy fell asleep for 30 hours, and woke
up thinking it was just a short nap!

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.000
30 hours!

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.330
In the following years researchers did more
organized, controlled studies, and found … when

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.980
isolated from light and other external markers
of time, it’s not that uncommon for us to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.440
fall into longer sleep cycles.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.640
All of this could be a great natural starting
point for hacking our sleep to fit our space-travel

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.110
needs, but it won’t get us all the way there;
since extended sleep periods are often followed

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.820
by extended waking periods.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.460
So we’re gonna need something a little more
sophisticated than a dark room to get us into

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.460
deep space.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.010
And luckily for future Mark Watney’s---
there are lots of scientists trying to figure

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.010
this out.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.490
One of the most exciting projects is in the
works is at a company called SpaceWorks Enterprises,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.860
yes that is the name of a real company that
actually exists.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.720
They’ve been working with NASA to develop
a stasis chamber they say could keep astronauts

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.700
asleep for 2 weeks at a time, and possibly
longer.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.570
Now, I know what you’re thinking, two weeks
won’t get me to Mars!

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.250
And, you're right, but SpaceWorks has a
plan for that -- they suggest stacking these

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.490
shorter hibernation periods back to back,
with a couple of days in between to walk around

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.530
and stretch out.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.040
The crew can rotate waking and sleeping shifts,
and voila!

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.110
You’ll be in deep space before you know
it.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.140
First, this design isn’t for an individual
sleep pod, but a shared sleeping chamber.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.920
The chamber works by lowering a group of astronaut’s
body temperatures to 32 degrees celsius, then

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.849
it sedates them to suppress the body’s reactions
to the cold.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.370
The low temp would put their bodies into a
mild hypothermia, slowing down your metabolic

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.110
rate and preventing injury from lack of oxygen.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.230
Robotic arms will check up on the astronauts
while they slumber, and any bodily waste will

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.900
be -- well let’s just say there are catheters involved.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.140
Sounds like hypersleep to ME!

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.550
Aside from greatly reducing the necessary
food and water for the mission, these stasis

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.920
chambers could also have some other major
benefits, like requiring a smaller area to

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.180
be thoroughly protected from radiation.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.460
The researchers also want to equip the chambers
with artificial gravity, which could prevent

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.260
a lot of the negative health effects associated
with long term space travel.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.750
But Danger, Will Robinson!

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.500
Don’t try taking one of these bad boys to
Proxima Centauri.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.200
We still haven’t figured out how to slow
down aging, so even though you wouldn’t

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.120
have to be entertained and fed on the 81,000
year journey, you’d still be VERY dead by

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.570
the time you get there.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.020
Sadly, these don’t exist yet, so if we send
astronauts to mars in the 2030s they might

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.060
just have to sleep like normal humans.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.130
In the meantime, as a person who enjoys a
good cold nap, I hope they make an Earth version.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.600
Figuring out how to sleep our way to Mars
is one thing, but what do we eat once we get

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600
there?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.490
NASA is working on that too, you can check
out our video about it, here.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.180
And one last thing, doctors actually already
use mild hypothermic states like these to

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.510
prevent brain damage after cardiac arrest.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.750
Saving lives and getting us to space at the
same time.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.290
Man, science is cool.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.790
Thanks for watching!
