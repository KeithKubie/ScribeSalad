can actually be fairly sure of one thing

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620
can actually be fairly sure of one thing
 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.199
can actually be fairly sure of one thing
that contributes which is they don't

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209
that contributes which is they don't
 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.520
that contributes which is they don't
like the feeling that they're being

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530
like the feeling that they're being
 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.920
like the feeling that they're being
pushed around by outside influences like

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930
pushed around by outside influences like
 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.719
pushed around by outside influences like
the United States showing up and telling

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729
the United States showing up and telling
 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.629
the United States showing up and telling
them what to do and so we can create

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639
them what to do and so we can create
 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.360
them what to do and so we can create
hostility to the United States by saying

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370
hostility to the United States by saying
 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.189
hostility to the United States by saying
oh we're showing up to defend the

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199
oh we're showing up to defend the
 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.960
oh we're showing up to defend the
stability of Middle East oil supplies

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970
stability of Middle East oil supplies
 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.350
stability of Middle East oil supplies
but we can't actually defend Middle East

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360
but we can't actually defend Middle East
 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.930
but we can't actually defend Middle East
oil supplies from local instability in

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940
oil supplies from local instability in
 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.490
oil supplies from local instability in
the Middle East

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500
the Middle East
 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.860
the Middle East
very well and so we've actually created

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870
very well and so we've actually created
 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.950
very well and so we've actually created
a lot of the problems in the oil market

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960
a lot of the problems in the oil market
 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.250
a lot of the problems in the oil market
however all of that said the global oil

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260
however all of that said the global oil
 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.130
however all of that said the global oil
market protects us so we don't actually

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140
market protects us so we don't actually
 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.100
market protects us so we don't actually
have to worry as much about that kind of

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110
have to worry as much about that kind of
 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.380
have to worry as much about that kind of
instability in any particular oil

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390
instability in any particular oil
 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.510
instability in any particular oil
supplier so what happens in the oil

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520
supplier so what happens in the oil
 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.820
supplier so what happens in the oil
market is when there's a disruption in

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830
market is when there's a disruption in
 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.490
market is when there's a disruption in
one country of the world that reduces

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500
one country of the world that reduces
 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.620
one country of the world that reduces
their oil supplies their ability to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630
their oil supplies their ability to
 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.210
their oil supplies their ability to
supply the global market to supply

supply the global market to supply
 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.010
supply the global market to supply
consumers like us in the United States

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020
consumers like us in the United States
 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.880
consumers like us in the United States
when there's that kind of a disruption

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890
when there's that kind of a disruption
 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.970
when there's that kind of a disruption
other suppliers compensate so suppliers

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980
other suppliers compensate so suppliers
 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.220
other suppliers compensate so suppliers
that aren't comp that aren't disrupted

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230
that aren't comp that aren't disrupted
 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.980
that aren't comp that aren't disrupted
see an opportunity to make more money

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990
see an opportunity to make more money
 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.010
see an opportunity to make more money
for themselves by increasing their oil

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020
for themselves by increasing their oil
 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.260
for themselves by increasing their oil
output to compensate for the fact that

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270
output to compensate for the fact that
 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.630

one of their competitors has reduced

one of their competitors has reduced
 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.270
one of their competitors has reduced
their oil output so for example when

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280
their oil output so for example when
 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.070
their oil output so for example when
Libya exploded into civil war and then

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080
Libya exploded into civil war and then
 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.100
Libya exploded into civil war and then
US and European intervention wrecked -

and made the Civil War last not just a
 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.900
and made the Civil War last not just a
few months in 2011 but persist for the

few months in 2011 but persist for the
 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.300
few months in 2011 but persist for the
last seven years such that Libyan oil

last seven years such that Libyan oil
 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.110
last seven years such that Libyan oil
output is way down millions of barrels a

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120
output is way down millions of barrels a
 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.780

day down compared to what it was before

2011 didn't lead to a huge disruption of

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450
2011 didn't lead to a huge disruption of
 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.210
2011 didn't lead to a huge disruption of
the oil market didn't lead to a big

the oil market didn't lead to a big
 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.920
the oil market didn't lead to a big
price surge for consumers like the

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930
price surge for consumers like the
 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.260
price surge for consumers like the
United States because other producers of

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270
United States because other producers of
 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.080
United States because other producers of
oil like Saudi Arabia like the United

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090
oil like Saudi Arabia like the United

Arab Emirates like Mexico you know all

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450
Arab Emirates like Mexico you know all
 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.110
Arab Emirates like Mexico you know all
around the world increased their output

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120
around the world increased their output
 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.240
around the world increased their output
to compensate for the fact that Libya

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250
to compensate for the fact that Libya
 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.480
to compensate for the fact that Libya
was producing less and so the natural

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490
was producing less and so the natural
 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.750

market reaction without the US military

market reaction without the US military
doing anything enables consumers to

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720
doing anything enables consumers to
 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.840
doing anything enables consumers to
continue consuming in the face of

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850
continue consuming in the face of
 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.790
continue consuming in the face of
political military disruptions of the

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800
political military disruptions of the
 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.560
political military disruptions of the
oil market in one country around the

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570
oil market in one country around the
 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.380
oil market in one country around the
world so we don't need to try to use the

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390
world so we don't need to try to use the
 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.510
world so we don't need to try to use the
American military to protect oil markets

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520
American military to protect oil markets
 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.610
American military to protect oil markets
because the market compensates for

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620
because the market compensates for
 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.400
because the market compensates for
disruptions and in fact our track record

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410
disruptions and in fact our track record
 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.320
disruptions and in fact our track record
of using the US military to protect oil

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330
of using the US military to protect oil
 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.219
of using the US military to protect oil
markets is lousy it often makes the

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229
markets is lousy it often makes the
 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.510
markets is lousy it often makes the
problems worse not

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520
problems worse not
 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.029

and so there's a clear policy adjustment

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039
and so there's a clear policy adjustment
 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.529
and so there's a clear policy adjustment
the United States could make to stop

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539
the United States could make to stop
 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:47.899
the United States could make to stop
using the military for this purpose and

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909
using the military for this purpose and
 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:51.360
using the military for this purpose and
that would make Americans safer and

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370
that would make Americans safer and
 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.460
that would make Americans safer and
continue to give us a reliable oil

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470
continue to give us a reliable oil
 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.340
