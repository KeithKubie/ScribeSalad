00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.529
The most abundant mineral in the world was
so far inside the Earth that you probably

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:07.529
never heard of it.

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.049
They should have called it hipsterite.

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:21.400
The Earth's most abundant mineral was discovered
in 1879, and until THIS YEAR it didn't have

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.730
a name.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.720
What did they call it before now?

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.720
All the things?

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.720
That stuff?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.720
Hey you!

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.720
Yeah, all-ah you!

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.210
Nah, they called it silicate-perovskite…
which is kind of a mouthful.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.530
So, this week, after 135 years of unnecessary
complication, the mineral has a name -- bridgmanite.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.219
If that's anticlimactic for you, I can see
why.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:48.060
Here’s why it took so long to get the name:
just because a geologist discovers something

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.160
like silicate-perovskite, doesn't mean it's
a material!

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.649
See, in 1879, a meteor shower allowed a number
of rocks to fall from space onto Australia

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.489
and on that meteorite they found something
called a silicate-perovskite crystal.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.711
The substance is a magnesium-iron (or calcium)
silicate, which follows a perovskite crystal

00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:11.100
pattern.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.960
It looks like a cube, but it’s made of two
positively charged elements held together

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.640
by a third negatively charged one.[a]

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.980
Bridgmanite is thought to make up about 38
percent of the WHOLE PLANET by volume, BUT

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.640
it can ONLY exist at high temperatures and
pressures.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.640
Where on the planet can you get that cocktail
of mineral goodness?

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.149
In the mantle!

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.549
The 25 mile thick (32 km) crust of the Earth
floats on the upper mantle, and the lower

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.219
mantle, where temperatures can reach 5000
degrees Celsius and pressures can reach 1.4

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.010
million times the pressure at sea level - that
contains the bridgemanite.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.320
The big deal is, we've never PROVED that's
what it was.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.330
Scientists have done experiments that showed
the mantle was made of bridgmanite, but they

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.930
couldn't perfectly confirm what they were
seeing.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.820
Bridgmanite only appeared in the lab, or on
meteorites which had been in high-energy collisions

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.890
which mimicked the pressure and temperature
found at the center of a planet! [[breathe]]

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.090
Which, as you might imagine, is a fairly rare
find.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.090
Normally, proof lies in the pudding, right?

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.170
Scientists had never found a naturally occurring
sample that they could prove, without a doubt,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.410
was bridgemanite!

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.200
See, when you put bridgemanite into an electron
microscope, it turns into glass…

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.530
So they get a sample, pop it into an electron
microscope to probe its nanostructure… but

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.710
the electron beams would react with the bridgemanite
and turn it to glass!!!

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.950
I KNOW!!

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.300
So, they came up with a new way… a synchrotron,
which sounds like an awesomely 80s carnival

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.840
ride, but it's actually a kind of particle
accelerator which uses high-energy X-rays.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.920
Finally, 135 years after its discovery, they
could prove what they were seeing was silicate-perovskite

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.340
and the International Mineralogical Association
was all like, okay, NOW you can name it.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.511
Which is pretty frickin' amazing when you
get right down to it.

00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:07.060
It was so exciting for the scientists, they
published their findings in the November issue

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.070
of the journal Science.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.660
Of course, they called it bridgemanite after
the inventor of high-pressure crystallography,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.660
Percy Bridgeman.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.070
I mean, they could have called it hipsterite
because it's so underground, but whatever

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.070
dudes.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.070
It's your rock.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.370
If you're like me, you're wondering what a
century of studying this silicate-perovskite

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.710
thingy was all for!

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.680
Well, the meteorite formed 4.5 billion years
ago, around the same time as Earth.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.460
That gives scientists a better understanding
of what THAT was like, as well as what's happening

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.420
in the innermost regions of the Earth!

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.290
So while you and me might not get much from
Bridgemanite, you'll know its name now.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.840
And that's something for bar trivia, for sure.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:04:09.680
What would YOU have named an ancient crystalline
mineral that makes up a third 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680
of the Earth?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.470
It's everywhereite?
