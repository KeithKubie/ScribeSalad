00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.000
Could you write a method that
downloads in the background and

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.860
then returns the image once it's done?

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.248
Try to write one, I'll wait.

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:19.850
No luck?

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.630
That's because it's impossible.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.180
Let's see why.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.870
When you call a function and
wait for it to return,

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.599
you're making an assumption you
probably never paid attention to.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.070
You have seen the function
knows where to return.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.900
This is fine in serial synchronous
code where the calling code

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.592
will be blocked until
the function returns.

00:00:39.592 --> 00:00:42.910
In asynchronous code, however,
the calling code may continue

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.645
doing something else, therefore,
we need to provide the function,

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:50.735
with the information on what it
needs to do once it's finished.

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:55.482
In SWF, that information could be passed
in a closure, a completion closure.

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:57.537
You've seen many so
far, in Apple's code.

00:00:57.537 --> 00:01:00.523
Now, you're going to write your own.

00:01:00.523 --> 00:01:01.435
Yeah!
