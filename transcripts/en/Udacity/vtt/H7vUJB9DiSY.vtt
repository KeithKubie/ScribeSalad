00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It turns out the answer is no, not all problems have efficient algorithms.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
They are some that actually require an exponential amount of running time.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For example, an algorithm may have a bound of Î¸(2â ż).

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So an n gets larger, this is getting larger and larger and larger very very quickly.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So this is considered not efficient.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We're going to talk in this course about any other problems that have provable lower bounds

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that are exponential that is to say that there can be no polynomial time solution to them.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There is one in the literature, which is a generalization of checkers

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that you can learn more about if you take a course in complexity.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But what I would like to talk about is this sort of funny gap between the problems that we know

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
have efficient solutions that have polynomial running time,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and the problems that we know do not have efficient solutions.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
They have the fastest algorithms that could run for them have to take of this exponential time.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Then in between here there's a gap.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There's actually some very very important problems that we don't know

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
whether they have a polynomial time solution of if they require exponential time.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
They are just kind off hovering in this no man's land. The great unknown.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There's lot of different kinds of classes of problems that live in this gap,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but I'm going to focus on for this unit is a class of problems known as the NP complete problems.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
They are not the only problems that fall in here, but they are very important class

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and probably the best studied class of problems that actually fall in this gap

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
where we just don't know if they are polynomial or exponential running time,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and it's really frustrating that we don't know where this problems lie, but we do know something,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and that is for all the NP complete problems

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
either they are all easy and they fit in the polynomial running time class or they are all hard

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and they fit in the exponential time running class.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We don't know which it is, but we do know that they can all be hang together,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and so sometimes it's very useful if your studying a problem to discover whether it belongs

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
to this funny class of NP complete problems

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that fit in the gap, so that's what we're going to take a look at.
