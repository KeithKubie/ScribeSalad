CAMDEN OLSON: Danny, ready?

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.999
Buddy.

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:03.915
[MAKES KISSING SOUNDS]

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:05.780
Sit.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.270
My career path is that I want
to work with service dogs,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.640
to be able to communicate
with an animal

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.510
and to teach that animal
to literally save someone's

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.650
life on a regular basis.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.220
When I work with a dog, I just --

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.450
I feel like I have a purpose.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.900
My name is Camden Olson.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.660
I'm Class of 2019.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.930
I'm majoring in ecology
and evolutionary biology

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.350
with a certificate
in cognitive science.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.780
I knew I loved dogs
and that I wanted

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.930
to train service dogs from
a pretty young age, since I

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.370
was 7.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.790
Ever since then, I've been
trying to train guide dogs

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.870
and service dogs.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.780
I've just fell in love
with it more and more.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.140
I decided to take
a gap year and so

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.400
I took a year off between
high school and college

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.990
to raise a guide dog.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.650
I just -- I hadn't quite had
the time yet and the experience

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.220
to fully devote to
training and what

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.880
I wanted to do in terms
of training service dogs,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.150
and so my gap year
was my opportunity

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.840
to be able to do that.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.464
SUBJECT 1: That is
how gentle they are.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.470
CAMDEN OLSON: I am really
interested in animal behavior.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.840
For my thesis, I want to train
a diabetic alert dog and then

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.130
so answer research
questions on that,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.190
and then take the dog
into a middle school

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.520
and have the dog work with
middle school students

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.350
who have trouble
paying attention

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.340
and see if there are any
effects on student performance

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.020
and behavior in the classroom.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.478
CHRISTINA RIEHL:
Could you identify

00:01:37.478 --> 00:01:40.010
a list of candidate
schools that might

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.330
be the ones that you approach?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.950
CAMDEN OLSON: OK.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.480
CHRISTINA RIEHL: You
know what I mean?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.100
Like say --

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.330
CAMDEN OLSON: I
have two professors

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.990
that I've been working with,
both in the EEB department.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.140
And one of them in
particular, Professor Riehl,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.320
she is amazing.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.310
She's so enthusiastic
and supportive.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.070
And I've been talking to her
about what I want to study

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.970
and what kind of
research I want to do,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.420
-- details about the experiment.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.090
What I love is the training
as much as I love the dogs,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.660
and you work together with
a dog to succeed as a team.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.500
I am just so
passionate about it.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.870
It's -- the effect that
the dogs have on people,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.150
the feeling that I
get when training.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.790
And just all of it is
just so incredible to me

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.605
that it's really hard
to put into words.

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:22.355
Ready --

00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:24.230
But it really leaves
me speechless how

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.510
I feel when I work with a dog.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.010
Good job.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.690
Good boy, yeah.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.290
Ready?

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.990
Danny out.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.490
Yes, good job.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.990
Yeah.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.490
Good boy.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.740
