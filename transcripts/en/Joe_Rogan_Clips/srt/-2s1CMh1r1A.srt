1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,830
I guess the Cliche is the modern, the
modern left, whatever people call it.

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:05,581
Like the,
you know,

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:10,581
capital l tribal left seems to be being
indoctrinated not by left wing policy

4
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:13,920
ideas. It's not about necessarily
socialism, it's about identity.

5
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:18,360
Arianism it's about policy based on
your immutable characteristics and how,

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,550
you know,
like going back to the green new deal,

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,520
like in the bill it talks
about racial equity,

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,150
what does that do to the environment?
But what does it mean? Um,

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,930
well equality would be like,
ew, ew. Equal opportunity to,

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,530
people are allowed to
try and if one succeeds,
congratulations, equity would be,

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,360
well let's determine whether or not you
are advantaged or privileged and then

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,530
hold you back or push you forward
based on these, these certain metrics.

13
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:47,760
I suppose it's, it's the problem I have
with it is that it's not quantifiable.

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,340
So this was actually something
that was really shocking to me.

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,820
I was sitting with my niece,
uh, and my, my sister,

16
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,150
my niece and my mom and I showed
this image that people like to share.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,720
It's three people standing
up by a baseball of offense.

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,470
And there's a base is a baseball game
as a really short person who can't see.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,010
There is a medium sized person who can
see a little bit and a very tall person

20
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:11,250
who just stands right up above the fence.
It says this is equality.

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,540
Each of them gets one crate,

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,870
one crate isn't enough for the short
guy and the two guys can already see.

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,830
I says this is equity and it shows
the short guy getting, you know,

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,290
three crates so they can all see now.
And I said,

25
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:26,340
the problem is when it comes to someone's
height, sure we can understand, let's,

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,580
let's, let's give the the crates to the
short guy so he can see along with us.

27
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,810
But how do you determine equity based on
the color of someone's skin or they're,

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,350
you know, like characteristics that
can't necessarily be quantified. Right?

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,220
So when Alexandria Ocozzio Cortez pushes
a bill forward that's purporting to be

30
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:44,010
about the environment,
but includes racial equity clauses,

31
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,420
are we to assume that her ideology
states that if you are not white,

32
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,320
you are poor by deaf?

33
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,550
Like it's a guarantee or do we have to
assume that each individual has different

34
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,970
advantages, different cards to play,
and some are born wealthy, some aren't.

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,500
And yes, there's historic
racism, but we can't make those
assumptions. Right? Right.

36
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,010
So this is, this is, to me,

37
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:05,590
one of the biggest problems I've been
having as like a lifelong left-leaning

38
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,160
individuals. Who do I vote for her? Right?

39
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,780
I was a big fan of Bernie
Sanders for awhile,

40
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,480
but then Bernie Sanders gets up
on stage at the debates and says,

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,740
white people don't know what it's like
to be poor. Well, that's hilarious.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,830
W Go to fucking West Virginia
and visit the coal miners. Right?

43
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,780
And you know what's really weird?

44
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,860
I saw one of Bernie's tweets that I
looked at and I said, oh, come on man.

45
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,210
You know,
this is fucked up.

46
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,510
He was talking about how much more money
white men make than black women and

47
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,430
Latino men and all these different things.

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,840
And what he didn't include was Asian men.
Well, because Asian men make more money.

49
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,740
But here's what I think a lot of people
on the right miss. He said pay equity,

50
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,110
not pay equality.
Okay.

51
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,290
I think perhaps we should stop assuming
they don't know what they're saying

52
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,980
because a lot of people
assume what they're saying
is, you know, the, the gender,

53
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,720
the gender earnings gap is, is
real. But the gender pay gap,

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,100
it's um,

55
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,520
that if a man and a woman are
both offered the exact same job,

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,730
exact same experience in education,
women tend to get,

57
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:10,530
I think it's like three to 5% less. And
many people believe that's because they,

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,990
they're less likely to negotiate.
Just why you have like lean in,

59
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:17,200
tell women to be more, you know,
trying to be more assertive. Um,

60
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,940
but it's not this 77% number that's,
but there is an earnings gap, right?

61
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,520
The median salaries of men
and women are different.

62
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,170
So when Bernie says white men make x
more than these other demographics,

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,350
he said in his tweet,
pay equity, not equality.

64
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,610
He doesn't want fair pay for everyone
based on job. He's actually saying,

65
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,180
it doesn't matter what job you have,
everyone should be paid the same. Yeah,

66
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,360
that's nonsense. But then you see
what Cortez releases on our website.

67
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,880
If you're unwilling to work,
they'll provide economic security.

68
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,210
They actually mine, I believe
they took it off the site. Right?

69
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,050
But I think when they included in
the bill that they want equity,

70
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:55,480
not equality when they include on
their website. If you're unwilling,

71
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:57,310
they'll pay you.
And when Bernie says equity as well,

72
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:00,360
I think they're not talking about
equality. Like I don't think you know,

73
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,340
the average American understands what
they're actually saying is you should be

74
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,720
paid a flat rate period.

75
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,990
And when you're talking about the pay
gap being different from men and women,

76
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:08,830
we should clarify that.

77
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:13,330
What you're saying essentially is that
men choose different jobs and they work

78
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:13,331
more hours.

79
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:16,900
And that's the reason why they make that
much more money where it's 77 cents on

80
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,230
the dollar. Yeah. There. There was a,

81
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,110
an another study came out recently that
said that hours worked was almost the,

82
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,230
uh, 100% of the reason why men
and women earn different, uh,

83
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,210
at a median median salary. In some areas
a women actually earn more than men. Uh,

84
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,740
and there's I think seven cities.
I think this was on pew again, you,

85
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:39,040
you fact check me if you got
you, everybody thinks I'm
wrong or whatever. But uh,

86
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,220
I believe it was seven cities where
women out earn men by like seriously high

87
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,660
numbers,
like up to 20%.

88
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,430
So there's a lot of issues when it
comes to the pay gap and equality.

89
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,510
But without going on a tangent in that
area, I think what ends up happening is,

90
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,200
you know, I saw Bernie's tweet and I
responded to it by saying good news,

91
00:04:56,201 --> 00:05:00,100
Bernie pay equality is enshrined in law.
And I signed it.

92
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,330
I cited three examples of where it's
illegal to discriminate based on gender.

93
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,990
And then someone pointed out to me, Tim,
he didn't say quality is said equity.

94
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,170
That would imply it doesn't
matter what job you have.

95
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,960
A petroleum engineer should earn the
same as a store clerk at h and m that's

96
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:17,860
equity that just because you
have an advantage because
if education doesn't mean

97
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:20,050
you should earn more than somebody else.
You see what I'm saying?

98
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,740
So the fact that there's people
that actually believe that,

99
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,430
that don't believe that
w w w first of all,

100
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:30,400
that's going to absolutely discourage
people from trying to succeed.

101
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,600
Why would you,

102
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,760
if you could get the same amount as the
CEO of Exxon as you can working at 21

103
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:41,500
forever, forever 21 or whatever,
Abercrombie and Fitch, why would you,

104
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,830
why would you try hard? Why would
you exceed? Why would you succeed?

105
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,180
Why would you excel?

106
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,410
I think it's fair to point out some
people would you know what if there's no,

107
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,830
if there's no real,
I mean other than social status,

108
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,440
if there's no reveal real consequences.

109
00:05:56,441 --> 00:06:00,160
I think social status might be one
of the prime driving factors of,

110
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,780
of most people. I don't
know, man. Not Enough.

111
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:07,310
Not enough to really encourage innovation
and progress. I can agree with that.

112
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,530
For sure.
But I also think there's a,

113
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,550
there was a saying that I was told a lot
that people don't get rich because they

114
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:13,941
want money,

115
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,100
they get rich because they're passionate
about something and the money comes

116
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:18,290
after, you know, they always say that the
money comes after something like that.

117
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,460
And I'd point out every,
every day I take no days off.

118
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,070
It's been a couple of years
with me not taking any days off.

119
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,750
I work literally every day full time.

120
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,210
Right now I'm producing six
youtube videos every day.

121
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,790
Only one of them is a real seven
days a week, seven days a week,

122
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,030
nonstop for two years straight. Fuck you
doing it yourself. I like it. It's fun.

123
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,130
And that's a thing. I'm
not, I'm not doing it.

124
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:40,370
You're enjoying this old lady down
the tunnel. I do it because, you know,

125
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:44,000
I see things on, uh, so for the most
part on, on my main youtube channel,

126
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,160
I do one video every day at 4:00 PM,

127
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:49,880
which tends to be just like a news
analysis piece. But I'm not perfect.

128
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:51,920
Sometimes I, you know, get
all hyperbolic and stuff.

129
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,560
My second channel is me
just ranting and you know,

130
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,620
not really swearing but still
just like heavy opinion stuff.

131
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,440
I do it because it's fun. You know, I
see something, I want to explore it. Uh,

132
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,590
I used to travel all the time.
You know, when I worked at vice,

133
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:06,050
I was in all these different countries
and all these dangerous places.

134
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,600
Not because I wanted to
have a name for myself,

135
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,540
not because I wanted to make money,
I wanted to watch a revolution.

136
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,150
I want to know why it was happening and
I want to talk to the people who are

137
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:16,100
experiencing it. So I can, I can,

138
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,640
I can relate to people who say
money isn't a motivator for sure.

139
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,380
But I've also talked to
people in Scandinavia who
have told me they sort of give

140
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:27,530
up at a certain point because I
can't remember which country it was.

141
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,920
It may have been Sweden or uh,
or Norway.

142
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,760
But these two women told me that
after like $77,000 per year,

143
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:36,710
they tax like 80% of your income.
So people just stop.

144
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,500
They literally just stopped.
That's another proposition, right?

145
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,040
This is something else that's
been discussed in terms
of anyone who makes more

146
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,210
than x amount per year,

147
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:49,130
taxing them over 70% I agree with
the progressive tax wholeheartedly.

148
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,660
I disagree with a number that high.
What do you think it should be? I don't,

149
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,130
I don't know. But I will say we
need more progressive brackets.

150
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,710
We need to keep going. And
you know, I gotta say maybe,

151
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:03,350
maybe at $10 million 70% does make sense.

152
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:06,740
But I kind of leaned towards not really,
cause it seems like man,

153
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:09,020
that's a lot of money. That's a lot.
That's, that's, that's more, that's,

154
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,460
that's ridiculous amount.
You know,

155
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:14,390
I think Steve Bannon said something
like a five in front of it or something.

156
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,340
But I don't know.
I'm not an economist,

157
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,890
but I do believe a progressive
tax makes the most sense.

158
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,640
And I can explain it to you if you want
to hear it. Sure. So there was a study,

159
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,750
I believe it was from Harvard,
you need $77,000 per year,

160
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,890
as may have been 10 years ago,

161
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,770
in order to be middleclass
median in the United States.

162
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,540
That means if you make 77,000 you'll
have a vacation, you'll have insurance,

163
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,550
you'll have a car, you can raise a
family, you can send them to school,

164
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,220
all that stuff, but you have
nothing left over for savings.

165
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:43,370
You have nothing left over for
investments. If you make $100,000 a year,

166
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:47,510
you're gonna have $23,000 leftover for
investing. Eventually. At a certain point,

167
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,320
if you only need $77,000 if
you're making 10 million,

168
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,500
you've got 9,000,900 900,000 that you
can invest and just be independently

169
00:08:56,701 --> 00:09:00,510
wealthy and be rich forever. Now, I have
no problem with being wealthy. I have no,

170
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,090
I have no problem with other people
being wealthy and living off of their

171
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:06,330
investments and all that. But there is a
point where you have to realize the, the,

172
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,130
the coalescing of power,

173
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,760
the monopolizing of power is a really
dangerous thing for any society to few

174
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:14,520
individuals holding too much
power can destabilize an economy,

175
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,250
can destabilize a country.
The problem with communism,

176
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,850
you snap your fingers and you put
a centralized authority in place.

177
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,470
At least that's how it's
been every single time.

178
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,780
And then they hold all the
cards and they can oppress over,

179
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:28,320
they want the problem with laissez faire.
Capitalism has over time,

180
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,080
which is why it's better
in a lot of ways over time.

181
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,920
It eventually becomes a
centralized oligopoly of a
few corporations controlling

182
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,210
everything,
which we're kind of seeing now.

183
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,530
So all the progressive tax can
really do is slow that process down,

184
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,240
which I think is a good
thing. But ultimately I think
just looking at the system,

185
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,100
eventually you end up
kind of where we are,

186
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:50,460
where six media companies control
everything. And then, you know,

187
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:54,150
some companies are the biggest funders
of certain politicians and corporations

188
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,890
is to have too much power. I
mean, there, there is, uh, I,

189
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,930
I remember reading a report or a story
about how wealthy people have like three

190
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:07,650
or four times more ability to influence
a politician than like the majority of

191
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:10,500
the people in the country simply
because paying for expensive dinners and

192
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:14,910
lobbying earns you favors, you
know, super pacs paying, you know,

193
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,620
guaranteeing funding for, for a politician
earns your favors. So it's, you know,

194
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:22,290
look, if a million people
tell me they want you know, x,

195
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,250
but the people who are paying me like pa
funding my campaign are paying me more.

196
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,110
Well,
who am I going to provide favors too?

197
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,990
And then once I'm done with my campaign
run, I can go to job at their company.

198
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,010
Yet these are problems.
So without going on too big of a rant,

199
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,030
I think ultimately a progressive tax can
help slow the process down of special

200
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,970
interests, acquiring too much
power. Eventually it happens anyway.

201
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,290
But with a flat tax,

202
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:47,190
you're basically saying at a certain
point you can just keep dumping more and

203
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,300
more money into different investments,

204
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:51,600
making more and more money and increasing
your power exponentially and other

205
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:54,680
people can't catch up to you and
then power becomes too quick. Right?

206
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,240
Yeah.

207
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,240
I think in this country we tried to look
at success and achievement is something

208
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:06,440
that everyone's striving for and we don't
want to put any restrictions on that.

209
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,710
Yeah,

210
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,950
we look at capitalism is the reason why
everything's going so great over here.

211
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,370
This is America. Atlanta, the free home
of the brave go out there and kick ass.

212
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,670
We're not going to saddle
you now with debt. Um,

213
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,510
but it makes sense that after
a while as we're seeing today,

214
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,670
but I don't mean what is,
what's the best way to do it?

215
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:26,390
I mean is not going to work.
What does work?

216
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,260
I think a mixed economy, well mixed
economy where we are right now, right?

217
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:33,770
A portion of income is paid in taxes from
government programs for the, for the,

218
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,900
um,
for defense and things like that.

219
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,440
I just think we have a big problem with
corruption. I think we've got bloat.

220
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,090
I think we've got government agencies
that instead of reforming and breaking

221
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:47,080
them down, we just slept
more bandaids on top. Yeah,

222
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,760
we've got a festering wound and we're
putting bandages over bandages. You know,

223
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:51,410
it's like a certain
point you got to Redo it.

224
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,120
We also have systems that
are in place that, I mean,

225
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,540
in terms of like the way communities have
always existed in certain communities,

226
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:06,420
there's just poverty and crime and no
one does anything to fix it. Right.

227
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,000
And it seems to be that we'll,

228
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,100
we're more than willing to go to other
countries and nation built were more than

229
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:14,500
willing to pump money
into different countries,

230
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,960
especially if they have natural resources.
But in our own country, we're not,

231
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:18,340
I mean,
the,

232
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,580
the greatest resources of course human
beings and the best way to make America

233
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:24,400
great or stronger would be
to have less losers. Well,

234
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:27,280
what's the best way to have less losers?
To have more people succeed?

235
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,810
What's the best way to
have more people succeed?

236
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,320
Give them more opportunity and
chance to not be stuck in a quagmire,

237
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,150
not be trapped in a ghetto.
This is, yeah. So, uh,

238
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,050
I believe we should allocate access
from other areas to improve the certain

239
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,840
areas. In that sense, I believe
in socialism to a certain extent.

240
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,540
Like I will leave in it with,
with fire departments.

241
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,830
I believe in it with
the police department.

242
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:50,480
I believe we should spend money
that comes out of, you know,

243
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,920
the public pool to fix things.
Right. I look at New York,

244
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,300
there are some neighborhoods
that are really bad,

245
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,340
some neighborhoods that are really good.
Well,

246
00:12:57,341 --> 00:13:01,780
if we take access from the really great
neighborhoods and use that to fix roads,

247
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,190
pay for schools in poor neighborhoods,

248
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,150
crime is one of the biggest
correlations for crimes. Poverty. Yes.

249
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:11,410
So if we can get better schools, we need
to reform the school system straight up.

250
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,170
If we can get better hospitals,
if you can fix the roads,

251
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,320
then we're doing a lot to reduce
crime and we're just poverty.

252
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:21,730
And a rising tide lifts all ships.
Yes. So that's why, you know, I,

253
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,450
that's why I like Bernie Sanders,
although I will, I say I make sure,

254
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:28,500
I tell people like, he has a little
too left for me. He is, but when we're,

255
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,290
when we're looking at who we had in
2016 I was like, yeah, Bernie's my guy.
