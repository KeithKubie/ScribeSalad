In the star network the description is that there is a center node

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to which all other nodes are connected using the edge.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There are n-1 other nodes if you choose one center, and each is connected

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to the center node with one edge so there are two n-1 edges and that seems good.
