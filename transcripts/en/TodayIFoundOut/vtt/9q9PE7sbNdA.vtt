00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.549
Phoebe Ann Moses, better known as “Annie
Oakley,” made a name for herself as one

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.109
of the best sharpshooters in the world throughout
her lifetime.

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.090
In the process, she overcame a childhood filled
with abuse and adversity to become not only

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.619
an enormously successful entertainer, but
a role model for women and young girls.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.340
Born in 1860, Annie’s father, Jacob, died
of pneumonia when she was six years old.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.399
Her mother, Susan, briefly remarried, but
her second husband likewise died shortly thereafter.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.769
Struggling to provide for her seven surviving
children (she had nine total up to this point),

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.300
Susan sent two of her children, the 8-10 year
old Annie (her exact age at this time is not

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.620
definitively known) and Sarah, off to the
county “poor house,” called the Darke

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.679
County Infirmary.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.800
From here, Annie was sent to work for a family
she would later refer to simply as “the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800
wolves.”

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.890
During her time in the wolf-den, she was severely
abused and functioned as a virtual slave for

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.910
the family.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.070
After two long years of this, she decided
she’d had enough and fled back to the infirmary.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.850
Supposedly the numerous scars on Annie’s
back convinced Nancy Edington, the wife of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.570
the superintendent of the infirmary, to see
to it that Annie was not sent back when the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.420
“he-wolf” came to collect her.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.109
After he was sent away and told in no uncertain
terms Annie would never be given back to him,

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:35.149
Oakley later stated, “That night I slept
untroubled for the first time in long months.”

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.170
Annie remained with the Edingtons for an unclear
amount of time, learning to sew and make clothes

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.179
until her mother married one Joseph Shaw,
and she was able to return home.

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.250
Not a financial burden at all, as it turns
out, Annie almost immediately began supporting

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.619
her poverty-stricken mother, step-father,
and six surviving siblings by utilizing her

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.950
talents with a gun.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.560
Beyond putting food on the table via shooting
and trapping various game, she was also able

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.130
to sell some of it to certain local businesses,
earning enough money to pay off the approximately

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.610
$200 mortgage (about $4500 today) on her mother’s
small farm by age 15.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.050
Due to the somewhat unorthodox (particularly
for the era) role the young teen took on as

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.190
her family’s provider, Annie was forced
to put her education on the back burner, rarely

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.350
attending school.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.070
Perhaps because of this, later in life she
made countless donations to charities that

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.760
helped orphans and women in need get educated.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.400
It was around this time (the exact date is
disputed, either 1875, when Annie was 15,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.790
or 1880, when she was 20) that Annie entered
a Thanksgiving Day shooting competition, going

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.780
up against famed marksman Frank E. Butler,
13 years her senior.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.250
One by one Butler outshot the local competition,
until he went up against Annie.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.760
She hit all 25 of her targets, while he only
managed 24 of 25.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.770
Rather than be sore about losing to the young
lady (and losing a $100 bet in the process,

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.620
about $2200 today), he went the other way
and started courting her.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.420
Less than a year later, the pair married,
either in 1876 or 1881.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.930
In 1885, the happy couple joined Buffalo Bill’s
Wild West show.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.940
A small-time star on the vaudeville circuit
up to this point, her time with Buffalo Bill’s

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.420
show ultimately vaulted her into superstardom
across the U.S. and parts of Europe, with

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.790
her staple tricks including things like shooting
a playing card edge on at great distance,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.930
then putting several bullet holes through
its face as it flew wildly through the air

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.181
to the ground; shooting out candle flames;
and shooting cigarettes and cigars from her

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.950
husband’s lips.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.640
This brings us to 1898.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.900
Although women were making small strides toward
equality, they were still a long ways off

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.120
on countless fronts.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.440
Most pertinent to this article, women were
forbidden to join the military in any potential

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.440
combat role.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.410
That’s not to say none of them tried.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.760
By the 20th century, a handful of women, disguised
as men, had joined U.S. war efforts in combat

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.400
roles under false names.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.840
Once the disguised women were found out, however,
they were immediately discharged, usually

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.010
dishonorably.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.650
The fact that women were highly discouraged
from engaging with the enemy did not deter

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.739
Annie Oakley.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.940
When it appeared that the United States was
on the brink of war with Spain around the

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.980
turn of the century, Annie offered her services
to train a team of female sharpshooters for

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.980
the war.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.140
In her letter to President McKinley, she wrote:

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.690
Dear Sir, I for one feel confident that your
good judgment will carry America safely through

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.940
without war.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.900
But in case of such an event I am ready to
place a company of 50 lady sharpshooters at

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.900
your disposal.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.180
Every one of them will be an American, and
as they will furnish their own arms and ammunition,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.280
will be little, if any, expense to the government.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.290
Very truly,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.290
Annie Oakley

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.470
Whether or not Oakley received a response
from the President or whether her offer went

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.680
completely ignored is unclear, but the President
certainly didn’t enlist Oakley’s help.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.560
Annie_Oakley2Oakley extended the same offer
to the government during World War I, but

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.310
again, the services of one of the greatest
sharpshooters in the world were declined.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.200
Undeterred, Annie and her husband helped the
war efforts by joining the National War Work

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.990
Council of the Young Men’s Christian Association
(YMCA) where the sharp-shooting couple held

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.030
exhibitions and presented lectures at Army
posts to help soldiers hone their shooting

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.030
skills.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.040
Despite her advanced years and being seriously
injured in a car accident in 1922, Annie continued

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.860
to perform and set various sharp shooting
records almost up to her death in 1925 at

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.600
the age of 66, dying of pernicious anemia.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.310
Her husband of approximately a half a century,
Frank Butler, died just 18 days after her,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.830
supposedly refusing to eat anything after
his wife’s death.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.480
The pair left behind almost nothing of the
small fortune they’d accumulated in their

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.600
lifetime, having previously donated the bulk
of it to support various charities, particularly

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.450
those focused on helping women and orphans.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.060
Annie Oakley was exceptionally careful with
her public image throughout her lifetime.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.419
Whereas other female sharpshooters tried to
make a name for themselves by altering their

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.960
appearance to please their male admirers,
Annie very purposefully made her own modest

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.651
costumes, striving to look attractive while
still maintaining a sense of dignity in her

00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:18.651
appearance.

00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:22.760
Needless to say, in the early 20th century
when William Randolph Hearst’s newspapers

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.139
reported that Annie Oakley was serving time
in prison for “stealing the trousers of

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.900
a negro in order to get money with which to
buy cocaine,” she was less than pleased.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.970
Of course, she never did anything of the sort;
a burlesque performer who called herself Annie

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.760
Oakley was supposedly the real culprit.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.620
The facts didn’t stop newspapers across
the nation from publishing the false, sensationalized

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.620
story.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.730
Furious, Annie filed 55 libel suits against
the newspapers and ended up settling or winning

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.730
54 of them.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.050
However, the amount she was awarded, while
significant, reportedly didn’t even cover

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.940
her legal bills.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.260
While nobody took Oakley up on her offer to
put together a team of sharp shooting women

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.169
to fight in a war, other women managed to
get into combat more discretely.

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.610
One such was Deborah Sampson who spent 17
months disguised as Robert Shurtliff, a male

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.580
Continental Army soldier who fought in the
Revolutionary War.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.010
While fighting alongside her male counterparts,
Sampson was seriously wounded.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.560
In order to keep her true identity hidden,
she was forced to cut a musket ball out of

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.810
her own leg so no doctor would discover her
secret.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.610
A second musket ball was too deep for her
to remove, so she simply stitched herself

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.610
back up.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.550
When her true identity was found out after
she became severely ill near the end of the

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.330
war, expecting a severe reprimand of some
sort, she was surprised to find that she was

00:07:37.330 --> 00:08:01.780
given an honorable discharge and enough money
to make her way home.
