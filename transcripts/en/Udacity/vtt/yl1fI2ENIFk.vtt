00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.190
So this is the solution for our ROB timing quiz. The first part,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.740
we were asked when does this multiplication instruction issue, execute, write,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.530
and commit. This instruction will issue in the second cycle.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.680
The reason for that is that we have still two multiply divide reservation

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.500
stations. This is using the first one, we can use the second one here so

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.320
we can actually issue in the second cycle. So the correct answer here is two for

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.630
issue. For execution, we are using R5 and R6.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.030
That doesn't depend on R2, so we can actually begin execution right after

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.650
we issue in cycle three. The multiplication will take two cycles to execute so

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.810
it's executing in cycles three and four. It's going to try and

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.380
write the result in cycle five. And now when does it commit? It commits when it

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.810
has both written the result and when all previous instructions have committed.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.400
The previous instruction commit is, had happening later. So,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.960
we will commit in cycle eight, right after the first instruction has committed.
