Hey, you ever been on a date

"the one"?

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.173
Like, uh, if they want kids
and you don't

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:08.641
or they showed up
with a pentagram carved

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:10.777
into their forehead
and you didn't.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.513
We rely on these red flags
to help us make good decisions

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.314
and keep our soul
from being consumed.

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:17.850
