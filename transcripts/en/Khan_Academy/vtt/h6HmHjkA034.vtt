00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.740
Find the product 2x
plus 8 times 2x minus 8.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.650
So we're multiplying
two binomials.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.080
So you could use FOIL,
you could just straight up

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.675
use the distributive
property here.

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:13.020
But the whole point of
this problem, I'm guessing,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.140
is to see whether you
recognize a pattern here.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.580
This is of the form a
plus b times a minus

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.060
b, where here a
is 2x and b is 8.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.592
We have 2x plus 8 and then 2x
minus 8. a plus b, a minus b.

00:00:31.592 --> 00:00:33.050
What I want to do
is I'm just going

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.929
to multiply this out for us.

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:36.220
And then just see what happens.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.040
Whenever you have this pattern,
what the product actually looks

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.790
like.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.450
So if you were to
multiply this out,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.990
we can distribute the a plus b.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.340
We could distribute
this whole thing.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.645
Distribute the whole
a plus b on the a

00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:50.490
and then distribute it on the b.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.170
And I could have done this
with this problem right here,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.420
and it would have taken us
less time to just solve it.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.150
But I want to find out
the general pattern here.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.240
So a plus b times a.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.030
So we have a times a plus
b, that's this times this.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.640
And then a plus b
times negative b,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.440
that's negative
b times a plus b.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.470
So I've done distributive
property once,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.890
now I could do it again.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.550
I can distribute the a
onto the a and this b

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.170
and it gives me a squared.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.600
a times a is a squared,
plus a times b, which is ab.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.400
And now I can do it
with the negative b.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.160
Negative b times a is negative
ab or negative ba, same thing.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.980
And negative b times b
is negative b squared.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.490
Now, what does this simplify to?

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.970
Well, I have an ab, and
then I'm subtracting an ab.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.190
So these two guys
cancel out and I am just

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.530
left with a squared
minus b squared.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.600
So the general pattern,
and this is a good one

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.620
to just kind of
know super fast, is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.040
that a plus b times
a minus b is always

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.150
going to be a squared
minus b squared.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.490
So we have an a plus
b times an a minus b.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.920
So this product is
going to be a squared.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.360
So it's going to be
2x squared minus b

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.250
squared minus 8 squared.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.760
2x squared, that's
the same thing

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.850
as 2 squared times x
squared, or 4x squared.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.910
And from that, we're
subtracting 8 squared.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.250
So it's going to be
4x squared minus 64.
