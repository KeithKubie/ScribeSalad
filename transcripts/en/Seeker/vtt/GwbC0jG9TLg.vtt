00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.040
Have you ever looked longingly into your cat’s
eyes and wondered, “why are you pupils terrifying

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.890
little slits, you nighttime killer of beasts?!”

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.400
I have.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.950
Hello everyone, it’s Amy with you on DNews,
and you’re watching me right now because

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.660
the light from your screen is passing through
your cornea, being bent in just the right

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.560
way that it passes through your circular pupil
into your eye hitting your retina so your

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.090
brain can receive the image and, well, you
can see!

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.670
In all that, the pupil plays the key role
as the adjustable opening that controls the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.730
intensity of light allowed to enter your eye,
just like the aperture on a camera.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.710
In humans, our pupils dilate to allow more
light in and contract to allow less light

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.710
in.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.539
But not all eyes in the animal kingdom are
created equal, nor are all pupils.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.789
When we think about different eyes, we have
to remember that eyes didn’t develop on

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:46.789
land.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:47.789
Nothing did.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.050
The first eyes of the first living things
were under water where light moves different

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.049
and moisture is built into the environment.

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:56.929
As different species developed in and out
of water, pupil shapes have gotten weird.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.620
Or at least, weird when we’re used to looking
at our own circular pupils.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.410
Obviously they’re totally normal and natural.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.600
The one most of us are familiar with is the
vertical slit pupil, which, interestingly,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.149
has developed in a variety of species independently
including canines, felines, some snakes, geckos,

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.390
crocodiles, and some birds.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.241
That’s a pretty wide variety of animals,
but what they all have in common is that they

00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:20.670
are nocturnal predators who don’t stand
too high off the ground.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.700
One benefit is that slit pupils can contract
and dilate more than circular ones.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.950
Think of a cat who is awake and running around
in full daylight and in the middle of the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.950
night.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.470
Cats can see far better than we can in those
two extreme light environments.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.340
Some more recent research suggests that slit
pupils also help predatory animals see color

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.200
in different light conditions, leaving a larger
amount of the retina open to receive wavelengths

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.130
of light that translate to different colours.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.170
A vertical pupil also affects the depth of
the image that the eye can see as well as

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.799
an increased horizontal movement in sharp
focus, something predators like cats need

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.280
more than humans.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.509
Vertical pupils are also less noticeable than
round ones when a predator is staring you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.509
down.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.460
But there’s another pupil shape that also
developed independently among a number of

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.590
species and that’s the horizontal slit.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.890
Even-toed ungulates as well as all equines,
mongooses, some frogs and toads, and octopi

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.100
have horizontal pupils.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.030
That’s a pretty interesting mix that might
not seem to have a lot of obvious commonalities

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.940
to explain their shared pupil shape, but they
are all predators with eyes on the side of

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.320
their heads, and with a lateral pupil, they
all get an extremely wide field of view, sometimes

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.670
nearing a full 360 degrees.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.260
So those, vertical and horizontal slits, are
the major ones.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.280
There are some even stranger pupils out there,
particularly lurking in the water or in species

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.780
that have to see both underwater and in the
air.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.910
Some species of gecko have pinhole pupils,
pupils that, when fully contracted, become

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.700
just four tiny dots vertically in the eye
that can help gauge distance.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.790
Dolphins have pupils that look like the letter
U when fully contracted.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.100
The cuttlefish has a super neat looking W-shaped
pupil that is actually a break in the retina.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.930
They can look forwards and backwards at the
same time and see in polarized light, cutting

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.730
out the glare that can make it impossible
for humans to see!

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.120
In the scheme of eye-things, our eyes are
sort of the most basic, and they serve us

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.120
well!

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.400
But there’s an intense variety of pupils
out there that speaks to the amazing variety

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.980
of species on our planet.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.010
I dig the cuttlefish pupil and find the horizontal
one a little terrifying… what’s your favourite

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:16.500
pupil?
