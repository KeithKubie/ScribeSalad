NIKO SCHROER: Hello, everybody.

00:00:01.411 --> 00:00:02.560
Good afternoon.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.260
My name is Niko Schroer.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.650
I'm a partnerships manager in
the Play Apps Team based here

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.230
in Berlin, and it's a
great, great pleasure

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.090
to have all of you here today.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.010
For a while now, I've
been really focusing

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.520
on the topic of subscriptions,
and it's actually

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.280
pretty amazing to see
how far the subscription

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.190
business on Google Play has come
and how well it has developed.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.630
Since we got together for a
Playtime last time in 2016,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.610
so about one year
ago, we've actually

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.830
onboarded over 3,200
new subscription

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.260
services to Google Play.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.410
Half of them, which are
completely new apps,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.350
with the other half coming
from existing apps which

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.050
started offering subscriptions.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.760
This includes developers,
such as VKontakte from Russia,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.760
[INAUDIBLE] from France,
Flight Radar 24 from Sweden,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.050
or even Supercell's game Boom
Beach to just name a few.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.880
So clearly, subscriptions
are having a great momentum.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.850
And proven point--
you're being here.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.640
We are having a more
and more full house.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.620
And if you attended
any of our events

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.650
before, Playtime, Google I/O,
or an industry-specific event,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.600
you should be pretty familiar
with our subscriptions

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.730
offering.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.180
So for today, we don't want
to bore you with the basics.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.270
We don't want to bore an
expert audience with repeating

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.760
this stuff over and over again.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.820
Instead, we will
share insights on how

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.550
you can take your subscriptions
business to the next level.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.470
So we will talk about how you
can outsmart subscriptions.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.200
As every business
grows, it starts

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.130
facing its own challenges.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.980
So when it comes to
subscription businesses,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.560
we hear from you
about such things

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.370
as declining
payments from users,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.590
the difficulty of figuring
out the right balance

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.340
between features
and price points,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.280
or churning subscribers, and
the issues of winning them back.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.710
So for today's
session, we took 10

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.850
of the most common challenges.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.580
We hear from you--
the developers

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.170
we work with-- on
a day to day basis.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.760
And we structure them
in three buckets--

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.910
the buckets that make up
your subscriptions revenue.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.500
So for the next
15 to 20 minutes,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.440
we will share some solutions
to help you outsmart them.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.910
Let's start with the tricky
top of the funnel acquisition

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.366
on conversion.

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:55.520
A first challenge we
hear is that developers

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.340
don't know where the
subscribers are coming from--

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.232
which markets, which
channels, or which devices.

00:03:04.232 --> 00:03:06.440
And therefore, they are
unable to optimize that value

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.710
proposition unless performing
markets double down

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.170
in the highest converting
markets or targeting

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.235
more lucrative devices.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.320
So over the last
few months, we've

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.750
launched several
subscription specific reports

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.260
in the Google Play Console to
allow you to easily deep dive

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.750
into all of that.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.970
The user acquisition
reports in the Play Console

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.700
allow you to understand
the markets that

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.090
drive the highest install
and subscriptions, which

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.550
acquisition channels are
most effective in driving

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.210
subscriptions for you, how
your subs are performing

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.750
along the whole funnel, and
very importantly-- also,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.930
how you're performing
against your peers.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.660
So all of that is extremely
useful information

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.875
for you to optimize your
subscription acquisition

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:52.375
strategy.

00:03:56.454 --> 00:03:58.620
Challenge number two-- we
often hear from developers

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.530
is that not enough
users perceive the value

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.740
of becoming a subscriber.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.170
So we have two solutions we
want to suggest for that.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.540
First is to make sure you
promote your value proposition

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.209
at various touch
points within the app,

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.120
and especially during
the onboarding.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.880
Health and fitness
app Freeletics

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.700
redesigned the
onboarding to emphasize

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.810
the value proposition, which
is getting a user really fit,

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.920
rather than the app's features,
and this increased conversion

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.060
by 10% for them.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.800
Language learning app Memorize
prompts upsell opportunities

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.380
based on user activity.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.020
So what that means
is they detect

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.090
what is the best moment to
highlight premier features.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.950
For example, somebody keeps
tapping on the audio button

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.410
to replay spoken words.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.590
That then triggers an
upsell prompt to highlight

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.400
audio mode, which is a
subscription-only feature.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.190
And they have similar pop-ups
linked to specific interactions

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.360
on screen.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.330
So once they detect a user
is doing a certain activity

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.420
in the app, that
triggers the upsell.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.380
So very intuitive and
very natural to the user

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.510
to then go to a subscription.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.670
Another solution is
a pretty common one.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.420
It's offering a
free trial to get

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.180
users to try before they
buy it Our user study shows

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.730
that 78% of subscribers
start with a free experience.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.770
Oh, and as we announced
in the keynote,

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.890
you have asked us for
shorter free trial periods,

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.880
and we have listened.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.000
So now, you can offer
three-day free trials

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.330
instead of the minimum of
seven, which we had before.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.970
So this could be really
relevant for businesses

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.160
with high marginal costs.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.150
Challenge number three we hear
from developers about users

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.330
abandoning the purchase flow.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.400
And unless this
is the first time,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.990
you're attending
any of our events

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.930
or speaking to anybody
of us from the team,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.270
you would probably have heard
our recommendations before.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.030
Implement Google Play billing.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.000
Implement Google Pay
billing to offer your users

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.990
multiple payment options across
over 130 countries globally

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.400
and the trusted, reliable, and
frictionless two-step checkout

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.360
process.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.280
And beyond that,
starting January 1, 2018,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.960
we're updating our
transaction fee

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.840
for subscribers who are
retained for more than 12

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.040
paying months to 15% to
recognize developers who

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.410
maintain longstanding
subscribers

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.280
and create great
user experiences.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.290
Challenge number four is related
to have users hanging around

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.760
in the free tier without
ever making a payment.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.060
A good solution
for that would be

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.910
to use introductory pricing to
offer periodic sales to users.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.520
Cookpad, which is a super
popular cooking app in Japan,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.940
ran a 50% discount
during Ramadan,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.080
and it led to a 4.5x increase
in data subscriptions versus

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.050
a comparable period.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.020
In fact, we are
seeing many successes

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.750
with introductory pricing.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.460
And many of the
developers we speak

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.475
to now consider it a
key marketing tool.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.910
Now, let's move on to the
next bucket of challenges--

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.470
those related to
retention and recovery.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.064
And to me, personally,
it's another great sign

00:07:55.064 --> 00:07:56.980
that we get more and
more questions about this

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.200
because it also means that
your business has grown

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.792
so much that this is actually
a major point of questions

00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:04.000
and feedback we get from you.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.900
So starting with
the challenge we

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.470
hear from almost every developer
in some shape or form--

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.750
trouble of retaining
subscribers.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.580
It is really something
everybody talks about,

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.050
and everybody tries to optimize.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:27.310
And that is very straightforward
because improving retention

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.700
rate is so crucial to the
bottom line of a subscription

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.690
business.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.299
And therefore, we want
to offer two solutions

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.940
you could use to optimize
your retention rate overall.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.250
The first solution
is to give users

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.920
something to nurture by
gamifying the user experience.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.880
And I completely appreciate that
when I mention gamification,

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.280
the buzzword alerts--

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.820
the risk of the buzzword alert
going off is really high.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.640
So let's go through
some best practices

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.877
to add some color
what we mean by that.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.460
First, it's important
that you measure

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.400
your users' engagements versus
the engagement objectives

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.410
that you have defined.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.769
Second, you want to make sure
to surface this to the user

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:18.560
and allow the user to
actually show it off.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.809
For example, in their profile.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.890
Another way to think about it
is to incorporate in-app rewards

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:32.030
or real savings for users
hitting engagement milestones,

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.970
and then you can deincentivize
subscription churn

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:40.460
by making valuable rewards
available for subscribers-only.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.740
Language learning app
Duolingo successfully

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.807
incorporates many of these
mechanics into the app.

00:09:45.807 --> 00:09:48.140
So if you want to get some
inspiration, download the app

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.723
and check it out and
see what they do.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.580
Also, it's peer memorized,
which I've mentioned before,

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.800
offers discounts to users
who hit certain milestones.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.010
So they're putting the last
best practice I mentioned right

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.530
into practice.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.887
Again, if you're looking
for some inspirations,

00:10:06.887 --> 00:10:08.220
I recommend you to check it out.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.670
The second solution
to optimizing churn

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.120
is more straightforward.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.070
It's to offer users
longer period plans

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.410
and to present
them convincingly.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.820
Some tips on how to do that.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.410
First, make sure your
multi-frequency plan

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:34.470
is available at cost savings
versus the monthly plan.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:39.070
Second, present the
equivalent monthly price

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.880
to highlight the cost savings.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.382
So it's easy for
the user to compare

00:10:42.382 --> 00:10:44.590
and very straightforward to
see what they're actually

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.130
getting for committing
for a longer period.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.610
Three, funnel all
your promotions

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:55.470
as seasonal campaigns to
those long period plans.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.610

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.720
diversified from
one option, which

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.390
was monthly, to four options--

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.450
one month, three,
six, and 12 month

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.480
and found that 40%
of the users actually

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.130
choosing a multi-month option.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.350
So the next challenges
that come up

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.890
when it's technically too late.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:28.900
It's too late because your
subscribers have churned,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.140
but the solutions
we will show you

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.490
are probably the most
requested as we've

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.470
heard from you over the
last couple of months

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.740
and probably a year.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.820
So the first churn
challenge we usually hear

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.610
is that you have a
hard time figuring out

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.170
why a subscriber has churned.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.250
As announced at Google
I/O, the new churn reports

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.990
in the Play Console
give you visibility

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.760
into the churn reasons.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.630
For example, is it voluntary
churn, involuntary churn,

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:04.771
or whether users also deleted
the app after canceling?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.970
But an even bigger challenge
we've heard from you

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.145
is that you don't know when
your subscribers are churning.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.230
So we're really excited to
present real-time developer

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.150
notifications.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.230
As Kobe talked about already
in the keynote this morning,

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.560
it's our new feature that
immediately informs you

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.840
of any change in
subscribers states, sorry.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.650
So for example, cancellation,
suspension, et cetera so

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.756
you can act on it immediately.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:51.100
So when subscribers
have left and now

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.430
that you can be
notified in real-time,

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.860
you could actually craft
your win back message

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.980
and reach out to
churn subscribers

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.160
to pitch the benefits of
your subscriptions again

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.680
and to try to win them back.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.970
Anghami, a music streaming
service in the Middle East,

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.270
optimizes the in-app
messaging to churn subscribers

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.090
to really emphasize
the premium features

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.680
they are missing out on.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.280
For example here
in the screenshot,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.420
you see the bring
back your 38 downloads

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.000
which is a subscription only
feature for Anghami users.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.930
Similarly, brain
training Lumosity

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.140
sends churned users
emails to notify them

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.150
about new content as
a win back strategy.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.360
And to close the
whole win back loop,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.300
we're now making restoring
a subscription much easier

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.130
with a new subscription
restoration

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.092
feature on Google
Play billing, which

00:13:52.092 --> 00:13:53.175
we announced this morning.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.800
So to quickly recap these
last couple of challenges

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:06.200
and solutions, combined this
gives you a full subscriber

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.690
win back solution.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.190
The subscriber cancels.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.640
We send you, the developer,
a real-time notification

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.110
about that.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.500
You, the developer,
then send a message

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.740
to the churned subscriber
and if successful,

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:29.560
the subscriber can go back and
restore their subscription.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.321
All of that at Google Play
billing, pretty cool, huh?

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.480
So we are constantly
investing in improving

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.317
features related to
win back, so stay

00:14:40.317 --> 00:14:41.525
on the lookout on this topic.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.430
While all of that covered
the voluntary cancellation

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:52.500
quite well, what about the users
that didn't even want to cancel

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.600
but whose payment
happened to get

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.910
declined because their
credit card expired,

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.150
the transaction didn't
go through, et cetera?

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.880
Again, we have two solutions.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.940
These two solutions can be used
separately or in combination.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.090
The first one is to
enable grace period.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.590
If you haven't
enabled grace period,

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.410
you can basically go into
your Google Play Console

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.260
and tick the box right now.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.250
By enabling grace
periods in the console,

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.470
you grant users an extra
three or seven days

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.350
to fix payment issues.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.650
And at the aggregate level
across all developers,

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.840
we see that those
two activate grace

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.090
periods see a 50% improvement
in renewal decline recovery.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.050
It is such a simple but
effective optimizations

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.840
you all can do basically now.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.920
And if you think granting
a grace period to use

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.820
is not enough, and the user
may need in addition motivation

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.740
to update their
form of payments,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.590
you can switch on account
holds to put subscribers

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:03.480
in a suspended state until they
update their form of payments.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.780
See that notification
that Univision now

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.910
pops up at two users whose
payment has been declined.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.520
From there, it
directly deep links

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:20.170
into the form of payment
update flow in the Play Store.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.610
So whenever they use the fixes
their form for any payments

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.730
on Google Play, their
suspended subscriptions

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.670
will be reinstated immediately.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.510
And as we announced
this morning,

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.090
this feature of
Google Play billing

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.510
is now open to all developers.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.900
Dating at Tindr has
been an early tester

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.180
and actually seen a 3x
increase in payment recovery

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.750
since implementing account hold.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.380
So with all these new
and exciting solutions

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.469
to outsmart
retention challenges,

00:16:58.469 --> 00:16:59.760
let's not forget about pricing.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.960
Finding the right price for any
product is a science in itself.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.140
So no surprise, we
quite often hear

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.450
that you're wondering if
you price it correctly,

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:18.430
or if you're actually
leaving money on the table.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.400
So we want to run through
three solutions of how

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.130
you can optimize that part.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:28.390
First, we recommend that you
test price points with the help

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.990
of Firebase Remote Config.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.860
You can set up two more SKUs,
surface them to different user

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:41.890
groups, and compare metrics to
find out which performs better.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.920
When doing that, please
remember that the goal

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.850
is to maximize retention
and not just the sign-up.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.560
So it may take a couple
of months for you

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.410
to actually figure out which
one works better in that regard.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.960
Solution number two is
to offer multiple plans

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.230
with varying sets of features.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.040
Entertainment app
CBS successfully

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.920
does cater to different
audiences' willingness

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.190
to pay with two different plans.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.490
One where you get the content
with limited commercials,

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.710
and one where it's completely
out of here, and both

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:19.970
are at different price points.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.840
And then solution
number three is

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.760
to use the plan
upgrade and downgrade

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.240
feature of Google Play billing
to let subscribers seamlessly

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.150
move between the plans.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.550
Again, entertainment
app CBS does this

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.710
successfully with their
limited commercials

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.050
versus no commercial
sell on plans.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.470
So if a subscriber decides
that a price point of let's say

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.490
$9.99 a month is too much,
instead of having them churn,

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.540
you give them the option to
kind of downgrade to $4.99.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.250
And obviously, you
can do it vice versa

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.390
and increase the basket
size and lifetime value.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.140
So I completely appreciate.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.410
This has been a lot of content
in a short period of time,

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.060
and it's an afternoon session.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.450
However, let me quickly recap.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.780
We presented one
or more solutions

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.360
to 10 common
subscription challenges

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.130
to outsmart subscriptions
across the complete user flow.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.060
As the next step,
we, of course, want

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.690
you to put these solutions into
action and to make this as easy

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.460
as possible for you.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.340
We actually summarized all of
them in a handy one-sheeter.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.790
I think it's actually
two sheets but anyways--

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.300
which you can
download on this link.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.860
I give you 20 seconds
to take a picture.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.890
And because sometimes you
like to kick it old-school,

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.972
we also have a
printed out version,

00:19:49.972 --> 00:19:51.430
which you can pick
up at the front,

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.380
and we're going to
have laying out later.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.080
So you can take it
back to your teams,

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.020
put it up in your
office, and start

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.860
getting busy with
implementing these solutions.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.060
That's it for me.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.840
I really hope the
session was useful.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.670
Thank you very much
for paying attention.
