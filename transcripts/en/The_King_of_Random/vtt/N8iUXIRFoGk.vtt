00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
Guys, believe it or not,

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.900
this was Nate's
idea, not mine.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.100
In today's video,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.500
we are melting over
a hundred lipsticks,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.652
and then we're going to see

00:00:07.652 --> 00:00:10.000
if there's anything else we
can do with them after that.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:19.160
[Music]

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.000
We've got over a hundred tubes
of lipstick here,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and they are in a nice
variety of colors,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.400
and I don't honestly know
too much about lipstick.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.100
And we're going

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.561
to learn a little bit more
about that today, specifically,

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:30.900
what happens if you heat it up.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.300
Lipstick, I know,
has sort of a really soft,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.320
like a crayon but softer
oil pastel sort of,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.780
a soft wax texture.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.780
And I suspect
that it melts down quite nicely,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.900
and we're going to try
melting it down,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.200
and see what it does.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.300
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.500
We have over a
hundred lipsticks here.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500
We are going to put
them all in a pot,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.020
put that pot on the stove,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.980
and after that,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.100
we're going to see if there's
anything else we can do.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.657
We do have a bunch
of different colors here,

00:00:55.657 --> 00:00:58.276
and we want to see what happens
with all of them combined.

00:00:58.276 --> 00:00:59.831
We want to see
if they'll mix well.

00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:02.081
Does lipstick boil
if you heat it up too much?

00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:03.900
And if it does turn
into a liquid,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.154
can you then cast it
into other shapes?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.300
So every tube of lipstick
that Calli has been opening,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.068
she has all spent applying.

00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:15.000
She has probably 25 layers of
lipstick applied at the moment.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.400
So these, these obviously

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.200
are not the highest quality
of lipsticks that there are,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.100
but the coverage
happening here...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Yeah, it feels more like
greasepaint than anything else.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.360
Just one.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.835
&gt;&gt; There's no such thing as one.
&gt;&gt; Just one.

00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:30.200
Shouldn't he put on just one?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.729
I've put on like 50.

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.870
I'm taking one for the team.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.390
There.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.200
There's mine.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.820
[Music]

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.700
Most of these lipsticks,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.093
we're going to be
melting in this pot

00:01:45.093 --> 00:01:46.100
on the stove all together,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.899
but I did first want to try and
see what happens with just one

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.000
of them and a lighter,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
see what kind
of melting effect we get.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.300
The first four ingredients
in this is wax.

00:01:55.303 --> 00:01:58.727
No, again, we weren't going
for top quality lipstick,

00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:00.900
so the pigmentation
is pretty low.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.340
But the wax content
is very high.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.940
So this is just going to run.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.400
[Music]

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.720
&gt;&gt; Oh, there's actually more in there.
&gt;&gt; There's quite a bit more down in there.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.420
You just can never get to it.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.300
It's like roasting
a marshmallow,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.648
if a marshmallow was a piece

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:24.110
of pigmented wax you put
on your face for fun.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.100
There's a big bubble in it.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.940
You can see.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.000
That does look pretty cool.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.397
I would say that's not the most

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.540
efficient way to melt
these down however,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.360
so I think now we want to take
every one of these lipstick,

00:02:34.368 --> 00:02:35.500
the colored part out,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.200
and just put them into this pot.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.700
So I've seen this done before,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.700
and people will put
them in a pot,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.718
and they mix them all together.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.690
No, no. I want to see

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.500
if we can get like a cool
rainbow effect or something,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.500
almost like hydro dipping
but sans the hydro part.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.857
Just make it look
a lot cooler as its melting.

00:02:51.857 --> 00:02:53.900
See if we can actually
keep that effect.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.900
Once it's melted,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780
see if we'll keep
that same pattern.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.940
[Music]

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.540
All right.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.850
So we've separated
out the colors.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.548
We're going to try to get
that sort of rainbow effect.

00:03:08.548 --> 00:03:10.648
So we're going to start
from darker colors,

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:11.700
and work our way over.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.940
[Music]

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.700
We've got our lipsticks.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.000
We've got them in our pot.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.140
Let's melt them.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.800
All right.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.500
So we've got
the tripod all set up.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.800
We've got everything
ready to go.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.329
Everything's on the stove.

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.380
Let's melts lipstick.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.460
I think we're going to want to go
with the lowest setting to start.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.840
Highest setting.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.920
Oh no.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.960
I'll turn it down low,
just a little.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.840
Like all the way below.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:04:33.040
[Music]

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.720
Oh-oh.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.480
Whoa.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.060
Oh, that is so much more liquid
than I was expecting.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.980
Super runny.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.300
Oh, but it's
like a bright galaxy.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.100
That's kind of cool.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.271
&gt;&gt; Oh,look at the little spots, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Little bits, yeah.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.440
Shooting up from the bottom.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.980
It also smells a little burned,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.380
but I want to see if I can get
a swirl lipstick out of this.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.840
But I don't want a regular mold.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.340
Look at those
cool swirl patterns.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.600
Oh, that's cool.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.120
So yeah, here's my prediction.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.283
If you see what's coming
off of the spoon after I dip it, it's--

00:05:01.283 --> 00:05:02.100
That's clear.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.980
There's not a lot of color.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.100
So what I think is is all

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.982
of our pigment has sunk
down to the bottom,

00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:09.000
and that's what we're seeing
bubbling up here.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.603
So, let's see what happens
if I try and pour this.

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:14.060
I might just end up
with like a shiny lip gloss.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.060
Yep.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.200
There's all the color.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.300
Look at that.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.180
[Music]

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.640
But look at the stripes,
that's so cool.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.933
That's amazing.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.140
[Music]

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.810
I have an R2D2 lipgloss.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.600
Before anything else,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.880
we've got these really
good swirls right now.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.300
I'm going to see if we can pick
up some of those swirls

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.700
on the surface of
this glass Christmas ornament,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.400
and hopefully,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.500
it won't be so hot
that it breaks the glass.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.500
[Music]

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.980
Lipstick ornament.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.700
[Music]

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.640
But yeah, you can see,
that's mostly wax.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.260
There's clear wax.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.603
Like this is covered.

00:05:58.603 --> 00:06:00.400
No pigment in it at all.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.980
It's just, they're wax.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.860
Guys, we sell these
now in TheKingofRandom.com.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.540
Go buy yours.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.800
This is going
to be clear, mostly.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.000
This is going to be kind
of a shiny lip gloss.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.400
I'm going to try and mix
the pigment a little bit

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.200
more from the bottom,
scrape it up off the bottom,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.020
and give myself
a stormtrooper actual lipstick.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.300
All right, I want
to keep some swirls.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.657
So now that I've got some color
coming up to the surface,

00:06:21.657 --> 00:06:22.500
I'm gonna pour this.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.620
[Music]

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.780
Oh, I made a mess.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.800
I made a mess everywhere.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.950
This, this silicon
mold has an issue.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.230
It's very thin mold,
but that's okay.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.080
Maybe pour a Darth Vader across
from it to even out the weight.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.580
I know Darth Vader
always wanted to be a lipstick.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.913
But look at the difference
between this color,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.840
and the color of my R2D2.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.000
But at this point,
you can kind of see

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.900
that we do have sort
of have one color.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.400
All right, wait,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.857
I'm dipping my entire
glove in this.

00:06:48.857 --> 00:06:49.600
I want to see.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.200
Oh, yeah.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.700
Ready?

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.460
Oh, that was too hot.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.000
It's too hot.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.800
That's okay.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.260
Best luck.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.700
Oh, a lipstick handprint.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.840
[Music]

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.400
This will also be
for sale in our shop.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.940
Give me an ornament.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.560
Hand me.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.800
[Music]

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.200
He's separating even more.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.800
Oh, he's a galaxy.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.698
That's so cool.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.860
It's like algae growing
in it or something.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.880
It does.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.680
I'll say this,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.600
even cool, this stuff
does not hold together,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.300
even as strong as
a regular lipstick.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.280
[Music]

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.300
Do you think anyone else

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.000
in the world has
a stormtrooper lipstick?

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.200
Because I do, and I am thrilled.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.440
Look at that.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.160
All right.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:46.800
I have to try it.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.740
You know I do.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.210
[Music]

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.500
Seems to apply all right.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.500
Maybe it's not like super
great coverage but...

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.360
All right.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.500
Now, this was pouring
from the very top.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.500
When we melt it
down the lipsticks,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.600
we ended up with that.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.292
The clear coat sort of on top,
just the wax itself,

00:08:08.292 --> 00:08:10.500
which is what happened
here with our R2D2.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.700
Some color mixed in,

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.900
but definitely not
a nice homogeneous mixture

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.540
like these ones.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.700
Here's the interesting thing.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.340
This stuff is just,

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.740
the colors not smearing
nearly as easy.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.400
You can actually

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.300
see my fingerprints
smearing through this.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.220
So this is just
the very very soft wax.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.000
So this is going to be
like a lip gloss, lip balm?

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.200
Let's see.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.280
Oh, but some
pigment settled out.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.200
That's cool.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.020
Didn't see that coming.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.260
No.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.420
Look at that division
on the top, like...

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:41.220
Oh, I loveit.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.300
The different layers.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.700
All right, let's see what this
guy looks like on the inside.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.200
So white on one side.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.100
You can see the color division.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.532
So how the pigment
is actually settling,

00:08:50.532 --> 00:08:53.900
which makes me curious
how lipstick is actually formed.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.900
How do they keep it
from doing that?

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:02.860
[Music]

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.900
That really divided.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.800
Yeah, but feel
the difference in texture.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.310
This side is very very tough,

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.253
and this side is
just soft and squishy.

00:09:10.253 --> 00:09:12.100
[Music]

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.600
Well, okay, well...

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.176
Break.

00:09:14.176 --> 00:09:15.680
Whoa!

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.840
Some sparkly bits.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.160
I found the glitter,
and that's in the center,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.400
which is interesting.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.520
Look at that.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.180
Yeah, it doesn't really
have it on the edges.

00:09:23.199 --> 00:09:24.300
Yeah, it's the center.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.950
I'm going to try
and just snap it,

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.926
because I want to know just
how brittle it is,

00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:29.200
or if it's been like crumble.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.300
Well, it's actually
pretty tough.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.300
But again, you can see
a color division here.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:36.800
It's interesting.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.936
You've got the red,

00:09:37.936 --> 00:09:40.678
more of the matte pigments
is on the outside,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.340
and then all of our sparkles
are this weird inner layer.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.900
Guys, that's not all,

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.347
we've always got more
for you to see.
