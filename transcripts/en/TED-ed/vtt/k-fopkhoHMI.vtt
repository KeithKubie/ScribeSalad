00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:16.332
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:21.186
Earwig,

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:23.348
an insect, generally classified

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:26.436
within the order &lt;i&gt;dermaptera&lt;/i&gt;.

00:00:26.436 --> 00:00:27.637
The common name of the insects

00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:30.647
we know as earwigs is exactly that,

00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:31.935
common,

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:34.635
and is based mainly in folklore.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.738
It's rumored that these so-called earwigs

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:39.459
crawl into your ear at night

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:41.447
and tunnel into your brain,

00:00:41.447 --> 00:00:43.539
but this is false.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.413
Sure, an earwig may, on rare occasion,

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:49.501
climb into the ear of an unsuspecting sleeper,

00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:52.576
but, really, who can blame them?

00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:54.872
Ear canals are warm and dark,

00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:59.130
the perfect home for a creepy-crawly like this one.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.762
The important thing to remember

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:04.140
is that even if an earwig found its way into your ear,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.283
it would never eat through your eardrum.

00:01:08.283 --> 00:01:10.412
Despite the erroneous origins

00:01:10.412 --> 00:01:12.565
of these trumped-up folk tales,

00:01:12.565 --> 00:01:15.244
they've been in place a long time.

00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:20.872
The word earwig comes from the Old English word earwicga,

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:23.701
a compound of ear, meaning ear, of course,

00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:25.703
and wigca.

00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:27.780
Scholars believe that wigca shares a root

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.734
with words like wiggle

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:31.243
and wag,

00:01:31.243 --> 00:01:32.889
and that it most likely referred

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:35.919
to a creature that moves quickly.

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:39.217
Unfortunately for this innocent little insect,

00:01:39.217 --> 00:01:43.338
even its scientific name gives it a bad rap.

00:01:43.338 --> 00:01:46.404
Because of the large, pencil-like cerci on the tail

00:01:46.404 --> 00:01:48.260
and of its abdomen,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.970
scientists associate earwigs

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.063
with a pair of scissors,

00:01:52.063 --> 00:01:56.768
calling them &lt;i&gt;forficula auricularia&lt;i&gt;,

00:01:56.768 --> 00:01:59.515
literally little scissors of the ear.
