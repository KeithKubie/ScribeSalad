one of the effects is repeated exposure

01:37:20.530 --> 01:37:20.540
are the products of racial exclusion
 

01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:27.080
are the products of racial exclusion
that may impede a social mobility and

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:27.090
that may impede a social mobility and
 

01:37:27.090 --> 01:37:28.910
that may impede a social mobility and
one of the things that I emphasize in a

01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920
one of the things that I emphasize in a
 

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.760
one of the things that I emphasize in a
book however is that these cultural

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:31.770
book however is that these cultural
 

01:37:31.770 --> 01:37:35.089
book however is that these cultural
factors are not nearly as important as

01:37:35.089 --> 01:37:35.099
factors are not nearly as important as
 

01:37:35.099 --> 01:37:36.859
factors are not nearly as important as
the structural factors that I talked

01:37:36.859 --> 01:37:36.869
the structural factors that I talked
 

01:37:36.869 --> 01:37:39.620
the structural factors that I talked
about that I only had time to talk about

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:39.630
about that I only had time to talk about
 

01:37:39.630 --> 01:37:41.510
about that I only had time to talk about
and I couldn't agree with you more or if

01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520
and I couldn't agree with you more or if
 

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:43.939
and I couldn't agree with you more or if
you're going to talk about cultural

01:37:43.939 --> 01:37:43.949
you're going to talk about cultural
 

01:37:43.949 --> 01:37:45.649
you're going to talk about cultural
responses you have to include the

01:37:45.649 --> 01:37:45.659
responses you have to include the
 

01:37:45.659 --> 01:37:48.560
responses you have to include the
structural factors in fact I made a

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:48.570
structural factors in fact I made a
 

01:37:48.570 --> 01:37:52.580
structural factors in fact I made a
point in my book that a social scientist

01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:52.590
point in my book that a social scientist
 

01:37:52.590 --> 01:37:57.169
point in my book that a social scientist
has an obligation to make sure that his

01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179
has an obligation to make sure that his
 

01:37:57.179 --> 01:38:01.100
has an obligation to make sure that his
is at her structural analysis Avista if

01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:01.110
is at her structural analysis Avista if
 

01:38:01.110 --> 01:38:04.310
is at her structural analysis Avista if
if they are including both structure and

01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320
if they are including both structure and
 

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:07.490
if they are including both structure and
culture to make sure that the structural

01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:07.500
culture to make sure that the structural
 

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.950
culture to make sure that the structural
analysis does not recede into the

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960
analysis does not recede into the
 

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.540
analysis does not recede into the
background you have to put it up front

01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:11.550
background you have to put it up front
 

01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:13.640
background you have to put it up front
so I've made an explicit attempt to

01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:13.650
so I've made an explicit attempt to
 

01:38:13.650 --> 01:38:15.890
so I've made an explicit attempt to
emphasize how important structural

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:15.900
emphasize how important structural
 

01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:21.410
emphasize how important structural
factors are but if you're going to have

01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:21.420
factors are but if you're going to have
 

01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:22.939
factors are but if you're going to have
come up with a comprehensive explanation

01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:22.949
come up with a comprehensive explanation
 

01:38:22.949 --> 01:38:25.339
come up with a comprehensive explanation
you have to include you have to include

01:38:25.339 --> 01:38:25.349
you have to include you have to include
 

01:38:25.349 --> 01:38:30.910
you have to include you have to include
both now regarding the special mismatch

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:33.410
when I was talking about the special

when I was talking about the special
 

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:35.870
when I was talking about the special
special mismatch I was talking about

01:38:35.870 --> 01:38:35.880
special mismatch I was talking about
 

01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:38.109
special mismatch I was talking about
groups that are left behind in

01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:38.119
groups that are left behind in
 

01:38:38.119 --> 01:38:43.479
groups that are left behind in
inner-city neighborhoods it is true that

01:38:43.479 --> 01:38:43.489
inner-city neighborhoods it is true that
 

01:38:43.489 --> 01:38:47.990
inner-city neighborhoods it is true that
black middle-class folks are moving to

gradually increasing the integration of
 

01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:59.270
gradually increasing the integration of
some of these neighborhoods so those

some of these neighborhoods so those

some of these neighborhoods so those
people are not really affected by the

people are not really affected by the

people are not really affected by the
spatial mismatch soap so much that as

those were moved into white areas but

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:07.470
those were moved into white areas but
 

01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:12.200
those were moved into white areas but
many blacks middle-class folks have

many blacks middle-class folks have
 

01:39:12.210 --> 01:39:13.580
many blacks middle-class folks have
moved into suburbs that are

you focus on the inner city or should

you focus on the inner city or should
say inner suburbs some of these poor

suburbs and they are also very very far

well we are overtime we could go on

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:56.490
well we are overtime we could go on
 

01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:59.780
well we are overtime we could go on
quite a bit longer but I want to end by

01:39:59.780 --> 01:39:59.790
quite a bit longer but I want to end by
 

01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:01.700
