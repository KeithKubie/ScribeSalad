00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:03.837
(beeps, clicks, error noise)

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.638
(sighs)

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:06.573
- Hey is this IT?

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.109
Can you send somebody over?

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.577
- Knockity knock.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.312
I heard I was wanted.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.748
(laughs)

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:18.718 align:start size:97% position:3%
I heard you were having a hard
time with your hard drive.

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:20.754
- Its weird, I literally
just called a second ago.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:21.988
- I'm pretty fast,

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.223 align:start size:81% position:19%
but when things
get hot and sticky

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.492
I know to take things slowly.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:28.561
Plus, I like to make sure
my clients get the full

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.296
bang for their buck.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.531
- This is free, right?

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.233
Because this is
a company laptop.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.267
You work for the company, right?

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:35.468
- I do indeed.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.303 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, where's my naughty
little patient?

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.806
- Well this is it, as
you can see it's, um--

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.975
(grunts)

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.244
It's not, doing it.
(beeps, error noise)

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.245
It's not doing anything.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:46.079 align:start size:69% position:31%
(shushes)
What?

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.514
- Calm yourself, man.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:51.851
It's not like it's the
apocalypse, after all.

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:54.287
Now, what seems to
be the problem, baby?

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:55.789
Tell me what's wrong.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.323
What did he do to you,
what didn't he do to you?

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.625
(sniffing) Tell me.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:00:59.959
(sniffing) Smell it to me.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.194
- Well, I guess I'm worried

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.430
that I might have
downloaded a virus.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.364
- You what?

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.865
You-- whoa whoa whoa whoa.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.201
Are you telling me that
you didn't use protection

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:11.905
when you touched this fine,
fine piece of equipment?

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.073
- I'm sure there's some kind of

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.007 align:start size:84% position:16%
protection software
on there, man.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.642
- Oh, you're sure, you're sure.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:18.745
So it's her responsibility to
bring protection to the party.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.246 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're a piece of
chauvinistic (bleep).

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.481
- Can you let go of my hair?

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.549
And I'm not the
piece of (bleep),

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.483 align:start size:84% position:16%
(shushes)
you're the one that's

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.918
talking to this like a sex toy.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.754 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Please, please don't
interrupt, I'm working here.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:28.922
- What are you doing?

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.356
(beeps)

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.025
- I'm licking the camera, man.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.793
(whirs, beeps)

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:36.596 align:start size:94% position:6%
Oh, she's telling me
that you never loved her,

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:40.567
that you never touched
her in the right way.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.803 align:start size:84% position:16%
That you never touched
her at all, really,

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:45.572 align:start size:88% position:13%
you never really
thought about her needs.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:46.706 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Okay.
- It's the truth,

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:47.974 align:start size:88% position:13%
you need to hear it man.
- Okay, okay.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:48.942
Are you actually
gonna do anything,

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.210
you're just gonna talk to it?

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.644
- (scoffs) Oh, I'm
gonna do something.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.947
I know what you need,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:57.250 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I'm gonna give her
what she aches for.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.220
This might be difficult
for you to watch, though.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.722
- If you can fix it,
just fix it, that's...

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:03.556
- Okay.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.757
Okay, baby.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.226
Tell me what you like.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.261
(beeps)

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:09.729
Oh.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.364
Oh, okay.

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:12.499
Okay.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.201
(beeps, whirs, error noise)

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.804
(gasps) Oh, yeah.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.572
Okay, I'm gonna give
you two a little tip

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.040
when you're on your own, okay?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.176 align:start size:94% position:6%
A lot of guys will go with
the same-old, same-old

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.345
that's Control-Alt-Delete.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.314
But I'm gonna introduce
you to a little move,

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.649
it's a little bit
more sophisticated,

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.985 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's called (snaps)
the Mac Attack.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.121
(clicks keyboard)

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.556
Oh, oh,

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:37.790
baby.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.993
Looks like I just hit the spot.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.261
Yeah?

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.595
D'you like that?

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.364
(clicks keyboard)

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.833
(groans)

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:50.036
- Okay, okay, can I see
your ID again, man, I--

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:50.937
Oh god.

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.339
(groans)

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.341
- Okay, maybe you should
just get out of here, man.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.910 align:start size:84% position:16%
(groans)
I think I'll be okay.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.545
- Don't you interrupt me,
we're nearly there, baby.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:00.346 align:start size:94% position:6%
(groans)
- Okay, okay, we're good!

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.814
- (bleep) off!

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.684 align:start size:97% position:3%
You're ruining my vibe,
man, you're ruining my vibe!

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:08.621
(moaning, clicking keyboard)

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.989
Is that too much?

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:10.924
It's good?

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:13.660
(moaning, clicking keyboard)

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.494
- What are you doing?

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.863
(moaning)

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.064
Dude, that is--

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:19.232 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Shush, shush,
we're nearly there.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.568 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're nearly,
we're nearly there.

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:24.070
(groans loudly)

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.538
(moans)

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.340
- Oh my god.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.541
(sighs)

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.976 align:start size:84% position:16%
That can't be good
for the computer, man.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.344
- Oh, baby.

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.079
C'mere, you, come here.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:33.913
- Oh, god.

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:34.847 align:start size:59% position:41%
(slap)
Oh!

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.450
- This, this is just a pleasure.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.052 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it's free of charge, okay?
- Thanks.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.119
- Now you're gonna
take care of her?

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.054
- Okay.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.155
- And if you guys need me,

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:45.258
you got my details, here I am.

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.392
- Thanks.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.294 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You two should
cuddle. (clears throat)

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:50.230
- Won't be using this.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.064
Ever.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.265
(sensual guitar music)

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.334
(card clatters)

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:57.070
(elevator music)
