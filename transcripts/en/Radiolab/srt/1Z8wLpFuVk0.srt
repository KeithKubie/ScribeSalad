1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,520
I'm Jad Abumrad are you asleep?

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,910
Hey. Hi. Do I even know
where you are right now?

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,240
Did you see like one day with my
leg? Why I kicked myself awake?

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,440
Did you see that? I heard
it. I'm Jab, boom, rod. Oh,

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,670
I'm Robert Krulwich and our next
falling feature is falling asleep,

6
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,790
but with a little kick. This
is Radiolab. Let's do it. Well,

7
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,730
tell me your name first and just tell me
how you would like to be identified on

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,370
here. You can call me Fred.
I like it the best. Okay.

9
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:32,640
My full title is Professor
Frederick l Coolidge,

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,670
University of Colorado
at Colorado Springs.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,840
So just so we get our definitions
right. What is a hypnic jerk?

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,010
It appears to be this, what seems to be
a reflex. Everybody's experienced it.

13
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:48,600
It's, it's you're still semi-conscious.
Then you start to feel kind of dreamy.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,200
You start to feel this
loosening of your thoughts,

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,050
loosening of, of your reality.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,690
But just as you're about to go under,
he says, just the first onset of sleep,

17
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,770
Bam, one big jerk. Then you're awake.

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,740
Usually you wake up with this feeling of
like, oh my God. Oh my God, Oh my God.

19
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,690
Oh, all right. And you know, wait,
how did you start studying this?

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,730
I was working at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Can I say it on the air for a dollar,

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,030
for a dollar an hour.
And I just thought, man,

22
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,470
I still can't eat coleslaw to this day
cause I would do a hundred pounds of

23
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:27,750
Coleslaw a day. So, um,

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,500
I saw this ad on campus and it said
somebody to work in a sleep lab.

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,460
So I went and applied and I ended up
in the beginning cleaning toilets.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,920
But I just got into all asleep.

27
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:42,360
I thought it was fascinating and I got
fascinated by these giant jerks at the

28
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,240
beginning of sleep. And I said, what
is that? You know? And they said, oh,

29
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:49,660
that's a hypnic jerk. And I said, what
is that? And they said, that's a hypnic.

30
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,620
In other words, no one could really
explain to him why these things happen.

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,220
That's right. So he started poking
around and there were some theories,

32
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:59,940
you know, having to do with
like physiological changes
in your body, you know,

33
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,460
a lowering of oxygen content
or something like this.

34
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:05,160
And you put that kind of
explanation didn't really satisfy.

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,450
It really doesn't say, well why,
what was its function? And, um,

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,010
as I started to look at the literature,

37
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:15,690
I saw that we had a very long
history sleeping in trees.

38
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,640
If we go back to Australopithecus
afarensis this is Lucy.

39
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,860
3 million years ago, Lucy was by
pedal. I mean walking on two legs.

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,590
Lucy lived in the trees. But
unlike the other prime itch,

41
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:30,960
she would sometimes go down to the ground.

42
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:35,940
But on the ground you've got big
bird, you've got snakes, tigers,

43
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,923
and rough times.

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,700
That ground life was stressful.

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,990
But night she crawled
up the tree for safety.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,720
She climbed up in that tree,

47
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:53,310
drops food there for her baby and
she's going to drop off to sleep.

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,460
Her muscles loosen her hands on curl.
She starts to have that relaxation.

49
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,660
Pretty soon she can't feel the tree

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,040
under her back or que the noises
down below. Just stay with me.

51
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,340
[inaudible] okay. That she
feels like she's floating

52
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,560
or falling, falling, falling. That means

53
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,640
I'd be a real good idea
to wake up from that.

54
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,810
Sleep was such a dangerous proposition
for so many millions of years that

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,490
something like the hypnic jerk, if some
of those primates had that behavior,

56
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,710
they may have been just slightly more
likely over millions of years to to adapt

57
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:37,350
and survive and we haven't gotten
rid of it yet is what he's saying.

58
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,100
So that's my jerk is just basically so
I don't get eaten by a lion all these

59
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:44,060
many years. Yeah, that's what he's
saying. Sort of like a Lucy Echo.

60
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,380
Do we know this or we just a mad
no. How are we going to know this?

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,950
This is just a story,

62
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,330
but there is at least one a tantalizing,

63
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:56,900
a bit of evidence to support this
idea. You ask college students,

64
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,370
what are the most common dreams that
you have and falling to is number one or

65
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:05,150
number two most common theme. And
if you go on a college campus,

66
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,470
you know thanks to OSHA, right? You
have no chance of falling off anything.

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,400
They'll make sure that your fullest
drop is like a flutter, six inches.

68
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:17,510
Even then at big yellow and red signs
all over it, but they dream of falling.

69
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:21,830
What, and by the way, the next
most common dream after falling,

70
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,630
it's being chased by an
alien in a blue dress.

71
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,490
Nobody is gonna stay

72
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,463
[inaudible] [inaudible]

73
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,803
[inaudible]

74
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,000
[inaudible] I'm wondering what happened

75
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,093
been falling.

76
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,600
Why is it that elderly people fall down
a lot? If you go into any hospital ward,

77
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:14,290
you'll see lots and lots of elderly people
who are in there with broken hips and

78
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,510
things like that because
they've, they've fallen.

79
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,170
So I started asking my clinician
friends and they say, wow,

80
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,420
they have a poor sense of balance,
muscle weakness. And I said,

81
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:25,720
could it have anything to do with
timing? What do you mean? Well,

82
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,590
one of the things I study is how the
brain sends out signals to the whole body

83
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:30,970
and how these signals come back.

84
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,560
Because the strange part is the brain is
situated all the way at one end of the

85
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,910
body all the way at the top end.

86
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,470
And it's controlling this huge amount of
machinery you have to send signals all

87
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:43,450
the way out to the toes
and all the way back.

88
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,520
And they're surprisingly
slow in the brain.

89
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:49,420
It's about 300,000 times slower than
singles move around in a computer.

90
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,530
So it would be like if you were a NASA
operator controlling the Mars rover,

91
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:58,200
there's a delay between when you send the
[inaudible] seven signals and when you

92
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:00,930
get the feedback, when you get feedback.

93
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,980
And so what happens is the brain is very,

94
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,610
it puts a lot of effort into making
sure that it knows exactly the timing of

95
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:11,750
sending signals out and when it's getting
signals back, and that's how you walk.

96
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:12,584
For example,

97
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,730
do you want the camera? Can
I take it? The camera? Oh,

98
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:18,120
this is like what toddlers
learn in reversed.

99
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,660
Aren't they learning the timings to get
the left foot out in front of the right.

100
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:23,740
That's exactly what they're doing.

101
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,290
They're calibrating the timing
of their whole nervous system.

102
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,071
That's interesting.

103
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,360
Cause that my kid's 10 months old and I
think he's in this calibrating periods

104
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,340
stand up. So what's happening
with him now is he's standing,

105
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:36,130
but then it looks like he's about to
take a step. But then right, it's about,

106
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,980
oh, that was a little
spill. Yes, it's good.

107
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,580
So basically you're saying his little
brain is trying to figure out the timing

108
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,790
on, let me see it. Oh,

109
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,230
electricity racing from brain to
foot and foot back to brain. Yes.

110
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,670
Mission control is going right.

111
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,720
Okay. Sending that message to the feet,
we expect it back in 300 milliseconds.

112
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,240
So

113
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,360
the fall take three. Okay, we're going
to try now. Two 80 milliseconds. Okay.

114
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:04,194
Two 80

115
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,290
ran down to Ooh, tumble
fall. That's exactly right.

116
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,620
A lot of trial and error until you get
the timing right, but get it right.

117
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:14,210
Now you're a walker, right?

118
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,933
How many?

119
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,710
Now something that happens in let's say
multiple sclerosis and maybe also when

120
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:25,610
you get old says David,

121
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,990
is that the timing starts to change
because there's damage to the Xi thing

122
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:33,770
around the nerves and that
slows down certain signals.

123
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,580
So then the brain says, oh, I thought my
foot should have hit the ground by now,

124
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,880
but it hasn't. So I'm going to send
out a corrective motor command.

125
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,180
And then finally the signal does come
back and you've set out this corrective

126
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:47,120
motor command and you'll
stumble with each step.

127
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,510
You fall forward slightly.
And then catch yourself

128
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,183
from falling.

129
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,840
Now we are going to fall far from home.

130
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,470
We're going to have to travel a good
many late years off the planet to fall in

131
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:09,760
this particularly special and gruesome
way. Our father is Neil degrasse Tyson.

132
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:12,400
He's a astronomical
physicist. Is that what he is?

133
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,860
Here he is at the Herbst theater.

134
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:18,640
I like saying that [inaudible] theater
in San Francisco in front of an audience

135
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,713
talking about

136
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,160
falling apart. Um, my name,

137
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,010
my own business on the airplane and
someone looks and sees what I'm doing.

138
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:29,830
They find out I do astrophysics,
the outcome, the questions.
When will life end?

139
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,950
Will the asteroid com, will the Aztec
calendar destroy the earth? There's all,

140
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,950
there's, it goes on and on.

141
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,830
So I figured people like death in mayhem,

142
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,570
so I might as well title the book with
that because there's a whole chapter on

143
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,940
how to die as you fall into a black hole,

144
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:49,550
which I personally think it's a
kind of kind of cool way to die

145
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,150
because what happens is the gravity
of the black hole is extreme.

146
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:58,340
As you can imagine, light
doesn't even escape.

147
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,380
Its gravity is so extreme light
traveling at the speed of light.

148
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,940
All right? So if light doesn't come
out, nothing's coming out. It's black.

149
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,780
You fall in, you're not coming
out. It's a one way trip. Okay,

150
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,880
so you don't just die cause you disappear.
You die long before you disappear.

151
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,110
As you fall in,

152
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,920
the gravity at your feet becomes rapidly
greater than the gravity at your head.

153
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,310
So your feet start falling
faster than your head does.

154
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,160
That's a bad situation to be in.

155
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,900
You don't really know initially
you kind of feel good, you know,

156
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,380
cause it's every you, we all stretch.
When you wake up in the morning.

157
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,720
Initially it feels like a stretch.

158
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,140
But what happens is that stretch continues
beyond comfort levels and you reach a

159
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:53,060
point where, and they're called the
tidal forces, tides on your body.

160
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:58,061
Basically the tidal force comes so great
that they exceed the intermolecular

161
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:01,400
forces that bind your flesh.

162
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,960
And so the point comes where you snap
into two pieces likely to happen at the

163
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:12,480
base of your spine. Now you
are two pieces. No. Now,

164
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,180
I know you didn't ask about this, but

165
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,340
it turns out you will survive that
snap because below your waist,

166
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:23,660
while there are the important organs,

167
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,640
there are no vital
organs below your waist.

168
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,760
So your torso will stay
alive for a little while,

169
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,750
okay? Until you bleed to death.

170
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:35,540
But this all happens much faster
than it would take to bleed to death.

171
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,720
So these two pieces then feel tidal
forces and then they snap into two pieces

172
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,810
and then they snap again into eight and
then 16 and then you're bifurcating your

173
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:51,260
way down. And so eventually it's
your head and multiple other parts.

174
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,500
And so that will continue until you are
a stream of Adams descending toward the

175
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:00,520
abyss. And it turns out
that's not the worst of it.

176
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,190
Okay? The worst,

177
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,610
it turns out the fabric of space and
time funnels down towards a black hole.

178
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,180
So the space that you occupy up here is
larger than a space you occupied down

179
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,990
here. So in fact, you're getting,

180
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,310
while you're getting stretched,
you getting screened,

181
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,700
extruded through the fabric
of space like toothpaste.

182
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,023
[inaudible]

183
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,300
well, we're, we're about to fall away.
I think we can it. Yeah. Okay. Nice.

184
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:54,160
One Nice one. [inaudible]
before we do though. Uh, no,

185
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,990
that we have podcasts. It's a radio
lab.org and Gen ed. Boom. Rod. I remember.
