&gt;&gt; TASSMUND: Hi there. Matt Tassmund, we're
from iRevolution. I'm going to show you our

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:13.080
product WaveLook today. So, our goal at iRevolution
is to revolutionize communication and we believe

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.269
Wave revolutionized communication. We've been
working with Wave right from the start. Our

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.199
focus has been the enterprise, specifically
Microsoft Outlook and Exchange. All of us

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.689
working the enterprise, we all dealt with
a lot of e-mail. We all dealt with shuffling

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.743
data from Skype to Excel to, you know, Outlook
to PowerPoint and back. And we felt Wave was

00:00:32.743 --> 00:00:38.190
a better way and we've working on it right
from the start. So I'm going to show you three

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.820
things today. The first thing is our Outlook
integration. So we have a product, WaveLook

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.990
for Outlook. It's available today. You can
download it from our website at wavelook.com,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.480
click on the nice download button, it's in
beta. So let's take a look here. I have Outlook

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.891
running. WaveLook for Outlook lets you add
your WaveLook account into--your Wave account

00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:10.560
into Outlook. You can add it right into your
inbox. So here are my matttassmund@gmail.com

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.930
Waves, sorry, e-mails in the same inbox with
my matttassmund@gmail.com Waves. So that's

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.830
something that was important--that's something
that was important to us because we were tired

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.930
of having to have Gmail in one browser tab
and Wave running in another browser tab, so

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.500
we integrated right into your inbox. The other
option we have is you can actually have a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.000
separate .pst file here. This is a WaveX we
test at Googlewave.com that is a separate

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.369
.pst that syncs directly to that .pst. So
this is Outlook with two users' accounts from

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:56.229
Wave integrated into the same histories. So
we basically built our own editor. We started

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.090
from scratch. This is all in C# because Outlook,
you have to do everything in C#. And so, for

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.331
example, here is our rich text editor. This
is our standard test Wave. I can come in here.

00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:12.752
Actually, there's one of our guys editing.
Right here, I can come in. I can edit it at

00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:18.110
the same time. It's just a standard Wave editor
that we built from scratch. What's interesting

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.240
is we also got draft edit working, so I can
go into draft mode. Actually, notice that

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.880
Kevin's actually in live mode and so he is
still is typing while I'm in draft mode and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.130
then when I'm ready to go, I can hit set.
So we modeled this based on how e-mail works,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.580
how the enterprise works, how people that
use Outlook works and we followed--that's

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:47.680
the model we worked on. We also have playback
and we have--so here's playback, for example.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.740
So it kind of goes through and shows you all
the deltas and you can go back and forward

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.850
in time. We have inline comments working,
replies, every--I mean, pretty much all Wave

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.570
functionality including private replies. So
that was our first product that we released.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.560
It's WaveLook for Outlook. This was released
back in July and we've seen adoption. And

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.560
around the same time, we started working on
our own Wave server. So, I'm going to show

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:24.560
you that next. Actually, one last thing, so
here is the same Wave in two different accounts.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.230
So this is matttassmund@gmail.com. There's
a WaveX we test at gmail.com and it works

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.370
even inside Outlook where, as I type stuff,
it shows up on the other side. This is the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.794
standard Wave and every loves but running
inside the Outlook--running inside the Outlook

00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:46.420
and Exchange and the reason is that half the
enterprise, I think about 500 million accounts,

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.280
use Outlook and Exchange, so that's what we're
targeting. The next thing that we started

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.340
working on was our own Wave server. So, we
got that. We've been working on it for months

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.950
and we finally have it working. And so, let
me show you what that is. So here, like I

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.940
said, it's all C#. That's [INDISTINCT] studio
and that's our server running. I'm going to

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.570
go to local host. And we actually have this
running in the cloud and also something you

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:22.440
can download and install on premises. So I'm
going to login with my wavelook@wavelook account,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.980
and I login. Now, so we built the server and
we needed something to make sure our server

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.810
worked. So what we did is we got the existing
Google web client running against our server

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.290
and it really helped because it helped us
rally in a lot of the things that we were

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.010
doing wrong, but basically because of that,
you can now go in here and you can edit Waves

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.210
and do all that fun stuff. So that's our server
that we're running. We'll be switching to

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.630
the Wave in the Box web client, I guess, at
some point, although it's in Java and all

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.070
of this is in C#, so we'll have to figure
out something there. And then around the time

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.820
that the Wave project got canceled, we worked
on the server and we decided to build a migration

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.540
tool because we had a lot of data in Wave
and we wanted to make sure it was preserved.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.540
But what was important to us was we didn't
want the forking to happen, where once we

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.250
migrate now, if I have some people who haven't
migrated, if they make changes to the one

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.950
on Google Wave then, you know, I loose them
because I've already forked. So what we ended

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.820
up doing was we ended up creating--so let
me open up our other build of the server--we

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.560
ended up creating a migration for Google Wave
but with two-way sync. And what that means

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.900
is--so let me login--what that means is I
log in with my Gmail account or my Gmail credentials

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.283
or any Wave account, any Google Wave account
credentials--that's Gmail, and this is my

00:05:51.283 --> 00:06:02.090
actual Wave--and I hit migrate. And now, eventually,
this is--these are my actual waves from Google

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.320
Wave running on our server. Any changes I
make are actually applied first on our server

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.590
but we treat the Google Wave server as the
master. So--and basically that allows us to

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.510
keep running in a two-way sync with Google
Wave servers until they go offline, at which

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.640
point this server will become the master for
the Wave. But the advantage of that is if

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:28.000
I log in to my Wave account, I can--so this
is the same Wave that has been migrated; Google

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.470
Wave on the right, our sever running on the
left, but I can edit the same Wave on our

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:41.111
servers. And we first OT it and store it on
our server, send it to Google Wave and then

00:06:41.111 --> 00:06:47.110
based on what happens, we go back.
&gt;&gt; Which protocol do we use to talk to Google

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.120
Wave?
&gt;&gt;TASSMUND: So we started working on this

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.050
a long time ago and there was no protocol,
so we reverse engineered the ACTP protocols

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.130
that the client--and use it right now. So
they're--so that's what we're using.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.430
&gt;&gt; That client, are you proxying the Google
client and then...?

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.190
&gt;&gt;TASSMUND: No. So what we actually have working
is two-way sync. So any change that comes

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.740
through, we first write it to our server and
then send it out to Google.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.370
&gt;&gt; Did that client that you--that's the GWT
client that you [INDISTINCT]?

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.159
&gt;&gt;TASSMUND: Oh yes, it's just that we took
the JS files. It's all obfuscated.

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:21.090
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.
&gt;&gt;TASSMUND: And we're hosting them on our

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.090
server.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then?

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.650
&gt;&gt;TASSMUND: But then it's talking back to
our server.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.520
&gt;&gt;Right. Okay.
&gt;&gt;TASMUND: And so those are the--that's what

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.169
we've been working on, the Outlook for the
enterprise and then our own server and then

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:37.960
migration because we felt that all of us,
you know, we want people to migrate, but if

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.889
you migrate and you can't talk to the people
again that you were talking to before, then

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:46.680
you kind of have this forking issue. And so,
this is our solution at solving that. That's

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:53.130
kind of what we're working on. And yeah, so
any questions? You know, you can download

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.741
WaveLook today. We're doing a quick survey
on Wave usage, so we'll appreciate it if people

00:07:57.741 --> 00:08:03.410
could sign up. And then also, you know, our
server and--will be available soon, so if

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:13.180
you guys can--if you want to--if you want
to try it out, you can sign up for that there.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.400
&gt;&gt; All right, this thing is very cool.
&gt;&gt; TASSMUND: Oh, thanks.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.890
&gt;&gt; Does the Wave server support [INDISTINCT]?
&gt;&gt; TASSMUND: That's something we're working

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:24.150
on. It doesn't support it yet, but that's
what we're working on. It does support persistent.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.199
So, for example, I could have two people--and
it's kind of interesting. We came up with

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:32.000
our own persistent system and then we saw
the file-base system. It was, like, almost

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.510
exactly the same because we have the same
thing where--I think our only differences

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.870
are we store a file for a Wave and then a
folder for Wave or something like that, but

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:50.050
it was very similar when we saw the spec you
put out. Someone else had a question? Okay.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:55.920
Okay. Yeah. If you have any other questions,
I'll be around and, you know, just let me

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.520
know.
&gt;&gt; I do have a question though. So the current

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.120
integration in Outlook, what server agent
is that right now?

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.560
&gt;&gt; TASSMUND: It works with the Google Wave
server or our servers, either one.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:12.480
&gt;&gt; So the server is something that integrates
with Exchange or is something that has to

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.020
be installed?
&gt;&gt;TASSMUND: So the server, if you want, can

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:20.060
integrate it with Exchange so we can get contacts
directly. And then from a web client perspective,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.330
we're going to do--be doing an Exchange integration
that integrates directly into the Outlook

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:30.230
web client. So that would be a direct integration
into Exchange. So, it's up to you. If you

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:35.550
want contacts and, you know, the admin and
the client access, then you would integrate

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.959
into Exchange and you would be able to use
the Windows domain credentials.

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:42.830
&gt;&gt; What is the--when the server integrates
with Exchange, what kind of integration do

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.820
you use?
&gt;&gt;TASSMUND: Right now, it's just SSL or HTTP

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:54.610
because our sever exposes the same authentication
as the Google Wave server does, that we basically

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.170
got it working as Google Wave server and then
made our server do the same thing.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.830
&gt;&gt; So the integration with Outlook, if I want
Outlook, then I can [INDISTINCT] using the

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.360
password in order to get at my Waves?
&gt;&gt; TASSMUND: Yes. So the first time you have

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:12.240
to--for now, you have to go in and you have
to add an account and we just ask you for

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:18.340
your credentials. But once we have the Exchange
integration fully completed, then you'll actually

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:23.670
just use your Exchange credentials, as long
as you have our server running with the same

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:28.660
credentials.
&gt;&gt; Do you make the Exchange with the principal

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.930
Windows [INDISTINCT] server?
&gt;&gt;TASSMUND: No, no. So we got it working as

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.399
a Google Wave server and then built our server
to match the Google Wave server, which is

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:43.210
why the same client can talk to either server.
Okay, well, thank you very much. Let me know

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.200
if you have any questions. We'll be around.
change integration fully completed, then you'll

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.200
actually just use your Exchange credentials,
as long as you have our server running with

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200
the same credentials.
&gt;&gt; Do you make the Exchange with the principal

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200
Windows [INDISTINCT] server?
&gt;&gt;TASSMUND: No, no. So we got it working as

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:49.203
a Google W
