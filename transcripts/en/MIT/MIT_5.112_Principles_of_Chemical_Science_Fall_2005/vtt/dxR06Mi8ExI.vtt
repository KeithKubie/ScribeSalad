00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.241
What I am going to do today is
I am going to start talking

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:23.735
about the development of atomic
theory.

00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:28.701
I am going to whiz through what
the evidence is for the

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:33.530
existence of atoms.
And then, we are going to talk

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.084
about how the atom is not the
most basic constituent of

00:00:38.084 --> 00:00:42.385
matter, how the atom can be
divided into at least an

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:46.855
electron and a nucleus.
And then, what we are going to

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:50.987
see is how the existing
classical way of thinking,

00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:54.614
Newtonian mechanics,
cannot explain how that

00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:59.000
electron and that nucleus hangs
together.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.774
And later on in the course,
we are going to see how that

00:01:02.774 --> 00:01:06.892
existing classical physics is
not going to be able to explain

00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:10.666
how two atoms hang together.
We are going to look at the

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:14.029
fundamental principles,
here, of chemical bonding.

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:16.705
I am going to get going on this
subject.

00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:19.794
Then, about three-quarters of
the way through,

00:01:19.794 --> 00:01:22.676
I am going to stop.
And then I will do some

00:01:22.676 --> 00:01:27.000
introductions of our teaching
team this semester.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.905
And then also we will talk
about the mechanics of the

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:35.867
course and some expectations of
the course.

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:40.113
Let's get going.
Certainly, the Ancient Greeks

00:01:40.113 --> 00:01:45.679
were known to have pondered
whether matter can be divided ad

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.547
infinitum into smaller and
smaller pieces,

00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:53.509
chopped up into smaller and
smaller pieces,

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.886
or whether there was a point at
which you couldn't chop up

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:04.649
matter any further.
Aristotle over here was one of

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.684
those philosophers who believed
that matter was infinitely

00:02:09.684 --> 00:02:12.599
divisible.
You could chop it up ad

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.955
infinitum.
This is called the continuum

00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:19.047
theory of matter.
It is a continuum.

00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:22.050
There is no discreteness to
matter.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.936
That was his view of the
structure of matter,

00:02:25.936 --> 00:02:30.000
but there was a minority
opinion.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.377
An opinion actually held by
Democritus who was 100 years

00:02:35.377 --> 00:02:40.167
older than Aristotle.
And Democritus believed that

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:44.860
matter was composed of discrete
particles called,

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.921
in Greek, "atomos," "a" meaning
not, "tomos" meaning divisible,

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:55.810
not divisible particles.
Well, for whatever reason,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.871
Aristotle's continuum theory of
matter prevailed all the way up

00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:07.465
to the 17th century.
And here he is depicted by

00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:12.681
Raphael, the frescos on the
walls in the Vatican holding

00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:16.379
court on the continuum theory of
matter.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.500
But at the same time that
Raphael actually painted this

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.189
picture, there were beginning to
accumulate some observations

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:32.974
about how matter behaved and how
it reacted that did not quite

00:03:32.974 --> 00:03:38.000
jive with this continuum theory
of matter.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.719
And what were those
observations?

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:45.223
Well, one of those observations
was by this gentleman,

00:03:45.223 --> 00:03:48.878
Robert Boyle.
Guess what his profession was.

00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:50.492
Chemist?
Good guess.

00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:55.422
He was actually a theologian,
as most chemists were at that

00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:58.226
time.
You know him largely for the

00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:03.325
empirical observation that if
you take the pressure times the

00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:08.000
volume of a gas,
it is always a constant.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.526
At least when the temperature
is constant.

00:04:11.526 --> 00:04:16.688
But Robert Boyle also put forth
probably the first idea of an

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:19.956
element.
And he called elements certain

00:04:19.956 --> 00:04:24.860
primitive unmingled bodies.
And he also put forth the idea

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.021
that these unmingled bodies were
the ingredients of perfectly

00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:34.868
mixed bodies.
Just a pseudonym for molecules,

00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:38.848
for compounds.
And then there is the work of

00:04:38.848 --> 00:04:41.809
this gentleman,
Joseph Priestley.

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:46.714
Guess what his occupation was.
Right, he was a priest.

00:04:46.714 --> 00:04:51.434
And what he did was he carried
out some reactions of

00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:55.413
dephlogisticated air with
various materials.

00:04:55.413 --> 00:04:59.856
And what he found was that
materials reacted more

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:04.483
vigorously in dephlogisticated
air than they did in

00:05:04.483 --> 00:05:09.147
undephlogisticated air.
And, of course,

00:05:09.147 --> 00:05:12.897
dephlogisticated air is nothing
other than oxygen.

00:05:12.897 --> 00:05:16.493
It is the air with the nitrogen
removed from it.

00:05:16.493 --> 00:05:19.860
But it really took this
gentleman, Lavoisier,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.221
to understand what Priestley's
experiments were all about.

00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:28.353
And what Lavoisier realized is
that when materials were

00:05:28.353 --> 00:05:31.337
reacting with this
dephlogisticated air,

00:05:31.337 --> 00:05:37.000
this dephlogisticated air was
kind of adding to the material.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.401
And he came to that conclusion
because he did some very careful

00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:47.628
measurements of the mass of the
dephlogisticated air plus the

00:05:47.628 --> 00:05:53.204
material before the reaction and
some careful measurements after.

00:05:53.204 --> 00:05:56.428
And found that they were indeed
equal.

00:05:56.428 --> 00:06:00.000
There was a conservation of
mass.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.732
And from that Lavoisier was
really the first person to

00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:10.178
realize that a chemical reaction
was analogous to an algebraic

00:06:10.178 --> 00:06:13.571
equation.
He also went on to isolate 17

00:06:13.571 --> 00:06:18.571
different metals and identified
them as elements and nine

00:06:18.571 --> 00:06:23.125
different nonmetals and
identified them as elements.

00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:28.303
But for all of his efforts,
well, we all know what happened

00:06:28.303 --> 00:06:32.305
to him.
He was advisor to the French

00:06:32.305 --> 00:06:34.858
Monarchy.
The judge at his trial

00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:38.647
proclaimed the Republic has no
use for Savants.

00:06:38.647 --> 00:06:42.435
LaGrange, who was a
mathematician at that time,

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:46.388
said, "It took but a moment to
cut off that head,

00:06:46.388 --> 00:06:51.000
though 100 years will be
required to produce another like

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.694
it." Well, here we have some
observations and we have some

00:06:55.694 --> 00:07:00.794
observations --
Oh, I forgot one other person

00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:02.817
here.
That's this guy,

00:07:02.817 --> 00:07:03.202
J.
L.

00:07:03.202 --> 00:07:04.069
Proust.
J.

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.574
L.
Proust was also a French

00:07:06.574 --> 00:07:11.102
scientist at that time,
but he was a little more

00:07:11.102 --> 00:07:15.823
politically savvy.
And so he high-tailed it out of

00:07:15.823 --> 00:07:21.315
France and lived a long and
productive life as a professor

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:24.205
in Madrid.
And what he did were

00:07:24.205 --> 00:07:29.485
experiments.
He recognized from the results

00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:34.042
that when two elements combine
to form a given compound,

00:07:34.042 --> 00:07:38.351
they always did so in definite
proportions by weight,

00:07:38.351 --> 00:07:43.157
regardless of what kind of
method of preparation he used to

00:07:43.157 --> 00:07:48.211
make that particular compound.
Here is an example where matter

00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:51.028
didn't quite behave as a
continuum.

00:07:51.028 --> 00:07:56.000
There was a discreteness of
some sense to matter.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.132
And it really took John Dalton,
an English schoolteacher with

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:08.244
broad interests,
to realize, or to recognize

00:08:08.244 --> 00:08:13.594
these observations of Priestley,
of Lavoisier,

00:08:13.594 --> 00:08:19.062
of Proust that he could
understand all of these

00:08:19.062 --> 00:08:25.363
observations if he resurrected
the idea of Democritus,

00:08:25.363 --> 00:08:30.000
the idea of atomos,
or atoms.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.331
And so he forth some
postulates.

00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:36.994
Well, those postulates are now
known as Dalton's Atomic Theory,

00:08:36.994 --> 00:08:39.701
but they were postulates at the
time.

00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:44.064
And those postulates say each
element is composed of atoms,

00:08:44.064 --> 00:08:48.275
atoms of a given element are
identical and that compounds

00:08:48.275 --> 00:08:51.885
form when atoms of more than one
element combine.

00:08:51.885 --> 00:08:55.194
And, of course,
that atoms are not created or

00:08:55.194 --> 00:08:59.089
destroyed.
And then, just an aside,

00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:03.007
Dalton, with his very broad
range of interest,

00:09:03.007 --> 00:09:06.751
was also really the first
person to document

00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:11.453
colorblindness in humans.
Colorblindness is also called

00:09:11.453 --> 00:09:15.023
Daltonism.
You see, we are getting you set

00:09:15.023 --> 00:09:19.725
for medical school already.
But I want you to recognize

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:24.862
here that Dalton didn't actually
do any of these experiments

00:09:24.862 --> 00:09:27.474
himself.
I think he could have,

00:09:27.474 --> 00:09:32.538
but he didn't.
Instead he just said that if

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:37.523
Lavoisier was right and Proust's
observations are right,

00:09:37.523 --> 00:09:42.690
well, then I can understand
those observations in terms of

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.856
this framework of postulates.
And I point this out because

00:09:47.856 --> 00:09:53.295
this is a powerful method in
science, a powerful way in which

00:09:53.295 --> 00:09:58.190
science works in that there are
often some observations

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:03.326
seemingly disparate.
And then somebody comes along

00:10:03.326 --> 00:10:05.893
and recognizes a unifying
factor.

00:10:05.893 --> 00:10:08.860
In this case,
the presence of atoms or

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.588
discrete particles.
Now, of course,

00:10:11.588 --> 00:10:16.080
Dalton's Atomic Theory here was
not immediately accepted.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.887
And rightfully so.
It needed further

00:10:18.887 --> 00:10:22.577
substantiation.
And that further substantiation

00:10:22.577 --> 00:10:27.470
came in the form of work by this
gentleman, Joseph Gay-Lussac,

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:33.536
the Law of Combining Volumes.
It came in the form of work by

00:10:33.536 --> 00:10:37.679
Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo
Avogadro's hypothesis.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:42.583
And here I want you to realize
that, even though you didn't

00:10:42.583 --> 00:10:45.626
know it, you indeed can read
Italian.

00:10:45.626 --> 00:10:50.615
It says "equal volumes of gases
under the same conditions of

00:10:50.615 --> 00:10:55.349
temperature yield the same
number of molecules or atoms."

00:10:55.349 --> 00:11:00.000
There you go.
That is from an Italian stamp.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.492
You can read Italian.
And that further substantiation

00:11:04.492 --> 00:11:09.157
came from the work of this
gentleman, Ludwig Boltzmann,

00:11:09.157 --> 00:11:13.476
gas kinetic theory,
who recognized - you know - the

00:11:13.476 --> 00:11:18.832
pressure of a gas that must be
due to individual particles that

00:11:18.832 --> 00:11:24.102
are moving and that are ramming
into the walls of some vessel.

00:11:24.102 --> 00:11:27.557
That must be what gives rise to
pressure.

00:11:27.557 --> 00:11:30.840
And then, finally,
it took a statesman,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:36.058
Cannizzaro.
And what Cannizzaro did was he

00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:40.647
got the scientific establishment
at that time,

00:11:40.647 --> 00:11:45.541
and the scientific
establishment at that time for

00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:51.454
sure was a small group of pale
males, to listen to Dalton's

00:11:51.454 --> 00:11:56.858
Atomic Theory and to the
supporting data from Avogadro

00:11:56.858 --> 00:12:02.276
and company.
And ultimately got them to say,

00:12:02.276 --> 00:12:05.869
yes, there is something to it
here.

00:12:05.869 --> 00:12:11.471
And so by the late 1800s,
the idea of atoms was pretty

00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:16.333
strongly ingrained in the
scientific community.

00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:22.569
Now, of course nowadays we can
actually see individual atoms

00:12:22.569 --> 00:12:28.166
for molecules.
And so here is a picture of 28

00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:34.922
individual CO molecules arranged
in the form of a little man or a

00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:38.299
little woman,
I don't know which.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:43.788
And each one of these CO
molecules is an orange ball.

00:12:43.788 --> 00:12:50.122
And what you are looking at are
these CO molecules bound to a

00:12:50.122 --> 00:12:54.872
platinum surface.
They are bound to a platinum

00:12:54.872 --> 00:13:01.311
surface such that the carbon end
is down and the oxygen end is

00:13:01.311 --> 00:13:04.911
up.
And there is a really good

00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:09.176
reason why the carbon end is
down and the oxygen end is up.

00:13:09.176 --> 00:13:13.073
And Professor Cummins,
whom I am going to introduce to

00:13:13.073 --> 00:13:16.750
you in a few minutes,
is going to talk to you about

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.867
what that really good reason is
in the second half of the

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:23.220
course.
We know why this is case.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.852
What you are looking at here is
really looking at the oxygen end

00:13:27.852 --> 00:13:31.529
of the CO molecule,
because we are looking at a top

00:13:31.529 --> 00:13:33.833
view.
All right.

00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:38.250
How is this image made?
Well, this image was made by a

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.750
technique called scanning
tunneling microscopy that was

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.750
invented before you were born,
I am sorry to say.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.583
I am sorry for myself to say.
It was worked on by Ruska and

00:13:51.583 --> 00:13:54.500
then perfected by Binnig and
Rohrer.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:00.000
And they earned themselves a
Nobel Prize for this work.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.934
And the way this techniques
works is the following.

00:14:04.934 --> 00:14:10.164
What you are going to do is
take a thin tungsten wire.

00:14:10.164 --> 00:14:13.618
It might be 0.01 inches in
diameter.

00:14:13.618 --> 00:14:16.973
And you etch it down to a fine
tip.

00:14:16.973 --> 00:14:22.105
You stick it in some potassium
hydroxide, do a little

00:14:22.105 --> 00:14:28.026
electrochemistry and etch it
down to as fine a tip as you can

00:14:28.026 --> 00:14:32.732
make it.
Then you attach that tungsten

00:14:32.732 --> 00:14:37.255
wire to something called a
piezoelectric crystal.

00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:41.401
And a piezoelectric material is
one in which,

00:14:41.401 --> 00:14:47.243
if you put a voltage across it,
you can make it expand a little

00:14:47.243 --> 00:14:52.802
bit, 10, 20 angstroms or so.
And if you can make it expand a

00:14:52.802 --> 00:14:57.513
little bit like that,
well, then you've got control

00:14:57.513 --> 00:15:02.951
on an angstrom-type level.
You attach it to some

00:15:02.951 --> 00:15:08.250
piezoelectric crystal here then
it allows you to move that

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:12.060
tungsten tip by a very,
very small amount.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:17.080
You bring that tungsten tip
close to the top of this CO

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.891
molecule sitting on this
platinum surface.

00:15:20.891 --> 00:15:25.352
And say you bring it to within,
oh, I don't know,

00:15:25.352 --> 00:15:30.000
5 angstroms or so from the
oxygen atom.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.572
Now, the tungsten has
electrons.

00:15:33.572 --> 00:15:40.716
And since this is a bulk metal,
some of those electrons are not

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:45.094
firmly attached to a particular
nuclei.

00:15:45.094 --> 00:15:51.777
There is a sea of electrons.
And what we are going to do is

00:15:51.777 --> 00:15:58.000
put a negative potential on that
tungsten tip.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.250
And we are going to ground here
this platinum surface.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.500
Now, these electrons on the
tungsten, they are in this

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.306
environment of a negative
potential.

00:16:09.306 --> 00:16:13.797
And that is a high-energy state
for them because they are

00:16:13.797 --> 00:16:18.127
negatively charged particles.
If I were to draw here an

00:16:18.127 --> 00:16:22.056
energy level diagram,
I am going to represent then

00:16:22.056 --> 00:16:26.466
the energy level of the
electrons here in this tungsten,

00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:32.000
around this tungsten tip as
some high energy over here.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.648
There are electrons on the
tungsten.

00:16:34.648 --> 00:16:38.735
Whereas, the electrons
associated with the platinum and

00:16:38.735 --> 00:16:42.972
the CO here, all of which are in
contact with each other,

00:16:42.972 --> 00:16:46.983
well, they are at ground.
That is a lower energy state

00:16:46.983 --> 00:16:49.859
for these negatively charged
particles.

00:16:49.859 --> 00:16:52.583
We are going to represent it by
this.

00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:55.081
This is the electrons on
platinum.

00:16:55.081 --> 00:17:00.000
And so this axis here is kind
of a distance access.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.082
These are the electrons on the
tip.

00:17:03.082 --> 00:17:06.618
These are the electrons on the
platinum.

00:17:06.618 --> 00:17:10.063
We are measuring kind of
distance here,

00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:13.961
from here to here,
in the vertical direction

00:17:13.961 --> 00:17:16.681
there.
There is a thermodynamic

00:17:16.681 --> 00:17:22.211
driving force for the electrons
on the tungsten tip to want to

00:17:22.211 --> 00:17:26.925
be here on the platinum,
but the problem is that this

00:17:26.925 --> 00:17:33.000
tungsten is not in contact with
this oxygen end here.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.611
There is a gap.
And if this is in a vacuum,

00:17:36.611 --> 00:17:41.254
we call this a vacuum gap.
And so for an electron to be

00:17:41.254 --> 00:17:45.640
inside of this vacuum gap,
well, that is a very high

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.391
energy state for those
electrons.

00:17:48.391 --> 00:17:53.378
And so, if we were to look at
an energy level diagram here,

00:17:53.378 --> 00:17:58.538
that energy actually goes up
pretty high before it comes back

00:17:58.538 --> 00:18:02.577
down.
There is a barrier to getting

00:18:02.577 --> 00:18:07.022
the electrons from the tip to
the platinum surface.

00:18:07.022 --> 00:18:12.266
Well, you have seen this kind
of reaction coordinate before.

00:18:12.266 --> 00:18:16.711
You have, I am sure.
If you look at an energy level

00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:22.044
diagram here for some reactions,
sometimes you have reactants

00:18:22.044 --> 00:18:28.000
here at a high energy and
products here at a lower energy.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.624
And, in order to get from
reactants to products,

00:18:31.624 --> 00:18:35.325
there is a barrier,
an activation energy barrier.

00:18:35.325 --> 00:18:38.641
You called it E(act) or
something like that.

00:18:38.641 --> 00:18:43.037
And you know that in chemical
reactions typically what you

00:18:43.037 --> 00:18:47.587
have got to do is put energy
into the system in order to get

00:18:47.587 --> 00:18:51.211
over this barrier before you get
any energy out,

00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:53.601
before the reaction can
proceed.

00:18:53.601 --> 00:18:59.000
And that is what happens in a
lot of chemical reactions.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.678
There is a barrier and you have
got to supply that energy to get

00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:08.554
over it before you can make the
reaction go.

00:19:08.554 --> 00:19:12.070
But over here,
in the case of electrons,

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:16.847
those electrons don't act like
atoms and molecules do,

00:19:16.847 --> 00:19:19.912
for the most part.
These electrons,

00:19:19.912 --> 00:19:23.878
what do they do?
They ignore this barrier and

00:19:23.878 --> 00:19:28.746
tunnel right through the
barrier, go right through that

00:19:28.746 --> 00:19:32.741
brick wall.
How can they do that?

00:19:32.741 --> 00:19:37.467
Well, they can do that because
they are quantum mechanical

00:19:37.467 --> 00:19:40.866
particles.
We cannot treat those electrons

00:19:40.866 --> 00:19:44.100
like we treat atoms and
molecules which,

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.080
for the most part,
behave as classical particles.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.811
And, actually,
this is going to be the subject

00:19:51.811 --> 00:19:56.786
of the first few lectures here,
the need for this new kind of

00:19:56.786 --> 00:20:01.346
mechanics to explain phenomenon
like this and to explain

00:20:01.346 --> 00:20:04.931
chemical bonding.
All right.

00:20:04.931 --> 00:20:08.655
So, these electrons tunnel
right through.

00:20:08.655 --> 00:20:13.031
What does that mean?
Well, what that means here,

00:20:13.031 --> 00:20:17.313
for this experiment,
is that if I then take and

00:20:17.313 --> 00:20:22.806
attach a wire to the tungsten
tip and a wire to the platinum

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:27.648
surface and I put an ammeter in
between, I will see a

00:20:27.648 --> 00:20:33.788
measurement of a current.
There are electrons going from

00:20:33.788 --> 00:20:37.692
this tungsten tip to this
platinum surface.

00:20:37.692 --> 00:20:41.317
I measure a current.
Well, that is nice.

00:20:41.317 --> 00:20:45.500
But now, from that,
how do I get this image of

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:50.333
these 28 CO molecules?
Well, what I do is I also have

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:55.910
this tungsten tip mounted not
only on a piezoelectric crystal

00:20:55.910 --> 00:21:00.000
that allows me to go up and
down.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.496
But another piezoelectric
crystal, which allows me to move

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:08.519
it from side to side with
control on the order of an

00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:11.674
angstrom.
I can take the tungsten tip and

00:21:11.674 --> 00:21:15.302
I am going to move it over by a
certain amount.

00:21:15.302 --> 00:21:20.193
And exactly I am going to know
that certain amount is because I

00:21:20.193 --> 00:21:22.954
calibrated my piezoelectric
crystal.

00:21:22.954 --> 00:21:26.346
But now, when I move that
tungsten tip over,

00:21:26.346 --> 00:21:31.000
what is going to happen to this
current here?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.332
Pardon?
It is going to go down.

00:21:33.332 --> 00:21:37.142
It is going to plummet.
It is going to go to zero.

00:21:37.142 --> 00:21:39.630
Why?
Because when I move this tip

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:44.217
over, I increase the distance
between the end of the tip and

00:21:44.217 --> 00:21:48.260
the oxygen onto the molecule.
And when I increase the

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.836
distance, what I do is make this
barrier wider.

00:21:51.836 --> 00:21:56.268
And the wider the barrier is,
the more difficult it is for

00:21:56.268 --> 00:22:00.000
those electrons to tunnel
through.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.762
And so the current actually
goes down.

00:22:03.762 --> 00:22:08.745
To compensate for that,
I am now going to take the

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:14.338
tungsten tip and move it down by
just enough such that I

00:22:14.338 --> 00:22:19.016
reestablish the current that I
originally have.

00:22:19.016 --> 00:22:23.389
And, of course,
I know exactly by how much I

00:22:23.389 --> 00:22:27.661
moved it down because,
again, I have my tip

00:22:27.661 --> 00:22:32.115
calibrated.
I've got two points now.

00:22:32.115 --> 00:22:35.994
I need a third point.
I am going to take that

00:22:35.994 --> 00:22:40.314
tungsten tip and I am going to
move it over again.

00:22:40.314 --> 00:22:43.663
Again, the current is going to
go down.

00:22:43.663 --> 00:22:48.512
But, in order to reestablish
the original current I had,

00:22:48.512 --> 00:22:51.685
I am going to move this down
further.

00:22:51.685 --> 00:22:56.710
And, again, I will know how
much I move the tip over and I

00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:02.000
will know exactly how much I
move the tip down.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.569
To get that image,
I am going to provide a color

00:23:05.569 --> 00:23:08.303
code.
I am going to say that when the

00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:12.708
tungsten tip is the largest
distance away from the surface,

00:23:12.708 --> 00:23:17.189
well, then that is going to
show up here on this picture and

00:23:17.189 --> 00:23:20.531
it is going to show up as a very
light color.

00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:24.556
That is the highest points.
When the tungsten tip is a

00:23:24.556 --> 00:23:27.443
little bit closer to the
surface, well,

00:23:27.443 --> 00:23:32.000
that is going to show up as the
darker colors.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.692
And, as it gets lower and lower
and lower, it is going to be

00:23:37.692 --> 00:23:42.807
deeper and deeper orangey.
Finally, when I am actually

00:23:42.807 --> 00:23:47.535
tunneling to the platinum
surface, instead of a CO

00:23:47.535 --> 00:23:51.973
molecule, I am going to make
that a blue color.

00:23:51.973 --> 00:23:56.798
That is how we get the image of
this molecular man.

00:23:56.798 --> 00:24:02.491
Now, you do see that these CO
molecules are in the form of a

00:24:02.491 --> 00:24:07.391
little person.
This does not represent,

00:24:07.391 --> 00:24:12.473
in the most au courant
language, intelligent design.

00:24:12.473 --> 00:24:17.355
Rather, this represents the
work of a very patient

00:24:17.355 --> 00:24:21.241
experimentalist,
i.e., graduate student,

00:24:21.241 --> 00:24:26.224
who spent 24 hours,
and I know this to be the case,

00:24:26.224 --> 00:24:33.000
moving these CO molecules into
this particular arrangement.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.330
How did he do that?
Well, how he did that is the

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.811
following.
What he did was took this

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:43.275
platinum surface and then opened
up a bottle of CO in the vacuum

00:24:43.275 --> 00:24:46.606
chamber, or let some CO into the
vacuum chamber,

00:24:46.606 --> 00:24:50.503
and the molecules just absorbed
anywhere they wanted to,

00:24:50.503 --> 00:24:54.259
well, sort of anywhere they
wanted to on this platinum

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:55.748
surface.
First of all,

00:24:55.748 --> 00:25:00.000
he had to figure out where the
molecules were.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.410
The soccer balls are the CO
molecules and the tungsten tip

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:10.725
here is my leg and my foot.
And so the first thing he did

00:25:10.725 --> 00:25:15.945
was scan the surface in order to
figure out where the CO

00:25:15.945 --> 00:25:20.786
molecules are and goes,
okay, I know where they are.

00:25:20.786 --> 00:25:26.101
Then he brought this tip down
right next to one of the CO

00:25:26.101 --> 00:25:30.413
molecules.
Then he gave that piezoelectric

00:25:30.413 --> 00:25:35.163
crystal a pulse of voltage which
jerked it and the CO molecule

00:25:35.163 --> 00:25:37.965
went flying away.
Well, that is nice,

00:25:37.965 --> 00:25:41.858
but now where is it?
Again, you have got to go scan

00:25:41.858 --> 00:25:44.506
along the whole surface to find
it.

00:25:44.506 --> 00:25:46.919
Well, he pushed it over too
far.

00:25:46.919 --> 00:25:50.890
Now we have got to come over
here, put the tip down,

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.627
give another voltage pulse
before his tip breaks.

00:25:54.627 --> 00:25:57.586
Well, you get the idea.
24 hours later,

00:25:57.586 --> 00:26:02.543
you've got it.
This is the beginnings of

00:26:02.543 --> 00:26:07.223
nanotechnology.
You can see that it is going to

00:26:07.223 --> 00:26:12.616
be a long time before
manipulation of individual atoms

00:26:12.616 --> 00:26:16.482
and molecules like this,
one at a time,

00:26:16.482 --> 00:26:21.671
before that competes
effectively with synthesis in a

00:26:21.671 --> 00:26:27.165
beaker where you get the
molecules right where you want

00:26:27.165 --> 00:26:32.354
them because of chemistry
instead of this mechanical

00:26:32.354 --> 00:26:38.982
manipulation.
Well, even though 100 years ago

00:26:38.982 --> 00:26:46.048
these direct observations of
atoms and molecules was not

00:26:46.048 --> 00:26:53.114
possible, it was by the late
1800s pretty well accepted,

00:26:53.114 --> 00:26:59.538
or the evidence for the atomic
structure of matter,

00:26:59.538 --> 00:27:05.319
atoms as the most basic
constituent of matter,

00:27:05.319 --> 00:27:12.000
that evidence was really pretty
compelling.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.803
And, in fact,
by the late 1800s,

00:27:14.803 --> 00:27:20.409
it was basically believed that
the theoretical structure of the

00:27:20.409 --> 00:27:24.388
universe was complete.
Nature was understood.

00:27:24.388 --> 00:27:29.000
There were no big discoveries
to be made yet.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.306
And, in fact,
there was some justification

00:27:32.306 --> 00:27:36.096
for that attitude,
because certainly by the late

00:27:36.096 --> 00:27:40.451
1800s Newtonian mechanics,
the mechanics that described

00:27:40.451 --> 00:27:45.370
how bodies all around us moved,
including astronomical bodies,

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:49.564
well, that had already been
known for over 200 years.

00:27:49.564 --> 00:27:53.596
Thermodynamics was formulated
already by that time.

00:27:53.596 --> 00:27:59.000
Statistical mechanics was also
formulated by that time.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.657
Statistical mechanics is a
field that relates the

00:28:03.657 --> 00:28:08.606
microscopic description of
matter to the macroscopic

00:28:08.606 --> 00:28:12.584
behavior of matter.
And, very importantly,

00:28:12.584 --> 00:28:17.824
there were experiments by
Young, Fresnel and Hertz that

00:28:17.824 --> 00:28:23.452
seemed to put to rest the notion
that light was a particle.

00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:28.595
Those experiments really
nailed, or seemed to nail the

00:28:28.595 --> 00:28:35.000
idea of light as a wave,
light has wavelike particles.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.359
They verified Maxwell's
equations that unified the

00:28:40.359 --> 00:28:44.406
fields of optics and
electromagnetism.

00:28:44.406 --> 00:28:50.859
All of these accomplishments
surely did justify a very proud

00:28:50.859 --> 00:28:56.000
feeling amongst the scientific
community.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.505
And, at that time,
the feeling was that the work

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:05.873
that remained was largely to
investigate the next decimal

00:29:05.873 --> 00:29:10.186
place and that is it.
Well, if you look really

00:29:10.186 --> 00:29:13.445
carefully, though,
at the evidence,

00:29:13.445 --> 00:29:17.088
even with all of these
accomplishments,

00:29:17.088 --> 00:29:21.401
there were beginning to be,
in the late 1800s,

00:29:21.401 --> 00:29:25.427
some experiments that were
suggesting that,

00:29:25.427 --> 00:29:30.795
one, maybe the atom was not the
most basic constituent of

00:29:30.795 --> 00:29:35.115
matter.
That was the first set of

00:29:35.115 --> 00:29:39.094
measurements that indicated
something was amiss,

00:29:39.094 --> 00:29:44.003
the fact that the atom wasn't
the most elementary particle.

00:29:44.003 --> 00:29:48.573
And we are going to look at
these sets of measurements.

00:29:48.573 --> 00:29:53.652
Second, the other observation
that hinted that this classical

00:29:53.652 --> 00:29:58.476
thinking as amiss was the
observation of the photoelectric

00:29:58.476 --> 00:30:02.412
effect.
Because the photoelectric

00:30:02.412 --> 00:30:07.815
effect, what it did was it
showed that light was behaving

00:30:07.815 --> 00:30:12.929
like a particle and not a wave,
and that sent a lot of

00:30:12.929 --> 00:30:17.657
consternation throughout the
scientific community.

00:30:17.657 --> 00:30:21.517
We are going to look at these
two tracks.

00:30:21.517 --> 00:30:27.210
And we are going to start by
talking about the fact that the

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:33.000
atom is not the most basic
constituent of matter.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.389
That at least you can divide
the atom up into an electron and

00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:42.071
a nucleus.
We are going to start here with

00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:43.778
this gentleman,
J.J.

00:30:43.778 --> 00:30:46.293
Thompson.
Remember that name.

00:30:46.293 --> 00:30:50.874
It is going to come back.
Discovery of the electron.

00:30:50.874 --> 00:30:52.850
This is 1897.
What J.J.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:57.880
Thompson was interested in
doing was understanding what a

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:03.000
discharge was,
or what made up a discharge.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.015
For example,
if you have a glass vessel that

00:31:07.015 --> 00:31:12.990
you evacuate and then you have a
cathode in that glass vessel and

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:18.593
you have an anode in that glass
vessel, and you also put some

00:31:18.593 --> 00:31:23.262
molecular hydrogen in it,
fill it up with molecular

00:31:23.262 --> 00:31:26.716
hydrogen.
But now what you do is put a

00:31:26.716 --> 00:31:32.319
negative voltage on the cathode
and a positive voltage on the

00:31:32.319 --> 00:31:36.121
anode.
And you crank up the potential

00:31:36.121 --> 00:31:39.515
energy difference,
the voltage difference between

00:31:39.515 --> 00:31:43.333
the cathode and the anode.
And you keep cranking it up.

00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:47.646
You have to get really pretty
high, but at some point all of a

00:31:47.646 --> 00:31:51.535
sudden what happens is that the
gas here begins to blow.

00:31:51.535 --> 00:31:54.858
And you get the establishment
of this discharge,

00:31:54.858 --> 00:31:56.272
this plasma.
And J.J.

00:31:56.272 --> 00:32:00.444
Thompson was just interested in
finding out what was in this

00:32:00.444 --> 00:32:04.743
plasma.
What he did to investigate it

00:32:04.743 --> 00:32:10.229
is he punched a hole in this
anode right here and let out a

00:32:10.229 --> 00:32:15.527
little bit of this plasma.
He let it impinge on a kind of

00:32:15.527 --> 00:32:20.351
phosphor screen here.
Even though the plasma leaking

00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:26.121
out was kind of glowing in the
dark, well, it also was glowing

00:32:26.121 --> 00:32:31.396
when it hit the phosphor screen.
That lit up.

00:32:31.396 --> 00:32:38.030
But then he took a pair of
parallel metal plates above and

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:45.362
below this luminous beam and put
a potential difference on them,

00:32:45.362 --> 00:32:49.900
some delta V.
And this delta V is just a

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:57.000
fraction of what this delta V
is, so it is very small.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.963
But what he noticed is that
some of this luminous beam was

00:33:01.963 --> 00:33:06.751
actually attracted toward that
positively charged plate.

00:33:06.751 --> 00:33:11.366
And so, if you have got
something that is attracted to

00:33:11.366 --> 00:33:16.416
this positively charged plate,
what does it mean about this

00:33:16.416 --> 00:33:19.377
particle?
It is negatively charged.

00:33:19.377 --> 00:33:22.163
It is just Coulomb's
interaction.

00:33:22.163 --> 00:33:27.387
And he could measure right here
the amount of deflection from

00:33:27.387 --> 00:33:32.692
the center line.
I am going to call that amount

00:33:32.692 --> 00:33:38.256
of deflection delta X sub minus
to indicate that

00:33:38.256 --> 00:33:42.294
this looks like a negatively
charged particle.

00:33:42.294 --> 00:33:47.858
Now, Thompson also knew enough
electromagnetism at that time to

00:33:47.858 --> 00:33:53.243
realize that the amount of that
deflection has to be directly

00:33:53.243 --> 00:33:58.000
proportional to the charge on
that particle.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.649
In other words,
the greater the charge the

00:34:01.649 --> 00:34:06.099
larger the deflection.
I am going to represent that

00:34:06.099 --> 00:34:11.083
charge by E sub minus.
He also recognized that the

00:34:11.083 --> 00:34:15.712
heavier that particle,
the more difficult it is going

00:34:15.712 --> 00:34:21.141
to be to deflect the particle to
the positively charged plate.

00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:25.502
That amount of deflection is
going to be inversely

00:34:25.502 --> 00:34:32.000
proportional to the mass of that
negatively charged particle.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.615
But then Thompson did a further
experiment.

00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:40.865
He increased delta V even more.
And here, I am taking a little

00:34:40.865 --> 00:34:44.825
liberty with the story.
It is a little bit more

00:34:44.825 --> 00:34:49.645
complicated, but I am just
trying to get the essence here

00:34:49.645 --> 00:34:52.744
across.
He cranked this up some more.

00:34:52.744 --> 00:34:56.875
And then, if you looked really,
really carefully,

00:34:56.875 --> 00:35:01.696
what happened is he also saw
some of this being deflected

00:35:01.696 --> 00:35:06.000
toward the negatively charged
plate.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.938
Indicating that,
lo and behold,

00:35:08.938 --> 00:35:14.226
there must also be some
positively charged particles in

00:35:14.226 --> 00:35:18.927
this luminous beam.
And he called that deflection

00:35:18.927 --> 00:35:25.097
delta X sub plus.
Again, the amount of deflection

00:35:25.097 --> 00:35:30.778
for the positively charged
particles has to be proportional

00:35:30.778 --> 00:35:36.850
to the charge on that positively
charged particle and inversely

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:44.000
proportional to the mass of that
positively charged particle.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.263
But the other critical
observation that he made was

00:35:49.263 --> 00:35:54.421
that the amount of deflection
for a given voltage,

00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:59.157
for that negatively charged
particle was much,

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:05.368
much larger that the amount of
deflection for the positively

00:36:05.368 --> 00:36:10.423
charged particle.
That is the evidence.

00:36:10.423 --> 00:36:15.615
Now we have to think.
Now we have to make some

00:36:15.615 --> 00:36:19.653
guesses.
What he guessed is that the

00:36:19.653 --> 00:36:25.769
positively charged particles
here were H plus.

00:36:25.769 --> 00:36:31.494
How did he know that?
Well, what he did know is that

00:36:31.494 --> 00:36:35.901
in this plasma there were some
neutral hydrogen atoms.

00:36:35.901 --> 00:36:39.477
He knew that.
How he knew that I am going to

00:36:39.477 --> 00:36:43.884
tell you, or we are going to
talk about in a few days.

00:36:43.884 --> 00:36:48.791
But he knew that this plasma
takes the H two molecule

00:36:48.791 --> 00:36:52.366
and tears it apart and makes
hydrogen atoms.

00:36:52.366 --> 00:36:56.940
And he knew it was neutral.
And so he reasoned that what

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.513
must be happening is that
something has to be coming off

00:37:01.513 --> 00:37:08.000
of this hydrogen atom to make it
a positively charged particle.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.346
He said, okay,
this is going to be H plus.

00:37:11.346 --> 00:37:14.190
But then, because this was

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:18.038
neutral to begin with,
whatever came off of the

00:37:18.038 --> 00:37:22.471
hydrogen has to be that
negatively charged particle so

00:37:22.471 --> 00:37:26.235
that when they come together
they are neutral,

00:37:26.235 --> 00:37:30.000
because a hydrogen atom is
neutral.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.589
And, of course,
ultimately that negatively

00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:37.004
charged particle was called an
electron.

00:37:37.004 --> 00:37:41.907
But the key point is that he
said, well, it must be then,

00:37:41.907 --> 00:37:47.161
when these two particles come
together, you are going to have

00:37:47.161 --> 00:37:51.276
a neutral particle.
It must be that the absolute

00:37:51.276 --> 00:37:56.442
magnitude of the charge on that
negatively charged particle,

00:37:56.442 --> 00:38:00.294
the electron,
that has to equal the magnitude

00:38:00.294 --> 00:38:04.585
of the charge on that positively
charged particle,

00:38:04.585 --> 00:38:10.844
this hydrogen plus ion.
That was the conjecture.

00:38:10.844 --> 00:38:17.599
Well, if that is the case,
if I then take a ratio of delta

00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:24.118
X minus the delta X plus,
what I am going to get here is

00:38:24.118 --> 00:38:30.874
just that it will be equal to
the mass of the hydrogen ion

00:38:30.874 --> 00:38:37.392
divided by the mass of this
negatively charged particle,

00:38:37.392 --> 00:38:42.336
the electron.
But the observation here is

00:38:42.336 --> 00:38:46.403
that this deflection,
for the negatively charged

00:38:46.403 --> 00:38:51.769
particle, is much larger than it
was for the positively charged

00:38:51.769 --> 00:38:53.846
particle.
That must mean,

00:38:53.846 --> 00:38:58.432
if this is an equality,
that the mass of this hydrogen

00:38:58.432 --> 00:39:03.365
ion is much, much greater than
the mass of this negatively

00:39:03.365 --> 00:39:07.000
charged particle,
the electron.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.897
And this is the stunning
result.

00:39:09.897 --> 00:39:13.168
It is stunning because,
at the time,

00:39:13.168 --> 00:39:18.121
it was already known that a
hydrogen atom is the least

00:39:18.121 --> 00:39:22.046
massive atom.
There wasn't evidence for any

00:39:22.046 --> 00:39:27.000
other atom less massive than a
hydrogen atom.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.532
And so here,
in this experiment,

00:39:29.532 --> 00:39:34.350
what we are finding is that
there is a particle that is less

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:39.333
massive than the hydrogen atom.
You can chop the hydrogen atom

00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:42.028
up.
The atom is not the most basic

00:39:42.028 --> 00:39:46.112
constituent of matter.
There is some other particle

00:39:46.112 --> 00:39:50.768
here, which we are going to call
an electron, that is less

00:39:50.768 --> 00:39:55.342
massive than a hydrogen atom.
That was the first piece of

00:39:55.342 --> 00:39:59.507
evidence for being able to split
that hydrogen atom,

00:39:59.507 --> 00:40:04.000
or that atom up into smaller
particles.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.517
The first evidence that the
atom was not the most basic

00:40:08.517 --> 00:40:12.950
constituent of matter.
Now, it took another ten years,

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:17.133
the Millikan oil-drop
experiment, for this ratio to

00:40:17.133 --> 00:40:22.403
actually be measured accurately
and for the mass of the electron

00:40:22.403 --> 00:40:26.000
to actually be measured
accurately.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.693
And what we now know is that it
takes 1,836 masses of the

00:40:30.693 --> 00:40:33.693
electron to equal the mass of a
hydrogen atom.
