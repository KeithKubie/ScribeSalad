00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.560
I've now done a bunch of videos
on thermodynamics, both

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.070
in the chemistry and the
physics playlist, and I

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.750
realized that I have yet to give
you, or at least if my

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.300
memory serves me correctly, I
have yet to give you the first

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.550
law of thermodynamics.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.310
And I think now is as
good a time as any.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.560
The first law of
thermodynamics.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.310
And it's a good one.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.330
It tells us that energy-- I'll
do it in this magenta color--

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.790
energy cannot be created or
destroyed, it can only be

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.680
transformed from one
form or another.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:53.020
So energy cannot be created or
destroyed, only transformed.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.280
So let's think about a couple
of examples of this.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.780
And we've touched on this when
we learned mechanics and

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.960
kinetics in our physics
playlist, and we've done a

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.620
bunch of this in the chemistry
playlist as well.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.860
So let's say I have some rock
that I just throw as fast as I

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.410
can straight up.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.800
Maybe it's a ball
of some kind.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.370
So I throw a ball straight up.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.510
That arrow represents its
velocity vector, right?

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.890
it's going to go
up in the air.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.570
Let me do it here.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.760
I throw a ball and it's going
to go up in the air.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.290
It's going to decelerate
due to gravity.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.530
And at some point, up here, the
ball is not going to have

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.230
any velocity.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.060
So at this point it's going to
slow down a little bit, at

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.160
this point it's going to slow
down a little bit more.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.920
And at this point it's going
to be completely stationary

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.040
and then it's going to start
accelerating downwards.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.690
In fact, it was always
accelerating downwards.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.130
It was decelerating upwards,
and then it'll start

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.200
accelerating downwards.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.220
So here its velocity will
look like that.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.980
And here its velocity
will look like that.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.330
Then right when it gets back
to the ground, if we assume

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.250
negligible air resistance, its
velocity will be the same

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.360
magnitude as the upward but
in the downward direction.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.660
So when we looked at this
example, and we've done this

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.810
tons in the projectile motion
videos in the physics

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.240
playlist, over here we said,
look, we have some kinetic

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.740
energy here.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.550
And that makes sense.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.230
I think, to all of us, energy
intuitively means that you're

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.120
doing something.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.110
So kinetic energy.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.580
Energy of movement,
of kinetics.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.810
It's moving, so it has energy.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.220
But then as we decelerate up
here, we clearly have no

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.880
kinetic energy, zero
kinetic energy.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.860
So where did our energy go?

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.920
I just told you the first law of
thermodynamics, that energy

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.860
cannot be created
or destroyed.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.520
But I clearly had a lot of
kinetic energy over here, and

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.570
we've seen the formula for that
multiple times, and here

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.460
I have no kinetic energy.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.470
So I clearly destroyed kinetic
energy, but the first law of

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.630
thermodynamics tells me
that I can't do that.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.290
So I must have transformed
that kinetic energy.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.440
I must have transformed
that kinetic energy

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.840
into something else.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.010
And in the case of this ball,
I've transformed it into

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.530
potential energy.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.490
So now I have potential
energy.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.970
And I won't go into the math of
it, but potential energy is

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.190
just the potential to turn into
other forms of energy.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.480
I guess that's the easy
way to do it.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.660
But the way to think about it
is, look, the ball is really

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.870
high up here, and by virtue of
its position in the universe,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.120
if something doesn't stop it,
it's going to fall back down,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.890
or it's going to be converted
into another form of energy.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.520
Now let me ask you
another question.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.560
Let's say I throw this ball up
and let's say we actually do

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.820
have some air resistance.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.100
So I throw the ball up.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.990
I have a lot of kinetic
energy here.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.450
Then at the peak of where the
ball is, it's all potential

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.082
energy, the kinetic energy
has disappeared.

00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:50.410
And let's say I have
air resistance.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.020
So when the ball comes back
down, the air was kind of

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.130
slowing it down, so when it
reaches this bottom point,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.340
it's not going as fast
as I threw it.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.910
So when I reach this bottom
point here, my ball is going a

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.450
lot slower than I threw
it up to begin with.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.970
And so if you think about what
happened, I have a lot of

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.890
kinetic energy here.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.890
I'll give you the formula.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.440
The kinetic energy is the mass
of the ball, times the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.500
velocity of the ball,
squared, over 2.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.950
That's the kinetic
energy over here.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.899
And then I throw it.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.160
It all turns into potential
energy.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.590
Then it comes back down, and
turns into kinetic energy.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.850
But because of air resistance,
I have a

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.930
smaller velocity here.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.880
I have a smaller velocity
than I did there.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.910
Kinetic energy is only dependent
on the magnitude of

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.380
the velocity.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.570
I could put a little absolute
sign there to show that we're

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.570
dealing with the magnitude
of the velocity.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.810
So I clearly have a lower
kinetic energy here.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:50.340
So lower kinetic energy here
than I did here, right?

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.370
And I don't have any potential
energy left.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.650
Let's say this is the ground.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.890
We've hit the ground.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.560
So I have another conundrum.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.380
You know, when I went from
kinetic energy to no kinetic

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.365
energy there, I can go
to the first law and

00:05:02.365 --> 00:05:03.000
say, oh, what happened?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.560
And the first law says, oh,
Sal, it all turned into

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.190
potential energy up here.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.510
And you saw it turned into
potential energy because when

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.050
the ball accelerated back down,
it turned back into

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.710
kinetic energy.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.340
But then I say, no, Mr. First
Law of Thermodynamics, look,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.390
at this point I have no
potential energy, and I had

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.830
all kinetic energy and I had
a lot of kinetic energy.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.660
Now at this point, I have no
potential energy once again,

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.930
but I have less kinetic
energy.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.300
My ball has fallen at
a slower rate than I

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.760
threw it to begin with.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.560
And the thermodynamics
says, oh, well that's

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.270
because you have air.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.200
And I'd say, well I do
have air, but where

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.410
did the energy go?

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.990
And then the first law of
thermodynamics says, oh, when

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.970
your ball was falling-- let
me see, that's the ball.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.790
Let me make the ball yellow.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.980
So when your ball was falling,
it was rubbing

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.990
up against air particles.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.990
It was rubbing up against
molecules of air.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.480
And right where the molecules
bumped into the wall, there's

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.100
a little bit of friction.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.310
Friction is just essentially,
your ball made these molecules

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.120
that it was bumping into vibrate
a little bit faster.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.710
And essentially, if you think
about it, if you go back to

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.860
the macrostate/ microstate
problem or descriptions that

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.870
we talked about, this ball is
essentially transferring its

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.630
kinetic energy to the molecules
of air that it rubs

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.360
up against as it falls
back down.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.910
And actually it was doing it
on the way up as well.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.100
And so that kinetic energy that
you think you lost or you

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.360
destroyed at the bottom, of
here, because your ball's

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.920
going a lot slower, was actually
transferred to a lot

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.240
of air particles.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.200
It was a lot of-- to a bunch
of air particles.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.100
Now, it's next to impossible to
measure exactly the kinetic

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.480
energy that was done on each
individual air particle,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.820
because we don't even know what
their microstates were to

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.810
begin with.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.910
But what we can say is, in
general I transferred some

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.070
heat to these particles.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.400
I raised the temperature of
the air particles that the

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.410
ball fell through by rubbing
those particles or giving them

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.000
kinetic energy.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.395
Remember, temperature is just
a measure of kinetic-- and

00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:14.530
temperature is a macrostate or
kind of a gross way or a macro

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.630
way, of looking at the
kinetic energy of

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.960
the individual molecules.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.090
It's very hard to measure each
of theirs, but if you say on

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.890
average their kinetic energy
is x, you're essentially

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.730
giving an indication
of temperature.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.770
So that's where it went.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.210
It went to heat.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.130
And heat is another
form of energy.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.500
So that the first law
of thermodynamics

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.300
says, I still hold.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.000
You had a lot of kinetic energy,
turned into potential,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.860
that turned into less
kinetic energy.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.820
And where did the
remainder go?

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.780
It turned into heat.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.720
Because it transferred that
kinetic energy to these air

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.570
particles in the surrounding
medium.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.010
Fair enough.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.630
So now that we have that out of
the way, how do we measure

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.460
the amount of energy that
something contains?

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.610
And here we have something
called the internal energy.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.060
The internal energy
of a system.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.620
Once again this is a macrostate,
or you could call

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.510
it a macro description
of what's going on.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.556
This is called u for internal.

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:13.250
The way I remember that is that
the word internal does

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.020
not begin with a U.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.440
U for internal energy.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.100
Let me go back to my example--
that I had in the past, that I

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.299
did in our previous video, if
you're watching these in

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:39.130
order-- of I have, you know,
some gas with some movable

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.919
ceiling at the top.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.220
That's its movable ceiling.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.190
That can move up and down.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.860
We have a vacuum up there.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.350
And I have some gas in here.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.360
The internal energy literally is
all of the energy that's in

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.000
the system.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.210
So it includes, and for our
purposes, especially when

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.210
you're in a first-year chemistry
course, it's the

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:07.330
kinetic energy of all the
atoms or molecules.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.820
And in a future video, I'll
actually calculate it for how

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.360
much kinetic energy is
there in a container.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.100
And that'll actually be our
internal energy plus all of

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.780
the other energy.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.590
So these atoms, they have some
kinetic energy because they

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.610
have some translational motion,
if we look at the

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.810
microstates.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.430
If they're just individual
atoms, you can't really say

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.780
that they're rotating, because
what does it mean for an atom

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.580
to rotate, right?

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.050
Because its electrons are just
jumping around anyway.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.670
So if they're individual atoms
they can't rotate, but if

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.970
they're molecules they can
rotate, if it looks

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.440
something like that.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.520
There could be some rotational
energy there.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.790
It includes that.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.630
If we have bonds-- so I
just drew a molecule.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.180
The molecule has bonds.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.020
Those bonds contain
some energy.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.270
That is also included in
the internal energy.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.130
If I have some electrons, let's
say that this was not

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.400
a-- well I'm doing it using a
gas, and gases aren't good

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.930
conductors-- but let's say
I'm doing it for a solid.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.390
So I'm using the wrong tools.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:11.310
So let's say I have
some metal.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:16.250
Those are my metal-- let me do
more-- my metal atoms. And in

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:21.326
that metal atom, I have, a
bunch of electrons-- well

00:10:21.326 --> 00:10:24.540
that's the same color-- I have
a bunch of-- let me use a

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.760
suitably different color--
I have a bunch

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.250
of electrons here.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.720
And I have fewer here.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.660
So these electrons really
want to get here.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.740
Maybe they're being stopped for
some reason, so they have

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.290
some electrical potential.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.250
Maybe there's a gap here, you
know, where they can't conduct

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.970
or something like that.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.610
Internal energy includes
that as well.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.500
That's normally the scope out
of what you'd see in a

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.480
first-year chemistry class.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.810
But it includes that.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.920
It also includes literally
every form of energy that

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.060
exists here.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.870
It also includes, for example,
in a metal, if we were to heat

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.910
this metal up they start
vibrating, right?

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.520
They start moving left and
right, or up or down, or in

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.690
every possible direction.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.760
And if you think about a
molecule or an atom that's

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.420
vibrating, it's going from here,
and then it goes there,

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.960
then it goes back there.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.330
It goes back and forth, right?

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.750
And if you think about what's
happening, when it's in the

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.240
middle point it has a lot of
kinetic energy, but at this

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.670
point right here, when it's
about to go back, it's

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.550
completely stationary for
a super small moment.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.360
And at that point, all
of its kinetic energy

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.590
is potential energy.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.910
And then it turns into
kinetic energy.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.490
Then it goes back to potential
energy again.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.940
It's kind of like a
pendulum, or it's

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.010
actually harmonic motion.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.010
So in this case, internal
energy also includes the

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.990
kinetic energy for the molecules
that are moving

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.110
fast. But it also includes the
potential energies for the

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.530
molecules that are vibrating,
they're at that point where

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:45.470
they don't have kinetic
energy.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.450
So it also includes
potential energy.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.000
So internal energy is literally
all of the energy

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.810
that's in a system.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.270
And for most of what we're going
to do, you can assume

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.190
that we're dealing with
an ideal gas.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.710
Instead of, it becomes a lot
more complicated with solids,

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.580
and conductivity, and vibrations
and all that.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.900
We're going to assume we're
dealing with an ideal gas.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.910
And even better, we're going to
assume we're dealing with a

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.850
monoatomic ideal gas.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.850
And maybe this is just
helium, or neon.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:16.990
One of the ideal gases.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.430
They don't want to bond
with each other.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.250
They don't form molecules
with each other.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.010
Let's just assume that
they're not.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:32.030
They're just individual atoms.
And in that case, the internal

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.340
energy, we really can simplify
to it being the kinetic

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.380
energy, if we ignore all
of these other things.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.690
But it's important to realize,
internal energy is everything.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:44.430
It's all of the energy
inside of a system.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.880
If you said, what's the
energy of the system?

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.280
Its internal energy.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.390
So the first law of
thermodynamics says that

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:56.230
energy cannot be created or
destroyed, only transformed.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.630
So let's say that internal
energy is changing.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.140
So I have this system, and
someone tells me, look, the

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.370
internal energy is changing.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.070
So delta U, that's just a
capital delta that says, what

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.730
is the change an internal
energy?

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.600
It's saying, look, if your
internal energy is changing,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.310
your system is either having
something done to it, or it's

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.780
doing something to
someone else.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.430
Some energy is being
transferred to it

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.540
or away from it.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.950
So, how do we write that?

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.360
Well the first law of
thermodynamics, or even the

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.920
definition of internal energy,
says that a change in internal

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.810
energy is equal to heat added to
the system-- and once again

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:40.810
a very intuitive letter for
heat, because heat does not

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.380
start with Q, but the
convention is

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.490
to use Q for heat.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:49.520
The letter h is reserved for
enthalpy, which is a very,

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.530
very, very similar
concept to heat.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.720
We'll talk about that maybe
in the next video.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.250
It's equal to the heat added to
the system, minus the work

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.500
done by the system.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.180
And you could see this
multiple ways.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.760
Sometimes it's written
like this.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.550
Sometimes it's written that the
change in internal energy

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:18.440
is equal to the heat added to
the system, plus the work done

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.730
on the system.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.960
And this might be very
confusing, but you should just

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.020
always-- and we'll really kind
of look at this 100 different

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:25.990
ways in the next video.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.440
And actually this
is a capital U.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.680
Let me make sure that I write
that as a capital U.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.270
But we're going to do it
100 different ways.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:35.400
But if you think about it, if
I'm doing work I lose energy.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.790
I've transferred the energy
to someone else.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.360
So this is doing work.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.090
Likewise, if someone is giving
me heat that is increasing my

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.380
energy, at least to me these
are reasonably intuitive

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:48.980
definitions.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:54.950
Now if you see this, you say,
OK, if my energy is going up,

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.750
if this is a positive thing, I
either have to have this go

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.340
up, or work is being
done to me.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.220
Or energy is being transferred
into my system.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.930
I'll give a lot more examples of
what exactly that means in

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.880
the next video.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.030
But I just want to make
you comfortable

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.120
with either of these.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.520
Because you're going to see
them all the time, and you

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.200
might even get confused
even if your teacher

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.970
uses only one of them.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.050
But you should always do
this reality check.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.100
When something does work, it
is transferring energy to

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.310
something else, right?

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.120
So if you're doing work, it'll
take away, this is taking

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.340
away, your internal energy.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.780
Likewise, heat transfer is
another way for energy to go

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.180
from one system to another, or
from one entity to another.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:45.680
So if my total energy is going
up, maybe heat is being added

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.730
to my system.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:51.210
If my energy is going down,
either heat is being taken

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:55.450
away from my system, or I'm
doing more work on something.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.690
I'll do a bunch of examples
with that.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.000
And I'm just going to leave you
with this video with some

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.050
other notation that
you might see.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:05.030
You might see change in internal
energy is equal to

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.850
change-- let me write it again--
change in internal

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.290
energy, capital U.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.360
You'll sometimes see it as,
they'll write a delta Q, which

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.060
kind of implies change
in heat.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.820
But I'll explain it in a future
video why that doesn't

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.240
make a full sense, but you'll
see this a lot.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.670
But you can also view this as
the heat added to the system,

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.020
minus the change in work,
which is a little

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.240
non-intuitive because when you
talk about heat or work you're

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.000
talking about transferring
of energy.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.790
So when you talk about change
in transfer it becomes a

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.470
little-- So sometimes a delta
work, they just mean this

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:41.580
means that work done
by a system.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.750
So obviously if you have some
energy, you do some work,

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.760
you've lost that energy, you've
given it to someone

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.610
else, you'd have a
minus sign there.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.060
Or you might see it written like
this, change in internal

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:58.120
energy is equal to heat added--
I won't say even this

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.860
kind of reads to me
as change in heat.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:06.690
I'll just call this the heat
added-- plus the work done

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.630
onto the system.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:15.160
So this is work done to, this
is work done by the system.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.020
Either way.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.040
And you shouldn't even memorize
this, you should just

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.410
always think about
it a little bit.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.349
If I'm doing work I'm going
to lose energy.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.700
If work is done to me I'm
going to gain energy.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.920
If I lose heat, if this is a
negative number, I'm going to

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.290
lose energy.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.710
If I gain heat I'm going
to gain energy.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.440
Anyway, I'll leave you there
for this video, and in the

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.010
