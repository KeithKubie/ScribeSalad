00:00:00.378 --> 00:00:02.182
- [Voiceover] So in the last
video we started talking

00:00:02.182 --> 00:00:05.182
about the system of Jim Crow segregation,

00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:08.387
which was a legal form of segregation,

00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:12.011
and denial of voting rights
or disenfranchisement,

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:14.267
which characterized the American south

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:17.754
from approximately 1877 to 1954.

00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:19.592
Now we finished up by saying that,

00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:23.521
with the end of the Civil
War, the system of slavery,

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.698
which had been the economic
and political system

00:00:26.698 --> 00:00:28.782
which characterized all of the south

00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:32.983
for the 200 plus years
before the Civil War,

00:00:32.983 --> 00:00:34.597
and I finished up by saying,

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:38.764
now that the Civil War has
outlawed slavery in 1865,

00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:44.663
what is the south going to
look like without slavery?

00:00:44.663 --> 00:00:48.619
So in this video, I want to really dial-in

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:53.586
in this period after the Civil
War known as Reconstruction.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.548
Now I don't have room here to go into

00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:58.690
a great deal of detail
about the Civil War,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.105
we'll make many more videos
about that in the future,

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:03.016
but what I do think is important

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:04.740
to note about the Civil War,

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.484
is that for the United States of America,

00:01:08.484 --> 00:01:11.932
often called the north in the Civil War,

00:01:11.932 --> 00:01:15.862
even though the Civil War
really didn't start out

00:01:15.862 --> 00:01:19.944
as a war to end slavery,
by the end of the Civil War

00:01:19.944 --> 00:01:23.675
it had really become a war to end slavery,

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:27.116
as northern armies became in effect

00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:29.575
armies of liberation in the south.

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:32.075
In 1863 Abraham Lincoln issued

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.082
the Emancipation Proclamation,
which ended slavery

00:01:37.082 --> 00:01:41.491
in all states that were rebelling
against the United States,

00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:44.423
and in 1865 the government ratified

00:01:44.423 --> 00:01:47.673
the 13th Amendment to the Constitution,

00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:52.157
which outlawed slavery for good.

00:01:52.157 --> 00:01:54.202
But all the 13th Amendment said

00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:56.119
was that you couldn't have slavery,

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.573
it really didn't say anything about

00:01:58.573 --> 00:02:02.602
what race relations between
whites and blacks in the south

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:04.451
would be after the Civil War,

00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:08.094
or whether not being a slave meant that

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:11.976
an African American person in
the south had the full rights

00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:15.014
of citizenship that a
white person would have,

00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:18.058
so in the immediate
aftermath of the Civil War,

00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:22.543
states in the south began
writing new constitutions

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:24.688
to account for the end of slavery,

00:02:24.688 --> 00:02:29.103
but the white leaders in the
south really have no conception

00:02:29.103 --> 00:02:32.752
of a world where African
Americans are equal to whites,

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:35.492
and so the new laws that they write

00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:38.243
regulating African Americans after the war

00:02:38.243 --> 00:02:43.143
are known as the Black
Codes, and these Black Codes

00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:46.545
are in many ways slavery
by a different name.

00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:49.602
So the Black Codes acknowledged
the end of slavery,

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:53.494
and they give some basic
rights to African Americans

00:02:53.494 --> 00:02:55.744
such as the right to marry,

00:02:57.433 --> 00:02:59.690
which enslaved people could not legally do

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.339
under the system of slavery,

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:03.839
and the right to own property.

00:03:06.445 --> 00:03:09.406
But that is pretty much it.

00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:13.793
The Black Codes did things
like prevent African Americans

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:15.543
from owning firearms,

00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:25.227
from being without a labor contract,

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:30.117
now remember the south is
based on these cash crops

00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:33.609
like tobacco and cotton,
and landowners are terrified

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.064
that if all of the former
enslaved people leave the south,

00:03:38.064 --> 00:03:41.277
they're going to have nobody
to work in their fields,

00:03:41.277 --> 00:03:43.510
nobody to harvest these crops,

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.941
and their economic system
is going to plummet,

00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:48.536
they're already in very bad
shape after the Civil War.

00:03:48.536 --> 00:03:50.536
So they say, all African Americans

00:03:50.536 --> 00:03:53.119
have to be in a labor contract,

00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:59.088
and these labor contracts
were usually very small wages

00:04:01.673 --> 00:04:03.370
for quite a bit of labor,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.480
and if they were not in a labor contract

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.762
or if they left in the
middle of a year, say,

00:04:08.762 --> 00:04:11.679
then they were considered vagrants.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:16.344
And the most outrageous thing

00:04:16.344 --> 00:04:19.515
that these southern governments do is say

00:04:19.515 --> 00:04:22.432
that African Americans cannot vote.

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:27.937
Now to people in the north,

00:04:27.937 --> 00:04:31.231
who had just fought a four year-long war

00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:35.641
where more than half a million
people died, to end slavery,

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:38.822
seeing southern states pass
laws that are pretty much

00:04:38.822 --> 00:04:41.844
slavery with another name, was galling.

00:04:41.844 --> 00:04:45.891
And so the more radical
Republican elements in Congress,

00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:48.435
these are members of
Abraham Lincoln's party,

00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:52.045
who are strongly
abolitionist, who are strongly

00:04:52.045 --> 00:04:55.326
in favour of civil rights
for African Americans,

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:58.727
and strongly in favor of a
strong central government,

00:04:58.727 --> 00:05:02.660
say "OK, this system of
Black Codes is not OK.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.306
"When we said slavery was over,

00:05:04.306 --> 00:05:07.201
"we didn't just mean that
you couldn't enslave someone,

00:05:07.201 --> 00:05:09.029
"we also meant that African Americans

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:11.843
"had full citizenship
rights in the south."

00:05:11.843 --> 00:05:13.736
So to combat the Black Codes,

00:05:13.736 --> 00:05:17.903
Congress passes the 14th
Amendment to the Constitution.

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:24.805
And the 14th Amendment says that anyone

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:27.195
who was born in the United States,

00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:30.126
regardless of whether or
not they were a slave,

00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:33.009
is a full citizen of the United States

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.205
eligible for all of the
benefits of citizenship

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:38.833
and equal protection under the law,

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:43.092
so laws must be equal for
whites and for blacks.

00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:45.602
And we'll get into what that
means, in the next video.
