00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.099
Alright bleeders.

00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:02.469
it’s time to answer the age old question.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.819
do we really need our periods every month?!

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.330
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.330
Periods.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.350
Messy, uncomfortable, inconvenient, and expensive.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.010
Seriously expensive.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.020
Some estimates say a woman will spend over
18,000 bucks over the course of her life on

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.650
products likes pads and tampons.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.460
I’ve about had it.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.410
I’m ready to never have one again.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.410
But is that possible?

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.420
Would it do any harm?

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.110
Every month your body prepares for one of
life’s greatest miracles.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.019
The lining of your uterus thickens in response
to hormones like estrogen and progesterone.

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.129
It grows into layers and becomes filled with
blood vessels in preparation of egg implantation.

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.129
if the egg becomes fertilized and implants
itself in that lining, we call it pregnancy.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.890
And in turn your body punishes you for not
making pregnancy happen.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.570
By shedding the lining, give you lots of cramps
and just messiness.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.760
But along came a little pink pill and changed
everything.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.399
I mean birth control has revolutionized so
much in our society.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.530
From the little pink pill to to the little
copper coil, birth control gave women and

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.559
those with a uterus control over their own
bodies.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.610
So you know what, I say screw it, who needs
a period anyways?

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.940
Turns out, no one.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.940
Not really.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.570
You don’t really need your period.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.890
So you ready to stop your period?

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.890
How?

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.200
Just a little pink pill every morning.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.280
Most birth control contains synthetic versions
of the hormones progesterone and estrogen.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.710
These hormones prevent pregnancy in a few
ways.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.310
Some types prevent ovulation by basically
tricking your body into thinking it’s already

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.450
released an egg.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.340
This way an egg doesn’t get released.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.469
And the progestin actually prevents the build
up of the lining of your uterus and might

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.439
also make the vaginal mucus thicker, making
it more difficult for a sperm to get where

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.439
it’s trying to go.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.060
While some pills you take every day for like
21 days and then take a placebo for a week

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.010
to menstruate, other types stop menstruation
completely.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.240
And this is completely fine, according to
a 2006 study published in the journal Contraception.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.140
The following year a pill that stops menstruation
completely was approved by the FDA.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.420
The only downside, some people might experience
some breakthrough bleeding or spotting throughout

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.420
the month.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.060
And many, many people were really interested.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.679
One survey by the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine found that more than two

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.579
thirds of women were interested in stopping
their periods.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.240
And even more promising, 97% of physicians
said suppressing menstruation is “medically

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.240
safe and acceptable”.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.630
But I should caution that yes, there are some
risks with oral contraceptives,—an increased

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.700
risk of blood clots, heart attacks, and stroke.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.000
But on the other hand it can lower the risk
of ovarian and endometrial cancers

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.950
I know that sounds so.. strange.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.210
You might think that we need periods to remove
“toxins” or something.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.080
That’s an old belief, one of many that tries
to paint periods as disgusting and dirty.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.770
Like this one physician in 1920 claimed he
found that women release 'menotoxins' during

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.240
their period that would actually wilt flowers
if they touched them.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.420
Not kidding.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.510
And there’s nothing true about that to say
the least, but a lot of people still believe

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.840
something close to that.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.960
So is having a period every month natural?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.990
Well weirdly some people think we actually
are having MORE periods than we’re supposed

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.990
to.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.340
In societies that don’t use birth control,
they tend to have more children.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.580
A lot more.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.130
So women spend much of their reproductive
years pregnant or breastfeeding, meaning they

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.410
menstruate less.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.300
Anthropologist Beverly Strassmann of the University
of Michigan, says women in these societies

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.590
typically have 100 periods over the course
of their life.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.510
While women in societies that use birth control
have, like 3 to 5 times as many.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.580
That’s just not fair.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.800
And yeah okay, having a period every month
is a kind of nice reminder from mother nature

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.430
that HEY YOU AREN’T PREGNANT.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.770
But there’s other ways to know you’re
not pregnant.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.030
And hormonal birth control is reversible.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.680
According to the European Active Surveillance
Study on Oral Contraceptives most women had

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.100
no problems getting pregnant after they stopped
taking the pill.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.130
So basically, period havers of the world,
REJOICE!

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.020
If the lining of your uterus doesn’t thicken
thanks to oral contraception, you really don’t

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.020
need a period.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.560
Alright ladies, so have you ever experienced
those moments where you and your roommates

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.630
all are on your period at the same time!?

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.520
ICE CREAM AND GREY’S ANATOMY PARTY!

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.100
No but seriously, is that even possible?

00:03:50.100 --> 00:04:14.870
Amy has the answer in this episode right here.
