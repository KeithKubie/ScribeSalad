00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:10.744
AS WE GO TO
OUR NEXT GAME, I, BIO-BOT.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.213
THE STANDARD TWITTER BIO THESE
DAYS USUALLY TENDS TO BE LIKE

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:16.783
"THING, THING AND THEN KOOKY
THIRD THING."

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:19.553
IT IS SUCH A PREDICTABLE
FORMULA THAT SPAM BOTS HAVE

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:22.356
FIGURED IT OUT. NOW THEY JUST
GRAB PHOTOS OF UNSUSPECTING

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:25.792

MECHANICALLY CONSTRUCTED NAMES

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:35.002

JIANG, WHO APPARENTLY IS

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.672
A MEDITATOR, A SPIRITUALITY
NINJA AND A DOORMAN.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.441
I THINK MEDITATOR WOULD MAKE A
BAD DOORMAN.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.810
THIS IS WHEN COMPUTERS
BECOME SELF-AWARE. IT'S NOT

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:46.013
GOING TO BE THROUGH THE
MILITARY; IT IS GOING TO BE

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.415
(BLEEP)ING SPAM BOTS. THEY ARE
GONNA BECOME SELF-AWARE

AND DROWN US OUT WITH PROMOTIONS
FOR ROLEXS AND BIG DICK PILLS.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.523

HASHTAG WARS AND THEN IT'S ALL
