00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:02.269
- HEY, ALICE?

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.471
CAN WE, UM, HAVE A MINUTE?

00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:06.840

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:10.744
- UH, HOMEGIRL'S DEATH, IT--

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.081
WE'RE--WE'RE PRETTY BUTTHURT

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.883
- REALLY?
- YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO COME IN

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.050
TOMORROW AND JUST

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.720
PLUCK AWAY
AND DO OUR DUTY HERE,

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.923
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M GONNA SOUND OKAY

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.892
[high pitched]
ON THE PHONES, BECAUSE I CAN'T--

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:27.261
- YOU SEE, HE JUST NEEDS
A DAY TO GRIEVE...

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:28.695
- YEAH.
- HAVE A GOOD CRY.

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.230
WE ALL JUST NEED A--
PROBABLY A GOOD CRY.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:31.965
JUST A DAY. ONE DAY.
- YOU WERE GONNA CRY TOO,

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.367
THOUGH, RIGHT?
- NO, I'M--I'M PROBABLY GONNA--

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.868
- SEE, HE'S CRYING TOO NOW.

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:39.206
- YEAH, OKAY, SO IF
YOU GUYS WERE ACTUALLY UP--

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.074
- ALICE! HEY, WHAT'S UP?
I--IT'S AWESOME TO, EH,

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:43.177
RUN INTO YOU HERE.
I WAS JUST OUT THERE,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.078
INDIVIDUALLY TALKING
WITH EVERYONE,

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:48.115
AND WE ALL AGREE THE BEST WAY
TO COMMEMORATE HOMEGIRL'S LIFE

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.150
AND REMEMBER HER IS BY
IMMEDIATELY FORGETTING HER,

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.652
AND JUST WORKING
ALL DAY TOMORROW.

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.453
- OKAY, ADAM,
DON'T MESS THIS UP FOR ME.

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:54.721
YOU KNOW HOW I AM WITH GIRLS.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.723
I'M LIKE A BULL
IN A VAGINA SHOP.

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:57.991
- BLAKE, IT'S NOT MY FAULT

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.860
YOU'RE NOT
A RICO SUAVE DUDE, OKAY?

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.128
- I AM A RICO SUAVE--
- YOU ARE NOT A RICO SUAVE--

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.963
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
THAT IS ENOUGH.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.365
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU GUYS ARE UP TO,

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.135
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT "BUTTHURT" MEANS.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.436
BUT GUESS WHAT.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.872
DEATH HAPPENS,
AND IT'S REAL SAD.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.141
AND WE'RE ALL STILL COMING
INTO WORK TOMORROW.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:16.910
- YES! WE'LL GE--

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:20.147
- SHOULD WE NOT REMEMBER
HOMEGIRL BY AT LEAST

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.949
HAVING SOME SORT OF SERVICE

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.418
FOR FRIENDS, AND CO-WORKERS,
AND OUT-OF-TOWN GUESTS?

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.620
- I DON'T NEED THIS.
- OH, YES.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.822
THAT WOULD BE
VERY GOOD.

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:31.124
- OKAY, FINE.
TOMORROW, AFTER LUNCH,

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:32.292
YOU CAN HAVE A THING.

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:33.861
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:35.229
- WE DON'T NEED A THING.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.897
- THIS IS NOT FA--
ALICE, THIS IS NOT FAIR!

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.333
I AM HAVING THE WORST DAY
OUT OF EVERYONE

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:42.970
IN THIS ENTIRE OFFICE...
EXCEPT--EXCEPT MAYBE HOMEGIRL.
