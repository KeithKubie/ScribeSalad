00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.320
Most of the time, movie cameos are a fun way
to put familiar faces in front of audiences

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.440
-- even if it’s only for a moment or two.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.680
Usually, the whole point of a cameo is that
we’ll recognize the famous person in front

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.680
of us.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.920
But sometimes, directors get a bit sneaky.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.150
They hide famous faces behind masks, make-up
and CGI, and sometimes they just put them

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.750
in roles you wouldn’t expect.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.609
And yeah, sure, this might negate the purpose
of having an extra celebrity or 2 in the movie,

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.130
but it also creates some fun Easter eggs for
fans to discover.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.840
Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven
Orlando Bloom is the star of Ridley Scott’s

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.260
crusades epic Kingdom of Heaven, but he’s
not the only big name in the cast.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.859
In addition to Liam Neesom, Eva Green and
Jeremy Irons, Kingdom of Heaven also features

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.690
an uncredited Edward Norton as Jerusalem’s
King Baldwin IV.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.320
The reason you may not have noticed this?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.210
The historical King Baldwin suffered from
leprosy, and he always wore a mask in public.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.640
So, you guessed it, Norton played the entire
role behind a metal mask.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.240
Then, he requested that his name taken off
the credits so it wouldn’t be spoiled.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.440
But he couldn’t keep it a secret for too
long.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.980
Most critics thought he gave the best performance
in the movie!

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.270
Tim Burton in Hoffa
You may remember Danny DeVito’s grotesque

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.420
performance as the Penguin in Batman Returns,
but that wasn’t the only movie the height-challenged

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.470
DeVito made that year.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.729
He also directed the gangster comedy Hoffa,
starring Jack Nicholson as the famous union

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.570
boss who disappeared under mysterious circumstances
in 1962.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.229
For a funeral scene, DeVito needed someone
to play a dead body lying in a coffin -- so

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.229
who did he choose?

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.189
His Batman Returns director Tim Burton, with
his famously wild hair tamed down as the well-coiffed

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.189
corpse.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.880
We certainly hope DeVito cast Burton as a
friend, and not as some kind of morbid commentary

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.500
about their professional relationship.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.360
Gene Hackman in Young Frankenstein
Comedy legends Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.899
made three movies together: The Producers,
Blazing Saddles, and Young Frankenstein.

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.719
But neither of them had a particularly extensive
track record of working with that other famous

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.000
Gene: Gene Hackman.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.219
Nevertheless, Hackman made a memorable cameo
as a blind priest in Young Frankenstein.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.030
Not being able to see Frankenstein’s monster’s
grotesque appearance, the priest welcomes

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.030
him into his home.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.479
But, despite the best intentions, the kindly
old priest ends up doing more damage to the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.250
monster than the other way around.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.390
At the time, Hackman was more known for thrillers
like the French Connection or The Conversation,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.569
so it must have been a shock for audiences
to find out it was him hidden behind that

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.940
fake beard and wig.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.870
Famous musicians in Harry Potter and the Goblet
of Fire

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.550
Originally, Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand
was meant to play the Weird Sisters, a band

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.599
that performs at the Yule Ball in Harry Potter
and the Goblet of Fire.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.680
But when they dropped out, a hodgepodge of
famous British musicians took over for them.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.260
Jason Buckle of All Seeing I [pronounced:
eye] and Steve Caydon of Add N to (X) play

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.650
rhythm guitar and bagpipes, while Johnny Greenwood
and Phil Selway of Radiohead fill in as lead

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.970
guitarist and drummer.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.730
Meanwhile, Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey
of Pulp cover vocals and bass for the wizarding

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.730
band.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.849
Previously, The Stone Roses’ Ian Brown made
a cameo in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.080
Azkaban as a bar patron.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.970
Who knew the wizarding world was so musical?

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.020
Richard Branson in Casino Royale
Richard Branson, the British business magnate

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.770
behind the ubiquitous Virgin brand, makes
a brief blink-and-you’ll-miss it appearance

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.720
in the James Bond film Casino Royale.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.600
Reportedly, Branson is a huge fan of 007,
and offered the production a plane while they

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.600
were in a tight spot.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.890
In return, the producers allowed him to appear
as a passenger getting flagged by security

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.560
in a scene set at Miami airport.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.630
Branson has made cameos in movies like Around
the World in 80 Days and Superman Returns,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.880
but his appearance in Casino Royale is special
for another reason.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.400
When it was played as an in-flight movie on
British Airways -- a competitor of Branson’s

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.400
Virgin Airlines -- they airbrushed his cameo
out of the film.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.970
Brad Pitt and Matt Damon in Confessions of
a Dangerous Mind

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.640
When George Clooney made his directorial debut
with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, he tapped

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.940
several of his famous friends to help out.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.481
Julia Roberts and Drew Barrymore agreed to
work for less than their usual salary, while

00:03:47.481 --> 00:03:51.879
character actor Sam Rockwell took on the lead
role as TV producer Chuck Barris.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.709
But when it came time to cast the contestants
on The Dating Game, he recruited his Ocean’s

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.310
11 co-stars Brad Pitt and Matt Damon to play
two of the contestants.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.180
Neither actor has any lines, but they both
seem to be losing to a third, more homely

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.930
contestant.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.650
Cameron Crowe and Cameron Diaz in Minority
Report

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.799
After Tom Cruise collaborated with director
Cameron Crowe on Vanilla Sky, he moved on

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.310
to the sci-fi hit Minority Report with Steven
Spielberg.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.799
But for some reason, it seems as though he
couldn’t leave his old crew behind.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.180
When Cruise boards a train in the film, Crowe
can be seen looking over his newspaper at

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.180
him.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.180
And that blonde behind him?

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.180
That’s Cruise’s Vanilla Sky co-star Cameron
Diaz.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.600
Cruise’s Magnolia director Paul Thomas Anderson
was also on the train, but his cameo was cut

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.770
from the final film.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.350
Nevertheless, you can find Scott Frank, the
film’s screenwriter, being told “you’re

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.610
the man” by a host of fake people as he
lives out his fantasies in an artificial reality

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.390
simulator.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.550
Danny Glover in Maverick
Maverick is a light-hearted comedy western

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.070
about a card sharp con man in the wild west,
and Mel Gibson brings his usual roguish charm

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.470
and charisma to the lead role.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.280
The movie is chock-full of cameos that many
people wouldn’t recognize today, including

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.040
Corey Feldman and Margot Kidder.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.950
But one cameo sticks out more than the others.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.750
Who is that man behind the bandana who robs
a bank in front of Gibson’s character?

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.000
It’s none other than Danny Glover, Gibson’s
co-star from the Lethal Weapon series.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.420
The two actors look at each other as if they
know each other, and Glover even utters his

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.580
famous catchphrase from the Lethal Weapon
movies: “I’m getting too old for this

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.580
sh*t!”

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.830
Chris Martin in Shaun of the Dead
OK, if you’ve seen Shaun of the Dead recently,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.380
you probably noticed Coldplay’s Chris Martin
at the end of the film, where he and his Coldplay

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.180
bandmate where “ZombAid” t-shirts.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.170
But Martin also appears earlier in the film,
as one of the zombies chasing down Shaun and

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.120
the gang as they escape from The Winchester.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.221
In fact, Martin isn’t the only celebrity
who appears as a zombie in the film, but the

00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:37.860
others, like Rob Brydon and Paul Putner, are
only well-known in the UK. Chris Martin also

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.180
appeared on the soundtrack to the film, performing
a cover of the Buzzcocks’ “Everybody’s

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.120
Happy Nowadays” with the band Ash.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.430
Daniel Craig and many more in Star Wars: The
Force Awakens

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.260
Simon Pegg, star of Shaun of the Dead, is
no stranger to cameos himself.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.240
He even appeared in the biggest film of last
year, Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.210
Under a great deal of prosthetics, Pegg played
Unkar Plutt, the junk dealer on Jakkar that

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.440
Rey deals with at the beginning of the film.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.350
Other celebrities who appeared in The Force
Awakens include comedians Bill Hader and Ben

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.280
Schwartz, who came up with the unique noises
made by the show-stealing droic BB-8.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.880
Warwick Davis, who famously played an Ewok
in Return of the Jedi, is a patron at Maz

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.940
Canata’s cantina, and Hamilton scribe Lin-Manuel
Miranda provides vocals for the cantina’s

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.940
band.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.940
The most famous cameo, however, is James Bond
himself, Daniel Craig, who is under the helmet

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.710
of one of the stormtroopers guarding Rey on
the Starkiller Base.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.770
So how did you like our list?

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.990
Did we miss any other sneaky cameos that most
people wouldn’t notice?
