00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I think when we did the work and this

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010
I think when we did the work and this
 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.249
I think when we did the work and this
was work that was done I was between the

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259
was work that was done I was between the
 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.889
was work that was done I was between the
ages of 20 and 25 so I was very young I

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899
ages of 20 and 25 so I was very young I
 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.540
ages of 20 and 25 so I was very young I
think we thought the work was exciting

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550
think we thought the work was exciting
 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.700
think we thought the work was exciting
but I think a scientist always thinks

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710
but I think a scientist always thinks
 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160
but I think a scientist always thinks
they work as a sighting and there's a

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170
they work as a sighting and there's a
 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.749
they work as a sighting and there's a
big difference from even if you think

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759
big difference from even if you think
 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.939
big difference from even if you think
your work is exciting and having an

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
your work is exciting and having an
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.130
your work is exciting and having an
impact to get a Nobel Prize it's got to

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
impact to get a Nobel Prize it's got to
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.620
impact to get a Nobel Prize it's got to
be a certain area and I think I've

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
be a certain area and I think I've
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.090
be a certain area and I think I've
always worked in many different areas so

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100
always worked in many different areas so
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.800
always worked in many different areas so
I i think was quite hard for them to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
I i think was quite hard for them to
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.410
I i think was quite hard for them to
find one area that went right back to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
find one area that went right back to
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.429
find one area that went right back to
the beginning so I was certainly

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439
the beginning so I was certainly
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.980
the beginning so I was certainly
surprised you know I think that in

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
surprised you know I think that in
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.889
surprised you know I think that in
science you hardly ever have a Eureka

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
science you hardly ever have a Eureka
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.330
science you hardly ever have a Eureka
moment you have lots of little Eureka

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
moment you have lots of little Eureka
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.490
moment you have lots of little Eureka
moments like I've just found an error in

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
moments like I've just found an error in
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.889
moments like I've just found an error in
a program or will that leave my keys or

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899
a program or will that leave my keys or
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.979
a program or will that leave my keys or
whatever but I think that it's much more

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989
whatever but I think that it's much more
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.529
whatever but I think that it's much more
so science it's sort of a mixture of

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539
so science it's sort of a mixture of
 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.299
so science it's sort of a mixture of
ideas and lots of hard work and you know

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
ideas and lots of hard work and you know
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.430
ideas and lots of hard work and you know
and being very persistent I think you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
and being very persistent I think you
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.380
and being very persistent I think you
have to not give up you have to believe

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
have to not give up you have to believe
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.119
have to not give up you have to believe
in yourself we have to realize that if

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
in yourself we have to realize that if
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.950
in yourself we have to realize that if
it's a new idea people are not going to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
it's a new idea people are not going to
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.900
it's a new idea people are not going to
like it if people like it then it's not

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
like it if people like it then it's not
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.120
like it if people like it then it's not
a good idea
