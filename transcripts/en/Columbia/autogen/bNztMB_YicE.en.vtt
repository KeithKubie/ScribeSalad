learning in our classes for these three
or four years and apply it towards a

or four years and apply it towards a
 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.380
or four years and apply it towards a
problem to help solve with the client

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390

consultants and really understand the
 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.239
consultants and really understand the
constraints that these types of

organizations face before offering our
objective solution so our client is the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030
objective solution so our client is the
 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.420

of nav is not currently being fully met

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350
of nav is not currently being fully met
 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.200
of nav is not currently being fully met
because there's a problem with

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210
because there's a problem with
 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.800
because there's a problem with
recruitment and retention for example in

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810
recruitment and retention for example in
 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.330
recruitment and retention for example in
2012 they had 117 stewards that were

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
2012 they had 117 stewards that were
 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.910
2012 they had 117 stewards that were
volunteering with the program and nav

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920
volunteering with the program and nav
 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.760
volunteering with the program and nav
has a recommended 12 hours of volunteer

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770
has a recommended 12 hours of volunteer
 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.380
has a recommended 12 hours of volunteer
for volunteers hours per person but

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390
for volunteers hours per person but
 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.800
for volunteers hours per person but
actually out of those 117 people only 14

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810
actually out of those 117 people only 14
 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.500
actually out of those 117 people only 14
people completed those 12 hours and only

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510
people completed those 12 hours and only
 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.380
people completed those 12 hours and only
40 people completed two hours which

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390
40 people completed two hours which
 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.479
40 people completed two hours which
means that everybody else did less than

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489
means that everybody else did less than
 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.400
means that everybody else did less than
two hours of volunteer

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410
two hours of volunteer
 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.980
two hours of volunteer
so there's a limited recruitment

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990
so there's a limited recruitment
 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.040
so there's a limited recruitment
strategy limited implementation

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050
strategy limited implementation
 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.790
strategy limited implementation
practices unlimited expansion goals and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800
practices unlimited expansion goals and
 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.090
practices unlimited expansion goals and
also they really highlighted a minimal

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100
also they really highlighted a minimal
 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.180
also they really highlighted a minimal
lack of minimal engagement from locals

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190
lack of minimal engagement from locals
 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.220
lack of minimal engagement from locals
around the parks and they really wanted

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230
around the parks and they really wanted
 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.100
around the parks and they really wanted
to have us focus on the people who live

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110
to have us focus on the people who live
 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.920
to have us focus on the people who live
in the areas where they're focusing on

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930
in the areas where they're focusing on
 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.110
in the areas where they're focusing on
for retention and they have minimal

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120
for retention and they have minimal
 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.330
for retention and they have minimal
retention of long-term dedicated

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340
retention of long-term dedicated
 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.670
retention of long-term dedicated
volunteers mainly because they have an

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680
volunteers mainly because they have an
 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.400
volunteers mainly because they have an
unfocused volunteer management system

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410
unfocused volunteer management system
 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.920
unfocused volunteer management system
and that probably stems from their lack

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930
and that probably stems from their lack
 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.450
and that probably stems from their lack
of communication structures both

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460
of communication structures both
 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.730
of communication structures both
internally and externally within the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740
internally and externally within the
 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.930
internally and externally within the
program so on our first meeting with our

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940
program so on our first meeting with our
 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.290
program so on our first meeting with our
client we were handed a survey that was

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300
client we were handed a survey that was
 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.870
client we were handed a survey that was
done in June of 2012 with a sample size

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880
done in June of 2012 with a sample size
 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.680
done in June of 2012 with a sample size
of 69 people and one of the things that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690
of 69 people and one of the things that
 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.410
of 69 people and one of the things that
was on there was the demographics of the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420
was on there was the demographics of the
 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.690
was on there was the demographics of the
current volunteers as you can see

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700
current volunteers as you can see
 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.310
current volunteers as you can see
students take up about thirty-five

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320
students take up about thirty-five
 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.550
students take up about thirty-five
percent of the demographics followed by

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560
percent of the demographics followed by
 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.460
percent of the demographics followed by
the other employment sectors and we

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470
the other employment sectors and we
 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.830
the other employment sectors and we
focused on these three just because we

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840
focused on these three just because we
 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.830
focused on these three just because we
saw potential with organizations as well

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840
saw potential with organizations as well
 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.310
saw potential with organizations as well
as students so students we saw an

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320
as students so students we saw an
 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.500
as students so students we saw an
opportunity to capitalize on just the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510
opportunity to capitalize on just the
 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.990
opportunity to capitalize on just the
willingness to be engaged in hands on

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000
willingness to be engaged in hands on
 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.640
willingness to be engaged in hands on
group project work for organizations nav

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650
group project work for organizations nav
 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.870
group project work for organizations nav
really wanted to focus on connecting

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880
really wanted to focus on connecting
 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.070
really wanted to focus on connecting
corporations with maybe one time work

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080
corporations with maybe one time work
 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.770
corporations with maybe one time work
days but also we wanted to incorporate

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780
days but also we wanted to incorporate
 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.460
days but also we wanted to incorporate
their vision to include more engagement

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470
their vision to include more engagement
 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.720
their vision to include more engagement
from locals surrounding the parks

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730
from locals surrounding the parks
 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.770
from locals surrounding the parks
another thing found in that original

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780
another thing found in that original
 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.990
another thing found in that original
survey was how people heard about the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000
survey was how people heard about the
 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.820
survey was how people heard about the
program and this is where we saw our

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830
program and this is where we saw our
 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.000
program and this is where we saw our
biggest problem because as you can see

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
biggest problem because as you can see
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.680
biggest problem because as you can see
email mailing list is the highest and

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690
email mailing list is the highest and
 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.240
email mailing list is the highest and
rightfully so because that's what their

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250
rightfully so because that's what their
 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.820
rightfully so because that's what their
strategy was beforehand in social media

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830
strategy was beforehand in social media
 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.640
strategy was beforehand in social media
is at the lowest end of the spectrum and

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650
is at the lowest end of the spectrum and
 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.800
is at the lowest end of the spectrum and
that's because it's not a focus or

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810
that's because it's not a focus or
 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.190
that's because it's not a focus or
priority right now we saw this is a

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200
priority right now we saw this is a
 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.830
priority right now we saw this is a
problem because social media has many

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840
problem because social media has many
 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.010
problem because social media has many
advantages so minimal costs the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020
advantages so minimal costs the
 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.260
advantages so minimal costs the
communication possibilities are endless

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270
communication possibilities are endless
 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.180
communication possibilities are endless
which would really help to address those

overview and deliverables so we broke it

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:23.650
overview and deliverables so we broke it
 

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.620
overview and deliverables so we broke it
up into the same categories that we

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:25.630
up into the same categories that we
 

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.080
up into the same categories that we
divided the problem into so recruitment

reason why we didn't create actual

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640
reason why we didn't create actual
 

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.550
reason why we didn't create actual
accounts was because we had meetings

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560
accounts was because we had meetings
 

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.070

the parks department and it was found
 

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.510
the parks department and it was found
that they didn't want to separate the

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:53.520
that they didn't want to separate the

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680
but there was some promise for the
 

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.090
but there was some promise for the
potential for this decision to be taken

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:01.100
potential for this decision to be taken
 

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.430
potential for this decision to be taken
away in the future so we created just

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440
away in the future so we created just
 

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.990

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:26.330
opportunities for these people for more
 

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.840
opportunities for these people for more
time instead of just focusing on the

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:28.850
time instead of just focusing on the
 

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.850
time instead of just focusing on the
people who aren't who don't want to be

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:30.860
people who aren't who don't want to be
 

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.170
people who aren't who don't want to be
involved who don't really want to give

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:32.180
involved who don't really want to give
 

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.370
involved who don't really want to give
that time another deliverable we

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:36.380
that time another deliverable we
 

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.020
that time another deliverable we
presented was just a list of

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:38.030
presented was just a list of
 

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.630
presented was just a list of
partnerships now these organizations are

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:40.640
partnerships now these organizations are
 

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.340
partnerships now these organizations are
just a few of the ones that we focused

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:42.350
just a few of the ones that we focused
 

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.820
just a few of the ones that we focused
on in our final deliverable section in

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:45.830
on in our final deliverable section in
 

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.790
on in our final deliverable section in
our final report we have the names the

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800
our final report we have the names the
 

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.890
our final report we have the names the
descriptions and contact information so

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:50.900
descriptions and contact information so
 

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.860
descriptions and contact information so
that they can link up with these

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:52.870
that they can link up with these
 

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.500
that they can link up with these
partnerships in the future but also we

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:56.510
partnerships in the future but also we
 

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.110
partnerships in the future but also we
just came up with a but through research

00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120
just came up with a but through research
 

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.350
just came up with a but through research
we came up with a bunch of NGOs and

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360
we came up with a bunch of NGOs and
 

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.790
we came up with a bunch of NGOs and
little organizations in and around the

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:05.800
little organizations in and around the
 

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.760
little organizations in and around the
specific parts of focus and so these are

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:09.770
specific parts of focus and so these are
 

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.710
specific parts of focus and so these are
also included in that contact

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720
also included in that contact
 

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.449
also included in that contact
information and that lives at the end so

00:17:16.449 --> 00:17:16.459
information and that lives at the end so
 

00:17:16.459 --> 00:17:19.030
information and that lives at the end so
that basically concludes our whole

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:19.040
that basically concludes our whole
 

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.980
that basically concludes our whole
deliverable section but we just wanted

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:20.990
deliverable section but we just wanted
 

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.319
deliverable section but we just wanted
to emphasize what this taught us about

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:23.329
to emphasize what this taught us about
 

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.000
to emphasize what this taught us about
sustainable development just going

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.010
sustainable development just going
 

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.730
sustainable development just going
through this process so number one the

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:27.740
through this process so number one the
 

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.560
through this process so number one the
connection between parks and sustainable

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:29.570
connection between parks and sustainable
 

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.260
connection between parks and sustainable
development parks creating awareness or

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:32.270
development parks creating awareness or
 

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.820
development parks creating awareness or
connection to our environment

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:33.830
connection to our environment
 

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.310
connection to our environment
and volunteerism is the first step

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320
and volunteerism is the first step
 

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.239
and volunteerism is the first step
towards developing sustainable practices

00:17:41.239 --> 00:17:41.249
towards developing sustainable practices
 

00:17:41.249 --> 00:17:42.799
towards developing sustainable practices
and habits if you're more connected with

00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:42.809
and habits if you're more connected with
 

00:17:42.809 --> 00:17:45.769
and habits if you're more connected with
the environment but also we ran into a

00:17:45.769 --> 00:17:45.779
the environment but also we ran into a
 

00:17:45.779 --> 00:17:47.690
the environment but also we ran into a
lot of roadblocks along the way we had

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700
lot of roadblocks along the way we had
 

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.849
lot of roadblocks along the way we had
the media and IT department shut us down

00:17:49.849 --> 00:17:49.859
the media and IT department shut us down
 

00:17:49.859 --> 00:17:52.669
the media and IT department shut us down
we had a lot of brainstorming ideas that

00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679
we had a lot of brainstorming ideas that
 

00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:54.109
we had a lot of brainstorming ideas that
we thought were really cool that maybe

00:17:54.109 --> 00:17:54.119
we thought were really cool that maybe
 

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:56.629
we thought were really cool that maybe
wouldn't work and practice for a number

00:17:56.629 --> 00:17:56.639
wouldn't work and practice for a number
 

00:17:56.639 --> 00:17:58.369
wouldn't work and practice for a number
of different reasons and what we had to

00:17:58.369 --> 00:17:58.379
of different reasons and what we had to
 

00:17:58.379 --> 00:18:00.139
of different reasons and what we had to
do is we had to come together afterwards

00:18:00.139 --> 00:18:00.149
do is we had to come together afterwards
 

00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:02.659
do is we had to come together afterwards
work around those roadblocks and

00:18:02.659 --> 00:18:02.669
work around those roadblocks and
 

00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:04.190
work around those roadblocks and
actually come to a solution that would

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200
actually come to a solution that would
 

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.779
actually come to a solution that would
work for everybody so we thought that

00:18:05.779 --> 00:18:05.789
work for everybody so we thought that
 

00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:07.519
work for everybody so we thought that
this was really relevant to our studies

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:07.529
this was really relevant to our studies
 

00:18:07.529 --> 00:18:12.169
this was really relevant to our studies
in sustainable development so um

00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:12.179
in sustainable development so um
 

00:18:12.179 --> 00:18:14.509
in sustainable development so um
assuming that a next team is selected

00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:14.519
assuming that a next team is selected
 

00:18:14.519 --> 00:18:16.930
assuming that a next team is selected
for the same project next semester and

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:16.940
for the same project next semester and
 

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.450
for the same project next semester and
we see them organizing some sort of an

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.460
we see them organizing some sort of an
 

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.639
we see them organizing some sort of an
organizational work day with Columbia

00:18:22.639 --> 00:18:22.649
organizational work day with Columbia
 

00:18:22.649 --> 00:18:25.820
organizational work day with Columbia
students so their clubs here that are

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:25.830
students so their clubs here that are
 

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.979
students so their clubs here that are
already focused on volunteering and

00:18:27.979 --> 00:18:27.989
already focused on volunteering and
 

00:18:27.989 --> 00:18:29.299
already focused on volunteering and
connecting with the community and we

00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:29.309
connecting with the community and we
 

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:31.579
connecting with the community and we
think that we can dig into those people

00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:31.589
think that we can dig into those people
 

00:18:31.589 --> 00:18:34.430
think that we can dig into those people
but also just to invest more time in

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440
but also just to invest more time in
 

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.249
but also just to invest more time in
working with the New York City IT

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:37.259
working with the New York City IT
 

00:18:37.259 --> 00:18:40.249

department within the parks we really

00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:40.259
department within the parks we really
 

00:18:40.259 --> 00:18:43.190
department within the parks we really

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200
feel and still do feel that immediate a
 

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.930
feel and still do feel that immediate a
social media presence separate from

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:44.940
social media presence separate from
 

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.669
social media presence separate from
parks would be so beneficial to this

00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679
parks would be so beneficial to this
 

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:49.329
parks would be so beneficial to this
program and we actually provided some

00:18:49.329 --> 00:18:49.339
program and we actually provided some
 

00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:52.249
program and we actually provided some
materials in our final report for how to

00:18:52.249 --> 00:18:52.259
materials in our final report for how to
 

00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:54.229
materials in our final report for how to
fight against this internal bureaucracy

00:18:54.229 --> 00:18:54.239
fight against this internal bureaucracy
 

00:18:54.239 --> 00:18:56.509
fight against this internal bureaucracy
that prevents them from doing so but

00:18:56.509 --> 00:18:56.519
that prevents them from doing so but
 

00:18:56.519 --> 00:19:00.169
that prevents them from doing so but
also just like as a final recommendation

00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:00.179
also just like as a final recommendation
 

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:02.479
also just like as a final recommendation
just maybe to focus a little bit more on

00:19:02.479 --> 00:19:02.489
just maybe to focus a little bit more on
 

00:19:02.489 --> 00:19:04.399
just maybe to focus a little bit more on
face-to-face recruiting just because

00:19:04.399 --> 00:19:04.409
face-to-face recruiting just because
 

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:07.759
face-to-face recruiting just because
this is such a personable um volunteer

00:19:07.759 --> 00:19:07.769
this is such a personable um volunteer
 

00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:10.669
this is such a personable um volunteer
activity that maybe instead of social

00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679
activity that maybe instead of social
 

00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:13.099
activity that maybe instead of social
media might not be the only option and

00:19:13.099 --> 00:19:13.109
media might not be the only option and
 

00:19:13.109 --> 00:19:14.599
media might not be the only option and
it might not be the end-all be-all but

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:14.609
it might not be the end-all be-all but
 

00:19:14.609 --> 00:19:17.299
it might not be the end-all be-all but
if you combine this with like actual

00:19:17.299 --> 00:19:17.309
if you combine this with like actual
 

00:19:17.309 --> 00:19:18.289
if you combine this with like actual
relationships and face-to-face

00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299

really far are there any question what
 

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.700
really far are there any question what
was the goal for recruitment

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:27.710
was the goal for recruitment
 

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.950
was the goal for recruitment
when you began the project you talked

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:29.960
when you began the project you talked
 

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.440
when you began the project you talked
about how many volunteers they had but I

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:32.450
about how many volunteers they had but I
 

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.750
about how many volunteers they had but I

numbers you know they kind of were not
 

00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:46.169
numbers you know they kind of were not
actively recruiting either they had a

website with their contact information
 

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:57.690
website with their contact information
but no outreach at all aside from that

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:57.700
 

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.940
other questions did you think about or

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:00.950
other questions did you think about or
 

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.159
other questions did you think about or
including your report what a social

00:20:03.159 --> 00:20:03.169
including your report what a social

social media is kind of its they could
 

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.659
social media is kind of its they could
do it I guess on their own terms as in

00:20:18.659 --> 00:20:18.669
do it I guess on their own terms as in
 

00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:21.130
do it I guess on their own terms as in
the comp navigator for the Stewart to

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:21.140
the comp navigator for the Stewart to
 

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.840
the comp navigator for the Stewart to
kind of they themselves could create

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:22.850
kind of they themselves could create
 

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.870
kind of they themselves could create
their own Facebook events or

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:25.880
their own Facebook events or
 

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.120
their own Facebook events or
conversations but that's kind of up to

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.130
conversations but that's kind of up to
 

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.659
conversations but that's kind of up to
up to that as stewards so I guess it'd

00:20:31.659 --> 00:20:31.669
up to that as stewards so I guess it'd
 

00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:34.690
up to that as stewards so I guess it'd
be a suggestion that we need to give

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:34.700
be a suggestion that we need to give
 

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.169

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.500
so I think it's even difficult for them
to have that conversation so we kind of

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:44.510
to have that conversation so we kind of
 

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.110
to have that conversation so we kind of
try to give them models or suggestions

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120
