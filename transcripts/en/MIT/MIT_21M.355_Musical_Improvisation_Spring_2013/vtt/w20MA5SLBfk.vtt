00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.840
INSTRUCTOR: So
welcome to the lab.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.950
I'm going to start off
today-- mostly everything

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.056
we'll do is be hands on.

00:00:27.056 --> 00:00:28.430
I'm going to start
out today just

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.750
to reiterate some of the
things that we talked about

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.370
last Monday, and to expand
on a few of those ideas

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.430
about what we're doing here.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.510
And the idea of this
little introductory lecture

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.420
is just to say,
what's our purpose?

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.790
What's the expectations?

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.580
What are we doing here?

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.340
Pretty much every place you go
there's a set of expectations

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.380
of what you're
expected to do and what

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.349
you're expected
to be done to you.

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:02.390
And it's very different
depending on what you do.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.810
If you go to a
baseball game, it's

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.120
a totally different
set of expectations

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.020
of both what you're
allowed and prepared to do

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.690
and what you're expecting to see
then if you went to a concert

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.447
or if you went to
a physics class.

00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:18.280
All different stuff.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.430
All different sets
of expectations.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.580
All different ideas about
what we're doing here.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.320
So this little
thing is to give you

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.719
an idea of what this is about.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:29.635
What we're doing here.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.609
The first thing-- which to me
is the most important thing

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:36.900
we already touched on in the
last class-- which is just

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.076
the idea that we're
all improvisers.

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:41.960
That simply by virtue
of being a human,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.410
you're already a
master improviser.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.680
Where I go from there is that
humans are also oral creatures.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.240
We understand the world
through sound a lot.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.170
Not only through
talking, not only

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.070
through our experience of
the sounds of other humans,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.760
but also the sounds
in the world inform us

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.820
all the time in all
different kinds of ways.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.960
And also each of us grows up
surrounded by music and sound.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.400
We all have a personal
universe of sound that is ours.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.080
In this class and in this
lab, what we'll be doing

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.260
a lot is dealing with how to
marry our awareness that we

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.500
have from growing up
as improvising people

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.010
to our awareness of our
understanding of sound.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.445
Our personal universe of sound.

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:34.820
Putting those two
things together

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.750
and figuring out how to express
ourselves improvisationally

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.670
through using sound.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.890
Both individually
and as a group.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.950
So that's our basic
task ahead of us.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.680
In this particular
class, we're doing that

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.780
by examining different
ways that people improvise.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.910
Different methods that people
use to structure improvisation.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.520
Different ways that they use to
conceptualize how to improvise.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.400
Because as improvisers,
you come up here

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.930
and when you're improvising
without any music

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.400
or without any prior structure,
anything is possible.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.590
That's an overwhelming
responsibility.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.980
You could do literally anything.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.715
How do you decide what to do?

00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:21.090
So that's the
first part of being

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.170
an improviser is
how do you start?

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.960
How do you start?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.260
And a lot of this class
is about how people start.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.810
Today I think Mark was talking
about graphic notation,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.310
I think in some kinds of ways.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.600
To conceptualize improvising
starting with something

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.130
that's visual.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.660
A way to start.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.550
And from this, then that
gives you a starting off point

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.170
where you can use
your understanding,

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.860
your intuition
about improvising.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.170
Your understanding, your
knowledge about sound.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.960
How it works, what it means.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.370
You can use all that
stuff to say OK, that's

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.120
my starting point.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.030
How do I use that stuff
starting from here?

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.500
So a lot of this
class is about that.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.260
How do you start?

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.218
Where do you come from?

00:04:14.974 --> 00:04:17.224
The other thing that's great
about this kind of class,

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:20.100
this kind of improvisation,
this kind of group

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.800
is that there's no particular
stylistic boundaries

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.020
to what we're doing.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.350
In a lot of different musical
situations you go into,

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.040
there's a set of boundaries just
like if you go to the ballpark.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.640
There's a set of boundaries
of what's going to happen.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.527
You go to a jazz concert or
you play in a jazz big band.

00:04:39.527 --> 00:04:41.860
There's a set of boundaries
of what you expect to happen

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.400
and you can-- pretty
much everything

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.066
you do is going to
be within that pretty

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:47.630
well established
set of boundaries.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.990
In this situation, we
don't have any of those.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.890
The boundaries that
we have-- there's

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.570
some set up by the structure
of the class, which

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.960
is bringing in these different
artists who specialize

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.740
in different ways of
conceptualizing improvisation,

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.050
but outside of
that-- and looking

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.140
at those specific
artists and ideas

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.230
that Mark's looking at in the
class-- outside of that there's

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.192
no particular boundaries
to how we improvise

00:05:14.192 --> 00:05:17.250
or what we do together
when we improvise.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.490
The only boundaries are ones
that we set up in the moment,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.240
and the way we set this
up is through a series

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.720
of structured improvisations.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.930
So most of the work
we're doing here

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.100
is examining improvisation
or examining music

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.900
through the use of structured
improvisational exercises.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.820
There are ways to say what
happens if you do this.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.130
Just like when you're talking
today about graphic notation.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.480
What happens if you do
this and you say play it?

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.080
So we'll work a lot
with structured--

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.210
and there are ways
to look at something

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.800
on a microscopic level.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.340
To go and look at
something closely.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.270
A particular aspect of
improvisation or of music.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.260
And then once you
examine it, bring it

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.690
into your conscious awareness,
then all that understanding

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.850
that you have is then
available for you

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.530
to use in a bigger context
where you're improvising.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.270
Whether you're improvising
on a squiggle or on a mode

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.910
or on giant steps.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.170
So what we'll do is we'll
take these specific exercises,

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.310
hone in really closely
on little-- small ideas,

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.160
and then we'll use those in
a freer context hopefully

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.376
later on to improvise
together as a group.

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:34.500
So that's the second thing.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.791
There's no particular boundary.

00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:40.690
So you're able to use your
entire personal universe

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.370
of sound to improvise with.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.920
And what that means is there's
no right and there's no wrong.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.190
So remember when we
were talking about how--

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.820
making this a safe
place to improvise.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.880
Making this a safe place
to show who you are

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.460
and to be who you
are in the moment.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.190
One of the reasons why it's safe
is because there's no judgment.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.530
Because there's no
boundaries set up

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.340
by a particular style of music.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.060
There's no judgment about
what's a right or a wrong sound.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.870
There's no judgment about
what sounds can go together.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.802
Any sound can go
with any other sound.

00:07:14.802 --> 00:07:16.260
So what we're
concerned with is not

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.996
judging which sounds
are right or wrong

00:07:17.996 --> 00:07:19.120
when you put them together.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.800
We're concerned with
what does it mean?

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.800
What does it feel like?

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.040
Did putting those
sounds together express

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.480
what you wanted it to express?

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.270
Did it mean what you
wanted it to mean?

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.750
Did it have the effect
on the people that

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.000
were observing you do it
that you wanted it to have?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.760
So it's really all
sonic experimentation

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.370
that we're doing together.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.770
Using these elements of
improvisation and of music

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.970
and of sound that we've grown
up with our entire lives

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.110
to say OK, if we do this
and this, what does it do?

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.960
What does it mean?

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.120
How does it work?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.320
Do I like it or
do I not like it?

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.120
Does he like it ?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.601
Does he not like it?

00:07:57.601 --> 00:07:58.100
It's awful.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.430
The other thing that Mark also
mentioned in the first class--

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.290
but I think is
worth reiterating--

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.780
is that this is really
about having fun.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.310
Improvisation should be fun.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:19.180
It should be fun in every
way that you can have fun.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.880
So it should be crazy fun,
it should be silly fun,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.580
it should be totally,
serious intense fun.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.420
The kind of fun where you're
so engrossed in something

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.640
that you lose all track of time.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.340
The kind of fun where
you're looking at formulas

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.679
and figuring out how they work.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.179
All the kinds of
fun you could think

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.854
of that you can have
up here improvising,

00:08:38.854 --> 00:08:40.770
and that's what it should
ultimately be about.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.360
I think that's about
all the things.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.010
We'll do some more, but
that's basically-- just

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.190
to give you an idea of
where we're at here.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.110
And I mentioned before that the
other really important thing--

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.380
but I'll reiterate that
too-- is that it's important

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.940
that you tell the truth.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.620
That really what
makes the difference

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.680
between an improvisation
that is compelling,

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.380
that grips your audience, and
one that people sort of fall

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.840
asleep or run away from is
are you telling the truth?

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.460
Are you expressing yourself?

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.135
Are you showing yourself?

00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:24.665
If you could do that.

00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:27.870
If you start from there, then
every note, every phrase,

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.580
every sound you play is
going to have meaning.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.550
And over the course
of this class,

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.390
we'll figure out different
ways to approach it.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.909
Different kinds of
meaning that you can have.

00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:42.450
And you'll get a
chance to experiment

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.200
with different
ideas of your own.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.660
To see what your personal
universe of sound

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.270
contributes to this group.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.650
Into what we do as improvisers.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.100
So today I was think
and we'd start off--

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.500
since we're dealing
with graphic notation

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.030
and I think we're going
into some stuff with film

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.717
improvising the
film later-- we're

00:10:07.717 --> 00:10:09.800
going to skip over a lot
of things I would usually

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:15.120
do in the beginning group and
go into some more stuff that's

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.310
related to more visual
parameters and movement.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.970
Different things that
you might be encountering

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.430
in the course of your next
few classes and your next few

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.800
assignments.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.350
So what I'd like to do is
start off with an exercise.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.460
We'll all come up
without instruments.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.560
A lot of times I'll start
off with some theater

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.670
exercises or
exercises that don't

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.070
involve instruments
as a warm up.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.750
So we are filming today,
so usually I'd do a circle,

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.530
but I think for the
sake of the camera,

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.160
we'll do sort of
like a semicircle

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.290
if you can just get in a
big arc here so you can all

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.540
see each other but
still leave an opening

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.100
so we're not staring in
the back of anybody's head.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.460
This exercise is a
very simple exercise.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.440
It's about movement and sound,
and the way it works is this.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:23.490
One person comes out here
to the center, or actually,

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.800
thinking of the
camera placement.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.650
The center might
not work so good.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.899
Might have just a step
forward from where you are,

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:34.440
and what you're
going to do is you're

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.430
going to make a
gesture and a sound.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.330
It can be anything.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.810
It can be any kind of
gesture, any kind of sound,

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.570
and you're going to repeat it.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.770
And then everybody else is
going to repeat it with you.

00:11:48.485 --> 00:11:49.360
Does that make sense?

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.610
And then after we
do it for a while,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.140
everybody gets into the groove,
it's how we got it going on,

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.490
then you're going to go
and take someone's place

00:11:55.490 --> 00:12:00.310
and they're going to
step out and do theirs.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.810
And so on until everybody
gets a chance to do it.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:03.490
Yeah?

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.440
All right.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.230
So, I'll start.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.120
Let's see.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.910
We might need to
get a little space

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.820
in between each other just in
case there's movement involved.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.380

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.170
Now the interesting thing
about this to me, and it's

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.470
really fascinating
and fun every time

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:37.980
is that we do associate
movement and sound.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.450
There was no accident that
you chose this movement

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.720
to go with that sound or that
sound to go with this movement.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.850
There's connections
we have in our brains

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.240
about what kind of
movement sound like what.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.060
And what kind of sounds would
be what kind of movement.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.920
So we're going on
sped up time here,

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.680
so what I'd like to do
is get some instruments

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.770
and what I want to do
is have some people

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:09.000
move and some people play.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.927
Let's go in half.

00:17:10.927 --> 00:17:12.760
So we'll have-- so,
just for now-- let's see

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.433
one, two, three, four, five six.

00:17:15.433 --> 00:17:19.660
We'll have you all play and
you all are going to move.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.410
I include you when I say play.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.990
It's all play.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.640
All instrumenting is playing.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.220
So here's the thing.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:40.580
Here's what I want to do
is-- oh, yeah, let's do that.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.090
Yeah.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.423
Let's just switch with somebody.

00:17:44.844 --> 00:17:47.260
Why don't we switch you since
you don't have an instrument

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.840
to pick up what those guys
are already picking up.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.960
So, let's do this.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.470

done it quite this way before,

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.650

I want you to do

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:10.350

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.700

you can turn around,

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.760
you can stand still.

go with how they're moving.

dramatic movement initially,

Which is-- the other
interesting thing

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.140
is that you were
moving in such a--

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:37.150
you were moving initially in
a very rhythmic way, which

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:41.460
allowed him to set up that
rhythmic correspondence.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.020

in the group

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.385
sort of revolved around that.

00:20:44.385 --> 00:20:46.760
You remember we were talking
in the first class about how

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.940
when you set up a pulse,
when you set up a rhythm.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.710
It just attracts things to it.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:57.370
Yeah, it just does because
we're-- that's how we survive.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:57.870

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:01.390

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.150
Right?

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.910
It's the rhythmic
beating of our heart.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.630
It's the rhythmic bleeding
in and out of our bodies.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.660
It's all these rhythmic
movements inside of us

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.710
that enable us to keep living.

process as humans.

Sleep and wake, you know?

00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:19.310
I mean we're surrounded
by our rhythmic universe.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.830
So, we're attracted to it.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.690
And we see that.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:26.020
We understand the sense of that.

Faster than other
kinds of things.

So it's just something to be
aware of as an improviser.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.599
When you set up a pulse
or when you set up

00:21:33.599 --> 00:21:36.030
a rhythm that repeats, it's
going to attract attention

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.530
and it's going to--
people are going

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:41.040
to go to it until you
repeat it for too long

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.867
and then they're not
going to hear it anymore.

00:21:43.867 --> 00:21:45.950
Like the air conditioner
that goes on in the room.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.366
You hear it's
really loud at first

00:21:47.366 --> 00:21:49.104
and then you don't hear it.

00:21:49.104 --> 00:21:50.270
So rhythm is like that, too.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.890
If you repeat the same rhythm
over and over and over again,

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.250
after a certain amount,
people stop hearing it.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.690
So that's another challenge
when we're dealing with groove

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.680
and rhythm is how to keep
it alive and fresh even

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.490
though it's repetitious.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.271
Let's switch roles.

00:22:04.271 --> 00:22:06.020
I'm going to say a lot
of different things

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.020
and basically I say
what comes into my head

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.235
based on what happens, you know?

00:22:11.235 --> 00:22:13.360
Things that I see that I
think might be interesting

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:19.740
or might give you some kind
of little insight, little idea

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.799
about how improvisation works.

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:23.590
I don't expect you to
particularly remember

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:28.600
it all or even
think about it much,

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.030
but I do expect that--
a lot of this process

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.320
is about bringing
things to your awareness

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.910
because we all mostly
understand and have dealt

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.400
with improvisation in
our lives as a completely

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.386
unconscious process.

00:22:43.386 --> 00:22:45.810
It's something we
use continually

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.850
all the time throughout
our entire lives,

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.070
and probably-- unless you're a
jazz player-- no one has ever

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:58.010
even mentioned it or talk to
you at all about how it works.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.640
Which is, to me, shocking.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.260
So we hope to rectify
that a little bit in this

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.340
because basically
every innovation

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.300
springs out of a moment
of improvisation.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.290
So the more aware
you can be, the more

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:19.590
things about improvisation--
tools of improvisation

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.300
that you are aware of and can
bring into your consciousness

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.250
and work with
consciously, the more able

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.430
you're going to
be to be creative.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:31.750
To be innovative no matter
what it is that you're doing.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.890
All right, so we split up?

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.930
We got our two groups?

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.450
And go!

00:23:40.432 --> 00:23:43.911
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.054
INSTRUCTOR: Good.

00:24:56.054 --> 00:24:59.135
Good, good, good.

00:24:59.135 --> 00:25:02.500
That was a nice ending place.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:07.252
One of the things I think we'll
have to work on fairly soon--

00:25:07.252 --> 00:25:09.460
I don't think today, but
maybe next time-- is ending.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.960
We'll do a little session
on beginnings and endings.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.310
But for right now
I'll just stop you.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:24.410
Or you can stop for yourself
if you feel like it's done.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:24.910
Right.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:25.993
So now, let's switch this.

00:25:25.993 --> 00:25:29.520
So now what I want
to happen is I

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.270
want the people that are
moving to pick a person that's

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.285
playing, and move
how they're playing.

00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:38.160
Now you guys are just
going to start playing.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.365
Improvising together.

00:25:39.365 --> 00:25:40.990
And at this point,
don't worry too much

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.110
about what you're doing.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.940
Just have some fun.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.820
Just like we were when
you came out and did

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.960
a sound and a motion.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.060
And then you all
who are moving are

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.790
going to pick one of the
people that are making sounds

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.590
and you're going to
move to their sounds.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.090
What's that?

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.800
AUDIENCE: Should we try and
play something together?

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.216
INSTRUCTOR: I don't think you
should try too much anything

00:26:03.216 --> 00:26:04.396
right now.

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:06.020
A lot of times when
you're improvising,

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.981
if you try too much it makes
it really hard to improvise.

00:26:10.981 --> 00:26:12.480
And one of the great
things actually

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.740
about doing structured
improvisations,

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.170
which is the secret goal of
a structured improvisation,

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:23.260
is to give your mind-- your
conscious mind, your monkey

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.650
mind, something to latch
onto-- so that you can actually

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.550
improvise freely.

00:26:31.016 --> 00:26:32.890
So yeah, I don't think
too much about it yet.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.264
We'll give you more things to
think about as we go along.

00:26:35.264 --> 00:26:37.630
For now, I think it's
just important to have

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.070
some fun making sounds.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.741
I mean, the interesting thing--
if you were paying attention

00:26:41.741 --> 00:26:43.990
on these last two exercises--
the interesting thing is

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.870
the music was actually
very interesting.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:49.130
You guys actually
did play together

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.850
even though that
wasn't our objective,

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.374
and you certainly didn't
have any thing to say,

00:26:54.374 --> 00:26:55.790
oh, you're going
to move together,

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.740
you're going to play together.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.340
The fact is that
people-- you get

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.650
a group of people in any
situation doing something

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.280
together, and they're
going to-- doing stuff.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.600
They're going to start
to do it together.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.330
Just how we work.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.170
As you get better
as an improviser

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.530
and more conscious and more
aware of the possibilities

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:21.890
that are around and what
your personal preferences

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:25.710
and possibilities
are, then you'll

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.920
be able to be more conscious
about being together.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.526
You'll have more choices.

00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:32.900
But right now I
think we can just

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.170
rely on our natural instinct
to make things sound good

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.127
and be together.

00:27:38.127 --> 00:27:38.960
And not think about.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.620
OK, ready?

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.720
OK, here, let's just
do this for a second.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.178
Because this is
going to be harder.

00:27:48.178 --> 00:27:51.080
Because-- well, it might not be.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.270
See, like I'm already
putting expectations on you.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.000
It might-- it's just going
to be totally easy, actually.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.190
Let's just-- ready?

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.930
Let's go.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.142
Go!.

00:27:59.142 --> 00:28:02.180
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:36.284 --> 00:28:38.160
INSTRUCTOR: We're
going stop here.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:38.660
Stop.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.546
Let's try this again.

00:28:39.546 --> 00:28:40.670
I'm going to add one thing.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:44.450
One is I want you guys to
feel free to come into here.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.420
So you have all this space.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:51.117
It's a little
intimidating, but you

00:28:51.117 --> 00:28:52.450
have all this space to do stuff.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.030
So let's use this space.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.740
You guys, I want you to also be
aware of the rest of the group.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.910
We'll say that now, because--
but be aware of them

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.160
in the same way that you
were aware of the people that

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.140
were moving.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.020
You know, like when
the people were moving

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.556
and you guys were playing.

00:29:10.556 --> 00:29:12.430
You were aware of what
everybody was playing,

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.350
but you weren't that
worried about it.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.920
You were just playing stuff that
felt good and related to what's

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.700
going on.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.696
Let's do the same thing.

00:29:21.696 --> 00:29:22.570
All right, you ready?

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:23.653
Let's do it one more time.

00:29:23.653 --> 00:29:25.660
Same groups.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.040
So here-- everybody come out.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.500
Let's all spread out in here
just so you're in a space

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.130
already.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:31.980
You don't have to
inhabit the space.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.690
You could just be in the space.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.660
And now I want you
guys-- before we

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.820
start-- to pick one of
the people to move to.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.760
So then you'll know--
you know already

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.790
when you're going to
move and when you're not.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:50.230
You guys that are playing?

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.240
Don't feel like you all
have to start at once.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.880
Wait, let's add this.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.470
This is fun.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.990
Let's wait until
you actually feel

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:03.630
an impulse to make a sound,
and then make a sound.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.700
OK?

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.260
So that's our structure.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.897
Wait until you have an
impulse to make a sound.

00:30:09.897 --> 00:30:10.730
Then make the sound.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.800
As soon as you don't have
that impose anymore, stop.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.280
You guys pick ahead of
time before they even

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.750
start playing who
you're moving to.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.500
And let's go!

Let's stop again.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.300
I gave you a bad start for this.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.200
Hold on, let's stop.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:46.949
Let's start again.

00:30:46.949 --> 00:30:49.640
I gave you a bad start for this
because the kind of exercise

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.760
we just proposed is
better if you guys have

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.400
a little sounds
just ahead of it.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.400
So you can actually--
you guys can

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.710
make a choice about
when to come in.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.630
So let's start that again.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.389
That was my fault
as director here.

00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:05.430
All right, so same thing.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:06.765

00:31:06.765 --> 00:31:08.375
Get in the space.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.090
All right.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:17.065
So you guys right now
pick who you're following.

00:31:20.897 --> 00:31:21.730
Is everybody picked?

00:31:25.498 --> 00:31:27.760
All right, and you
guys take a second.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.060
Just pay attention to yourself.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:35.730
Wait to feel like you want to
play something, and then play.

and this is pretty much true

the movement.

00:48:13.281 --> 00:48:13.780
Yeah.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:17.590
Who was playing what?

00:48:21.127 --> 00:48:22.002
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:27.892
INSTRUCTOR: Anybody else?

00:48:27.892 --> 00:48:29.850
AUDIENCE: I feel like it
was kind of estranged.

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:33.000
I feel like if you want to have
everyone be on the same page,

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.330
then like-- this is at
least going through my head.

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.070
How are we going to time this?

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:40.880
And then is there a standard
way to read from left to right?

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.585
Approximately from
the time we finished

00:48:42.585 --> 00:48:44.710
playing those first two
lines, whatever that means,

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:47.260
we kind of start the squiggly
thing, whatever that means.

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.362
Just because I assumed
that everyone else assumed

00:48:49.362 --> 00:48:50.570
that assumed that, et cetera.

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:51.776
INSTRUCTOR: Right.

00:48:51.776 --> 00:48:53.030
Yeah.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:57.430
Well let's say-- let's
make that more explicit.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:58.650
Because you're right.

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:00.800
People-- we are used to
as a culture moving from

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.910
left to right, but in
all kinds of reading.

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:08.770
And in music temporally you
move from left to right.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:10.380
It indicates time.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:17.790
In art, I'm not sure if that's
necessarily true since it's

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:20.590
more-- but definitely
in music you

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:24.230
tend to think that this is
the beginning, that's the end,

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.370
and we sort of been
playing that way all along.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:29.090
So let's say specifically
this is the beginning.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:31.490
Actually, let's do repeats.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:32.390
We'll do it twice.

00:49:36.617 --> 00:49:38.450
All right, so we are
going to play it twice.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:39.325
That's the beginning.

00:49:39.325 --> 00:49:41.640
That's the end.

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:45.740
So if you choose to do the
squigglies-- technical term,

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.030
the squigglies.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:48.660
Remember that.

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.290
If you choose to do that, then
you're starting like a little

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:52.455
after the third note.

00:49:52.455 --> 00:49:53.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:59.370
INSTRUCTOR: No.

00:49:59.370 --> 00:49:59.870
No.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:02.410
It might be more
fun if you didn't.

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:03.090
OK, you ready?

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:04.423
You can start whenever you want.

00:50:04.423 --> 00:50:08.330
I'm going to stop starting you.

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:11.816
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.000
INSTRUCTOR: Awesome.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.120
That was great.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.800
All right, let's
add a third part.

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.751
Anybody?

00:51:19.751 --> 00:51:21.140
Any volunteers?

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:22.210
Want to add a third part?

00:51:30.404 --> 00:51:34.929
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:34.929 --> 00:51:35.595
INSTRUCTOR: Ooh.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.430
OK, you ready?

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:47.030
Let's take the repeats
off this time, though.

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.400
Because I want to do a
couple more and we're

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.245
running out of time.

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:53.970
OK, you ready?

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.718
Whenever.

00:51:59.718 --> 00:52:03.204
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:34.717
INSTRUCTOR: That was cool.

00:52:34.717 --> 00:52:36.050
All right, let's do another one.

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:37.260
We got time to do one more.

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:43.120
This is when I feel
really teachery where

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.120
I have to do blackboard.

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.260
All right.

00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:58.895
First part-- let's
do three parts.

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:06.720
So key here is
make them specific.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.120
Make them simple at this point.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.174
Makes it easier.

00:53:10.174 --> 00:53:14.000
Haha, did I blow your
thing [? there? ?]

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.500
No, no.

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:14.999
Go ahead.

00:53:14.999 --> 00:53:15.712
Go ahead.

00:53:15.712 --> 00:53:16.670
Do what you want to do.

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:18.532
We'll see.

00:53:18.532 --> 00:53:19.490
Oh yeah, that's simple.

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.526
Or not.

00:53:28.526 --> 00:53:29.026
Oh.

00:53:34.224 --> 00:53:35.390
It's like that ribbon candy.

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:40.074
Cool.

00:53:40.074 --> 00:53:41.490
All right, what's
the second part?

00:54:15.921 --> 00:54:17.418
INSTRUCTOR: Haha.

00:54:17.418 --> 00:54:17.970
Good.

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:21.250
Let's do this one-- let's
split into-- let's do it

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:23.080
in two different groups.

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.849
Just to make it-- because
there's a lot of sound there.

00:54:27.849 --> 00:54:29.140
So we'll just split it in half.

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:31.210
One, two, three, four, five.

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:32.930
You guys can split
up if you want to.

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:36.240
Would you rather do
that or play together?

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.680
All right.

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:41.028
Yeah, so you'll be one,
one, one, one, one.

00:54:41.028 --> 00:54:42.417
AUDIENCE: Can I have one?

00:54:42.417 --> 00:54:43.921
INSTRUCTOR: Yeah, sure.

00:54:43.921 --> 00:54:44.754
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:54:44.754 --> 00:54:45.690
INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:50.409
All right, so you guys
go first and then--

00:54:50.409 --> 00:54:51.700
let's see what they sound like.

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:01.490
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:55:35.347 --> 00:55:36.055
INSTRUCTOR: Good.

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:41.030
Now second group, same piece.

00:55:44.166 --> 00:55:46.904
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.510
INSTRUCTOR: Cool.

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:21.415
I think that's a
good place to stop.

00:56:21.415 --> 00:56:22.290
All right, thank you.

00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:24.280
So for this week
as you're just--

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.622
as you're walking
around, pay attention.

00:56:26.622 --> 00:56:28.205
Pay attention to the
sound of movement

00:56:28.205 --> 00:56:33.480
and how they go together in your
mind and outside of your mind.
