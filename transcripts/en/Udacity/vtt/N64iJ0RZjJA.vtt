00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.132
So far, we focused on helping users
fill out forms faster by, well,

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:07.430
not filling out anything.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.500
But now, I want you to think
about your users confidence,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.880
with good validation features.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.540
With validation,
you can ensure that users know

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.950
that they are filling forms
with the right information.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.260
More importantly,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.620
validation can ensure that the users
fill out form correctly the first time.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.350
They won't waste time leaving an input
and submitting a form only to find

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.750
out a few seconds later that they
forgot a digit in their zip code.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.140
With validation, you are giving
your users a real time feedback and

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.040
minimizing errors.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.440
I want to choose a new password,
and like in any good website,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.560
I have a few rules
that I need to enforce.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.340
Here, while i'm typing, you could
see that I'm using lowercase, and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.609
now I understand that I need an
uppercase, as well, I need few numbers,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.760
and I just passed the minimum
length of eight characters.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.100
I'm adding some punctuation, and
only then, I'm enabling the next button.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.652
It's worth adding that HTML file
validation or any front end validation,

00:01:15.652 --> 00:01:19.932
for that matter, is not a replacement
for a service side validation.

00:01:19.932 --> 00:01:22.611
Your websites are obviously not safe,

00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:25.458
unless you validate
on your back end too.

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:28.288
The approach Cam and
I are discussing is just

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:33.410
a way to improve the user experience,
and to put a big smile on the faces.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.012
In the next video, I'll show you how
to use HTML5 attributes for validation.
