00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.629
 
so in the in the Garden of Eden there's

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639
so in the in the Garden of Eden there's
 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.970
so in the in the Garden of Eden there's
Adam and Eve right the primordial human

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980
Adam and Eve right the primordial human
 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.970
Adam and Eve right the primordial human
beings and there's a walled garden

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980
beings and there's a walled garden
 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.430
beings and there's a walled garden
that's paradise paradise means walled

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
that's paradise paradise means walled
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.589
that's paradise paradise means walled
garden and Eden means well watered place

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599
garden and Eden means well watered place
 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.480
garden and Eden means well watered place
and so there's this idea that the proper

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
and so there's this idea that the proper
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.609
and so there's this idea that the proper
habitat of human beings is in the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619
habitat of human beings is in the
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680
habitat of human beings is in the
amalgam of social structure and now and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690
amalgam of social structure and now and
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.689
amalgam of social structure and now and
nature and that's exactly right because

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699
nature and that's exactly right because
 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.310
nature and that's exactly right because
that's what we live in right we live in

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320
that's what we live in right we live in
 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.759
that's what we live in right we live in
a we never live in nature and we never

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
a we never live in nature and we never
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.759
a we never live in nature and we never
live in society we live in an amalgam of

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769
live in society we live in an amalgam of
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.500
live in society we live in an amalgam of
society in nature that's the human

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
society in nature that's the human
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.900
society in nature that's the human
environment so it's a walled garden

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910
environment so it's a walled garden
 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.420
environment so it's a walled garden
alright and so it's a productive well

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430
alright and so it's a productive well
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.819
alright and so it's a productive well
watered place where we could thrive it's

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
watered place where we could thrive it's
 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.940
watered place where we could thrive it's
safe and it's ruled over by a farther

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950
safe and it's ruled over by a farther
 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.619
safe and it's ruled over by a farther
figure in this particular in this

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
figure in this particular in this
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.470
figure in this particular in this
particular story and that's like the you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
particular story and that's like the you
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.119
particular story and that's like the you
could think about that as the spirit of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
could think about that as the spirit of
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.130
could think about that as the spirit of
civilization that's at least one way of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140
civilization that's at least one way of
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.270
civilization that's at least one way of
considering it so well there's a snake

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
considering it so well there's a snake
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.560
considering it so well there's a snake
in the garden and it's there unbeknownst

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
in the garden and it's there unbeknownst
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.950
in the garden and it's there unbeknownst
to God roughly speaking although he

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
to God roughly speaking although he
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.660
to God roughly speaking although he
knows everything so I guess he probably

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670
knows everything so I guess he probably
 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.230
knows everything so I guess he probably
knows about the snake too and he tells

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240
knows about the snake too and he tells
 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.789
knows about the snake too and he tells
Adam and Eve not to interact with it

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
Adam and Eve not to interact with it
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.770
Adam and Eve not to interact with it
fine and they do and the snake wakes

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
fine and they do and the snake wakes
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.600
fine and they do and the snake wakes
them up right because when they interact

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
them up right because when they interact
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.039
them up right because when they interact
with the snake they're given a fruit

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
with the snake they're given a fruit
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.050
with the snake they're given a fruit
that opens their eyes and makes them

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
that opens their eyes and makes them
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.280
that opens their eyes and makes them
aware that they're naked and vulnerable

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
aware that they're naked and vulnerable
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.070
aware that they're naked and vulnerable
and then dooms them to work well I'll

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
and then dooms them to work well I'll
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.960
and then dooms them to work well I'll
tell you the whole story much later in

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970
tell you the whole story much later in
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520
tell you the whole story much later in
the course but I want to give you an

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
the course but I want to give you an
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.170
the course but I want to give you an
overview of it now but then there's this

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
overview of it now but then there's this
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.890
overview of it now but then there's this
really strange idea that developed over

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
really strange idea that developed over
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.660
really strange idea that developed over
the course of the development of not

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
the course of the development of not
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.179
the course of the development of not
only Christianity but Judaism and and a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189
only Christianity but Judaism and and a
 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.770
only Christianity but Judaism and and a
number of other religions that fed into

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
number of other religions that fed into
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050
number of other religions that fed into
the mainstream of Christian ideas

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
the mainstream of Christian ideas
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.660
the mainstream of Christian ideas
including Zoroastrianism there's an idea

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670
including Zoroastrianism there's an idea
 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.569
including Zoroastrianism there's an idea
that that emerged across a very long

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
that that emerged across a very long
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.310
that that emerged across a very long
period of time that the snake in the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
period of time that the snake in the
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.590
period of time that the snake in the
garden was the same as Satan that the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
garden was the same as Satan that the
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.840
garden was the same as Satan that the
source of all evil and I've been trying

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
source of all evil and I've been trying
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.280
source of all evil and I've been trying
to figure out for the longest period of

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
to figure out for the longest period of
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.580
to figure out for the longest period of
time why in the world the manifestation

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
time why in the world the manifestation
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.319
time why in the world the manifestation
of what's essentially a representation

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
of what's essentially a representation
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.240
of what's essentially a representation
of a predator so that's this snake and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
of a predator so that's this snake and
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.999
of a predator so that's this snake and
you know the snake is associated with

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
you know the snake is associated with
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.490
you know the snake is associated with
trees well yes the reason for that in

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
trees well yes the reason for that in
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.429
trees well yes the reason for that in
all likelihood is that we dwelt in trees

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439
all likelihood is that we dwelt in trees
 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.109
all likelihood is that we dwelt in trees
right and snakes like trees and they're

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
right and snakes like trees and they're
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.880
right and snakes like trees and they're
around trees and they can climb trees

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
around trees and they can climb trees
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.550
around trees and they can climb trees
and and the snake was a typical predator

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
and and the snake was a typical predator
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.490
and and the snake was a typical predator
on our our ancient relatives but and so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
on our our ancient relatives but and so
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.990
on our our ancient relatives but and so
that's fine so you can see that that

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000
that's fine so you can see that that
 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.610
that's fine so you can see that that
representation makes perfect sense

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
representation makes perfect sense
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.350
representation makes perfect sense
there's predators that lurk in the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360
there's predators that lurk in the
 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.750
there's predators that lurk in the
garden yes obviously if you interact

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
garden yes obviously if you interact
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.640
garden yes obviously if you interact
with them they wake you up well if they

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
with them they wake you up well if they
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.260
with them they wake you up well if they
better wake you up because if they don't

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270
better wake you up because if they don't
 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880
better wake you up because if they don't
wake you up when you interact with them

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890
wake you up when you interact with them
 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.160
wake you up when you interact with them
then you get eaten so it's probably just

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
then you get eaten so it's probably just
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.660
then you get eaten so it's probably just
as well to wake up even though there's

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
as well to wake up even though there's
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.790
as well to wake up even though there's
painful consequences associated with

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800
painful consequences associated with
 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.710
painful consequences associated with
becoming conscious and that manifests

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720
becoming conscious and that manifests
 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.020
becoming conscious and that manifests
itself immediately in the in the story

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030
itself immediately in the in the story
 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.920
itself immediately in the in the story
of Adam and Eve but then there's this

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930
of Adam and Eve but then there's this
 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.100
of Adam and Eve but then there's this
weird Association it's it's very

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110
weird Association it's it's very
 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.740
weird Association it's it's very
undeveloped in the biblical stories that

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750
undeveloped in the biblical stories that
 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.120
undeveloped in the biblical stories that
are part and parcel of this line of

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130
are part and parcel of this line of
 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.640
are part and parcel of this line of
thinking it was more like a consequence

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650
thinking it was more like a consequence
 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.740
thinking it was more like a consequence
of a cloud of mythological stories that

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
of a cloud of mythological stories that
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.810
of a cloud of mythological stories that
surrounded it but the reason for that I

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820
surrounded it but the reason for that I
 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.330
surrounded it but the reason for that I
think is this that imagine that what

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
think is this that imagine that what
 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.979
think is this that imagine that what
human beings were trying to puzzle out

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
human beings were trying to puzzle out
 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.070
human beings were trying to puzzle out
was the nature of the predator okay so

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080
was the nature of the predator okay so
 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.050
was the nature of the predator okay so
on one level of analysis the predator is

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
on one level of analysis the predator is
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.490
on one level of analysis the predator is
the thing that slinks along the ground

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500
the thing that slinks along the ground
 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530
the thing that slinks along the ground
and the threatened sea and also it's the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540
and the threatened sea and also it's the
 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.880
and the threatened sea and also it's the
thing that's your mortal enemy and that

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890
thing that's your mortal enemy and that
 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.690
thing that's your mortal enemy and that
wakes you up but then that's one

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700
wakes you up but then that's one
 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.860
wakes you up but then that's one
conceptualization of predator and fair

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870
conceptualization of predator and fair
 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.810
conceptualization of predator and fair
enough you can identify it and you can

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820
enough you can identify it and you can
 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.050
enough you can identify it and you can
take precautionary measures but a better

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060
take precautionary measures but a better
 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.120
take precautionary measures but a better
conceptualization of predator might be

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130
conceptualization of predator might be
 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.370
conceptualization of predator might be
where does it come from let's say it's a

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380
where does it come from let's say it's a
 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.530
where does it come from let's say it's a
snake well there's a layer of snake

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540
snake well there's a layer of snake
 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.509
snake well there's a layer of snake
somewhere and so if we want to get rid

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519
somewhere and so if we want to get rid
 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.289
somewhere and so if we want to get rid
of the snake

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299
of the snake
 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.509
of the snake
we shouldn't be conceptualizing it as a

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519
we shouldn't be conceptualizing it as a
 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.140
we shouldn't be conceptualizing it as a
snake we should be conceptualizing it as

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150
snake we should be conceptualizing it as
 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.720
snake we should be conceptualizing it as
one manifestation of a layer of snakes

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730
one manifestation of a layer of snakes
 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.520
one manifestation of a layer of snakes
and what we should do is go down follow

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530
and what we should do is go down follow
 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.320
and what we should do is go down follow
the damn snake wherever it goes and find

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330
the damn snake wherever it goes and find
 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.660
the damn snake wherever it goes and find
its lair and wipe out all of the snakes

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670
its lair and wipe out all of the snakes
 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.630
its lair and wipe out all of the snakes
and that's that's a more abstract

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640
and that's that's a more abstract
 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.560
and that's that's a more abstract
representation right it's not predator

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570
representation right it's not predator
 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.310
representation right it's not predator
anymore it's the source of predation and

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320
anymore it's the source of predation and
 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.509
anymore it's the source of predation and
so if you want to solve the predator

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519
so if you want to solve the predator
 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.930
so if you want to solve the predator
problem permanently you don't kill the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940
problem permanently you don't kill the
 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.900
problem permanently you don't kill the
snake you get rid of all the snakes okay

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910
snake you get rid of all the snakes okay
 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.150
snake you get rid of all the snakes okay
so fine so and people are pretty damn

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160
so fine so and people are pretty damn
 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.620
so fine so and people are pretty damn
good at that and that's why you have

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630
good at that and that's why you have
 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.810
good at that and that's why you have
stories of people like Saint Patrick who

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820
stories of people like Saint Patrick who
 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.400
stories of people like Saint Patrick who
chased all the snakes out of Ireland and

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410
chased all the snakes out of Ireland and
 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.210
chased all the snakes out of Ireland and
all sorts of saints were snake

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220
all sorts of saints were snake
 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.370
all sorts of saints were snake
eradication Saints and well there's a

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380
eradication Saints and well there's a
 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.479
eradication Saints and well there's a
variety of reasons for that

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489
variety of reasons for that
 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.550
variety of reasons for that
but then you might think okay well the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560
but then you might think okay well the
 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.009
but then you might think okay well the
worst predator is the lair of snakes

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019
worst predator is the lair of snakes
 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.750
worst predator is the lair of snakes
right but then you might think well wait

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760
right but then you might think well wait
 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.759
right but then you might think well wait
a minute the worst predator isn't the

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769
a minute the worst predator isn't the
 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.920
a minute the worst predator isn't the
lair of snakes maybe the worst predator

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930
lair of snakes maybe the worst predator
 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.960
lair of snakes maybe the worst predator
is the enemies that come to attack us

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970
is the enemies that come to attack us
 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.450
is the enemies that come to attack us
and those are human enemies and so what

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460
and those are human enemies and so what
 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.440
and those are human enemies and so what
we do is we defend

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450
we do is we defend
 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.300
we do is we defend
selves against the human enemies we put

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310
selves against the human enemies we put
 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.430
selves against the human enemies we put
walls around our cities we fortify our

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440
walls around our cities we fortify our
 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.920
walls around our cities we fortify our
our land and we defend ourselves against

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930
our land and we defend ourselves against
 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.150
our land and we defend ourselves against
the evil that's lurking in other

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160
the evil that's lurking in other
 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.370
the evil that's lurking in other
people's hearts and so that's like a

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380
people's hearts and so that's like a
 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.830
people's hearts and so that's like a
higher-order snake and then we build

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840
higher-order snake and then we build
 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.620
higher-order snake and then we build
these walls around us and what's inside

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630
these walls around us and what's inside
 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.600
these walls around us and what's inside
gets larger and larger and larger and

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610
gets larger and larger and larger and
 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.910
gets larger and larger and larger and
then what happens is the snakes start

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920
then what happens is the snakes start
 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.640
then what happens is the snakes start
popping up inside the cities because you

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650
popping up inside the cities because you
 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.890
popping up inside the cities because you
know we've pushed all the we've we've

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900
know we've pushed all the we've we've
 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.410
know we've pushed all the we've we've
protected ourselves from all the evil

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420
protected ourselves from all the evil
 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.170
protected ourselves from all the evil
that lurks outside but we've now created

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180
that lurks outside but we've now created
 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.690
that lurks outside but we've now created
a space where that evil can manifest

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700
a space where that evil can manifest
 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.390
a space where that evil can manifest
itself inside so there's criminals

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400
itself inside so there's criminals
 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.220
itself inside so there's criminals
inside the city and there's people who

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230
inside the city and there's people who
 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.330
inside the city and there's people who
want to bring you down and there's

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340
want to bring you down and there's
 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.130
want to bring you down and there's
malevolence within the city not only

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140
malevolence within the city not only
 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.800
malevolence within the city not only
outside so then there's the the problem

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810
outside so then there's the the problem
 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.190
outside so then there's the the problem
of the snake that's closer to you and

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200
of the snake that's closer to you and
 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.360
of the snake that's closer to you and
then there's the ultimate problem which

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370
then there's the ultimate problem which
 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.270
then there's the ultimate problem which
is the snake that lives in your heart

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280
is the snake that lives in your heart
 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.740
is the snake that lives in your heart
right and that's each individual's

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750
right and that's each individual's
 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.840
right and that's each individual's
capacity for evil and then that was

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850
capacity for evil and then that was
 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.410
capacity for evil and then that was
conceptualized as a transcendent spirit

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420
conceptualized as a transcendent spirit
 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.820
conceptualized as a transcendent spirit
right so that's the spirit of Satan

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830
right so that's the spirit of Satan
 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.340
right so that's the spirit of Satan
who's the who's the adversary of the

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350
who's the who's the adversary of the
 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.890
who's the who's the adversary of the
hero the adversary of the hero and

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900
hero the adversary of the hero and
 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.510
hero the adversary of the hero and
that's why there's an association

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520
that's why there's an association
 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.580
that's why there's an association
between the snake in the garden and this

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590
between the snake in the garden and this
 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.860
between the snake in the garden and this
this great series of mythologies about

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870
this great series of mythologies about
 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.260
this great series of mythologies about
the existence of evil itself it's a

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270
the existence of evil itself it's a
 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.330
the existence of evil itself it's a
consequence of our continued capacity to

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340
consequence of our continued capacity to
 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.940
consequence of our continued capacity to
abstract we started using the predator

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950
abstract we started using the predator
 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.250
abstract we started using the predator
detection system to detect snakes and

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260
detection system to detect snakes and
 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.070
detection system to detect snakes and
maybe no predatory cats and maybe birds

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080
maybe no predatory cats and maybe birds
 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.840
maybe no predatory cats and maybe birds
of prey and all that but that didn't

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850
of prey and all that but that didn't
 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.180
of prey and all that but that didn't
solve the bloody problem because just

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190
solve the bloody problem because just
 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.950
solve the bloody problem because just
because you hid from the predatory bird

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960
because you hid from the predatory bird
 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.420
because you hid from the predatory bird
today didn't mean the bloody thing

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430
today didn't mean the bloody thing
 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.830
today didn't mean the bloody thing
wasn't gonna be back tomorrow and

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840
wasn't gonna be back tomorrow and
 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.810
wasn't gonna be back tomorrow and
tomorrow starts to matter as you get

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820
tomorrow starts to matter as you get
 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.640
tomorrow starts to matter as you get
smarter and then once you're on that

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650
smarter and then once you're on that
 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.780
smarter and then once you're on that
pathway and you're starting to think

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790
pathway and you're starting to think
 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.800
pathway and you're starting to think
about abstractly about the predator the

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810
about abstractly about the predator the
 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.600
about abstractly about the predator the
nature of what constitutes the predator

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610
nature of what constitutes the predator
 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.820
nature of what constitutes the predator
starts to become because you're trying

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830
starts to become because you're trying
 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.790
starts to become because you're trying
to solve it across all situations

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800
to solve it across all situations
 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.290
to solve it across all situations
simultaneously it starts to become very

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300
simultaneously it starts to become very
 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.270
simultaneously it starts to become very
much more abstract and it ends up being

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280
much more abstract and it ends up being
 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.920
much more abstract and it ends up being
something like a personality like an

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930
something like a personality like an
 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.050
something like a personality like an
eternal personality and an eternal

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060
eternal personality and an eternal
 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.090
eternal personality and an eternal
personality that has its effect on

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100
personality that has its effect on
 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.330
personality that has its effect on
everyone all the time so and it's so

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340
everyone all the time so and it's so
 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.160
everyone all the time so and it's so
it's so interesting to see those ideas

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170
it's so interesting to see those ideas
 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.110
it's so interesting to see those ideas
because they basically evolved people

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120
because they basically evolved people
 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.360
because they basically evolved people
did not understand those ideas as they

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370
did not understand those ideas as they
 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.190
did not understand those ideas as they
produced them right it was all put

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200
produced them right it was all put
 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.920
produced them right it was all put
forward in a massive mythological

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930
forward in a massive mythological
 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.280
forward in a massive mythological
context and in a rich storied context

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290
context and in a rich storied context
 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.100
context and in a rich storied context
and the

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110
and the
 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.870
and the
korie's were as conscious as the

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880
korie's were as conscious as the
 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.380
korie's were as conscious as the
information got it was never articulated

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.390
