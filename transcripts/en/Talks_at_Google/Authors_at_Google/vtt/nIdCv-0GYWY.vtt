00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.440
BORIS DEBIC: Welcome,
everybody, to one more Talks

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.730
at Google event.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.170
Today with us is Mark Binelli.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.800
His new book is
called "Screamin'

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.210
Jay Hawkins' All-Time
Greatest Hits."

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.840
The rhythm and blues wild
man Screamin' Jay Hawkins

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.150
only had a single hit, the
classic "I Put a Spell on You,"

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.350
and he was often written off
as a novelty act, or worse,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.880
an offense to his race.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.280
But his myth making
was legendary.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.440
Mark Binelli embraces
the man and legend

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.530
to create a fantastical
portrait of this unlikeliest

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.820
of protagonists.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.690
At "Rolling Stone,"
Binelli has profiled

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.290
some of the greatest
musicians of our time,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.700
and this novel plays with
a focus and authenticity

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.790
in much music writing
about African-Americans.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.710
Binelli is the author of
"Detroit City is the Place

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.200
to Be," and "Sacco and
Vanzetti Must Die,"

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.550
as well as contributing
editor at "Rolling Stone"

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.330
and "Men's Journal."

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.300
Please join me in welcoming
Mark Binelli to Google.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.088
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.820
MARK BINELLI: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.880
Yeah, it's a real
treat to be here,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.920
and I'm going to read a
section quick section first,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.420
and then I'll talk
a little bit more

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.900
about how I came
to write the book,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.960
and just tell you a bit more
about Screamin' Jay Hawkins.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.520
I guess even for people
who haven't heard of Jay,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.180
you've probably heard
"I Put a Spell on You,"

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.670
or some version of that song.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.000
It's his one hit, as Boris said.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.500
It was recorded in 1956.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.424
It's been covered many times.

00:01:42.424 --> 00:01:44.840
The most famous version of it
is probably not his version,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.440
but a version done
by Nina Simone.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.070
Creedence Clearwater
Revival did a rock version

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.490
that's pretty popular.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.210
And then years later, people
like Marilyn Manson covered it.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.380
It was sampled by the
Notorious B.I.G. in the song

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.430
"Kick in the Door" to
pretty great effect.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.600
And later years, She and
Him covered the song.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.440
And his own version has been
used in films and commercials.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.520
So I was-- his own
penchant for myth making

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.490
is what really kind of brought
me to Jay as a subject,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.020
and I'll talk a little bit more
about that after this reading.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.000
The section I'm
going to read for you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.920
is about part of his myth that
sort of came up posthumously.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.790
He died in 1989.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.950
A year or two later,
stories started

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.930
to appear in the press
about how he had made claims

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.930
before he died that
he had fathered up

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.080
to 75 illegitimate children.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.900
And somebody created
a website, actually,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.200
called Jay's Kids,
which basically put out

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.280
a call to these children
to come forward,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.180
register with the website.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.820
There was some talk of
making a documentary film

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.110
and actually having a family
reunion of these kids.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.230
I'm not really sure if
any of this ever happened.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.380
But the scene I'm
about to read kind

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.300
of imagines what this
family reunion might

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.252
have been had it taken place.

00:03:23.252 --> 00:03:25.210
Funnily enough, it's the
only scene in the book

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.310
that Jay himself doesn't
appear in, because he's dead.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.120
But it's pretty self-contained.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.800
I think that's all
you need to know.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.390
So here we go.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.550
They began arriving
at the Sunset Marquis

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.310
just after 7:00, though
the invitation said 8:00.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.480
A young white girl
holding a clipboard

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.020
greeted them enthusiastically
in the lobby.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.280
"Oh, Mr. Hendricks,
welcome," she

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.420
said to Marvin Hendricks, who
arrived at closer to 8:30.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.070
"How was your flight
from Detroit, correct?"

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.866
She was correct.

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:01.240
She also made
clear her knowledge

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.930
of what he did for a
living-- a staff therapist

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.730
at a juvenile detention center--
and certain family details--

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.150
two kids.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.250
And Marvin got the
sense as she ushered him

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.350
toward the courtyard pool area,
where the reunion was taking

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.050
place, that she had
probably also memorized

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.980
his age and marital status--
37, divorced-- as well as,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.090
of course, his ranking
among the bastards.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.270
According to a
password-protected section

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.270
of the official
World Wide Web site,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.280
Marvin was the 13th male and
24th overall of Screamin'

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.620
Jay Hawkins'
extramarital offspring.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.980
They'd come from Philadelphia,
Paris, Southern California,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.880
Juneau, Texas, Tallahassee,
Guanajuato, Coney Island.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.870
They displayed a multiplicity of
ages, body types, complexions,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.010
styles of dress.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.870
The youngest, a 7-year-old
from Bowling Green, Kentucky,

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.140
was accompanied by an
ever-watchful mother.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.170
The oldest, a 53-year-old
surgeon practicing in Toronto,

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.800
brought his own teenage
daughter, a first-year art

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.720
history major at
McGill, who wanted

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.010
to take a tour of
the new Getty Center

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.494
and see the Hollywood
Walk of Fame.

00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:16.160
One of the brothers
had actually dressed

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.260
like Jay-- cape,
skull staff, bones

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.715
through his nose, the works.

00:05:20.715 --> 00:05:22.840
Though maybe he wasn't
actually a brother, but just

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.790
some guy hired by the
organizers of the event.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.015
They'd shown up for
a variety of reasons.

00:05:29.015 --> 00:05:32.740
Some, like Janessa, an airline
pilot based out of Minneapolis,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.850
had known their father's
identity from an early age.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.290
For others, the revelation
had come more recently

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.400
and been received as a
seismic shift-- Marvin,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.460
for example, whose mother, an
11th-grade English teacher,

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.450
private and bookish, had
always refused to say much

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.710
about his biological
father, except that she

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.400
hadn't known him, really,
beyond that one-night stand.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.510
He'd come through Detroit
while on military leave,

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.234
died in Vietnam.

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.150
But something one of
Martin's uncles had said,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.180
a crack one Christmas
Eve, had always

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.270
made him suspect the
Vietnam story was bullshit.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.280
Marvin read his uncle's hint
as implying his true father

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.510
had been a musician
of some renown,

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.860
genetic fantasy Marvin found
both flattering and certainly

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.850
more fun to secretly
speculate upon.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.830
Had Otis Redding or Miles
Davis, gigging in Detroit one

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.940
winter eve in 1965,
found themselves

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.150
smitten by the young cocktail
waitress at Baker's Keyboard

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.830
Lounge?

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.760
Or perhaps, it being
Detroit, after all,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.900
one of The Temptations?

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.860
Or even-- would his mother
provide such a throbbing neon

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.510
clue-- Marvin Gaye himself?

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.400
She finally confessed
in the most awkward way

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.210
possible, at one of their
regular Wednesday dinners.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.900
As Martin sat down
at the table, he

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.290
noticed a newspaper
clipping neatly folded

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.660
and tucked beneath his
napkin-- a short article

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.030
about how the late
musician responsible for "I

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.090
Put a Spell on
You," a son Marvin

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.050
only knew from the
Nina Simone version,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.260
had fathered scores of
illegitimate children,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.770
all of whom had been invited to
attend a family reunion in Los

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.130
Angeles, providing they
brought some manner of proof

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.470
and were willing to sign a
release form for a planned

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.000
documentary.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.520
"Marvin Gaye?" his
mother exclaimed

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.987
when he revealed his own
long-harbored notions.

00:07:15.987 --> 00:07:18.320
"But you know you're named
after your grandfather's best

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.825
friend, Marvin Sturgis."

00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:22.200
Marvin had known
that, of course,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.840
but had convinced
himself Sturgis must

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.430
be a convenient cover story.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.620
Screamin' Jay Hopkins,
though-- a number

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.610
of the children,
not only Marvin,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.300
found this news
difficult to process.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.610
They went out to record
stores, some of them

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.930
for the first time in years,
picked up greatest hits CDs,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.610
and listened to their
father's strange, jokey tunes,

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.980
while scrutinizing
liner notes photographs

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.150
for some trace of a
familial resemblance,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.290
poring over the details
of the old man's

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.317
ridiculous, unbelievable life.

00:07:54.317 --> 00:07:55.900
They'd all come to
the reunion bearing

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.334
varying degrees of skepticism.

00:07:58.334 --> 00:08:00.500
Some of them wondered if
the organizers of the event

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.874
hoped to turn
their group meeting

00:08:01.874 --> 00:08:03.790
into a kind of freak show.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.240
Others held vague
hopes of a surprise

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.960
a monetary reward, some
manner of deathbed amends

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.190
ordered by their absent father,
and came picturing dozens

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.710
of gathered heirs
seated in folding chairs

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.510
beneath a massive tent
as a lawyer solemnly read

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.630
from the revised will.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.530
Most of them hoped to find,
to a greater or lesser degree,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.520
some trace of themselves,
something that had existed out

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.210
in the world for
these many years,

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.210
scattered but a
true part of them,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.360
something no one
could deny is real.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.470
Over the course of
the evening, Marvin

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:41.120
met a catalog photographer, a
dogcatcher, a meteorologist,

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.620
an Asian studies professor,
a retired professional soccer

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.970
coach, a coder at
Netscape, a janitor,

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.670
a 26-year-old mother of
five from the Bay Area,

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.730
a gay, single dad from Wichita.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.580
They'd all missed having
a biological father

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.170
around, even though some had
stepdads or other surrogates--

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:02.620
in Marvin's case, his
mother's two older brothers.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.690
They shared such intimacies,
delicately at first.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.960
A few of them flirted in
spite of the unspoken taboo.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.380
Marvin had lived in
an international dorm

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.330
at the University of Michigan,
and one of the Indian guys down

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.600
the hall had taught him a
few curse words in Hindi,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.740
including one Marvin remembered
to this day-- bhenchod,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.600
which his friend had
translated as "sister fucker,"

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.130
and which Marvin
had for some reason

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.060
found enduringly
amusing as he explained

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.180
to a young lady from Baltimore
as she sipped a cloudy drink

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.230
from a Martini glass.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.820
A young lady-- his half
sister, the context being they

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.310
both spotted the dogcatcher
shamelessly hitting

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.740
on the Asian studies
professor, though if he

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.470
was forced to be
completely honest,

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.928
Marvin would have had to admit
that his injection of sister

00:09:43.928 --> 00:09:46.780
fucking into the conversation
was not wholly innocent

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.530
of suggestive intent.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:50.530
She didn't bite, though.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.950
Or rather, she
might have, but they

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.824
were interrupted by
another half brother, who

00:09:53.824 --> 00:09:54.744
introduced himself.

00:09:54.744 --> 00:09:56.910
This sort of interruption
was happening all evening,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.090
of course, the reunion being a
reunion of complete strangers,

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.770
after all, and who turned out
to be the only working musician

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.810
Marvin would meet that evening.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.726
He lived in Nashville,
he said, where

00:10:07.726 --> 00:10:09.600
he'd been doing steady
session work as a bass

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.262
player for the past decade
or so-- "Stuff you'd never

00:10:13.262 --> 00:10:15.220
have heard of, man," he
told Marvin, chuckling,

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.804
"unless you're
into Garth Brooks."

00:10:16.804 --> 00:10:18.470
"You've played on
Garth Brooks records?"

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.320
Marvin asked.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.830
"No, that's just an example,"
his bass-playing half brother

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:22.410
said.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.290
"Cats like him, though."

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.010
Marvin nodded.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.400
He never had any real
affinity for music-- played

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.389
no instruments, listened
mostly to the radio in his car,

00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:33.180
or to one of the handful
of the same albums

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.040
he been spinning
since college-- best

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.810
of compilations by Al Green,
the Police, Bob Marley, Prince.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.307
Some older rap.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.140
The newer stuff all
sounded the same to him,

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.265
knuckleheaded and abrasive,
though he realized this

00:10:45.265 --> 00:10:47.974
probably just meant
he was getting old.

00:10:47.974 --> 00:10:49.890
They also couldn't help
resenting the old man,

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.880
as much as they found him
intriguing, the mystery of him.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.000
His songs played on a loop, and
whenever the most famous one

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.960
came up, they joked about
how Hawkins should've

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.110
thought about casting
a second spell that

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.790
would have prevented his
women from getting knocked up.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.990
Others wonder darkly if
the spell in question,

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.592
like so much magic, came
with a curse attached,

00:11:08.592 --> 00:11:10.050
and if perhaps they
were the result

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.020
of that curse, the unintended
consequence of Jay's

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.120
version of the monkey's paw.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.620
You can fuck all
the women you want,

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.540
but every single one of
them's leaving pregnant.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.360
75 children, he'd apparently
estimated before he kicked.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.050
The insane numbers
had been reported

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.529
in the papers as a jokey, news
of the weird type of story,

00:11:29.529 --> 00:11:31.570
though to many of them,
it wasn't terribly funny,

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.370
but rather disquieting.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.050
Would anyone want
to claim membership

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.690
in such a messy diaspora?

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.840
Not long after his
mother's confession,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.770
Marvin locked himself
in the bathroom

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.920
and began vomiting into
her doily-covered toilet.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.587
He'd always instinctively
hated the man who'd screwed her

00:11:47.587 --> 00:11:49.920
and ran after the war, or to
the next gig, wherever he'd

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.820
gone, partly because Marvin was
a bit of a mama's boy himself.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.337
When he got older
he told friends

00:11:55.337 --> 00:11:57.420
he wished his mother would
date, but in his heart,

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.320
he clutched her love with greedy
fingers, uneager to share.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.350
Now, finally having
a face to put

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.560
on her fleeting suitor--
what a face-- it simply

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.170
wasn't easy to stomach.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.340
"This guy," he'd
wanted to shout at her.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.480
Jesus, the man was a clown,
and the music such camp.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.580
He'd popped the disc
from his car stereo

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.790
after only a few listens,
switching to the jazz station

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.220
to cleanse his palate.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.670
The CD case would glint
from the passenger seat

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:28.109
floor for the next several
months, mocking him.

00:12:28.109 --> 00:12:29.650
Why did he come to
the reunion, then?

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.074
Well, curiosity, of course,
that was the main thing.

00:12:32.074 --> 00:12:34.490
"And well, I don't know," he
was trying to explain himself

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.150
to his Baltimore sister
and country bass brother,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.000
"as disgusted as I was upon
first learning of all of this,"

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.220
he gestured at the crowd,
quickly adding, "no offense,

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.897
but it didn't mess with my sense
of, I don't know, uniqueness.

00:12:47.897 --> 00:12:49.480
But then I thought
about it some more,

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.990
and I realized, in a
certain sense this made me,

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.000
makes us, more unique.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.490
I mean, how many other
people have a miniature army

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.780
of siblings out in the world,
biologically programmed

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.150
to have one another's backs?

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.614
That's the dream, at any rate.

00:13:03.614 --> 00:13:06.030
Except I'm still trying to get
my head around the strength

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.620
of the connect."

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.232
He'd lost them.

00:13:09.232 --> 00:13:10.940
The Nashville brother
had cocked his head

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.730
in the direction of
the ether, trying

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.960
to make out the song
that had come up,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.840
and their sister was watching
this professional appraisal

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.567
play out in his face.

00:13:19.567 --> 00:13:21.400
Marvin hadn't heard the
song before, either.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.830
It was a ballad delivered with
unusual sincerity, at least

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.060
for their pops.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.660
"My only prayer will be
someday you'll care for me,

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.110
but it's only make believe."

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.800
"Conway Twitty," the
country session musician

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.590
finally muttered.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.250
Martin had to admit that,
as the evening wore on,

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.580
his father's music had begun
to take on a certain power.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.950
The exceedingly strange context
played a part, no doubt,

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.350
along with his own
increased inebriation.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.560
True, all true.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.412
But there was something
in the repetition as well.

00:13:56.412 --> 00:13:58.120
The Nashville brother
turned back to them

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.940
and mentioned that
he'd received a letter

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.630
from a conceptual
artist based in Berlin.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.510
The artist planned to remake
all 31 Elvis Presley pictures,

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.470
only with Screamin' Jay as the
lead-- well, "Screamin' Jay,"

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:12.760
an actor playing him, obviously,
a response, the artist wrote,

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.852
to Hawkins' claim
that he'd been offered

00:14:14.852 --> 00:14:16.810
the script for "Jailhouse
Rock" before Presley,

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.830
only to be rejected by studio
bosses as too scary and too

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.410
black.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.090
The artist had seen a
photograph of the session player

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.790
in a news story in Der
Spiegel about Jay's children

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.560
and found the
resemblance uncanny,

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.480
and she wanted to talk to
him about being her Jay.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.860
The Nashville brother said
he was considering the offer,

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.400
though he'd done some research
on her earlier work, which

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.900
involved quite a bit of nudity,
along with certain Christian

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.180
imagery that could be
interpreted as sacrilegious,

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.430
and worried it might prove
controversial in a way that

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.382
could hamper future gigs.

00:14:47.382 --> 00:14:49.340
"Nashville is still a
pretty conservative town,

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.674
you know," he said.

00:14:51.674 --> 00:14:53.590
Marvin, really all of
them, to a half sibling,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.330
had nurtured secret hopes of
the party turning into something

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.940
like an actual family
reunion-- not immediately,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.270
of course, but over the
course of the evening, primed

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.320
by the power of suggestion,
and, who could say,

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.970
a certain sort of
striving or refusal

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.080
to take no for an answer, born
of the same stubborn Hawkins

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.490
gene that collectively
would bond the group in ways

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.165
that they could never predict.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.790
They wanted, in other
words, to believe

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.240
in the triumph of nature.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.010
They vowed as they parted
ways at the end of the night

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.390
to do it again each year
in different cities,

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.720
to never lose touch
with one another.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.530
But the cameras only
came the one time.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.600
And it's not clear if they
ever followed through.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.430
So that's just a little
scene from the book.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.190
So I thought I'd just tell you
a little bit about my background

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.770
and how I came to
write this book.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.300
I've been a contributing
writer at "Rolling Stone"

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.430
for-- been a
contributor since 2000,

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:59.460
and I started freelancing
for them even before that.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.660
In the early days I wrote
primarily about music.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.950
More recently, I've shifted
to writing about politics

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.690
and general features.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.090
I wrote a book, a nonfiction
book, about Detroit--

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:15.420
"Detroit City is the Place to
Be"-- that came out in 2012.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.500
But as I said, I started
at "Rolling Stone"

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.990
primarily as a music writer,
and I came to music writing

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.840
in a kind of roundabout way.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.360
A lot of people on staff
at "Rolling Stone" who

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.170
focus on music are
hard-core music writers,

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.570
like old-school
record store-type guys

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.790
who just know everything.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.920
I can't hang with them.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.550
I came to writing about
musicians more as a writer,

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.340
meaning I like to
profile musicians

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.690
because they're
generally very extreme

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.430
and interesting characters.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.840
I was writing about different
sorts of arts and culture

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.590
for a while.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.110
And when you interview actors
or other sorts of artists,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:04.710
they're much more
controlling-- excuse me--

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.770
they're much more
controlling of their image

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.589
than musicians,
who are much more

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.130
likely to kind of
let it all hang out

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.569
and just be themselves.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.880
Which, for a writer,
that's ideal.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.329
So my first feature, my first
profile for "Rolling Stone,"

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.569
was a one-page profile at
the front of the magazine,

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:27.132
was Mo Tucker, the drummer
from The Velvet Underground,

00:17:27.132 --> 00:17:28.840
who at the time, I
was living in Atlanta.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.300
She was living in South Georgia.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.220
She was actually
working in a Wal-Mart.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.280
She had-- the Velvet Underground
had reunited and done

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.750
a brief tour, but then
it kind of fell apart

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.440
because of some conflicts
between Lou Reed and Sterling

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.890
Morrison, I believe, or maybe
it was Lou Reed and Cale.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:49.460
But anyway, she was
left back at Wal-Mart

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.460
working in this little
town in South Georgia.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.680
So for that very first
story, I drove down there

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.180
and sat with her
at a kitchen table,

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.340
heard from her about
learning the Wal-Mart cheer.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.610
My first longer feature was
a profile of Hank Williams

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:11.080
III, who's the son of
Hank Jr. He looks--

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.020
if anyone has seen him, he looks
eerily like his grandfather.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.210
He's tall and skinny and
sounds exactly like him.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.120
But he was performing a mixture
of classic country tunes

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.270
like his grandfather's
and thrash metal and punk.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:32.980
And that story actually got
him sent to rehab, weirdly.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.480
I drove up to Nashville
to meet with him.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.740
We took a tour
bus from Nashville

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.800
to Hot Springs, Arkansas,
where he had a gig.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.250
Before we even
left Nashville, he

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.990
stopped at his drug
dealer's house, talked

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.740
about drinking and
doing drugs, or was

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.790
doing that the
entire weekend I was

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:55.200
with him, which didn't
seem like a huge deal to me

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.200
because in the rock world
and the hip-hop world,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.908
none of that stuff is
that big of a deal.

00:18:58.908 --> 00:19:01.140
Apparently it is a big
deal in the country world.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:06.150
And so after my
story ran, he was

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.670
summoned to his record label.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.470
And when he got there, they
had staged an intervention.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.890
Waylon Jennings was
there, his father,

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.680
the guy who wrote the
song "Ring of Fire."

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.080
So I felt kind of
bad about that.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.960
But I did early stories--
in the early days,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:29.040
it seemed like whenever I did
a profile of a rapper or an R&amp;B

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.850
artist, they would
take me bowling, oddly.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.230
I went bowling in
Columbus, Ohio,

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:38.200
with Bizzy Bone of
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.790
I went bowling with
Outkast in Atlanta.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.020
I started to feel like I was
being profiled, possibly,

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.620
that they were thinking,
what is this nerdy white guy

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.440
gonna want to do?

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.560
Let's take him bowling.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.580
That's what he'll like.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.570
Anyway, the thing I found
after years of doing this

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.340
was that fringier
characters in the rock world

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.860
were much more interesting
to me than some

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.150
of the bigger
superstars, which takes

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.980
us to Screamin' Jay Hawkins.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.380
I've profiled-- I've
written cover stories

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.130
for "Rolling Stone" about
really huge artists.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.880
And I found over the
years that the more people

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.910
I meet at parties or
friends, the more they're

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:26.320
interested in a
particular artist, that

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.040
tends to be inversely
proportional

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.800
to how interesting they end
up being to me as a writer.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.860
So I've written cover stories
about Paul McCartney, Bruce

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.750
Springsteen, Jay-Z,
Radiohead, Britney Spears,

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.520
and really with the
exception of Britney Spears,

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:50.060
I found them all really likable
and smart and interesting,

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.230
but because they're
such huge stars,

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.507
there's just a
level of distance.

00:20:56.507 --> 00:20:58.840
Even though it's "Rolling
Stone" and we get lots of time

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.060
with them, it's really hard
to get them off message.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.330
When they've gotten
to that level,

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.200
they've generally
gotten very good

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.820
at saying what they want to say,
no matter what you ask them,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.480
and your access is
somewhat limited.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:22.410
So again, for me, musicians who
are sort of on the periphery

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:28.290
became what I kind of really
loved writing about more.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:32.360
In the case of Jay
Hawkins, who recorded

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.310
"I Put a Spell on
You" in 1956, he

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:41.600
was definitely a cult artist.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.210
I first heard "I
Put a Spell on You"

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:49.131
probably in the Jim Jarmusch
film "Stranger than Paradise,"

00:21:49.131 --> 00:21:51.630
which was an independent film
that came out in the mid-'80s.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.860
I saw it years later in college.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:22:00.209
And in the film he makes--
one of the characters

00:22:00.209 --> 00:22:02.250
plays "I Put a Spell on
You" throughout the film.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:08.860
And considering it was
recorded half a century ago,

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:14.110
it's really an oddly sort
of timeless-sounding song.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:20.200
I was in a pharmacy or somewhere
about a week or two ago,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.060
and I heard they were
just playing a Chuck Berry

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.290
song over the speakers.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.030
And it was one of his big
hits, maybe "Johnny B. Goode."

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:33.630
And it's a great
song, but it felt--

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.930
it just struck me, hearing it,
it felt very much of its time.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.840
It felt like a
song from the '50s,

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.160
like of that era, whereas
if you listen to "I

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:47.220
Put a Spell on You,"
there's a strange,

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.295
to use the same word again,
very timeless quality to it.

00:22:53.388 --> 00:22:56.370
It's a very funny song,
in certain ways, which

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.425
humor is hard to do in
music without crossing

00:22:59.425 --> 00:23:02.520
the line into novelty.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.530
Yet there's also kind of a
creepy, haunted element to it.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.760
He obviously screams
and sort of howls

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.480
and shouts throughout the song.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.630
There's kind of a
weird waltz tempo.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.730
There's something about
it that really still

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.534
works and does not feel dated.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.430
But it wasn't like I heard
the song and thought,

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.920
"I must write about this guy."

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.819
It was probably
many years later,

00:23:32.819 --> 00:23:34.610
I happened to be flipping
through the liner

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:39.370
notes of a compilation
CD by Hawkins

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:44.150
and realized that he had
this penchant for myth making

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.740
that was just
unbelievably great.

00:23:50.836 --> 00:23:53.400
In interviews, he
claimed that he

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.610
had been raised by
a tribe of Indians

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:02.910
in Cleveland, that he was a
boxing champion in Alaska,

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.350
that he lied about his
age when he was 14 so he

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.260
could fight in World War II.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.523
It just goes on and on.

00:24:16.658 --> 00:24:20.130
Even the actual recording of "I
Put a Spell on You," actually,

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.400
I think I'll just read a short
just a couple of paragraphs

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.900
from the very
beginning of the book.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:34.140
He has a very funny-- he
makes some very funny claims

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.560
about how that
song got recorded.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.910
This is just like a page.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.390
The origin story typically
goes something like this.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:48.930
On September 12, 1956, a
rhythm and blues aspirant

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:53.130
named Jalacy Hawkins, 27 years
old, a native of Cleveland,

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.720
entered a New York
recording studio

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.180
to cut a handful of sides
for OK Records, a subsidiary

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.630
of the Columbia label.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.570
One of the songs Hawkins brought
to the session, an original

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:06.030
he penned himself, followed a
heartbroken protagonist who,

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.990
in a fit of desperation,
turns to black magic

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.517
to beguile the strayed
object of his affection.

00:25:12.517 --> 00:25:14.100
He'd actually recorded
another version

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.130
of "I Put a Spell on
You" months earlier.

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.750
It's difficult to
imagine considering

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.060
the sturdiness of Hawkins
baritone, but at that time

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.470
he crooned the number
entirely straight.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:26.830
His model was Johnny Ace,
the Memphis preacher's son

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.870
with the impossibly
tender voice,

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.710
specifically the hit single
"Pledging My Love," a favorite

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.840
of Hawkins with its
syrupy arrangement,

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.125
heavy on the tinkling vibes.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.520
"I Put a Spell on You," Jay
said, "was a sweet ballad

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.510
when I wrote it."

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.370
Arnold Maxon, the
Columbia A&amp;R man

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.051
meant to supervise the session,
wasn't interested in ballads,

00:25:48.051 --> 00:25:48.550
though.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.490
Rock and roll,
that mongrel genre

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.300
with its raw appeals
to youth, had

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.890
become the sound of the moment.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.540
Hawkins and the session
musicians, to Maxon,

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.980
sounded hopelessly
stiff by comparison.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.810
In frustration, he
ordered up a case

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:06.170
of cheap wine, Swiss
Colony, an Italian muscatel.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.712
"We all got blind
drunk," Jay said.

00:26:08.712 --> 00:26:10.920
The singer awoke the following
afternoon, worked over

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.370
by a brute of a hangover,
the rest of the night lost

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.840
in the fog of war.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.870
Nearly two weeks later,
when Maxon presented him

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.590
with a newly pressed
78 recording of

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.860
"I Put a Spell on You," Hawkins
hardly recognized his song.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.830
Its melody had been sliced apart
and overtaken by a shuffling

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.550
somnambulist's rhythm,
the vocal track

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.790
similarly debased by
a series of drunken

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:36.390
screams and groans and
yells-- Hawkins' words.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.410
His sweet ballad,
ensorcelled, now

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.320
walked like a zombie, the
arms of his lovelorn hero thus

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.240
embodied, were no longer
outthrust to embrace

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.069
but to strangle.

00:26:48.069 --> 00:26:50.110
"And that is how I became
Screamin' Jay Hawkins,"

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.100
Jay said.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.670
"10 days later, I had
to learn the song."

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:58.340
So that's his tale of
how he wrote the song,

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.490
and he presented that
straight-faced his whole life.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:02.870
Most likely, it's not true.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:07.110
I mean he had been doing
that sort of shouting.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.904
It's a long tradition in jive
music and R&amp;B, blues shouters,

00:27:10.904 --> 00:27:12.820
and he'd been recording
other songs like that.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.400
So it seems unlikely
that he got so drunk

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.940
that he just somehow did this.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:23.630
But it's typical of his
style in interviews.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:28.230
And for me as a
writer, I had never

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:32.790
thought-- as a person who wrote
about music for my day job,

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:39.300
I never thought that would bleed
over into my fiction writing.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.660
It seemed like I wrote
about music plenty for work,

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.887
and I loved doing that.

00:27:45.887 --> 00:27:47.386
The fiction would
be something else.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.310
But when I came
across Jay's story,

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:56.570
it just was such a
perfect picaresque.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:03.380
It was kind of the
ultimate rock biopic,

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.240
in a certain way, just the
arc of his life as he told it.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:14.280
And I also loved-- the
idea of writing about him

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.342
was such a perverse choice.

00:28:17.342 --> 00:28:21.250
If you were going to
make a list of musicians,

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:25.040
iconic musicians, who
would be worthy of a novel

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:32.010
or a biography or a film
biopic, Screamin' Jay Hawkins

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.670
would be very, very, very
low on most people's lists.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.800
He's not anybody's idea
of a super iconic figure.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.822
He's a very cult
figure, and there

00:28:41.822 --> 00:28:44.280
are plenty of people who really
love him, including myself.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.880
But he's a very odd choice,
which really appealed to me.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.060
He only has the one hit.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.480
He's not very well known.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.180
And as I kind of
thought about it more,

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.719
I realized-- I
initially actually

00:29:00.719 --> 00:29:02.760
thought about writing a
book a straight biography

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.170
and really properly
researching it,

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:08.200
and approaching it that way.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.740
Then I realized, what if I
just took him at his word,

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.500
assumed all these
stories were true,

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.640
and wrote the novel that way?

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:23.580
And, that to me, that
unlocked-- that was the key that

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.530
unlocked it for me.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:29.050
I mean, it was
just-- it suddenly

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.640
gave me so many
liberties to just do

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.100
what I wanted as a writer.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:40.350
And my mantra basically
became, what if it's all true?

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.200
And that was
incredibly appealing.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.550
So I very deliberately did not
research his claims at all.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.000
I could've tried to find
his military records

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.430
and found out if he'd actually
fought in World War II.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:59.210
I didn't really want to
know any of that stuff.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.480
What I did end up doing
was sort of researching

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.230
around his many claims.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.960
So rather than finding
out specifically what

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:13.820
his actions were at that
time, I did find out

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.030
that there were people
who-- 14-year-olds who

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.130
lied about their age to
fight in World War II,

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.480
so that is plausible.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.350
There was this patriotic
fervor at the time.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.870
People were doing that.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.880
I researched-- he
claimed that he'd

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.990
seen combat in the
Pacific, so I looked

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:34.070
into where he might
have been stationed,

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.580
what sorts of roles
African-Americans

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.640
had in the Army at that time,
how segregated things were.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.010
That kind of period detail
was really actually very fun

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:45.630
to research.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.850
And then I still
had that liberty

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:52.033
of making up these
scenes within his life.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:03.220
I also was very drawn to
a few of the other details

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:08.530
that he had sort of sprinkled
throughout interviews

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:09.320
in his career.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:15.720
One of them was his whole stage
persona was very outrageous.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.870
I mean, he was-- again,
this was like '56, '57,

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.370
so this is decades before
George Clinton, decades

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.580
before Alice Cooper,
other people who were--

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.910
Kiss-- very theatrical rockers.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.370
He was the original person
doing this kind of stuff.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:35.760
So he would wear-- he put a
fake bone through his nose.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.790
He carried a staff with
a human skull on it

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.900
and wore these crazy
capes and costumes,

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.655
and would actually
jump out of a coffin.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.870
The coffin part was
apparently Alan Freed's idea,

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.970
the famous rock DJ.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.650
And in interviews
later in life, Jay

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.760
claimed that he
hated the coffin,

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.430
that he would get really drunk.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.820
He actually says he
developed a drinking problem

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.200
because he was so scared
of getting in the coffin.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.670
He dreaded it so
much he would just

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.910
have to get drunk every
night before the shows.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.730
It's a funny story, and who
knows if it was true or not,

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.820
if he was just kind of
saying that because it's

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.830
kind of funny.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.830
But to me, that was
the moment where

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:24.840
what was kind of a funny idea,
taking this guy's life story

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.960
and making it into
an entire novel,

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:33.750
also had a potential for more
depth-- just imagining him,

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:40.900
this sort of cartoonish figure,
actually mortally terrified

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.300
night after night,
staring down death

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.340
and locked into
these dark thoughts.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:50.730
I love the tension between
taking that totally seriously

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:54.470
and then also
presenting him, as he

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:59.510
was, this sort of outrageous
outwardly in many ways

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.530
ridiculous figure.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:05.610
Similarly, his whole
shtick was very

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:10.250
problematic and controversial
as far as race goes.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.980
The way he was
dressed was almost

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.720
like a sort of witch doctor
from a bad Looney Tunes

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.490
cartoon from the '40s.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:24.060
He was denounced by
the NAACP at one point.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:27.890
And yet, I thought,
he was possibly

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.330
doing some very
interesting things

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:33.480
with that in terms of just
playing around with audience

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.420
expectations, specifically
white audience

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.016
expectations of the time.

00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:43.310
Years later he released
an album called

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.570
"Black Music for White
People," and I think

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.210
that's it's a telling title.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:51.775
And I think he knew what he
was doing at a certain level,

00:33:51.775 --> 00:33:54.320
or at least in the book
I imagine that he did.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.870
And he, I think, was sort
of tweaking audience ideas

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.480
of authenticity, which can be
especially acute when it comes

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.780
to African-American artists.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.580
And you can go all the way
back to blues musicians

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.840
like Leadbelly and come all
the way forward to gangsta rap,

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:16.139
that this idea of a
craving for authenticity

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.070
from certain artists.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.770
And his wearing
that kind of costume

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:24.330
seems like a sort of
in-your-face mockery

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.860
and rejection of
that, at least to me.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.340
So I loved-- in
those ways, I thought

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:35.150
there were opportunities to
kind of get a little bit deeper

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:37.350
with him.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:39.920
So talking about
the coffin, and I

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.110
thought I would just
wrap up with one more

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.489
very short reading.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:56.159
It's a scene I imagined
of him and his manager,

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.720
a guy named Stan Pat.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.530
It's a scene of them coffin
shopping after they first come

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:08.015
up with the idea to do this,
and it's just a couple of pages.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.270
The day after their meeting
with Freed, Stan and Jay

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.180
visited a funeral
parlor in Gowanus.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:22.750
The coffins were arranged by
price in subsets of color.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.740
Mr. Browning, the
funeral director,

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.060
pointed out the key features of
various models-- finer grains

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.080
of wood, the ornate
gelding lavished upon more

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.330
baroque grips and handles.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:35.220
Jay, lagging
behind, ran a finger

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.590
along the center of a mahogany
lid, polished to an oily sheen.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.990
Leaning forward at the waist,
he held his nose inches

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:45.480
from the casket
and inhaled deeply.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.450
Looked roomy enough.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:50.390
"How well ventilated are
these things," Jay called out.

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:54.279
Browning, misunderstanding,
assured him they were airtight.

00:35:54.279 --> 00:35:56.820
They'd have to drill some holes
in the head end, Jay thought.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.250
Easily done.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.630
Jay cracked one of
the fancier models.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:04.030
The deep red lining of
the inside of the box

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:07.840
brought to mind a
dissected animal-- guts.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.210
He stroked the lining
with the back of his hand,

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.750
the way he would a baby's
cheek, or a woman's.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:17.680
Something soft
caught his sleeve.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.150
Solid, he said.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.300
He allowed the lid to drop.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.205
It made a clattering
sound as it fell shut.

00:36:22.205 --> 00:36:24.330
"I think we're probably in
the market for something

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.650
a bit simpler," Stan murmured,
flipping through a catalog

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.430
provided by Browning.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.370
On the page in which he
paused, the depicted coffin,

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:34.890
a rich oak, has
been lit to resemble

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.020
a perfect cut of steak.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:41.050
"Certainly," Browning said. "We
accommodate the entire range."

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:43.030
"Father was a very
pious man," Stan said.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:45.322
"He would've considered
expenses like these."

00:36:45.322 --> 00:36:47.230
"This is true," Jay
interrupted. "But we also

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.664
want Daddy to be comfortable."

00:36:49.664 --> 00:36:51.580
"No one is talking about
sacrificing comfort,"

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.550
Stan said.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.550
"I just think we would
be respecting his wishes

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.690
by finding happy medium end."

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:57.190
"Happy?"

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.130
Jay said.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.610
"You going to be
in there or him?"

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.570
"There's always cremation."

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:05.360
"He wouldn't have
wanted that," Jay said.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.390
"Toss the old scoundrel
in the oven," Stan said.

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:09.580
"Might be kind of satisfying."

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.540
"Poor old dad," Jay
said. "I'm sorry he

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.765
had one really bad son."

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:15.890
"Remember what mother said.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:19.040
Money is tight,
boys," Stan said.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.050
"That greedy cow," Jay
said, "always grabbing

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:23.430
at 15% of father's
hard-earned income,

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:27.110
spending it on Cuban
rum, dog races."

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.910
"Mr. Browning, I hope you'll
forgive our banter," Stan said.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.690
"It's our way of grieving."

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.280
Clearing his throat, Browning
asked, "Do you have a pastor

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.030
to say a few words?"

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.740
"He wasn't a religious
man," Jay said.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.280
"Catering?"

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.970
"All set."

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:43.461
"Flowers?"

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:45.210
"What do you think,
brother, too much?"

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.150
Stan asked.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.300
"Might be distracting
to the audience."

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.320
"He means the
mourners," Stan said.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.690
"Of course," Jay said.
"And also too feminine."

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:58.600
"There's that," Stan said.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.120
"I ain't Little
Richard," Jay said.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.010
"You mean the
deceased," Stan said.

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.920
"Daddy was not Little
Richard," Jay said.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.730
"He means the rhythm and
blues singer," Stan said.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.060
"Wap-ba-ba-loo-ba.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:11.830
An inside joke.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:13.788
Daddy would go around
saying, 'Who do you think

00:38:13.788 --> 00:38:15.994
you're talking to,
Little Richard?'"

00:38:15.994 --> 00:38:18.160
"Not that daddy listened
to rhythm and blues music,"

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.180
Jay said.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.700
"He just heard the name and
found it amusing," Stan said.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.210
"He thought it sounded like
a slang term for a tiny--

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.550
you know," Jay said.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:31.730
"He was a stupid,
stupid man," Stan said.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.430
"Amused by the
vulgar," Jay said.

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:38.120
"I'll miss the old
bastard," Stan said.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.120
Browning asked when the
body would be arriving.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.770
Stan Pat explained
that they would

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:44.440
be taking the coffin with them.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:48.880
"Private viewing," Jay said.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.690
"Someone must prepare the body."

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.560
"Mother," Stan said.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.890
"She insists," Jay said.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.050
The undertaker said
this was highly unusual.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:59.760
He repeated the
statement when he

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:05.240
saw the van in which the pair
proposed to lock the coffin.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:09.650
On its way out the door, Stan
said, "we'll need a receipt."

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:10.930
That's it.

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:12.560
Thank you.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.220
Thanks.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.660
Great to be here.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.210
