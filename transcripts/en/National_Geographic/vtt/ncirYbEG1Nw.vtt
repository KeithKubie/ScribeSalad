00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.667
NARRATOR: I met so many
families, moms and dads,

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:12.667
brothers and sisters, all
adjusting to a new normal

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:17.200
when a child tells them I'm
not a boy or I'm not a girl.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.166
But as the saying goes,
it takes a village.

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.333
So I wondered, how
are the institutions

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.000
who help raise our
children adapting

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.600
to this gender revolution?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.600
Grammar schools, daycare,
and that rite of passage--

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.934
summer camp.

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:35.834
So I traveled to Long Island
to meet Sadie, a tiny camper

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:37.133
on the front lines.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.467
She's on a gender
journey of her own

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:43.166
and the entire community here
at Hampton Country Day camp

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.400
is along for the ride.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.633
Will you show me around?

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:46.467
Sure.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:47.166
OK.

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.400
Low ropes, ooh.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.533
Oh, this is like
a zip line, right?

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.166
Yeah.

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.100
That's so cool.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.834
So Sadie is the first
transgender camper here

00:00:57.834 --> 00:00:59.734
at Hampton Country Day Camp.

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:01.400
Yes.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.600
Has it been a big adjustment?

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.433
Were you worried about her
making this transition,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.533
because she started
here as a boy?

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.667
Well it initially
took me by surprise.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.700
I think through conversations
and just looking at it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.834
in a rational way and trying to
figure out how this was going

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:23.200
to work out and knowing Sadie as
such a wonderful little child,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.667
just a happy child.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.867
This is camp, camp
is about being happy.

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:30.433
So our concerns were really
how Sadie was going to make

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:33.433
the transition here
and how other campers

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.200
were going to receive her.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.700
So there were a number
of things to consider.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.800
It was never a question
of would we do this,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.066
it was just a matter
of how will we do this.

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.033
Never a question?

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:44.367
Never a question.

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:47.166
So how old were you,
Sadie, when you said--

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.734
when you thought
to yourself and you

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:53.233
started telling your mom and
dad, I'm not a boy, I'm a girl.

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:55.166
I think when I was little.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:56.900
When you heard
from Sadie's parents

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.834
that she was going to be coming
to camp as a girl at six,

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:04.266
were you surprised?

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:06.734
I wasn't because I had
been speaking to her mother

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:08.000
even at the age of three.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.233
I think a lot of people
listening to this conversation

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:13.900
might think, that's
just too young.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.200
How do you know, at such a young
age, that this is who you are?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.467
And could it just be a phase.

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:23.800
I think that's probably--

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.633
That is the question.

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:25.834
--What people ask.

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:28.200
I just use the facts
that have been given to me

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.867
and that is children
actually formulate a gender

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:33.467
identity at a very young age.

00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:35.367
And it can be as
young as two or three

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:37.066
that they begin to demonstrate.

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.400
This is exactly
what we saw in Sadie

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.000
when she was here at camp.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.433
And you have to allow them to
express themselves freely and

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:46.033
be the people that they are.

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:48.600
The seminars that we've attended
and we go to camp conferences,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.467
there had already been a
lot of discussion going on.

00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:55.000
Sleepaway camps are now starting
to consider these situations.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.333
And started to educate ourselves
a little bit about this,

00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:01.066
because we knew that we're
on the horizon of change.

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:05.233
And And tell me about other
campers and their parents.

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:06.800
Was that tricky?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.233
I called every person who had
a child that was going to be

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:12.066
in Sadie's group
two summers ago,

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:13.667
giving them the
information about what

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:14.800
we were planning to do.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.200
So what was the reaction?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.100
Was there any resistance
from family members?

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.967
It was amazing.

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:23.066
They were so
welcoming to the idea.

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:25.500
I was actually surprised
by how easy it was.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.300
Sadie was in a boys
group at age five

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.233
and then a girls group
as Sadie at age six.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.467
How did the campers react?

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:38.600
The campers were
just welcoming to her.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.667
There were certain steps
that we took to make sure

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:45.233
that her privacy was respected
and that the privacy of the

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:46.600
other campers was respected.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.033
So her changing was
handled separately.

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:51.533
And you asked
Sadie's parents, you

00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:55.066
need to have a bathing
suit that affords her more

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:58.166
modesty than maybe other girls.

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.567
Exactly.

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:04.266
I know you went shopping
for a bathing suit this year.

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:06.233
For a girl's
bathing suit, right?

00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:07.967
Was that exciting for you?

00:04:07.967 --> 00:04:08.800
Mm hmm.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.834
Yeah?

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:11.233
Tell me about your bathing suit.

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:13.767
I think, really, I liked it.

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:16.433
And I was like, that was the
best shopping in my life.

00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:19.400
And when Sadie changes she
goes to a private area.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.333
She goes to a
separate area to change,

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:23.433
she's taken by a counselor,
which she loves to do,

00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:25.166
and they go to a
separate bathroom

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.967
and she changes
in that bathroom.

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.433
In a very short
amount of time,

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:30.433
it seems that our
perception of gender

00:04:30.433 --> 00:04:32.266
has changed dramatically.

00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:35.200
There's so much going
on around this issue.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.700
And people can just be
accepting of who people are

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.800
and give them an opportunity
to express themselves.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.834
She's joyous.

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:45.600
I mean, this is a joyous child.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.233
How could we ever take
that away from her?

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:50.300
Make her feel shameful
for who she is?

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.867
It just doesn't
seem right or fair.
