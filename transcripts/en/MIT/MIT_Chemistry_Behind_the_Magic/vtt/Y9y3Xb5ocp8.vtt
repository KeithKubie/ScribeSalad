00:00:07.387 --> 00:00:08.720
JESSICA HARROP: Hi, I'm Jessica.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.930
And today, I'm going to
talk about her reaction I

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.170
like to call Midas' Magic.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.460
And before I get started, let's
watch the reaction in action

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.528
with the help of Dr.
Bassam Shakashiri.

00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:26.310
And here he is.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.220
He's actually the president of
the American Chemical Society.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.690
And his motto is,
"Science is fun."

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.860
Here he is at MIT.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.660
And let's see what
he has to show us.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.910
BASSAM SHAKASHIRI: Watch this.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.250
Here i take this clear
and colorless liquid.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.232
And I put some of it in the
beaker, about 100 milliliters.

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:45.940
How do I know it's
about 100 milliliters?

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.365
AUDIENCE: It says so.

00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:49.490
BASSAM SHAKASHIRI: I'm
reading the markers on here,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.610
on the beaker.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.086
And I take about 100
millimeters of a different

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.210
clear and colorless liquid.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.380
But you don't know
that it's different.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.562
They look the same, right?

00:00:56.562 --> 00:00:57.270
And look at this.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.260
Look what's going to happen now.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.162
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:01.155
AUDIENCE: It's yellow.

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:02.530
BASSAM SHAKASHIRI:
Isn't that one

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.700
of the most fascinating
observations you make?

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.850
You take two clear,
colorless liquids.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.940
You mix them together, and
you get a yellow substance

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.440
that is insoluble in water.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.530
This is lead iodide.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.370
I mixed potassium
iodide solution

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.944
with lead nitrate solution.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:20.110
So the magician never tells
you how the trick works.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.090
But in science, we like
to know what's going on.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.590
JESSICA HARROP: So
what is going on?

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.050
Let's break it down.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.130
Dr. Shakashiri started with
two clear, colorless liquids.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.560
He had about 100
milliliters of lead nitrate.

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:40.100
And that's aqueous.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.010
That's in solution.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:49.870
And about 100 milliliters
of potassium iodide, also

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.700
aqueous, and when he
mixed those together,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.950
he got a yellow precipitate.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.430
Let's color that in yellow.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.240
A precipitate is a solid.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.395
So how do we know what
this yellow solid is?

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:09.770
Well, this is the
reaction that's

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.560
called a double
displacement reaction.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.350
And in this kind of reaction,
the cation and anion pairs

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.800
switch places.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.840
So what exactly does that mean?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.860
I'm going to use some
colors to help me out.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.350
So we've got cations and anions
in each of these compounds.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.790
The cations have
positive charge.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.050
So in this case, it's
lead, which has a 2+ charge

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.740
and nitrate, NO3-.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.230
You need two of those to
have a neutral compound.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.100
Our other compound, over here,
has potassium, which has a +1.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.850
And our anion is
iodide, which is -1.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.950
When these two solutions
are mixed, we've got lead,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.770
which is our +2.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.245
And it's going to
react with iodide.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.040
We need two of them to
make it a neutral compound.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:33.780
And potassium nitrate, and we
just need one nitrate here.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.317
So our cations and anions
all switched places.

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:40.650
We're going to need to balance
this equation let's throw

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.400
some twos there and there.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.190
So how can we predict which
one of these two compounds

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.290
is the yellow precipitate?

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.560
Hundreds of years ago,
chemists mixed ions together.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.490
And they came up with solubility
tables, just like this one.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.990
Now this chart
basically shows us

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.020
when these two ions, an ion
from this column and this column

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.240
are mixed together,
is their product,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.810
a compound that they form,
soluble or insoluble in water?

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.230
If it's soluble
in water, there's

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.620
an aq for aqueous on the chart.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.770
And if it's insoluble in
water, there's an s for solid.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.680
So our two compounds that we
want to look at our lead iodide

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.329
and potassium nitrate.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.930
So let's take a look.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.330
Potassium nitrate--
we've got potassium

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.000
down here at the bottom.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.210
We've got nitrate
here at the top.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.710
When mixed together, aqueous
solution, soluble in water.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.910
So it's more likely that
our lead iodide would

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.200
be the yellow precipitate.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.160
But let's see if that's true.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.145
Lead mixed with iodide--

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.290
voila.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.130
It's a solid.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.440
So to recap,
solubility tables help

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.770
chemists predict whether or
not a precipitate will form

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.840
when two solutions are mixed.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.280
So going back to our equation
here, the lead iodide--

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.480
this is the yellow precipitate.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.310
It's a solid.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.780
And the potassium
nitrate is aqueous.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.520
And even though I
didn't paint my nails

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.460
with this particular
pigment, lead iodide,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.290
creating nail
polish colors is one

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.270
of the many different
things that chemists can do.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.900
So there we go.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.660
I hope you enjoyed Midas' Magic.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.020
And I will see you next time.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.370
