00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
Ok, roll it.

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.569
You know what this is? It is the longest word
in the world.

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:06.640
Like, anywhere, in any language, ever.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.600
More than 189,000 letters.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.880
If you were to write it down, though I don't
know why you would, it'd fill up more than

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.080
100 pages!

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.860
And if you could actually say it without,
like, breaking your face, it'd take about

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.620
FIVE hours!

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.450
So what the frick is this word?

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.190
It's the name of the longest known protein
on earth. And it's actually in you right now.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.220
Because of its enormous size, it was given
the nickname Titin by scientists.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.770
And that's with two i's.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.350
It's a protein that helps give some of the
springiness to your muscles.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.190
Today we're going to be talking about DNA
and how it, along with three versions of its

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.350
cousin RNA, unleash chemical kung fu to synthesize proteins just like this.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.710
This is going to take a while to explain,
so how about if we make ourselves some hot pockets.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.760
Mmmm, my favorite. Ham and cheese.

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.789
Every time I take a bite I wonder, how do
they do it?

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.509
How do they pack exactly the same flavor into
every foil-cardboard wrapped foodish item?

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.229
Clearly there has got to be some super secret
instruction manual kept in a location known

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.020
to only two people.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.000
And since I'm talking about biology here,
that brings up a related question:

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.820
How did I get built from the DNA instructions
and biological molecules we've been talking about?

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.100
Today, that's what I'm going to do. Not
actually make hot pockets, or a person.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.969
But I'm going to be talking about DNA transcription
and translation

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.149
which is how we get made into the delicious
things we are today.

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.750
Though hopefully none of us know how delicious
people are.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.820
Animals, plants, and hot pockets are really
nothing more than salty water, carbohydrates,

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.479
fats, and protein, combined in precise proportions
following very explicit instructions.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.210
Let's say I want to make my own hot pocket.
I would have to:

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.109
1) break into the lair of the Hot Pocket Company
holding the secret manual

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.960
2) read the instructions on how to make the
machinery to produce the hot pocket and the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.380
proportions of the ingredients

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.240
3) quickly write down that information in
shorthand before I get caught by the hot pocket police

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.800
4) go home and follow the instructions to
build the machinery and mix the ingredients

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.850
until I have a perfect hot pocket.
That's how we get us.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.260
Very simply, inside a cell's nucleus, the
DNA instruction manual is copied gene by gene

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.800
by transcription onto a kind of RNA

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.930
then taken out of the lair where the instructions
are followed, by the process of translation

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.630
to assemble amino acid strings into polypeptides
or proteins that make up all kinds of stuff

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.660
from this titin down here to the keratin in
my hair.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.940
But most of the polypeptides that get made
aren't structural proteins like hair, they're enzymes

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.700
which go on to act like the assembly machinery,
breaking down and building and combining carbohydrates

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.200
and lipids and proteins that make up variations
of cell material.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.160
So enzymes are just like whatever ingenious
machinery 'they' use at the factory to make this.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.670
Let's start in the lair -- I mean the nucleus.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.950
The length of DNA that we're going to transcribe
onto an RNA molecule is called our transcription unit.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.170
Let's say, in today's example, that it's
going to include the gene that transcribes

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.430
for our friend titin

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.550
which, in humans at least,
occurs on Chromosome 2.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.580
Now each transcription unit has a sequence
just above it in the strand

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.970
and that's called "upstream"

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.120
biologists call that "upstream" on the strand

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.990
And that sequence defines where the transcription
unit is going to begin.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.430
This special sequence is the promoter, and
it almost always contains a sequence of two

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.620
of the four nitrogenous bases we discussed
in our last episode: adenine (A), thymine (T)

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.110
cytosine (C) and guanine (G).

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.380
Specifically, the promoter is a really simple
repetition

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.450
we've got thymine, adenine, thymine, adenine,
and then A-A-A.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.750
And on the other side: ATATTTT. Because you
know how this works, right!?

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.870
This is called the TATA box. It's nearly universal
and helps our enzyme figure out where to bind to the strand.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.070
Now, you'll remember from our episode about
DNA structure that DNA strands run in one

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.460
of two directions

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.090
depending on which end of the strand is free
and which end has a phosphate bond.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.230
One direction is 5 prime-3 prime, and the
other is 3 prime-5 prime.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.960
In this case, upstream means toward the 3
prime end and downstream means toward 5 prime.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.100
So the first enzyme in this process is RNA
polymerase, and it copies the DNA sequence

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.230
downstream of the TATA box

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.920
that's towards the 5' end and copies it into a
similar type of language: messenger RNA [mRNA].

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.930
Quick aside: So you'll notice that to read
the DNA in order to make enzymes we need an

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.370
enzyme in the first place.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.230
So it kind of gets "chicken vs egg" here.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.890
We need the enzyme to make the DNA and the
DNA to make the enzyme.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.620
So, where did RNA polymerase come from if
we haven't made it yet!?

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.520
What an excellent question! It turns out all of these
basic necessities get handed down from your Mom.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.770
She packed quite a bit more into her egg cell
than just her DNA so we had a healthy start.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.780
So, thanks Mom!

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.030
So the RNA polymerase binds to the DNA at
that TATA box, and begins to unzip the double-helix.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.020
Working along the DNA chain, the enzyme reads
the nitrogenous bases, those are the letters

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.700
and helps the RNA version of the nitrogenous
bases floating around in the nucleus find their match.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.080
Now as you ALSO might recall from our previous
episode

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.670
nitrogenous bases only have one counterpart
that they can bond with.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.070
But RNA, which is the pink one here, doesn't
have thymine like DNA does

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.220
which is the green and the blue.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.050
Instead it has uracil (U), so U appears here
in T's place as the partner to adenine.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.139
As it moves, the RNA polymerase re-zips the
DNA behind it and lets our new strand of messenger

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.280
RNA peel away.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.820
Eventually, the RNA polymerase reaches another
sequence downstream, called a termination

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.160
signal, that triggers it to pull off.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.710
Now, some finishing touches before this info
can safely leave the lair.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.490
First, a special type of guanine (G) is added
to the 5-prime end

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.320
that's the first part of the mRNA we copied

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.170
and this is called the 5' cap.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.400
On the other end, it looks like I fell asleep
with my finger on the A key of my keyboard

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.389
but another enzyme added about 250 adenines
on the 3' end.

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.389
This is called the poly-A tail.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.169
These caps on either end of the RNA package
make it easier for the mRNA to leave the nucleus

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.380
and they also help protect it from degradation
from passing enzymes, while making it easier

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.380
to connect with other organelles later on.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.400
But that's still not the end of it. As if
to try to confuse me to protect the secret

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.070
hotpocket recipe

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.470
the original recipe book also contains lots
of extra, misleading information.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.440
So just before leaving the nucleus, that extra
information gets cut out of the RNA in a process

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.020
called RNA splicing.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.550
And it's. something. like. editing. this.
video.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.210
The process is really complicated, but I just
had to tell you about two of the key players

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.410
because they have such cool names.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.350
One, the Snurps, which are Small Nuclear RibonucleoProteins.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.100
These are a combination of RNA and proteins,
and they recognize the sequences that signal

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.280
the start and end of the areas to be spliced.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.410
Snurps bunch together with a bunch of other
proteins to form the spliceosome, which is

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.100
what does the actual editing

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.980
as it were, breaking the junk segments down
so their nitrogenous bases can be reused in

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.870
DNA or RNA, and sticking together the two
ends of the good stuff.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.490
The good stuff that gets spliced together,
by the way, are called exons because they'll

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.290
eventually be expressed

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.960
the junk that gets cut out are just intervening
segments, or introns.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.990
The material in the introns will stay in the
nucleus and get recycled.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.699
So for instance, titin down there is thought
to have hundreds of exons when it's all said and done

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:19.610
probably more than 360, which may be more
than any other protein.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:25.050
And it also contains the longest intron in
humans, some 17,000 base pairs long.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.560
Man, titian! It is just a world record holder!

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.140
So now that it has been protected and refined,
the messenger RNA can now move out of the nucleus.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.940
OK, a quick review of our Hot Pocket Mission
Impossible caper so far:

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.800
We broke into the lair containing the instructions,
we copied down those instructions in shorthand

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.160
we added some protective coatings, and then
we cut out some extra notes that we didn't need

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:47.580
and then we escaped back out of the lair.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.949
Now I have to actually read the notes, make
the machinery and assemble the ingredients.

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:54.050
This process is called translation.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:08:00.010
So next, rewind your memory -- or just watch
that video again -- to the episode about animal cells.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.800
Do you remember the rough endoplasmic reticulum? I hope you do.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.330
Those little dots on the membranes are the
ribosomes, and the processed messenger RNA

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.430
gets fed into a ribosome like a dollar bill
into a vending machine.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:16.580
Ribosomes are a mixture of protein and a second
kind of RNA, called ribosomal RNA [rRNA]

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.560
and they act together as a sort of work space.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.729
rRNA doesn't contribute any genetic information
to the process, instead it has binding sites

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:26.660
that allow the incoming mRNA to interact with
another special type of RNA

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.320
the third in this caper, called transfer RNA,
or tRNA.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.340
And tRNA really might as well be called 'translation
RNA' because that's what it does

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:38.990
it translates from the language of nucleotides
into the language of amino acids and proteins.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.890
On one end of the tRNA is an amino acid. On
the other end is a specific sequence of three

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:44.980
nitrogenous bases.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.569
These two ends are kind of matched to each
other.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:51.369
Each of the 20 amino acids that we have in
our body has its own sequence at the end.

00:08:51.369 --> 00:08:57.619
So if the tRNA has the amino acid methionine
on one end, for instance, it can have UAC,

00:08:57.619 --> 00:08:59.279
as the nucleotide sequence on the other.

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:03.249
Now it's like building a puzzle. The mRNA
slides through the ribosome.

00:09:03.249 --> 00:09:08.319
The ribosome reads the mRNA three letters
at a time - each set called a triplet codon.

00:09:08.319 --> 00:09:12.629
The ribosome then finds the matching piece
of the puzzle: a tRNA with three bases that

00:09:12.629 --> 00:09:14.350
will pair with the codon sequence.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.619
That end of the tRNA, by the way, is called
the anticodon.

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:18.239
Sorry for all the terminology.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.420
YOU NEED TO KNOW IT!

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.740
And of course, by bringing in the matching
tRNA, the ribsome is also bringing in whatever

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.600
amino acid is on that tRNA.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.569
Ok so, starting at the 5' end of the mRNA
that's fed into the ribosome, after the

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:35.569
5' cap, for almost every gene, you find
the nucleotide sequence AUG on the mRNA.

00:09:35.569 --> 00:09:41.339
The ribosome finds a tRNA with the anticodon
UAC, and on the other end of that tRNA is methionine.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.920
The mRNA, like a mile-long dollar bill, keeps
sliding into the ribosome so that the next

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.730
codon can be read, and another tRNA molecule
with the right anticodon binds on.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:56.970
If the codon is UUA, the matching tRNA has
AAU on one end and Leucine on the other

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:03.249
and if the mRNA has AGA, the matching tRNA
has UCU on one end and Arginine on the other.

00:10:03.249 --> 00:10:09.200
In each case that new amino acid gets connected to
the previous amino acid - starting a polypeptide chain.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.879
Which is the beginning, the very beginning
of a protein.

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:14.499
But it turns out there are LOTS of different
ways to read this code.

00:10:14.499 --> 00:10:18.889
'Cause UUA is not the only triplet that
codes for Leucine -- UUG does too!

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:20.970
And argenine is coded for by six different
triplets!

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.369
This is actually a good thing. It means that
we can make a few errors in copying, transcribing

00:10:24.369 --> 00:10:27.459
and translating DNA, and we won't necessarily
change the end product.

00:10:27.459 --> 00:10:32.189
This process continues, with the mRNA sliding
in a bit, the ribosome bringing in a tRNA

00:10:32.189 --> 00:10:35.759
with an amino acid, that amino acid binding
to the existing chain

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:40.879
and on and on, sometimes for thousands of
amino acids to make a single polypeptide chain,

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:41.639
for example.

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:45.369
This whole word is basically just the names
of the amino acids in the sequence in the

00:10:45.369 --> 00:10:47.660
order in which they occur in the protein

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.959
all 34,350 of them.

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:52.929
But before we can make our own hot pockets

00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:56.089
and that string of amino acids becomes my
muscle tissue

00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:57.350
we have some folding to do.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.110
That's because proteins, in addition to
being hella big, can also contort into very

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.899
complex and downright lovely formations.

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:07.579
One key to understanding how a protein works
is to understand how it folds, and scientists

00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:11.670
have been working for decades on computer
programs to try to figure out protein folding.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.529
Now, the actual sequence of amino acids in
a polypeptide - what you see scrolling along

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:18.720
down there - is called its primary structure.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.839
One amino acid covalently bonded to another,
and that one to another, in a single file.

00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:26.639
But some amino acids don't like to just
hold hands with two others, they're a bit

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:28.149
more promiscuous than that.

00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:31.899
The hydrogens on the main backbone of the
amino acids like to sometimes form bonds on

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:35.740
the side (hydrogen bonds) to the oxygens on
amino acids a few doors down.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.679
When they do that, depending on the primary
structure, they bend and fold and twist into

00:11:39.679 --> 00:11:42.050
a chain of spirals, called a helix.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.850
We also find several kinked strands laying
parallel to one another, called pleated sheets.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.300
All those hydrogen bonds in pleated sheets
are what make silk strong, for instance.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.740
So in the end, our promiscuous amino acids
lead to wrinkled sheets. Ah-hah!

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:58.429
These hydrogen bonds help give polypeptides
their secondary structure.

00:11:58.429 --> 00:12:02.290
But it doesn't end there. Remember the R groups
that define each amino acid?

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:07.129
Some of them are hydrophobic. Since the protein
is in the cell, which is mostly water, all

00:12:07.129 --> 00:12:11.329
those hydrophobic groups try to hide from
the water by huddling together, and that can

00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:12.600
bend up the chain some more.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.519
Other R groups are hydrophilic, which if nothing
else means that they like to form hydrogen

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:18.339
bonds with other hydrophilic R groups.

00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:22.720
So we get more bonding, and more bending,
and our single-file line has now taken on

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.209
a massively complex 3-D shape.

00:12:25.209 --> 00:12:28.319
It also explains why I can fix my bed-head
by wetting my hair with water.

00:12:28.319 --> 00:12:32.689
The water helps break some of those hydrogen
bonds in the keratin which relaxes its structure.

00:12:32.689 --> 00:12:37.889
That way I can comb it out, and when it dries
those bonds reform and voila, perfect hair.

00:12:37.889 --> 00:12:44.000
All of this shape caused by bonding between
R groups gives our polypeptide a tertiary structure.

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:49.239
So now we have a massively contorted polypeptide chain, and it actually contorts very precisely.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.660
Sometimes, just one chain is what makes up the whole enzyme or protein.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:57.829
In other proteins, like hemoglobin, several
different chains come together to from a quaternary structure.

00:12:57.829 --> 00:13:02.709
So a quick review of structure: the sequence
is primary, the backbone hydrogen bonds forming

00:13:02.709 --> 00:13:06.920
sheets and spirals are secondary, R group
bonds are tertiary, and the arrangement of

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.769
multiple proteins together give quaternary
structure.

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:12.999
These polypeptides are either structural proteins,
like this thing at the bottom here that you

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:15.569
can find in muscle or in my hot pocket.

00:13:15.569 --> 00:13:18.989
They might also be enzymes, and enzymes like,
do stuff.

00:13:18.989 --> 00:13:23.179
They can cut up biological molecules like
I do with this chef's knife, they can mix

00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:24.769
stuff and they can put stuff together.

00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:28.679
So from that one recipe book we got all of
the ingredients and all of the tools necessary

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:33.249
to make me, which is better than a hot pocket.

00:13:33.249 --> 00:13:33.850
Would you all agree?

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.439
Now take your time with this stuff, feel free
to watch the episode a couple of times, because

00:13:37.439 --> 00:13:41.209
next week we're going to talk about how
cells swap all of this

00:13:41.209 --> 00:13:43.089
genetic information through reproduction.

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:45.489
Thank you for watching this episode.

00:13:45.489 --> 00:13:47.279
By now, you should probably know how this
works.

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:51.189
You can click on any of the links over there,
and it'll take you back to that point in the

00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:52.679
show as long as you are not watching on your
cell phone.

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:54.569
It doesn't work on cell phones, I apologize
for that.

00:13:54.569 --> 00:13:57.969
Thank you to everyone who helped us put this
show together, and thank you to you, for watching it today.
