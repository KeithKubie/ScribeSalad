00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.030
 The Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476 AD 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.040
 The microphone was not invented until the 1870s. 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.160
 It’s a gap. 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.460
 And so far we still know how the ancient Romans read their Latin 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.080
 Proof? 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.500
 OK! 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.720
 Christian school 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.720
 Literature class 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.060
 My teacher is a priest who yelled at his priest F. 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.550
 As a priest F with a language mind, he has more experience than many of me. 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.599
 respect-- 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.019
 Everything happened in the morning, and the sunshine in that classroom 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.640
 Almost to switch the power switch in my mind 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.750
 Language vocabulary drifted through the classroom 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.829
 "Consonant", "Italian", and "pronunciation" exceeded my sensor. 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.890
 A child is talking to the priest over there 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.840
 As far as I can recall, it’s probably like this. 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.629
 "Well, that, how do we know what Latin sounds like? 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.760
 I always think that Caesar's sentence is "vennee veedee veechee". 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.289
 But some Latin students told me that v is w and c is k. " 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.950
 "Hey? No. 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.859
 Please, can you imagine any Italian who speaks "wennee, weedee weekee"? " 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.429
 I am sitting there, making sure there are some problems. 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.360
 My first linguistic doubt is about how Latin becomes Romance. 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.910
 Then why am I suddenly speechless? 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.540
 Ah, kid, it will take you a few years but I will come back to help you. 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.110
 We think we know how Caesar’s Latin sounds, but it’s not always true. 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.750
 We understand because ⋯⋯ sometimes they tell us 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.780
 Professor Kun Tiliang comes from Spain, a Roman empire, and is a smart person. He moved to Rome, 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.100
 I was able to survive the crazy "Four Years of the Four Emperors" and established a school of rhetoric. 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.940
 Then he hates the letter K. 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.420
 "So, I personally think that K should not be used anymore. 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.680
 C maintains its strength before all vowels. " 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.800
 If he says that "C" always has a "K" sound, then it means that C is not like English or Italian. 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.000
 The pronunciation of the squeaky sound (S). 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.300
 But this is just the rhetoric of a grammar scholar. Things may be in all evidence 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.400
 They all come out differently. What is the "R" claimed by a Czech linguist? 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.700
 Your Latin textbook says that R is a small tongue, and she says it should be a flash. 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.730
 We only have a little bit of evidence, written by ancient authors. 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.020
 "Good" in Latin. The first clue they gave us was the letters, 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.240
 They should be in line with the Latin sound. Did you hear English? 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.250
 So when we write different vocabulary, like ÁNVS, ANVS and ANNVS, it is 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.740
 Clues to different readings. "ahh" such as long sound, sometimes 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.250
 The small "apex" sounds different from the short "ah". Twin tones and monotones 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.920
 It sounds different. 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.110
 In the epic of Weijier, the letters that are seen immediately are full. 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.560
 Precise structure: step. From the steps we can construct the length of the syllables. 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.250
 This also helps us to prove which vowel is longer and which vowel is shorter. 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.960
 So some "I", sorry, "ee" is longer than the other "ee". 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.930
 But take a closer look at the short "ee" on the inscription and you will find something interesting. 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.460
 Or, can't find it. Because maybe there should be "ee" there, but only "E". why? 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.319
 Well, this makes sense. If the short "ee" is not only shorter than the long "eeee", even 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.340
 Have different pronunciations, one is "ihh", close to the pronunciation of "é". 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.069
 The Romans left many clues as they advanced into foreign languages. 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.910
 And was attacked by the Germanic tribe. Linguistic ambush. "We want to make a vocabulary, companion! 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.020
 What do you want? "Give me some wine!" "I want the wall!" Yes, these are Latin vocabulary. 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.350
 There is also a bad accent. And they make "v" look like "w", 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.010
 Some of us have some doubts about poetry and word pairs. 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.580
 So yes, good Latin is circulating, but after the return home, the Roman mob is 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.160
 Let it go bad! Although the Latin writer noticed, even the entire nation is 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.770
 Talking about bad Latin, the so-called "popular Latin" is especially funny. 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.849
 But bad Latin can only be considered a good evidence. Back to Pompeii, before the tragedy, one 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.760
 Passers-by come here and graffiti, let us know him and his brother forever 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.980
 I have been here for a tour. Although he drew something inferior. He missed "h" in "here". 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.080
 Ah, just a small mistake, right? 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.069
 Then you find a book full of dust, very old, and full of corrections, telling you 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:21.220
 Tell you that "old" is "vetulus" instead of "veclus"; "hostiae" instead of "ostiae"; 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.749
 There is also "hermeneumata" instead of "erminomata". Please! It seems that Pompeii brothers file 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:27.610
 It is not the only missing H letter. 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.419
 These errors are some sort of interesting evidence. I mean you probably won’t ask me. 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.740
 Don't miss writing H, even though people are actually missing H. 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.069
 But the "heresy" of linguistics finally turned it into a Romance language. they 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.139
 All can tell us about Latin. 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.001
 Wait, why is the new language a proof of death? Take a look at the "e" in Spanish and Italian: 

00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:55.449
 They all come from the Latin "e", but also from the short "i", not the long "i". Like these 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.139
 Inscription! They have more evidence of short "ih" and long "eeee". 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:07.289
 Also, "si" is the letter C. The Romance still quite like it, but in 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:14.770
 Before e and i, it sounded. In addition to Sardinian. So when most Italians read "vincere" in Sardinia, 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.580
 "Winning" is "vìnchere". The current pronunciation of Romance is another topic, but historical linguistics 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.180
 Said that these languages ​​are secretly telling us, "Latin C always sounds like K, but most 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.120
 It has changed. They gave a thumbs up for Kunming. 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.909
 Look, little guy, that's why when the Romans said "conquer" 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:39.250
 They read ['wɪnkærɛ], and why Caesar's famous saying is /we:ni:/, /wi:di:/, /wi:ki:/(I come, I see, I conquer). 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.080
 Now when you ask to rebuild the voice, ask the pope to speak 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.749
 When you are like Caesar, think about the story of Latin living. This is just one part of the whole story. 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.040
 It’s amazing.
