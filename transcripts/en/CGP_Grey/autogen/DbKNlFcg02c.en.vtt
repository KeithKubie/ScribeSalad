00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Antarctica - the location of the South Pole, 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.040
 There are also penguins and 5,000 people in the summer. 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.280
 And less than 1,000 people in the dark winter. 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.940
 No one lives permanently on this continent, 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.700
 Who owns Antarctica? 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.640
 Things outside the borders, such as the seabed, the moon, 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.100
 The entire space is often regarded as the "common heritage of mankind." 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.340
 It does not belong to anyone, but at the same time belongs to all, and is kept by us for transmission to the next generation. 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.160
 This is good, but the whole universe is ours. 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.220
 It may be a bit overdone, 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.540
 In the end, others may have a little opinion. 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.860
 But this is another story. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.220
 Human beings, doing well. 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.380
 However, things are never so simple. 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.780
 Because the document on the Antarctic is roughly called Antarctica as a common heritage of mankind, 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.960
 But there is no more in-depth explanation. 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.160
 The reason is the explorer in the 19th century 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.260
 Started to land in Antarctica and set the flag. 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.240
 And declare the right to occupy. However, these statements are a bit vague. 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.860
 Because in the civilized science tree, Antarctica 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.240
 Can't be colonized. However, like the Monopoly game, 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.480
 The best colonial strategy is to occupy all the places where you landed. 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.500
 In the early 20th century, the British tried to declare the occupation of the entire Antarctic. 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.920
 Then she reduced her ambitions. 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.820
 Instead, only declare that the occupation of the coastal part that has been surveyed by the United Kingdom. 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.860
 France also stated that the occupied part of the occupied coastal part, 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.340
 The same approach was followed by Norway, as well as those of the Nazis. 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.880
 Later, the declarations of Argentina and Chile occupied the overlap of the region with the United Kingdom. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.920
 At that time, the powers had no time to manage this matter. 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.980
 But after the UK 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.120
 And her independent colonies finally began to deal with this matter. 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.980
 This led to a mess of declared occupations on Antarctica. 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.360
 Especially in a dangerous era where there should be no major territorial disputes. 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.380
 The United States and the Soviet Union respectively 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.260
 Grant yourself a declaration of occupation on Antarctica 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.820
 The right, but neither party will make a statement immediately, but delay the decision. 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.360
 Under this premise, in 1959, the United States, the Soviet Union, and 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.700
 The other ten countries are Argentina, Australia, Belgium, 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.280
 Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.200
 South Africa and the United Kingdom have unusually succeeded in creating a treaty to ease tensions among nations. 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.240
 Marked on the treaty in Antarctica 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.620
 Military activities, mining and nuclear tests are not allowed. 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.820
 This Antarctic document is the first in the Cold War. 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.400
 Disarmament treaty for science and nature 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.000
 And the conservation of Antarctica. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.040
 By the way, because Antarctica is a nature conservation area, 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.560
 There is a rule about garbage - "Never leave anything behind," 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.600
 It is "anything." If you arrive in Antarctica in the summer, 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.580
 You will be leaving with your own stool in the winter. 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.800
 So this treaty looks very good, but "common heritage" 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.280
 What is wrong with this line? 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.040
 Well, no one actually gave up their declared occupied area on Antarctica. 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.740
 Because the only way for everyone to sign a treaty is 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.440
 Added this article to avoid the problem. 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.940
 Countries that basically sign the treaty will "like" 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.740
 Antarctica is treated as a "common heritage of mankind" without the right to occupy, 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.820
 But there is no country in law. 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.800
 Abandoned the occupation, so the map of Antarctica 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.080
 It usually includes the areas that are claimed to be occupied. 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.640
 This blank area is completely unoccupied. 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.400
 Make it the largest unmanned area on the planet, 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.100
 At least until now. 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.420
 Now no longer like the colonial era of the past, all countries have technology, 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.100
 Allow them to build a permanent base on duty in Antarctica. 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.540
 It’s just that countries happen to build their bases in 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.380
 There is no clear answer to the territorial disputes in the occupied territories. 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.220
 According to the treaty, Antarctica belongs to everyone, 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.820
 But the treaty itself has a deliberate loophole. 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.240
 So Antarctica exists in this area of ​​true and false occupation. 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.260
 Strange state. Some countries are in their own "occupied areas" 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
 Construction bases, and some countries that do not have an "occupied area" in Antarctica, 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.020
 For example, China has also built her base in Antarctica. 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.980
 Because Antarctica belongs to everyone, right? Everyone? 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.900
 These occupied areas are meaningless until 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.260
 The mining ban was re-examined in 2040. 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.100
 Oh, it’s very likely that there is a lot of oil under Antarctica. 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.260
 Not to mention that 70% of the world's fresh water reserves, 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.440
 Fresh water may become a very precious resource in the future. 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.300
 The United States and the Soviet Union...oh...Russia may use them 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.700
 The right to occupy the custody. However, until now, 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.220
 Antarctica still maintains the state stated in the treaty, is a 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.500
 A continent-level shelter for nature conservation and research. (IvanKT rough translation)
