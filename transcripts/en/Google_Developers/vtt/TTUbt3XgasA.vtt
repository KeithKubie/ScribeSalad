MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.500
Welcome to "Root Access," the
show on GDL about startups.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.470
My name is Martin Omander,
and I work for

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.920
Google Developer Relations.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.380
And today I'm joined by none
other than Don Dodge, fellow

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.190
Googler, longtime investor
and startup advocate.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.010
Today we'll deal with some
viewer questions, Don.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.300
And, by the way, thank you all
for your comments on YouTube.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.020
Keep them coming.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.970
We love the feedback.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.800
Don, we recently ran an episode
about how to get

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.910
funding and launch your
startup where we

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.610
talked about ownership.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.980
And Jacob Williams made a
comment on that YouTube video

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.260
saying that the preferred stock
split is to give one

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.080
third to each of the two
co-founders, and then another

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.760
third to investors.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.350
And that way, no one
can dictate to the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.870
others or make a coup.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.430
Is that how it's usually done?

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.830
What are you actually
seeing out there?

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.150
What do investors do?

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.950
DON DODGE: Well, I suppose
that's one way to do it.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.850
But if control is the issue,
that's probably

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.420
not going to work.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.860
First of all, as founders,
you start

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.000
owning 100% of the company.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.220
So as founders, you might have
two founders or three

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.130
founders, and you divide up the
founding stock in a way

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.400
that makes sense to you.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.380
So maybe one founder gets 40%,
and the other two founders get

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.480
30% each for 100%.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.310
So you start that way.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.300
Then, when you bring in
investors, they are going to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.280
say, all right, I'll give you
$250,000 for 20% of the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.310
company, or whatever.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.530
You might get $500,000 for
20% of the company.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.320
You don't know until you start
talking to investors what that

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.050
valuation is going to be.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.100
But over time, you get diluted
by taking on additional

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.150
investment.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.300
When a VC investor comes in,
they will ask you to set up an

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.200
employee stock option pool.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.900
That's typically 15% of the
company, sometimes 10,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.410
sometimes 20, but in that
range, 10 to 20%.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.600
So you set aside 10
to 20% of the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.570
company for future employees.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.420
So that's going to dilute you
down from your initial

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.680
position of 30% or
40% down further.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.030
MARTIN OMANDER: And dilute, so
you mean actually new shares

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.880
are created.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.220
DON DODGE: Right.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.020
So let's say you start out with
the company, and there's

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.390
1,000 shares.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.400
And you give 400 shares to one
founder and 300 shares to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.710
another founder and 300 shares
to the third founder.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.820
So that's the 1,000 shares.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.250
Then you bring in investors,
and you create more shares.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.460
So you sell a part of the
company, and you create more

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.460
shares to do that.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.260
Typically, the founders have
founders' stock, and then

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.940
there's common stock and
preferred stock.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.200
So founders get founders' stock,
employees get common

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.960
stock, investors get
preferred stock.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.150
So you create this new stock.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.930
That creates more shares and
dilutes your percentage

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.530
ownership every time you
sell more shares.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.670
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.160
So do investors care about
getting a controlling stake?

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.700
DON DODGE: Typical not, no.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.650
Angel investors, they invest
their money, and they care

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.670
about the valuation a little
bit, and the team mostly, and

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.310
that kind of thing.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.370
So they might put in $100,000
or $200,000.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.300
And they care more about
getting in early at a

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.370
reasonable low valuation and
then helping you build a

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.460
company up to a level where
you can go to VCs.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.060
Venture capital investors tend
to care more about percentage

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.000
ownership and not so much
control, but percentage

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.910
ownership, and not for
control reasons.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.080
They care about it for
return on their time.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.740
Because it takes the same amount
of time to make an

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.900
investment in a company where
you control 5% of it as it

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.730
does to make that same
investment where

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.060
you have 30% of it.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.890
So they're going to invest their
time and their money

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.240
where they have the most
ownership percentage for the

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.650
return on their time, not so
much because they get control

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.910
of the company.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.980
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.020
You mentioned on founders'
stock, preferred stock, common

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.100
stock, are those just words that
describe stock you give

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.620
out at different times, or do
they actually work different

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.640
and/or have different
legal implications?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.550
DON DODGE: Yes, they
are very different.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.220
So founders' stock, if you're
a founder, you get founders'

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.800
stock, and you own that 100%.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.100
So it doesn't vest over four
years or whatever.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.910
So the two or three founders,
they own 100% of

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.370
the company to start.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.660
And their stock is fully
vested and fully owned.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.210
Common stock is typically given
to employees in the form

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.200
of employee stock options, which
vest over four years and

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.910
has a strike price.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.080
So as employees come in, you
give them common stock in the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.500
form of employee stock
options, and

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.910
it vests over time.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.230
Preferred stock is for venture
capital investors.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.730
And it's called preferred
because it has some preferred

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.670
provisions in the agreement that
allows them to get their

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.260
money out first.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.920
So they have preference
over common stock

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.700
or founders' stock.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.190
They get their money out first
in the case of a liquidation

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.490
or bad event.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.650
They might also have warrants or
other types of preferences.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.140
So, yes, there are three
different types of stock, and

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.670
they're very different
legally.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.650
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.110
