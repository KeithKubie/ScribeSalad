00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.700
Let's talk about how to perform passive

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.710
Network Traffic Management. One way to do

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.160
this is using the Packet and Byte

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.120
Counters provided by the Simple Network Management Protocol.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.470
Many network devices provide what's called a

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.910
Management Information Base, or a MIB that can

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.680
be polled or queried for particular information.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.590
One common use for SNMP is to pull

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.750
a particular Interface on a Network Device. For

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.410
the number of Bytes or Packets that it sent.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.010
By periodically polling, we can then determine the rate

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.360
at which Traffic is being sent on a link

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.790
by simply taking the difference in these Packet

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.010
and Byte Counters over particular intervals. The advantage of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.500
SNMP is that it's fairly ubiquitous. It's supported on

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.750
essentially all Networking Equipment and there are many products

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.150
for polling and analysing SNMP data. On the other

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.860
hand, it's fairly coarse and you can not express

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.500
complex queries on the data. It's coarse in the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.910
sense that because we are just polling Byte or

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.250
Packet Counts on the Interface. We can't ask specific

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.120
questions, such as how much Traffic has been sent

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.710
by a particular host or by a particular flow.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.490
Two other ways to measure passively are by monitoring

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.700
at a packet granularity, whereby monitors can see full packet

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.750
contents or at least headers. Or at a flow level where a

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.265
monitor may see specific statistics about individual flows in the network.

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:36.700
Let's now talk a little bit about packet and Flow Monitoring.
