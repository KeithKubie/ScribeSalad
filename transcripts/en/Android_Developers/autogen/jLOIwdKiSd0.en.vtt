00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.000
 Rutland: We saw the 2011 opportunity 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.080
 When we noticed a great interest in the mobile world 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.000
 This is what prompted us to establish Hutch. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 We have a studio for mobile applications in London, 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.440
 Many members of the studio are interested in cars. 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.880
 We do not care about anything more than our interest in cars, 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.000
 Especially racing games. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.520
 Racing games in the past have been very skillful. 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.680
 We are looking for new ways to integrate players with different skills. 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.760
 We take all our toys from our own interests, 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.440
 We also put a lot of perceptions and models 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.760
 With game teams. 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.760
 Our task is to make the game available 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.160
 To the public as soon as possible. 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.680
 There is great importance to developers of pilot programs 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.040
 On Google Play. 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.560
 This is part of the tools we use 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.560
 With a view to enhancing the Group's decision-making capacity 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.080
 So we can then convert 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.240
 Our own interests to useful data. 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.080
 Scannel: Google Play lets you switch from a beta 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.680
 To launch at a personal level and then reach a world-class level, 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.680
 Get instant feedback from users, 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160
 This allows us to examine the actual data 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.560
 And prepare the best possible game for players. 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.240
 During the self-launch of MMX Hill Climb, 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.680
 Take advantage of our store listing experiments 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.560
 In testing the different colors of symbols, 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.240
 We discovered the best code that helped improve CTR 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.640
 At 20% in the Play Store. 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.520
 Rutland: MMX Hill Climb is a traditional and simplified game of contests. 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.640
 This game has great social features. 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.160
 Among the things we discovered through the A / B test 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.200
 That when we raise the level of difficulty at some point, 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.000
 Increases the retention level of the player. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 SCANNEL: Using the A / B test, we were able to test the stability of the vehicle 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.280
 We were able to follow the level of difficulty 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.640
 At the beginning of the game 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.800
 In order to improve the user experience 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.480
 And get new players. 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.080
 Examples of optimization 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.480
 We looked at how difficult a certain level is. 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.560
 We found that this particular level takes more than 60 attempts, 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.240
 This greatly exceeds other levels in the game. 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.640
 So we were able to focus 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.320
 At this level to reduce the level of difficulty 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.440
 Specifically on this level. 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.080
 Game statistics are very important 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.280
 Since they provide us with the possibility to get out of this place, 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.400
 When we create content for updates, 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.720
 We know what attracts players. 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.800
 Rutland: MMX Hill Climb exceeded 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.560
 3 million on Google Play. The time to interact with the game arrived 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.720
 To approximately 48 minutes a day. 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.320
 This game is user-friendly 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.040
 Which is really wonderful. 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.880
 Skanel: We can take advantage of reviews to know the problems 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.880
 Which may not necessarily be obvious in statistics. 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.760
 Reviews can be obtained from ideas for updating content, 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.520
 They are also useful in motion 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.080
 Clarify certain features in the game that have not been well explained. 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.200
 Rutland: Statistics are very important to us. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.280
 It helped us improve our users' experience for the first time 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.720
 In previous games, our level of standing value has also been raised to double. 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.840
 We are able to attract more than 10 million new players 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.240
 Via Google Play. 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.440
 We have increased profits 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.560
 Over the past four years has tripled. 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.880
 We also notice a continuous increase in the level of interaction. 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.400
 We are interested in the long term 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400
 To be the best destination developers can rely on 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.960
 In the best gaming industry. 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.360
 We are trying to create a dream studio. 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.360
