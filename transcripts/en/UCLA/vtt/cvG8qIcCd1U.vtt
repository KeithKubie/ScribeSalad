00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.130
I've been working over a decade with low-wage
working families.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.750
Above immigration, above housing, above healthcare,
the number one issue that is most important

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.000
to working families is the education of their children

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.600
The Parent Worker Program is a collaboration
between UCLA Labor Center and IDEPSCA.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.280
Specifically, our program Mujeres en Accion, our household worker project.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.570
The Parent Worker Project aims to support
parents who are household workers better serve

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.590
the needs of their kids.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.730
My mother is a domestic worker, so I know
this from the work that I do, but I also know

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.710
it in my personal life.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.370
Domestic workers are really interested in
participating in their communities

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.290
Parents are learning about how to get involved
in their children's education, how can they

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.890
be the agents in making sure that their kids
have all the opportunities that all children have.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.159
And while parents are learning those skills, their
children are also working with tutors from

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.159
UCLA.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:14.659
UCLA has been able to train UCLA students
that share similar backgrounds as these families.

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.000
So there's already that cultural connection.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.400
We had a trip to UCLA.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.269
Many families had never visited a university
in the US.

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.730
It was great because then being there with
their kids they could have a conversation

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.819
about the future.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.510
A key component of this project is for parents
to train other working parents around advocacy

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.040
to provide the best education for their children.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.819
When parents are able to participate in the
education of their children, the academic

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.000
outcomes for those kids are higher.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.049
When we started this project, 60% of the kids
in this area did not graduate from high school.

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.480
Those numbers are changing.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.120
It's a very empowering thing to see how their
parents are fighting every day to provide

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.259
an opportunity for them.
