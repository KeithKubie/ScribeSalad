00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The correct answer is consistency.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've gotten our database system--this whole group of machines here--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
operating in a state that is inconsistent.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The master has one view of the world,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and the slave has a different view of the world.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And we may have inserted some item into here,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and it got propagated to this slave,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but it hasn't quite made it to this slave.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So there could be some inconsistency there.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So that's an example of a loss of consistency.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Okay, we are now done with the vocabulary lessons,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and let's move on to some programming

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and see this stuff in practice.
