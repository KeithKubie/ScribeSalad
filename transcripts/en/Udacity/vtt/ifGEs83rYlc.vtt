00:00:00.668 --> 00:00:04.463
The fourth issue is concerned with a technical consideration,

00:00:04.463 --> 00:00:05.806
the use of callbacks.

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:09.055
A callback is an operation provided by the client.

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:12.104
When a specified event is detected by component,

00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:14.217
the client operation is invoked.

00:00:14.217 --> 00:00:17.181
Callbacks can be a powerful tool that components can be use for

00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:19.868
interacting with a client, but they come with a price.

00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:23.598
System integrity may be compromised during the time in which the client is

00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:25.030
in control.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.780
Here is the situation.
