00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.820
If you've implemented
app indexing,

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.650
you're getting all the
benefits of new users clicking

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.290
on app pages and installing
your app from search results,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.540
as well as your current
users returning to your app

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.160
again and again.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.180
But once you're there, how
do you know how you're doing?

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.740
You could, of course, enlist
your coworkers, your friends,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.050
or your family to do
searches on their phones

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.900
and see if deep links
from your app show up.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.490
But wouldn't it be
nice if you could

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.070
track where your app shows up
in search results, for which

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.850
queries, which content from
your app is most popular,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.290
or if there are any
technical issues?

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.470
There is a better way.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.590
My name is Mariya,
and I'll show you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.580
how to use the new
reports of Search Console

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.250
to get deep insights
on how to optimize

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.170
your app's performance
in search results

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.860
and get found on Google.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.400
By the way, if you haven't
yet implemented app indexing

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.090
and you want to
know how to do that,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.910
check out the developer site.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.180
It has the most
detailed information.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.690
Back to Google Search Console.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.490
It's a free tool
that shows you how

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.210
Google understands and treats
your content in search results.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.560
In fact, it's the best place
to look for top query, top app

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.300
page data, as well as for app
indexing and technical issues.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.460
To be clear, Google
Search Console

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.470
is different from analytics.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.620
If you imagine the
process of search

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.050
with the click as
the middle point,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.950
analytics typically
focuses on how

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.740
the user is behaving
after they click--

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.830
what are they doing inside your
app, what are they clicking on,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.540
how often they click, and so
forth-- whereas Google Search

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.900
Console focuses on what happens
before someone enters your app.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.070
Specifically, if you've
implemented app indexing,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.710
Search Console will
provide you a ton

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.890
of data about how users
are searching for, finding,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.612
and navigating to
content inside your app.

00:01:39.612 --> 00:01:41.070
It can even show
you the times when

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.490
your app showed up in search
but no one clicked on it.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.570
So let's take a
quick look at how

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.000
to use Search Console to improve
your app's discoverability.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.980
We'll use a recipe
app as an example.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.890
It's got a bunch of pages
which are already indexed.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.900
Are you ready?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.360
Let's go.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.160
Search Console shows a lot
of very comprehensive data

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.390
about your app, so we don't
just show it to anyone.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.920
No, no, no.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.790
You need to verify that you
are the owner of the app first.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.470
It's simple.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.970
You just need to enter Search
Console using your Google Play

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.620
account and add
the app from there.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.850
The Google Play account
is necessary to prove

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.860
you really do own the app.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.890
Now we can see
the app dashboard.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.100
It might take a day or two
before your app's data appears,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.000
and in the meantime,
what you can do

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.470
is connect your app to your
website inside Search Console.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.210
Associating your
site to your app

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.760
is necessary for app
indexing to work.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.080
Plus, it helps with
understanding and ranking

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080
the app content better.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.660
So now that we've finally
got our data, let's see,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.080
what can we do with it?

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.400
Remember earlier when we
were doing random queries

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.070
on our phone trying to see
if a deep link was triggered?

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.950
Let's look at how to
do that the smart way.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.940
The first and most
important thing

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.910
you can find out
from Search Console,

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.530
how well is your
app doing in search?

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.590
For a recipe app,
how can we find out

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.090
which are the most
popular dishes?

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.200
Every app developer has specific
business goals, a target

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.610
audience, and success metrics
to keep track of regularly.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.320
For our recipe app, we want
to increase the user base

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.670
and get more regular users.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.130
We're primarily targeting
English speaking users

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.770
on their phone in the kitchen
looking for something to cook.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.170
Who's actually searching for
and finding content in your app?

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.310
You can find out where
the users are from,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.500
what devices they're using,
and what they're looking for.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.690
The search analytics
report in Search Console

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.260
has all of this info.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.180
In search analytics,
you can immediately

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.460
see the top queries for
which your app pages show.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.010
There are also options to
filter by specific queries,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.630
by country, or by app page.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.170
For our recipe app, we recently
added a lot of salad recipes.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.200
So let's see if any
of them are actually

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.750
showing up for salad queries.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.930
You can add filters to
highlight only a type of query--

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.270
for example, queries
containing the word "salad."

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.550
In our case, we're
getting very few clicks

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.240
for salad-related queries
for the past month.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.470
Is this because they
don't show up in search?

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.880
Let's see.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.910
You can add impressions
as an additional metric,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.660
so you can compare
how many people

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.114
saw a deep link versus how
many actually clicked on it.

00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:14.000
Hm.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.360
It looks like salads are not
as popular as we thought.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.310
App pages from our recipe app
get decent impressions but very

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.180
few clicks for
salad-related queries.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.990
What is popular then?

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.100
If you sort by
clickthrough rate,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.460
you find the most
convertible queries.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.030
Summer desserts.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.590
Our app shows up a lot
for summer dessert queries

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.380
like fresh berry cake
and peach cheesecake,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.560
and people are clicking through.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.860
In this case, it
might be a good idea

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.080
to beef up the desserts
section of our app.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.950
Now, let's see which are
our most popular recipes.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.700
You can do this from
the Top Pages filter.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.880
Here again, it's useful to
compare your expectations--

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.430
which pages do you consider
most important-- with the ones

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.770
that people actually
search for and click on.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.780
If there is very
little overlap, you

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.870
may need to restructure
your navigation,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.490
or make the most important
content easier to find.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.530
Another thing to consider is,
have you provided deep links

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.550
to all of your app pages?

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.090
If we encounter errors while
indexing your app content,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.030
we won't be able to show deep
links for those app pages

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.460
and search results.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.100
So it's important to keep track
of new errors in Search Console

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.010
and debug the underlying cause.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.140
Here is our Crawl Errors report.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.490
You can find the type
and the number of errors

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.730
we've detected.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.430
Turns out our recipe
app has two types

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.960
of errors, content mismatch
and back button behavior.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.510
That's why app
deep links were not

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.970
showing up in search results.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.500
Content mismatch means
that the app content

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.100
is too different
from the content

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.020
of the corresponding web page.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.890
As for the back
button behavior, we

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.020
want to make sure people are
not trapped and can get back

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.120
to the search results.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.230
You can investigate
specific error types

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.300
to see a list of sample
pages with that problem.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.070
Let's take one of the content
mismatch errors from our recipe

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.280
app to see how to debug it.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.770
Each example app page show
its corresponding web page,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.580
the dates when we last
crawled both, also

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.390
step-by-step instructions on
how to fix the specific error.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.290
For content mismatch
errors, it's

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.330
really useful to see
your app page the way

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.290
Google sees it to
understand where

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.160
the mismatch is coming from.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.190
Try the Fetch as Google feature.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.660
Compare the rendered result
with the corresponding web page,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.060
and see what you need to fix.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.110
In our case, it seems to be
a pop-up window asking users

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.330
to sign in or create a profile,
which makes the render app page

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.160
content appear very different
from the web page content.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.240
Removing that fixes the
content mismatch issue.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.320
Mystery solved.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.430
We took care of the
app indexing errors,

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.710
and our app pages are beginning
to show up in search results.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.470
So now you know how to use
Search Console to monitor

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.470
your app for errors, and improve
your app's visibility in search

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.580
results.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.570
To get started on analyzing and
troubleshooting your own app,

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.630
add it to Search Console now.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.030
If you want to know
more about app indexing,

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.300
check out our developer
site in your next video.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.880
And don't forget to try
out the delicious lava cake

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.290
recipe in our app.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.500
Thanks for watching.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.850
