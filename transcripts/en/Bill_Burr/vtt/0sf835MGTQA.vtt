1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.010
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:07.011
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.250
March 28th, 2016 the year or the Yak,

4
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:13.430
whatever the fuck it is in the Chinese new year. I have no ideas.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.830
And that new year. Next, next, uh, next month.

6
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:19.710
How does that work with those people?

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:23.430
You know how to like, I don't, I don't get it. I just don't,

8
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:26.820
I don't understand why we're on standard and everybody else's on metric.

9
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:30.150
Can we just pick one fucking calendar, one unit of

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.100
measurement. You fucking go over to Europe. Jesus Christ metric.

11
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:39.840
And then some old guys talk. Hey, way fucking 20 stone,

12
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.720
20 stone. I mean,

13
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:47.190
I guess we're still saying horsepower. Jesus. Fucking, well, what size stone?

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.220
What are you fucking Free Mason? Um, she buddy in the Illuminati.

15
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.100
Is that where he said, now your little secret group,

16
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:58.590
you think you're going to make it buying up land on the AUC prefers?

17
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.450
Is that what you're going to do? And then what?

18
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.190
All the robots are gonna take everything over, right? You phase everybody out.

19
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:08.520
But, uh, except you and then you, you guys, you guys going to be good.

20
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:10.770
And then all the robots for some reason aren't going to turn on me.

21
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:14.940
Fucking movies you need to watch before you realize that they're eventually

22
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.030
going to turn on. You stuck out.

23
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.460
You made a fucking robot.

24
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.200
Now it's choking you off with your Dick and you deserve it.

25
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.680
Maddick glad you stayed ban on and later on, there you go.

26
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:33.000
There was a little Illuminati with a Lionel Richie and you're like that.

27
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.510
Um, somebody sent me this fucking video the way you might want to,

28
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.710
you might want to watch this thing.

29
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.410
And it was basically this person was talking about a,

30
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.600
we showing how the automobile put the horse out of business, you know,

31
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:48.120
which was so funny to me. Like the Horse was upset like,

32
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.540
Oh fuck you mean human beings are not,

33
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.700
aren't gonna ride on my back anymore guy at what I want. Now what do I gotta do?

34
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.670
I can't run free on the planes. Um, I guess the horse population dropped off,

35
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:03.480
but like nobody who was no one, you know, most of them are born into, uh,

36
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.490
I guess you really don't see horses running around do you can be on Wyoming.

37
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.200
Yeah. See a lot of cows at the waffle house. I'm sorry.

38
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.750
Well why would you do a fat choke bill this early and come on,

39
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.830
you're better than that bill. Hang on a second. We come on like this,

40
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.700
a certain standard of comedy. You gotta go that low. Yeah.

41
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.940
You got to check the broads and fat people all at the same time, that early.

42
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.810
Hey, you know, whatever, you got to shoot your way out of a slump.

43
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.270
That's my second attempt to get to Cinco.

44
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:38.820
And this is one of these times I'm recording the podcast.

45
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.320
Not because I'm feeling it,

46
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.370
it's because I have to because I got shit to do tomorrow. So a,

47
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:46.830
I got to kind of knock this thing out on Easter. So anyways, anybody,

48
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.320
if somebody shows me this fucking thing, so the guys shows how the,

49
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:53.880
the car put the horse out of fucking business and uh,

50
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.460
yeah, like I said, like, like the horse is upset.

51
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.040
It's like when you watch those weird commercials, we're like a,

52
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.220
the Mr potato heads are sneaking off to eat potato chips.

53
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.630
There's some sort of weird like undertones of cannibalism going on there and

54
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:09.130
it's supposed to be adorable. I don't,

55
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.400
I don't get those commercials on any level. Um,

56
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.410
but uh, totally lost my train of thought. Oh yeah.

57
00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:23.411
So they were basically showing how computers and everything being automated is

58
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.900
gonna phase everybody out and there's going to be this mass unemployment that is

59
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:33.550
coming. I'm like, this is fucking groundbreaking thought. I mean,

60
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.090
a dummy like me has been saying this for fucking ever. Right.

61
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.890
And he just kept going like, oh,

62
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:42.100
see you're in this industry where you're not safe either. You think you know,

63
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:44.710
you actually, you're a computer programmer. Well guess what?

64
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:47.080
You're not safe either, buddy. Just fucking relax.

65
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:51.730
And like he just kept coming with that tone and at some point it was just like,

66
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.770
well, you gonna fucking shine that light in yourself.

67
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.400
That maybe does by the end. I couldn't listen to him. What about condescending?

68
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.060
Douchebags who think they know everything? Narrating over these fucking videos,

69
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.140
you know with your big dude. I called it really our,

70
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.910
is technology in the future going to get rid of jobs? Yeah. I had no idea.

71
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:13.750
It's only been doing that since the beginning of fucking time and these fucking

72
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:18.751
people are just forever forecasting that the sky is going to fall.

73
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.360
This is the fucking thing. Eventually the sky will fall.

74
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.190
Nobody knows when it's going to happen.

75
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.520
Everybody's been trying to predict it ever since that fucking Nostradamus

76
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.680
douchebag all the way down to a moron like me.

77
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.590
And the bottom line is none of us know what we're talking about. Oh, lovely.

78
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.540
Mia.

79
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.540
And then on your pocket we'll get a microphone and a in a plug there in the A,

80
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.593
they're in the closet

81
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.230
till the bottom line is nobody knows when all this shit's going to end.

82
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:48.460
So just get fucking, go enjoy yourself. You know,

83
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.420
I just feel like this fucking, all this whole presidential election you get,

84
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.810
you got one Luna, it's in the cloud. It's on the closet at a top shelf.

85
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.920
You got one Luna tick on the fucking left, another Luna tick on the right,

86
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:04.900
and then you got this fucking, I don't know what she is in the middle, you know,

87
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.940
she's not really in the middle. She's just more of the same,

88
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.190
you know they're going to wait. They should just wheel her into the White House.

89
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:12.700
Like fucking handled electric. When I was in fucking mass zone,

90
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.050
he just went up to watch her awful fucking mouth. You need the plug to, oh,

91
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:17.920
I got the plug over here.

92
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.970
Let me hit pause so the listeners don't have to fucking listen to this shit.

93
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.720
And with that, the magic of the pause button, we were able to get by all that.

94
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:32.290
Don't you wish you had a pause button in life, Nia? I certainly do.

95
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:35.230
When all of a sudden some bad was going on. Like, you know,

96
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.500
I was in the middle of one of my long drawn out stories you could do.

97
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.000
I actually want to fast forward, wouldn't you?

98
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.420
<v 1>I felt that your listeners might need rescuing from that.</v>

99
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.110
I know.

100
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.880
Let me just bring it down because you have an agreement into the mic here. Yeah,

101
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.650
don't do that. Just have it. Just hold it down a little more relaxed. You know,

102
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.030
like you're sitting there with a drink in your hand.

103
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:58.340
You're always telling me how to use the microphone. Yeah, because you don't,

104
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.140
<v 0>alright, well fuck can use that. You want to use it then I got my own style,</v>

105
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:07.170
man. Yeah, you do. Yeah, you don't. You sound sometimes you sound like a fool.

106
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.460
You don't. One of the little kid answers the phone. Oh Wow.

107
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.090
Just pick up the phone. You know? It's like,

108
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.113
<v 2>hello.</v>

109
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.900
<v 0>You're like, Hey, what'd you do today? Do you have a good day?</v>

110
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.683
<v 2>Yes.</v>

111
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.260
<v 0>That's the hardest thing ever.</v>

112
00:06:23.261 --> 00:06:28.060
I just was talking to my niece and it's just like you gotta like you can't aunt

113
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.050
aunt. If you just ask them yes or no questions, you gotta be like,

114
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:34.990
what did you do today? He can't be like, did you have fun today?

115
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.800
Cause they want elaborate. Just go yes.

116
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.080
<v 1>You're like, oh fuck, I needed another question. Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.020
They're not the greatest conversationalist but oh there they're brutal interview

118
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.400
, brutal interviews. They just think that you always,

119
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:52.510
that why child actors are so creepy, you know like little kid.

120
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:55.240
Cause it's like you shouldn't be able, you shouldn't be this articulate.

121
00:06:55.241 --> 00:07:00.241
You shouldn't be able to just like elaborate in a way.

122
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.620
Cause you're a kid. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

123
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.480
<v 0>No it's, it's a combination that they talk like adults,</v>

124
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.020
they're making more money than you are and they're wearing that little talk show

125
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:11.200
suit, the whole thing. And they just feel,

126
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.540
and they just sit there and they cross their legs like an adult does when they

127
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.430
do panel and they'll just be like, you know,

128
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:18.310
so what was it like working on blah, blah, Blah and Greg,

129
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.040
oh he was great to work with. I've, I've, I've been a huge fan of his stuff.

130
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.580
Like I know for the last six years, my whole life basically,

131
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.660
<v 1>I don't think they should make little kids do interviews. I feel like that,</v>

132
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.750
I think it's one thing for them to do movies and stuff,

133
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.750
but I don't think they should be doing interviews and press and stuff.

134
00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:35.400
I just feel like

135
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.060
<v 0>that's weird. I don't think people should talk to little kids, period.</v>

136
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.380
Like no legacy, like little kids. I don't talk to little kids like little kids.

137
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.650
No, neither do I. And I think that that is a, like,

138
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.180
I think it weirds them out after the age of four to be like,

139
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.920
<v 1>oh, okay, you, oh, I'll do both.</v>

140
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.640
<v 0>So can you like, yeah,</v>

141
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.080
you don't like to remember and remembering young Frankenstein when he just goes

142
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.540
like, yeah,

143
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.420
<v 1>it is alive. I've never seen it. This alive</v>

144
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.660
<v 0>Frankenstein sitting, they look looking at him like, dude,</v>

145
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:11.850
what the fuck is you deal? No. Gene Wilder. Oh No,

146
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.480
he never saw that movie. No. Walk this way. You haven't touched your food.

147
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.333
Are you calling them?

148
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.710
<v 1>Yeah. Saying words you're caught in the movie and you have a pop cookie.</v>

149
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.100
No, no, like, yeah.

150
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.130
How have you never seen that when we was fucking hilarious at the one where he's

151
00:08:29.131 --> 00:08:32.800
always going Frankenstein. Yeah, cause he's,

152
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.020
I remember those clips but I don't, wasn't there some info? He's young.

153
00:08:37.021 --> 00:08:39.210
Frankenstein with Yahoo serious.

154
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.720
That comedian from Australia movie.

155
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.720
Well God knows I always fuck up the name. It's the one with Jane Wilder and no,

156
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.680
I think you're right. That that's the name of a gene wilder movie.

157
00:08:49.681 --> 00:08:54.670
But wasn't there something with Frankenstein with Yahoo serious? Am I, I dunno.

158
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.130
I don't know. There's like a wind

159
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.710
<v 0>tunnel where you're, where you're talking like I, you know what it is.</v>

160
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.750
Does it sound bad? No. Cause this is what you do.

161
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.870
You're up here and then you're down here and then you're here.

162
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.090
You're moving it all around. So what do I do?

163
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.940
You need a steady hand on that microphone. You see?

164
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.450
You don't move your hand at all. I'm, I'm pretty consistent. I just,

165
00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:16.300
I arrested like this, I arrested against my chest, my chest nickels. Okay.

166
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.180
So just like my mail, my mail pex here.

167
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.540
My Chester says it sound far away though if I do this. Yeah, it does.

168
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.930
How about this? That's fine. This is good. That is good. All right.

169
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.350
That's right. Then I just don't move and freeze for the next year.

170
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.440
<v 1>50 minutes. Well, I'm probably gonna leave soon. I just came in to say hi. Oh,</v>

171
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.890
okay. Well, I didn't know if you had any questions from, oh,

172
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:39.030
that hasn't come in yet. Oh, so where are you going on about Frankenstein?

173
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.820
<v 0>No, I was talking about the aluminum.</v>

174
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.710
This fucking video somebody told me to watch where it's just like,

175
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:47.430
this guy's just saying the technology and robots are gonna phase everybody out

176
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.600
and you just go, you know, oh, you're a milkman. You think you're safe.

177
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.390
Check out this fucking robot and everything. It's just like, yeah.

178
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.120
What about condescending dos bags who narrate videos?

179
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:59.370
Like they probably already have a robot to do that, right?

180
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.700
<v 1>Don't they? To do what? I'll tell you this to just narrate shit.</v>

181
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.460
They already have the fucking robot lady in the elevator

182
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:16.170
or even that's just a voice over that. Somebody can slowly please make a poster.

183
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.550
It's like a horror film.

184
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.520
And what did you say that weird robot lady in the elevator.

185
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.530
I want some fucking robot lady in the elevator.

186
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.660
I need to do a poster for a movie with your face looking.

187
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:30.840
Very concerned and there's like an elevator pressing.

188
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.320
She's in like every fucking elevator and it's like going up.

189
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:35.670
And then when she says going down,

190
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:39.730
she goes going down and she really [inaudible] like,

191
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.020
like your whole life is going in the shitter and I can't tell you how many

192
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:43.360
people,

193
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.510
<v 0>right. But on the elevator I go, I, it's so fucking depressing. I know.</v>

194
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.870
I hate it. It's not just me. Okay.

195
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.020
You know it's all of us out there in the Ramada, you know,

196
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.280
hoping they got that little waffle flippy thing down there for the continental

197
00:10:57.281 --> 00:10:59.920
breakfast. Those stale blueberry muffins,

198
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.040
those little bite size ones that for some reason give, give you a,

199
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.460
what do they call this? A little muffin top top.

200
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.700
Those things are like little grenades for your gut, for your belly. You know,

201
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.860
you just pop one of those in there and you come like, like homer Simpson. Yup.

202
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.690
Oh, you're going to do this. All right, let's get into the,

203
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:21.270
let's get into this part of it. Oh, I thought you were giving me Shit, Huh? Yup.

204
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.380
Just doing that shit. Let's talk about uh,

205
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.610
your, your little trashing that you,

206
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.130
you took like a seller level comedy seller level trashing today we were out to

207
00:11:33.131 --> 00:11:37.030
brunch. Ah, your mother in law.

208
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.020
My brother in law, my sister in law and you in Maine and we go out to,

209
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:47.260
we go out to a launch and you are the biggest sweetheart. You got your,

210
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.840
yeah, wonderful sense of humor. You're a cutie pie.

211
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:54.520
But when you talk to the waitstaff or just in general,

212
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.450
I still don't see it. Oh, and everybody that was in agreement, you have,

213
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.690
you put a little mustard on it. You have like a,

214
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.610
can you get your shit together or what?

215
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:05.860
Like how many times do I have to ask you the first time,

216
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.270
like when the lady came over

217
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.520
<v 1>and she goes, what did she ask you?</v>

218
00:12:11.521 --> 00:12:13.520
And I were sitting down while

219
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.240
while my mom and my brother were outside waiting for my sister.

220
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.830
So we went to get our table and she said, hi, can I get you guys in the drink?

221
00:12:22.831 --> 00:12:26.760
And we boasted waters and she goes, okay, I'm going to get you some appetizers.

222
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.330
And I said, we're just, we're waiting on three more. That's all I said.

223
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:35.100
But you make it seem like an excuse me. New had this tone of

224
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.480
<v 0>like, bitch, why would two people sit at a six top?</v>

225
00:12:39.481 --> 00:12:42.990
There's obviously more people coming. You had a little fucking,

226
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.570
and there were menus and they will menus that see there is,

227
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.680
and they were menus and it was totally, that's what it was.

228
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.100
The fact that there was menus there and she didn't do the math.

229
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.460
You just have this, well what the fuck's wrong with you?

230
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.263
<v 1>I,</v>

231
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.050
but I don't think that I'm a difficult person to serve in a restaurant.

232
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.030
What did you say? That I don't send things

233
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.840
<v 0>the way. The way that you do it, the way that you do it, it's,</v>

234
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.100
it's one of those fucking zingers. It's a tone.

235
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.500
So the person that you said something nice,

236
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:18.700
but there's a tone in there that makes a person a step and a half away kind of

237
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:22.300
cock their head like, well she just being a fucking asshole.

238
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:25.150
There am I like you are accusing me of being shady.

239
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.290
It's basically what it was and that's not my intention. I just, you do.

240
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.950
You do know though I not shady. Shady is like dishonest.

241
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.980
You're saying that that shady as in I'm being shady the way I'm throwing shade.

242
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.090
Are you going down

243
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:45.840
<v 1>and down? Um, I've, I just have, uh,</v>

244
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.940
I definitely have a little less patience than normal perhaps at a restaurant.

245
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.500
This is good. You gradually do feel that? Um,

246
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.820
I don't like it when they're not on top of things. That's all.

247
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.650
And I mean it wasn't just for me,

248
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:06.460
like my mom got her salad before she got her wine and the rest of us got drinks

249
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.360
and like, you know, me and my brother, my sister all had mixed drinks.

250
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.750
She had wine, like hers should've been the first thing that came out.

251
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:19.170
And then we all get our stuff and then she gets a salad with no one and I said

252
00:14:19.241 --> 00:14:23.260
to her, and she has a wine to the, when she brought over my mom's fat salad,

253
00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:24.430
I just said she has one.

254
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.940
I wasn't like my mom ordered one and she should've gotten that first.

255
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.190
I don't do all that. No, you don't go to that level. Yeah.

256
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:33.100
So what's the problem? No, you have a fucking tone.

257
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.910
I can't do it the way that you fucking do it. I just, I always look at you go,

258
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.330
go easy. Nia. Just fucking take a little off your fastball there.

259
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.090
You just had this fucking dude, your brother and agreed. Your sister agreed.

260
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.100
What am I never said. She pleaded the fifth she goes,

261
00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:50.770
I'm not going to get involved in this cause she does the same thing.

262
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.850
To be honest, I'm not trying to throw them off and that's what you want.

263
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.060
That's what your brother said.

264
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.540
What brother goes when your mother would tell I said that's where she gets it

265
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:00.560
from. Well,

266
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.660
I mean my mom definitely has been known to complain about food.

267
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:08.030
She bitched about the food in Italy. The funniest thing ever.

268
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.480
She keep saying don't keep

269
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.570
[inaudible] I'm just used to a sandwich that has meat on it. More meat,

270
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.030
more meat on it. No, I mean I think yes.

271
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.060
How hard did we tease her for complaining about food here? A lot. But then yes,

272
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:28.220
she could support about it, but um, no, I mean my mom has a tendency to be like,

273
00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:31.220
just to the point with people like that because you know,

274
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.580
I just letting them know, listen, this was the Sunday waitstaff,

275
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.560
this was the Easter Sunday weights that like I said, you're not getting,

276
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:43.670
you're not getting the waitstaff on Easter Sunday.

277
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:45.530
Like let's be real. Wow.

278
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.280
You're just so you're going in there with that attitude now this is all this

279
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:54.050
type of fucking predisposed thought and tone that guys like me,

280
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.620
guys like me then offend somebody. Cause somebody did a shift at, no, no, no.

281
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.940
I'm saying on Easter Sunday they're going to say that I'm saying that they're

282
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.800
not the creme de la creme, but if you had been in this restaurant, okay,

283
00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:06.440
so I'm not talking about you. If you had been at restaurant,

284
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.910
you would have seen just how it was a little off.

285
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.440
That's all. And I wasn't like throwing a temper tantrum. Being demanding here,

286
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.180
you have to have mandate.

287
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.680
You have this fucking attitude every fucking place we go.

288
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:28.460
When you order, you have, I'm always like easy Nia, just easy.

289
00:16:28.461 --> 00:16:31.580
Just all you're going to do. Just pump the brakes a little.

290
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.540
I just feel like they asked me what I want and I just tell them what I want and

291
00:16:35.541 --> 00:16:40.310
what I need. And I'm, the thing is when you order, I think you find,

292
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.420
but then it's when, when everything isn't chomp, chomp coming your way.

293
00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:47.270
You have a way of like, can we get some more bread?

294
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.330
Like please, like you have this, I can't,

295
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.890
that's yes, I lose my page. So you're fucking agreeing with me.

296
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.520
I agree that I have a low patience for

297
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.920
service that is not the quality that I feel this should be.

298
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.920
Yeah. For his. Yes, I'm crazy. I know. And if they fuck with your food,

299
00:17:12.921 --> 00:17:15.320
they're going to fuck with my food too. So it's just fucking,

300
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:20.470
the waitstaff has an unbelievable amount of power that you're not really

301
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.400
realizing to fuck with your life. I realized that I was a waitress.

302
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:29.720
Remember, I understand how it all goes down. I just,

303
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.370
and what happened to you at that job?

304
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.810
You got fired and here you are.

305
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.480
I got fired over some bullshit and they could never even tell me why I got

306
00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:47.660
fired. Okay. They were like, oh,

307
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.480
you told somebody that they couldn't have ice coffee. And I said, Oh,

308
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.320
you told me that we don't serve ice tea anymore because it's the fall.

309
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.160
And they're like, oh, but you still can have ice coffee. And I'm like, oh,

310
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.360
I didn't fucking know that.

311
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.440
And that was an example of one of the reasons why they fired me. Bullshit.

312
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.270
It was all bullshit.

313
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.260
<v 0>It was a little mustard. Yeah.</v>

314
00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.410
Little mustard getting slung around in that place. You know what?

315
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.020
You probably have the same fucking attitude.

316
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.190
The same lack of patience with the people ordering those fucking barflies.

317
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.050
Actually, no, you did a great job.

318
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:22.020
That was one of my favorite times when I was first getting the, yeah,

319
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.210
you should still work at this place. It doesn't exist anymore.

320
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:28.890
The all state cafe on the west side in New York and she used to work the

321
00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:32.220
lunchtime shift and I would come in as a fucking,

322
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:36.120
you know no name Magoo comedian. Right. So all my days are free.

323
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.750
My phone's not ringing. You'd come in every day that I was working with.

324
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:42.570
So cute. You come in with the New York pose, you come in with the paper,

325
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:46.980
I loved it. And you'd sit in the same booth and you get a burger. Oh Shit.

326
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.160
And I would say Rosa would come by to, Rosen would come.

327
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.070
Joe You looked at adorable. You looked at or people loved you.

328
00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.160
Then people that you, you got, you got the shaft there,

329
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.410
which I just brought that up for the shack there cause I had friends there.

330
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.920
But restaurants are just, they're weird environments.

331
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.320
That's the only place you ever got fired from.

332
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.250
And I remember how far you took that because every place else you've just gotten

333
00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:11.940
promoted, promoted, promoted. That's the only place. Yeah, you cried.

334
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.630
So I think maybe that's why you have that fucking attitude when you go in there

335
00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:18.990
because it brings you back and rather, oh, that's ridiculous.

336
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.630
Well then I didn't, if maybe you're just not a nice person,

337
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.390
<v 1>but now I get impatient at restaurants. I will cop to that. Okay, fine.</v>

338
00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.790
I cops are being impatient at restaurants.

339
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.810
<v 0>Well, do you remember when you were awake weighted waitress and people were like</v>

340
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.640
impatient with you? How did that make you feel?

341
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.610
<v 1>It didn't make me feel good. Okay,</v>

342
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.030
so the next time we go out,

343
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.880
do you think maybe I'll just let you order from me.

344
00:19:46.881 --> 00:19:51.710
How about that and making all my at school and traditional just like you like

345
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.850
that. Well, yeah, I liked it when there was defined jobs.

346
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.350
Defined gender roles, you mean? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Well,

347
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:05.630
I'll let you had this one made. It made a shrew to deal with.

348
00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.690
When you take me out to eat, it made it a lot easier.

349
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.320
What do you mean the questions just came in by the way. Okay.

350
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:17.350
One of them is skin infection. My doctor,

351
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.510
somebody I'm wrote you about Vega,

352
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.830
they were getting married or they're engaged in their fiance wanting to have a

353
00:20:24.831 --> 00:20:28.520
little mermaid theme wedding. Did you remember this question? Yeah,

354
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.290
yeah cause I got sent it to Andrew sent it to me to, um, it's a comment.

355
00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:36.680
I'm an obviously I'm late, but I just, first of all,

356
00:20:36.681 --> 00:20:39.170
I just don't think that's a real fucking question. I didn't either.

357
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.170
Are you okay, good. I didn't think it was real, but I was like,

358
00:20:42.171 --> 00:20:47.030
if this is real person would really like no 28 year old woman wants,

359
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.600
have their fiance dress up as who was it supposed to be? Nope.

360
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.450
<v 0>June. Um, you know,</v>

361
00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.940
<v 1>because that doesn't make any buttons sense because June is her fault would be</v>

362
00:20:58.941 --> 00:21:00.560
look a the little mermaids father.

363
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.130
<v 0>Yeah. I it just seemed like a chill dress</v>

364
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:08.210
<v 1>as Prince Eric and the fact that you didn't know that just proves that you lied</v>

365
00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.210
because a girl who's really into little mermaid like I am,

366
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.770
would know that those are the facts.

367
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.580
<v 0>Well, maybe they're just talking about, okay, here we go. Bazaar,</v>

368
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:21.240
13 most bizarre and unusual wedding themes. All right,

369
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.380
here we go. Look, these people are dressed up like fucking monsters. All right.

370
00:21:25.381 --> 00:21:29.910
Look at these other both dress zombies. Yeah. No, this isn't really,

371
00:21:29.911 --> 00:21:32.610
this isn't good for the podcast. People can't see what we're talking about.

372
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.220
Yeah, well we can comment on it. I can. You have a little faith in me. Jesus.

373
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.350
Stop treating me like a waiter.

374
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

375
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.120
<v 0>Having your wedding at a, at a department store.</v>

376
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.190
These people got married at TJ Maxx. All right.

377
00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:54.130
No comment. No comment. Oh, okay. Your entire party can be superheroes.

378
00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:54.561
All right,

379
00:21:54.561 --> 00:21:59.540
so here this is getting towards a little Neptune or whatever the fuck it was

380
00:21:59.541 --> 00:22:03.080
called. A Little Mermaid. Little Mermaid. Okay,

381
00:22:03.081 --> 00:22:06.110
so one was dressed like wonder woman. The other one's dressed like Batman.

382
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.670
How out of shape is the Batman? It's a loose fitting fucking Batman suit.

383
00:22:10.671 --> 00:22:13.610
He looks horrible. That's some shit that you regret later.

384
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.110
He looks like old Batman. Like you know when your skin loses the elasticity.

385
00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:21.440
Super Mario Brothers can smash it up at your weddings.

386
00:22:21.441 --> 00:22:23.870
That's a wedding cake of Super Mario Brothers wedding.

387
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:30.020
Just show up naked. [inaudible] okay. Now is this seeing this, this seeming a

388
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:36.610
wow. What? A bunch of fucking Weirdos. A roller coaster of a wedding.

389
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.100
People getting married on a roller coaster. Yeah,

390
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.740
I could see that jump off for bridge while you say I, do you get the metaphor?

391
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.510
Mia, is they hitting you over the head with the Arrow? Yes.

392
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.420
Uh,

393
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.770
make it so somebody has in their wedding ring to boldly go where no man has gone

394
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:57.310
before you. This is, this is, he's seeing the theme here. This is Shrek wedding.

395
00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:58.690
Oh really?

396
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.080
<v 1>Well, anyway, I, I thought the question said that the Dad Yep.</v>

397
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:08.020
<v 0>Thrown into a shark cage was not the dad, but like the,</v>

398
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.140
the groom was supposed to be dressed like Neptune and that just would not make

399
00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:14.570
sense unless he was all this comic con shit.

400
00:23:14.571 --> 00:23:19.160
All these fucking nerds try to find middle earth for the wedding of your dreams.

401
00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.690
Rocky horror picture show and a Zombie wedding.

402
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.310
I mean, it's just people out there that think that, that shit's cool.

403
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.670
I still thought it was a bogus question. I have. I don't fucking know.

404
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.290
What do I know? Okay. Um,

405
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.110
I was going to tell the story of seeing the old guy fall off the scooter.

406
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.530
I hope we sell it right. Jesus Christ. And you helped him though.

407
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.040
But what was I supposed to do? The first person there,

408
00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:49.290
the daily bird of the rescue fucking guy rolling down the street,

409
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.480
sliding on his face. Of course he fucked up.

410
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.620
He wasn't v at raspberries. He knocked himself out.

411
00:23:57.621 --> 00:24:01.250
He came around and he was spitting up. He was pulling out little bits of teeth.

412
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.980
And I don't know why. It was horrifying when I saw it,

413
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.800
but now I can't talk about it without laughing.

414
00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:11.450
It's just cause he was on a scooter. I had basically I was

415
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.730
on not going to say all the information cause God forbid the people that are

416
00:24:16.731 --> 00:24:17.730
related to them or listen,

417
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.430
it's so the fucking dude was like a Ah, fuck it.

418
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:27.200
I'll just tell the story. I didn't do anything I had just finished flying.

419
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.310
Does explain is like in tragic, why don't we know his way?

420
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.340
I had just done finished flying, right,

421
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.790
which everybody says is so fucking unsafe. Right.

422
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.130
Fly around and look all this cool shit,

423
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.730
fly over silver lake to see that they took the water out of it and even realize

424
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:47.930
that. And I came back, I fucking land, you know,

425
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.940
say goodbye to everybody and I'm driving out, you know, to the real scary thing.

426
00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:55.910
Driving down the fucking street and I literally pull out,

427
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.830
I make a right turn and I don't,

428
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:01.250
I don't drive more than 40 yards and I just see this fucking guy,

429
00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:05.420
just this old guy takes the turn to come onto the,

430
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:07.130
on the little two lane highway that I'm on,

431
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.070
he's on the opposite side of the road and he like,

432
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:13.190
he went too fast and I'm like a motorcycle. You can't just turn the front wheel.

433
00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:14.720
You're going to go down on a scooter. You know what I mean?

434
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.350
You've got to kind of look your way through the turn and lean and your momentum

435
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:20.450
momentum, you know, it's supposed to look through the fucking turn. He,

436
00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:25.530
he was going too fast and he went into the fucking island in the middle of it.

437
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.080
Bell, he fucking jumped the fucking curb.

438
00:25:32.081 --> 00:25:36.400
The whole fucking scooter went up in the and you high sided, right.

439
00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.900
He just gets launched off this bucket thing and he's rolling down the street

440
00:25:40.901 --> 00:25:45.610
like a fucking log. Why are you laughing so hard? Cause people falling down.

441
00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:49.060
It's fucking hilarious. He was fine. He didn't break anything.

442
00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.010
You just knocked himself out. He's a little because,

443
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.990
and then he wasn't wearing a shield and in the end he was sliding on his face.

444
00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.980
So I'm going, Oh shit. Oh Shit. Oh Shit.

445
00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.690
As I'm watching it and I fucking pullover. No,

446
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.550
I made sure everybody stopped and I got out. I was like, dude, dude,

447
00:26:05.551 --> 00:26:10.240
I just stay there. You're all right. You're all right. And um, and he was,

448
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.100
he wouldn't say anything and he has fucking raspberry on his face.

449
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:17.230
His pants were torn up.

450
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.900
He literally got fucking attacked by a wild animal and he's fucking late.

451
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.990
I feel terrible that this happened to him, but it's just afterwards,

452
00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.040
it's just funny. And he was laying there right in like one of his legs.

453
00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:31.220
He had like up, like he was chilling and the LN was just straight out.

454
00:26:31.221 --> 00:26:35.280
Like that is as like that. And he was like around and I was like, Oh man,

455
00:26:35.281 --> 00:26:36.870
I called nine one you find, you find,

456
00:26:36.871 --> 00:26:40.350
and then this lady shows up and she just kept going, don't move. Don't move.

457
00:26:40.351 --> 00:26:44.880
Okay. You're okay. Just don't move. You should have to keep going. Okay.

458
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.850
And it started annoying me and I almost started laughing like,

459
00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:48.720
I want to be like, lady,

460
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.980
like the way you're talking is probably worse than what the fuck is failing

461
00:26:52.981 --> 00:26:57.270
right now. So, uh, by then, you know, like five or six people had stopped.

462
00:26:57.271 --> 00:27:00.210
Everybody called to this ambulance shows up like, okay, thank God,

463
00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.600
and now he wants to get up. And we just kept telling him not to get up.

464
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:08.910
And um, the ambulance pulls up and he just goes, uh, he goes, does he all right?

465
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.640
Is he all right? You're like, yeah, yeah, he seems to be okay. You know,

466
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.250
we're not fucking doctors, but he seems to be okay. And he goes, all right,

467
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:16.830
just tell him not to move. I already have someone on this ambulance,

468
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.800
there's another one coming and then he gets the ambulance and drives away. Yeah.

469
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.910
And then we're looking down the street and we don't see any ambulance come and

470
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:26.460
we're like, what the fuck? And um,

471
00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.690
finally one at a cop finally came up and this guy was fucking priceless.

472
00:27:31.691 --> 00:27:35.410
He gets out right? Fucking horseshoe bald guy. Right.

473
00:27:35.411 --> 00:27:36.670
He's got the whole land in strip.

474
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.000
He just comes out looking like Sargent Riker from the rookies for anybody's old.

475
00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.630
Any fucking just comes walking. He looked, the guy from MIP blue,

476
00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.730
the old guy showed his ass with the mustache minus the mustache.

477
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:51.610
She just comes walking up and he just walks right up to the guy, Dennis frons.

478
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:51.911
Yeah.

479
00:27:51.911 --> 00:27:56.380
He just walks up like his toes are almost touching the guy's body and he just

480
00:27:56.381 --> 00:27:59.960
looks down at Amigos. Yeah. All right.

481
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.280
Okay. And the guy at that point is going like, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

482
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.990
And he goes, I know Daniel's going to be coming. Like he just,

483
00:28:11.991 --> 00:28:14.480
his level of just like [inaudible] and he must be like,

484
00:28:14.481 --> 00:28:16.880
people would be on fire every day. So this guy,

485
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.600
he just sees a scooter and this guy fucked up. He just like, yeah, yeah.

486
00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:23.630
All right. He also seemed way too old to still be in a patrol car.

487
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.360
So I think he fucked up somehow and got busted down.

488
00:28:26.361 --> 00:28:28.070
Or maybe he was on his way to some, uh,

489
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.370
senior police fucking banquet or some shit. And he's as I have,

490
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.570
I'm driving the cruiser. They know I'm a cop. I have to stop.

491
00:28:35.571 --> 00:28:37.280
So once that was fine, it was funny,

492
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.860
they were just standing there waiting for the ambulance. But you know,

493
00:28:39.861 --> 00:28:43.190
we gotta get on with that day and uh, me and there was this tall,

494
00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:46.970
older black dude standing there and this, he's just like that guy,

495
00:28:46.971 --> 00:28:48.680
man right here. And I was like, yeah, the heat. And we just

496
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:55.220
both got in a car and fucking drove away. And uh, it was really, you know,

497
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.290
it wasn't too bad. I mean, it wasn't too glorious scene.

498
00:28:57.291 --> 00:29:00.740
It was just a couple of raspberries and stuff. I didn't have a,

499
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.560
but it was serious injury. Oh yeah, absolutely.

500
00:29:03.561 --> 00:29:07.000
But it wasn't until I got on the highway and I started driving.

501
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.140
I started thinking about it and I just started laughing.

502
00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.830
I think it was just more than surprise that you saw it,

503
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.270
but there is just something

504
00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.010
just watching somebody get fucked up like that.

505
00:29:18.011 --> 00:29:20.740
I remember a time I was in Griffith Park and that dude came down the hill in

506
00:29:20.741 --> 00:29:23.950
street clothes on a skateboard. He went down that fucking,

507
00:29:23.951 --> 00:29:27.980
what are you serious dude? This kid hike. Will you hike up to the observatory?

508
00:29:27.981 --> 00:29:30.970
Somebody was going down. Yeah. Escape War. Yeah.

509
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:35.200
So I was just north of where the Greek theater was and this guy just went flying

510
00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.260
by and this thing and I was just like, oh my God,

511
00:29:38.261 --> 00:29:42.820
that guy is the shit like, and I'm thinking like, well how's he going to stop?

512
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.660
Cause this is just downhill to you get into traffic and all of a sudden his legs

513
00:29:45.661 --> 00:29:47.170
started doing that. What are the Dah Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

514
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.690
That wobbly fucking thing. And I'm like no fucking way.

515
00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:53.590
And I'm telling you this guy was going 30 miles an hour.

516
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.680
Then he just steps off the skateboard.

517
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.590
You always do that either one or two steps and then you're done.

518
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.430
He was going so fast, he did like one step and it was like,

519
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:06.070
who's that guy? Oh fucking jump 30 feet,

520
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.490
1969 nobody ever broken he fucking head first

521
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.970
flying. It was like the greatest study of his side. And he landed too.

522
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.200
And he started rolling. When I tell you this guy, this guy was rolling so fast,

523
00:30:20.201 --> 00:30:23.800
he was like a blur. He's like, here we go. Like you hit like his elbow,

524
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:24.940
which would shoot him in the area.

525
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:27.913
<v 4>Okay.</v>

526
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.240
<v 0>That the the best is when you're not going fast enough to keep rolling and then</v>

527
00:30:32.241 --> 00:30:36.650
you just slide in the same way all the way down the thing. And now

528
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:42.020
it was skateboard kept going and anyway, and he just,

529
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:47.480
he was just not moving and I was going like, oh my God.

530
00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:52.430
And he was so he started wiping out like 50 yards away from me and I swear to

531
00:30:52.431 --> 00:30:55.280
God I was a quarter mile walk to get where the fuck he stopped.

532
00:30:55.730 --> 00:31:00.510
And he was just laying in the road, not moving. Like I was like fucking dead.

533
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.340
He had, he had no helmet. I had street clothes on.

534
00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.990
He looked like he just came back from drinking and he just had like this

535
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:12.860
Harrison Ford, like Brown leather chair. He just fucking launched himself.

536
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:18.710
So I get up, so I'm getting close to it at this point. He's trying to set up,

537
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.510
he knows he's laying in the middle of the road and I finally seen his skateboard

538
00:31:23.511 --> 00:31:27.230
hit the curb on the other side, balls into a parked car and then he like,

539
00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:31.090
like crawled. He tried to stand up and he couldn't put any weight on like,

540
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.060
and he crawled,

541
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.750
he crawled over and sat down and by then I knew it was all right.

542
00:31:35.751 --> 00:31:38.450
So I was already starting to laugh, so I was just going like

543
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.930
doing that dude while laughing. I go, you are right. He goes, he's like,

544
00:31:44.931 --> 00:31:45.770
yeah bro.

545
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.330
And at that point I'm trying out the lamp. I was just like, dude, I go,

546
00:31:53.331 --> 00:31:55.880
that was fucking, it was fucking hardcore, man.

547
00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.920
I never seen a wipe out like that. If I was filming that fucking thing, dude,

548
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.780
it was the most fucking, it was the greatest log roll,

549
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.050
whatever the fuck you call that thing. That dude was just

550
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:10.763
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

551
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:15.810
<v 0>I know senior that I can't believe these shoes stayed on. Like, you know,</v>

552
00:32:15.811 --> 00:32:19.950
your shoes always fly off whenever you get hit real hard. Yeah. Oh my God.

553
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.680
Tremendous. Fucking tremendous.

554
00:32:22.681 --> 00:32:24.750
And it's just as much as you feel for the person,

555
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.050
that's just nothing funnier than watching somebody fucking wipe out if they

556
00:32:28.051 --> 00:32:32.520
don't die and you don't know him. Right. God, God, help me man.

557
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:36.540
Anyways, let me do a little podcast radio for some, uh,

558
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:41.160
for some of the advertising. Oh, it's advertising time. It's advertising time.

559
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.310
You do the question to actually ride. Yeah.

560
00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:46.340
I can get right to those things if you know, I just don't want you to start,

561
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.290
you know, talking to me in a certain way.

562
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.260
I was going to ask you what you wanted for dinner.

563
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:55.730
I'm starting to get hungry again. Um, something remotely. Oh, here we go. Oh,

564
00:32:55.731 --> 00:32:58.210
the advertising and wanna help me read some advertising you had.

565
00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.940
God knows I can't read out loud. They don't want me to read it. Well,

566
00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:04.010
I can't read this again. And she had the whole fucking,

567
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.760
am I supposed to read the whole menu? I'm not doing this shit. All right,

568
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.460
you're supposed to look at it before you do the podcast to be me.

569
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:15.410
I didn't get into this business to have a job. Blue Apron,

570
00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:20.090
everybody. All right, you need to know how to cook. Um,

571
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:23.660
not only do you feel like you know your way around the kitchen, honey,

572
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:27.980
but cooking at home means eating healthier and saving money instead of ordering

573
00:33:27.981 --> 00:33:31.070
expensive takeout again. But where do you start?

574
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.560
It sounds like an almost old school infomercials.

575
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.010
Somebody's like looking at all the pans and looks at the camera and shakes their

576
00:33:37.011 --> 00:33:40.340
head. Look, I don't know where to start. You turn on a burner.

577
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.440
You fucking jerk blue apron,

578
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.730
blue apron as you covet for less than 10 bucks per meal.

579
00:33:46.731 --> 00:33:50.180
Blue Apron delivers all the fresh ingredients you need to create home cooked

580
00:33:50.181 --> 00:33:52.910
meals. Just follow the easy step by step instructions.

581
00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:55.430
This is actually a cool thing. This is what I would definitely try that.

582
00:33:55.431 --> 00:34:00.170
Can blue aprons and awesome. No. Oh, okay. Neil,

583
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:02.030
we got too much shit. I'm trying to get rid of shit.

584
00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:04.190
I don't need a bunch of beltway friends hanging around.

585
00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.160
They send you food and a recipe card or you know, I haven't even finished this.

586
00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:12.230
That's what blue apron is. What are you talking about?

587
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.690
How do I know what this is? You're doing the advertising.

588
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.040
You don't know what Blue Apron is.

589
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.160
They send you the ingredients and then the rest of they suddenly the exact

590
00:34:19.161 --> 00:34:21.380
amount you need so you don't buy too much or too little.

591
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:23.450
Well then they should call it blue recipes, shouldn't they?

592
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.330
Maybe you do want me to read it.

593
00:34:26.331 --> 00:34:29.480
Each meal can be prepared and I'm just saying if I was young, right, and I was,

594
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.070
you know, dating or anything, that is a great way. Let's stay in tonight. Whoa.

595
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.950
We're a little blue paper. We can do that.

596
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.190
Each meal can be prepared in 40 minutes or less.

597
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.830
No overwhelming trips to the grocery store. Oh wait,

598
00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:47.090
no more sad takeout. Oh, look at the noodles.

599
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.510
No matter how. I love what they just have to shit on everything else.

600
00:34:50.511 --> 00:34:53.090
It's convenient. Why do you have to take grocery stores down

601
00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:58.400
no matter your dietary preferences?

602
00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:04.250
Blue Apron makes it a breeze to discover and prepare dishes like I am not

603
00:35:04.251 --> 00:35:08.360
reading all of these fucking things. At least read three. Let's,

604
00:35:08.361 --> 00:35:11.840
we'll do like a little like a Donny and Marie here. I'll read the first one.

605
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.780
Chicken Fried Chicken with what?

606
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.780
Have you not heard them. Chicken Fried Chicken. You have chicken fried steak.

607
00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:25.010
Oh, chicken fried chicken with baked sweet potato and quick collared Greens.

608
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:28.460
Oh look at him. Go shrimp.

609
00:35:28.461 --> 00:35:32.360
Poboy sandwiches with Tribeca bread locked in.

610
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.120
The fuck is striped back a bread. Maybe we should go to blue apron.

611
00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.770
Dot Steak and it for ourselves. Steak and eggs with Kimchi fried rice.

612
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.810
That sounds good. I love Kimchi.

613
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:48.110
It's spice catfish with Paez direct style rice and Creamy Saffron Aly.

614
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.140
Ooh, I used to be my stripper name.

615
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:57.330
Seared pork with sprinkler. Such an old jokes. Don't,

616
00:35:57.331 --> 00:35:59.900
don't turn off the a computer knock. Kamado come on, I'll look.

617
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:05.050
You'll hear a radishes and sugar snap peas Hash with ranch yogurt.

618
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:10.530
I haven't heard after the show. One word. Oh, radishes and sugar snap peas.

619
00:36:10.531 --> 00:36:14.970
Hash and I guess, yeah, Hash with ranch yogurt. Yeah, I speak the language.

620
00:36:14.971 --> 00:36:16.410
That sounds great. In your own kitchen.

621
00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:21.030
Cook with ingredients that you've never used before. Like watermelon, radishes,

622
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:26.070
Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Pharaoh and purple potatoes.

623
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.700
Appliques with purple potatoes. Oh, we need to go to the farmer's market.

624
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.140
Oh yeah, like every Sunday. And it was all those dirty people walking around.

625
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.750
Dirty people are just, you know,

626
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:38.820
you're talking about the vendors and all the lefties.

627
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.220
Even talking about like the hippie farmers guys,

628
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:47.240
all the man bonds to the fucking hair falling into the fucking Kimchi.

629
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.220
That kind of plays the way you could definitely buy a weed there and not,

630
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.130
I actually, I don't mind the farmer's market,

631
00:36:53.131 --> 00:36:55.160
but I hate how you have to get there. I just hate that. Hey,

632
00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.420
you got to get there early. You got to get the earliest like, do I,

633
00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:00.080
let me just go down the street and I'll just get the poison.

634
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.700
Oh and recipes between 500 to 700 calories proportion,

635
00:37:03.701 --> 00:37:06.510
delicious and good for you right now, you can get your first two meals for

636
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.230
free@blueapron.com slash [inaudible] that's [inaudible] dot com slash burger

637
00:37:10.231 --> 00:37:12.090
blue apron. A better way to cook. Actually,

638
00:37:12.091 --> 00:37:16.290
I like farmer's market because if they actually are local farmers,

639
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.210
I like to support them,

640
00:37:18.211 --> 00:37:21.240
but I know the corporate food has worked its way in there. You know,

641
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.920
they just take off corporate potatoes and they just write, hey man potatoes.

642
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:31.260
And then it's like me by him thinking I'm sticking it to the man. Hey man,

643
00:37:31.261 --> 00:37:35.820
potatoes only two this week near. Can you believe it? Great.

644
00:37:35.821 --> 00:37:39.570
I read these things. Helen's a great group. Uh,

645
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.470
right now it's not helix helix. Was that the name of the group? I don't know.

646
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:44.790
Give me an r.

647
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:48.870
O c c j what are you talking about?

648
00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:52.700
What you want to do? Rob Do Rocky.

649
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:55.890
You don't remember that song now? It was like a, I dunno what it was.

650
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:58.350
It was one of the most bizarre things and there was some reason they would dress

651
00:37:58.351 --> 00:38:02.380
like fucking, man, that sounds like an eighties thing. Oh, absolutely.

652
00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.730
It was an eighties thing. You know how old I was in the 80s I got what?

653
00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.090
I don't remember. Sorry. Yeah, but you know other things.

654
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.040
We're speaking of robots taking over everywhere.

655
00:38:11.041 --> 00:38:15.300
How can you have a can make a robot do what James Brown did? You can't.

656
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.470
You can't. You know what?

657
00:38:16.471 --> 00:38:21.471
But there's some fucking nerd trying to insert oppression in pain into a robot

658
00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:24.660
to see if they can give it a little bit of soul.

659
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.740
It's like x Mash. They start treating it worse than the other ones.

660
00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.890
Yeah, or ex machina or however you pronounce it.

661
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.660
It's like Helix night after night. I really feel like it's helix. Helix night,

662
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.370
half tonight. Two people lay in the same bod [inaudible].

664
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.130
but when it comes time to buy a new mattress,

665
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.300
only one gets their way until the end.

666
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.800
The fucking top until now.

It's tough.

744
00:43:24.371 --> 00:43:27.050
That's why I fuck around on him because I'm not going to have people subjected

745
00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:31.570
to my fucking reading out loud without, you know, if it's a funny train wreck,

746
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:34.540
like the way I read is like me watching that old guy fall off this scooter.

747
00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:40.540
Oh grandpa grampy did you take it too fast? Hey, guess what?

748
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:42.320
My Boston Bruins did teeth today.

749
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.370
Did they do something that's going to put them in the running to be in the

750
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:49.970
Stanley Cup finals? Uh, the playoffs, the playoffs last week, you know,

751
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.920
we will fucking, possibly could be a, you know, a bunch of shit had to happen,

752
00:43:54.921 --> 00:43:58.160
you know, basically the ranges in the capitals had to keep losing or whatever.

753
00:43:58.161 --> 00:43:59.540
And we could've gone past them,

754
00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:03.650
had been in first place in the eastern conference and then we lost five in a

755
00:44:03.651 --> 00:44:08.000
row. Okay. And today we, uh, we won our first one PB Toronto.

756
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:12.110
Thank Josh and breweries. Yeah, it was going to be a shit show.

757
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.430
We lost five in a row. We fucking lost a San Jose, Anaheim, the kings,

758
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.930
then the ranges and then the panthers and the wheels will fucking come and off.

759
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:25.610
And then, uh, of course as always brush around and shower fucking step up,

760
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.310
you know, for the, uh,

761
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:34.150
I guess the time gold and then the ahead goal and what's his face? Bless.

762
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:37.470
He got the fucking empty net or I missed the whole game cause we were at Brunch

763
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.200
and I was sitting there watching you looking absolutely gorgeous.

764
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:44.370
Treating the white staff in that way. You didn't want to go to that?

765
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.520
No, I didn't know.

766
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:48.930
I didn't want to go cause I thought your mom wanted to go to someplace where

767
00:44:48.931 --> 00:44:51.660
everyone was going to go and everyone was going to show up with their Easter

768
00:44:51.661 --> 00:44:53.460
hats and I was gonna be standing out in the sun with,

769
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.470
it's going to be a 45 minute wait.

770
00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:58.770
If you guys want to go down the street and get some drinks and then maybe come

771
00:44:58.771 --> 00:45:02.640
back, we'll give you this vibrating square. Yeah. And I don't want to do that.

772
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.290
And not to be that. No, it ended up being great. Ended up being great. Oh,

773
00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:08.740
by the way, I haven't even talked about it. Yeah.

774
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.890
I played the terrorist state or last night in Long Beach.

775
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.760
The place where a Richard Pryor did the greatest stand up special of all time.

776
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:18.150
I want to thank everyone that came out. I had such a great time,

777
00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:23.151
but for the first 10 minutes I was literally freaking out going like that's

778
00:45:23.341 --> 00:45:26.760
where he told the white guy, you know, sit your ass down. You know,

779
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:31.660
this is where he did. My monkeys died and I remember in the end when I waved,

780
00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:33.870
good night, I remember how he finished the set,

781
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:37.690
doing the woman having the orgasm and the whole place goes nuts and eating out

782
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:41.760
to say goodnight. He just waved. Ah. I started to watch the special,

783
00:45:41.761 --> 00:45:44.400
I had to stop watching it because I knew it would fuck up my set,

784
00:45:44.401 --> 00:45:45.510
but like it is,

785
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:49.680
if it is the definition of a comic who's just in a zone,

786
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.980
he walks out from the beginning to end.

787
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:57.450
It gives me like fucking goosebumps when I watched that special. To this day.

788
00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.900
He, he's the greatest. It's not even fucking close.

789
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:05.860
And I got to basically stand and do stand up and I just can't believe I've

790
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:07.590
watched that specialist since I was a kid. And,

791
00:46:07.591 --> 00:46:11.580
and you walk in and it looks the exact same where you drive in is where he drove

792
00:46:11.581 --> 00:46:15.930
in with his wife when they filmed the special and it all still looks the same.

793
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.250
And as I was walking in, I was getting like the chills and you just walk in.

794
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.690
It's like, there it is. This is, this is it, this is the place. And,

795
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:26.070
and at the end of the show, when I said, good night,

796
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.790
Dean del Ray came out and out, showed me in the spotlight,

797
00:46:29.791 --> 00:46:33.840
went on him so it wasn't on me. And so it wasn't in my eyes anymore.

798
00:46:33.841 --> 00:46:36.540
I could just see the spotlight hitting the tops of everybody's heads.

799
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:38.770
And that's the way I saw the theater, you know,

800
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:42.600
cause they didn't really show the crowd in that special. And, um,

801
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:44.490
it was just one of the coolest things ever.

802
00:46:44.491 --> 00:46:47.640
And then the night before I worked at theatre in Riverside, California,

803
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.960
that they actually debuted, gone with the wind. The first, you know,

804
00:46:51.961 --> 00:46:54.690
before they had the official premiere at Mann's Chinese theater,

805
00:46:54.691 --> 00:46:56.460
they wanted to make sure the sound was out right.

806
00:46:56.461 --> 00:47:00.750
So they just headed east and they, uh, they shot at, I don't know,

807
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.800
they fucking whatever.

808
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.680
They played the movie out there and I got to stand on those stages and it was

809
00:47:04.681 --> 00:47:08.150
fucking tremendous. And I want to thank everybody who came out. Um,

810
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:12.930
it was fucking amazing. It was fucking amazing. Yeah. Um,

811
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.100
and lastly, before we get into the questions is the, uh,

812
00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:21.210
the Lincoln Continental. All right. I talked to this, you know,

813
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.340
this guy who drove us,

814
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.790
we've got a driver to take us down to long beach because I knew it was going to

815
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.500
have a couple of whiskeys after that. You know, I was trying to be responsible.

816
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:33.670
So, um, you know, I, I was sitting there going like, you know,

817
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:36.040
I liked the Lincoln Continental. I hope they don't fuck it up.

818
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:39.460
I hope they make it fuck with the Mercedes Benz. You know,

819
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:43.180
like those really make this a nice car. Like fuck with the seven series BMW.

820
00:47:43.181 --> 00:47:47.170
I went to seem to be a nice fucking car and I was saying it'd be cool if they

821
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:49.990
actually brought back the suicide doors and the driver was going, yeah,

822
00:47:49.991 --> 00:47:52.810
they're doing that. The top of the line. One's going to have suicide doors.

823
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.870
And I went and I looked it up and here's a picture of it.

824
00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:01.270
How sick is that fucking car? That's very cool. Um, we're,

825
00:48:01.271 --> 00:48:05.560
I'm gonna post this picture and it's just the concept car. And as far as I know,

826
00:48:05.561 --> 00:48:08.470
they didn't fucking do it. Why wouldn't shit do that?

827
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:13.360
Look at that fucking pew that it's the second fucking shit ever.

828
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:18.250
Yeah. Look at that car. Yeah, I see. No, it's cool.

829
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.540
I'm looking at, hopefully you guys had just,

830
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.680
you're looking at the picture right now.

831
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:27.760
They even have like the trunk comes up and slides forward and then the bottom

832
00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:31.120
kicks out and they should fucking luggage. You can see it in real life.

833
00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:32.163
They can.

834
00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.170
We know what you have to do is you have to buy the car and then you got to take

835
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:38.590
it to one of these wizards out here and say you see that? I want you to do that.

836
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.610
One of those gas monkey guys. T tell him to fucking do that to the car.

837
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:48.790
Wait, what's this one though? I saw on the bottom this, this is a Lincoln. Yeah.

838
00:48:48.791 --> 00:48:52.690
This is what the led lights and in this one, the led lights like the,

839
00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:54.130
the Lincoln continental,

840
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:58.660
their emblem also lights up in led lights as fucking sick. That's nice.

841
00:48:58.661 --> 00:49:03.640
2017 Lincoln continental to replace 2016 Lincoln MKX.

842
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.710
Yeah. I'm either going to get that or I'm going to get that dodge Ram,

843
00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:13.450
our t s sport, like just the two door. No extra cabinet or that I just,

844
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:14.770
I'm such a Ford Guy,

845
00:49:14.771 --> 00:49:18.280
but I just fucking love the way the dodge Ram Hemi truck looks.

846
00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.970
One or the other. One or the other. But I'm going to get some,

847
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:24.720
I'll probably get the old man car. That's me. Right?

848
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:28.470
You're definitely an old man. Oh yeah. God Damn it. You know, but again,

849
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:31.270
I thought it was cool. I guess I'm like, all right, so here we go.

850
00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:35.310
Unless they fucked the car up and then I'll be right back to square one. Um,

851
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:36.863
look at this fucking guy.

852
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:39.303
<v 2>Okay.</v>

853
00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.400
<v 0>It's like, wait a second. You are addicted to Worldstar hip hop like this.</v>

854
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:49.500
Go watch these videos. Constantly do this. The funniest shit ever. So sick.

855
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:53.430
His fights, the funniest fucking videos. And then there's all this,

856
00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:56.780
all this rap shit that I'm never gonna fucking, I'd see that I,

857
00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:58.020
I'm too out of the loop.

858
00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.320
And I ended up seeing like I was the guy I liked to Trinidad a yes to Trinidad

859
00:50:03.811 --> 00:50:07.530
James James. Yes. The fucking, that guy's a genius. I don't know.

860
00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:12.750
So fucking G. Yay. Yes. He's totally different. You don't think he is.

861
00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.340
I've enjoyed a couple of his songs, but uh, whatever wouldn't go that far.

862
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.160
You didn't see the fucking video where they had the things in that either the

863
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:24.960
coolest shit they did that in the fucking, the openings of that movie belly.

864
00:50:24.961 --> 00:50:29.810
This is not like a new concept. Look, everything's been done.

865
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.060
You could do that to my echo. Are you being, yeah,

866
00:50:32.061 --> 00:50:34.010
he's treating everybody like a fucking waiter this week.

867
00:50:34.011 --> 00:50:37.040
I'm trying to give somebody a shout out who got fucked out of a record deal.

868
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:41.540
You know what I mean? You know? Unbelievable. All the,

869
00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:45.120
I get to criticize shit. I see that. All right, let's get onto the a,

870
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:49.190
the scope of the, uh, let's get to the questions here for this week. All right.

871
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:54.080
Daredevil dear Billy. Nunchucks uh, you know nunchucks are yes.

872
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.273
Bell.

873
00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.410
<v 1>That was it right there. That was it right there.</v>

874
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.090
You just asked me if I knew what nunchucks I just asked you.

875
00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:06.450
<v 0>Yeah. I can't even read out loud. I'm not judging you. Fuck.</v>

876
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:09.240
All right.

877
00:51:09.241 --> 00:51:14.241
Last year someone recommended you to watch a daredevil.

878
00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:19.200
I would like to reiterate that a year later, season two is the shit. Uh,

879
00:51:19.201 --> 00:51:23.610
the punisher fucks people up the way he should and you actually believe the love

880
00:51:23.611 --> 00:51:27.000
story. Tons of cool fight scenes. Watch it with the whiskey.

881
00:51:27.001 --> 00:51:31.060
Not sure if Nia would love it, but this one's, this one's for you. All right,

882
00:51:31.061 --> 00:51:33.510
I'll give it a shot. I heard it's really good. Well, let's, let's,

883
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.920
let's watch it. Let's watch it tonight. Okay. We'll watch it.

884
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:40.170
You want to have a whiskey with me, sir? Whiskey with old, frisky over here.

885
00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:45.450
Um, sorry. Skin infection. Oh,

886
00:51:45.451 --> 00:51:50.070
the question everybody has not been waiting for. All right, dear bill,

887
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:54.330
I was hanging out with this girl and I think she gave me a quote.

888
00:51:54.331 --> 00:51:58.860
Skin infection. Oh No, I haven't been with anybody else.

889
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.520
I confronted her about it and she said she didn't have any symptoms.

890
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:07.860
I am 100% sure I haven't been with anyone else. And I contracted it from her.

891
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:12.300
She's acting like nothing happened. And I didn't say I got it from her,

892
00:52:12.301 --> 00:52:13.860
but it's still kind of weird.

893
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.940
Should I take my chances and get back with her or move on?

894
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:20.570
What kind of skin infection they have

895
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.320
<v 1>means STD. He's just trying. I know. Okay. Um,</v>

896
00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:27.250
I was hanging out with this girl. I mean if you are,

897
00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:30.950
if that was the only person that you had slept with in like the last six months

898
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:35.660
and you didn't use protection and uh,

899
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:40.780
I mean as long as you told her just get treated and I mean that's up to you if

900
00:52:40.791 --> 00:52:44.180
you want to keep paying in this girl or not, but um,

901
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:48.980
don't keep banging this girl. Yeah, probably not. Especially if she,

902
00:52:48.981 --> 00:52:51.170
I mean cause the thing is she could at least be like, all right,

903
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:53.090
well let me go get tested just in case.

904
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:58.520
And then you can both be tested for everything and get treated for everything

905
00:52:58.521 --> 00:53:01.670
and that's all good. Yeah, go your separate ways.

906
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:04.430
This is how this thing starts off. Yeah. It's not good.

907
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:08.060
He obviously likes bagging or otherwise he wouldn't be asking this question.

908
00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:10.850
It must not be too many prospects on the horizon.

909
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.190
If this is what it's come down to

910
00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:16.850
<v 0>and I'll, I'll go the obvious one. She's really good at fucking that.</v>

911
00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:20.650
She's done it a lot. A lot of people I may maybe May,

912
00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:24.160
well maybe she got on and maybe she got unlucky. Maybe she just had the gift.

913
00:53:24.161 --> 00:53:25.310
I don't fucking know. Geez.

914
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:31.110
<v 1>Well I hope whatever you got is hero section. Go to the doctor and get treated.</v>

915
00:53:31.111 --> 00:53:35.430
He is protection. Like don't be an idiot. Stop raw dogging out here.

916
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:40.320
Okay. New Girl. No new car. Sorry. New Car.

917
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.550
That was like a Freudian slip. Like get a new girlfriend.

918
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.930
Get the fuck out of that thing. Oh Man. Dude.

919
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:54.090
Ah, that's brutal. Makes you happy to be married. Alright, new car.

920
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.800
Dear Billy Blue Book.

921
00:53:56.190 --> 00:54:00.390
I'm in the market for a new car like yourself.

922
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:03.420
I want to get something used, something with character,

923
00:54:03.421 --> 00:54:07.260
but my girlfriend thinks I'm holding onto the past and I'm trying to be hip in

924
00:54:07.261 --> 00:54:10.200
my own way. She wants me to get a facade.

925
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:15.240
What do you know how much of a creepy sell out I'd have to be to drive a

926
00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.820
pesticide out. Your thoughts? Sexy car.

927
00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:20.370
Why would your girl want you to get [inaudible]? That's some lame.

928
00:54:20.371 --> 00:54:24.120
I would want to see 30 man car. Not a fucking facade.

929
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:26.460
Keep all them a Japa plus that.

930
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:31.110
But I also fucking drive an eight year old dented Prius. I know, but you're,

931
00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:35.250
I mean I'm a frugal son of a bitch. Yeah. I think it's a little bit different.

932
00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.320
Why? Why is that different? Well,

933
00:54:37.321 --> 00:54:39.330
you didn't tell me to get the fucking thing what it is.

934
00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:40.200
You know what it is out there.

935
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:44.850
There's so many fucking men and women out there that that will derail your

936
00:54:44.851 --> 00:54:46.390
fucking dreams. Okay.

937
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:50.100
I wonder if she wants him to get a car like a paisano cause I feel like that's a

938
00:54:50.101 --> 00:54:55.101
reasonable safe car because she's trying to get you to save up for a ring or an

939
00:54:55.651 --> 00:54:59.990
apartment or something. Yeah. Look at that thing. That is not, oh my God.

940
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.050
That's as soulless as my praying ass car I've ever seen in my fucking life.

941
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:08.250
That is so blind. Yeah. Free isn't Lee's. It's like,

942
00:55:08.251 --> 00:55:12.570
what is that a Poseidon? I don't want this. Whatever.

943
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:16.320
I'm horrible in the fact that Germans made that Germans usually fucking crush

944
00:55:16.321 --> 00:55:18.180
it. Well then I'm sure it's very efficient.

945
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:25.500
Leave that one alone. Um, but other than that, I'm not into it.

946
00:55:25.501 --> 00:55:28.860
I think the bigger thing here is what happens to a lot of people when they get

947
00:55:28.861 --> 00:55:33.000
into a relationship is, look, there's definitely going to be some compromises,

948
00:55:33.001 --> 00:55:36.420
but like when your heart's fucking racing and you want to fucking do something

949
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:40.460
or the person you're with and you can see it like this is something they want as

950
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:41.500
something of a passionate saying,

951
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.910
something's gonna make them happy for you to try to fucking talk them out of it.

952
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:48.090
Like, why would you do that? She wants some rain. That's why.

953
00:55:48.091 --> 00:55:49.860
And she's trying to get him not to spend,

954
00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:53.550
I have to spend money on an older car that needs repairs and need this and that

955
00:55:53.551 --> 00:55:57.390
and the other when he could be saving for a ring. I guaran fucking see it.

956
00:55:57.690 --> 00:56:00.720
That's what you're thinking. I absolutely think, well, if he gets a used car,

957
00:56:00.721 --> 00:56:05.190
isn't that cheaper than going out and getting a new Passat? Uh, what,

958
00:56:05.191 --> 00:56:06.960
what is it? I'm, what do you want to,

959
00:56:06.961 --> 00:56:09.090
I want to get something used and then with character,

960
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:12.360
but things I'm holding onto the past and trying to be HIPAA Myoma.

961
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:17.710
[inaudible] having a little bit of style plastic car he must've plastic to means

962
00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.220
you have something like that. She wants get upset, right?

963
00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:24.870
She wants him to get a nice cost effective. Moderator, she is.

964
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:28.040
We're going to have a family and a house someday. A car.

965
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.790
That's what that's about. Read. Read in between the lines.

966
00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:33.100
Read in between the lines.

967
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:37.210
<v 0>I thought she was the dream catcher. You know Jane Catcher,</v>

968
00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:40.690
Jane Catcher is like your dream and this is my dream and then she catches it and

969
00:56:40.691 --> 00:56:43.780
she puts it in her pocket like a dream killer. Dream killer. Right?

970
00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:44.920
But you've got to catch it first

971
00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:49.720
<v 1>just so it's like an ant. You can't kill it much.</v>

972
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:53.350
You just decide that things are what you want them to be.

973
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.400
That a dream catcher is really what a dream killer is,

974
00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:02.050
but you have to catch it for catch you first. Catch it before you kill it. Okay,

975
00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:02.730
honey,

976
00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:06.150
<v 0>I live in my own little world over here. All right, magma,</v>

977
00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:10.050
magma. Okay, dear bill, have you heard,

978
00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:14.520
have you heard about the lonesome blues or have you heard of magma?

979
00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.260
I just saw them in la.

980
00:57:16.261 --> 00:57:18.900
They definitely sound like some sort of fucking metal band here.

981
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:20.250
I'd never heard of them,

982
00:57:20.251 --> 00:57:23.790
but went with a friend of mine who works in post production.

983
00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:27.870
The drummer is 68 and unreal. All right. I already loved this band.

984
00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:32.220
He plays a combination of Jazz and progressive style beats, tons of soul.

985
00:57:32.221 --> 00:57:36.630
The music is interesting and operatic. He invited his,

986
00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:40.020
he invented his own language and it's really out there.

987
00:57:40.021 --> 00:57:44.520
Please look some up and give your reaction on the podcast. Well,

988
00:57:44.521 --> 00:57:47.190
let me fucking do it really quickly. We're running out of time here.

989
00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:51.120
Let's see here. What do you think? You think you're gonna like it, man?

990
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:54.350
<v 1>Well, I'm curious about it. I'm surprised the dude I went to,</v>

991
00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.480
I went and I saw this crazy fucking band,

992
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:58.970
Bobby Lee's Bobby Lee's brothers in it,

993
00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:02.040
and I went and I saw this crazy fucking band like, I don't know.

994
00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:04.520
I got to the show late. I can't remember the name of the band,

995
00:58:04.521 --> 00:58:05.770
but they'll fucking Ho. Yeah,

996
00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:09.020
somebody tagged me in a picture you took with one of the band members.

997
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:10.340
I had the best time.

998
00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:13.360
They had this once to look them up so you can give them a shadow. Okay.

999
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.640
<v 0>Okay. I had the best fucking time. All I remember was the fucking,</v>

1000
00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:18.870
the closing song was,

1001
00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.960
was that the guitar was like really like thrash restaurants and the guy just was

1002
00:58:21.961 --> 00:58:25.040
going like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1003
00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:27.120
no. Was, it was just so ridiculous.

1004
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:30.210
It was awesome and funny and I was just going to let you should put that on an

1005
00:58:30.211 --> 00:58:33.870
album cover and then have all the lyrics like written out like, no, no, no, no,

1006
00:58:33.871 --> 00:58:37.680
no, no, no. Oh, they're French. Oh, they are magma.

1007
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:40.650
The weirdest band in the world. All right, let's, let's see. We got here.

1008
00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:49.453
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1009
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:53.910
<v 1>all right. I'm already in. I kinda like it too. I would go see that.</v>

1010
00:58:53.911 --> 00:58:56.970
That reminds me of the vibe out to this kind of stuff you always reminds me of.

1011
00:58:56.971 --> 00:59:01.370
I used to go see, I used to go see Oz noy down in the village. Who? Mas NOI?

1012
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:03.530
[inaudible]. O. Z. N. O. Y. Yeah.

1013
00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:07.080
He used to always have like will Lee would be down there and Keith Carlock would

1014
00:59:07.081 --> 00:59:11.350
sit in and you said all these insane drummers. Um, look at him.

1015
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:18.180
Oh my God. Oh my God. Yeah. I love it.

1016
00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:21.090
They all look a little long in the tooth. The actually,

1017
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:23.990
<v 0>these guys are all beasts. That guy,</v>

1018
00:59:23.991 --> 00:59:27.020
the bass player looks like the cop that walked up to the guy in the fucking

1019
00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:31.920
scooter. Yeah. All right. Oh my God. I love these guys. Um,

1020
00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:35.350
I'm man, let's speeding up. Oh, what's going to happen?

1021
00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:39.380
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1022
00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:40.880
<v 0>hang on. Why can't leave you here? Here we go.</v>

1023
00:59:43.170 --> 00:59:44.860
Let me fast forward so you don't have to sit through all that.

1024
00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:53.360
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1025
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.380
<v 0>dude, I would just, this is the, yeah, this is when it's asking weird.</v>

1026
00:59:56.450 --> 01:00:00.290
It gets all fucking night. Yeah, I'm in, I'm in. No, I feel like if there was,

1027
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:04.370
if we had our own version of the Andy Warhols factory or something like that,

1028
01:00:04.371 --> 01:00:07.940
like a big loft space downtown where we just had a bunch of our artists friends

1029
01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:09.050
and assorted Weirdos,

1030
01:00:09.051 --> 01:00:12.350
we can have magma playing in the background and it just would make a lot of

1031
01:00:12.351 --> 01:00:13.184
sense and we are,

1032
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:16.160
yes you could drown out all those assholes that hang around with people like

1033
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:16.994
that.

1034
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:22.710
I'm not an Andy Warhol fan on on any level or you don't like his like persona?

1035
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.781
No,

1036
01:00:23.781 --> 01:00:27.760
I respect the originality of it but I also just feel like a lot of it was smoke

1037
01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:32.780
and mirrors and it was very like that hipsters sort of sort of the rich God,

1038
01:00:32.781 --> 01:00:34.700
the original of like that hipster shit.

1039
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:38.630
Like am going to paint a soup can and like it's some sort of comment on

1040
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:42.080
capitalism and everything and it's just like, all right,

1041
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.820
but is it a really a deep comment on it because it's not moving me.

1042
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:50.930
I Dunno. I mean I like Andy Warhol, I like his stuff.

1043
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.820
I feel like that was a very cool time to be in New York City during that time.

1044
01:00:55.821 --> 01:00:59.120
I feel like I would have loved to been a part of that scene, but, um,

1045
01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.360
it just seemed to me like it was a bunch of nerds trying to be cool,

1046
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:04.400
pretending like a lot of hipsters to me.

1047
01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.680
I think there were a lot of misfits that found each other and they created like

1048
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:11.330
their own little world and they became cool because of that.

1049
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:15.500
That's what I think. All right. Because there's a bunch of like, you know what,

1050
01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:18.410
I'm transgendered people and just like, yeah, come and you,

1051
01:01:18.411 --> 01:01:20.240
and they're just automatically cool. Right?

1052
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.850
They're just automatically cool and you just listen to what I'm saying.

1053
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.800
Like there's no asshole transgendered people.

1054
01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.750
Can I explain to you what it was?

1055
01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:34.060
The bringing together all these different kinds of people and that was different

1056
01:01:34.061 --> 01:01:37.870
in New York City. It was like a whole birth of interesting,

1057
01:01:37.871 --> 01:01:42.550
like outsider perspectives and giving them like a platform and like you're a

1058
01:01:42.551 --> 01:01:47.260
freak and you're cool. No, I absolutely think so. Then like the, the uh,

1059
01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:50.320
what is wrong? Why can't, why if I have a different opinion,

1060
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:53.650
you gotta fucking get upset. No, it's not that you have a different opinion.

1061
01:01:53.651 --> 01:01:57.070
Is that you literally didn't even let me finish my thought before you just

1062
01:01:57.071 --> 01:01:59.530
hopped on that whole thing and that just makes you,

1063
01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.420
<v 2>I interrupt what I do. Fine.</v>

1064
01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:08.790
<v 0>You're taking this way through Searcy. Look,</v>

1065
01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:13.840
do I have any sort of artistic style of looking at me like I'm in a buffalo wild

1066
01:02:14.471 --> 01:02:19.200
wings. I'm going to sit here and criticize fucking Andy Warhol I,

1067
01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.630
Oh yeah. I took an on Elvis cover that somebody else already created.

1068
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.770
Then I painted red and blue stripes across the Warhol. Could it vary

1069
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.540
<v 1>easily made that poster. That's the kind of stuff that he made.</v>

1070
01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.720
Actually there is a poster of him and John Michel Basquiat.

1071
01:02:34.721 --> 01:02:37.510
That was kind of like some poster. Yeah,

1072
01:02:37.511 --> 01:02:42.400
like the kind of like battle of them boxing and stuff like that poster could

1073
01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:46.180
100% have been what? Andy Warhol date if you were famous back in the day.

1074
01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.510
That's all I'm saying. So you're saying it's not original.

1075
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:55.090
I'm saying the person that did that perhaps is not putting a head on something.

1076
01:02:56.610 --> 01:03:00.040
Was he the first guy that he was the first day I was Photoshop shit style to

1077
01:03:00.041 --> 01:03:03.640
that poster, which is really cool by the way. And like that's,

1078
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.810
it reminds me a little bit of what Warhol might have done.

1079
01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:11.880
That's all I'm saying. All right, well what,

1080
01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:15.760
we even went to a museum though, like, let's be honest, if I don't like them,

1081
01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:20.470
I really don't like it. Look at Princeton. If it's a bunch of old cars,

1082
01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:24.790
if it's painting old cars, if it's paintings, a cars, you know,

1083
01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:28.810
there's a big debate actually in the art community are automobiles works of art

1084
01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:29.920
and they,

1085
01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.090
and they took a Ralph Lauren's car collection and they stuck it in one of those

1086
01:03:34.091 --> 01:03:35.920
fucking stuck up museums there.

1087
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:41.920
Moma or whatever the fuck it is. Museum of natural history. The, the,

1088
01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.390
I don't think they put it in the museum,

1089
01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:47.130
<v 0>the fucking losing her on day vote on Fifth Avenue,</v>

1090
01:03:47.131 --> 01:03:51.510
whatever the fuck it's called. Every other fucking broad. I dated in New York,

1091
01:03:51.511 --> 01:03:54.660
that was always the first date. Like they, oh, let's go to a museum. It's like,

1092
01:03:54.661 --> 01:03:59.661
will you stop back and look your smart stop doing this just cause you're dumb.

1093
01:04:01.231 --> 01:04:03.990
Does stop trying to find abuse. Oh for fuck sake.

1094
01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.510
So let's just go out and get a drink and see if we can deal with each other.

1095
01:04:06.511 --> 01:04:09.750
I got to go fucking sit there and stand next to you in silence.

1096
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:14.880
Reading Shit above dinosaur bones. Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun.

1097
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:15.810
I'll meet you there.

1098
01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:23.020
<v 1>Um, no I don't like them. I don't like,</v>

1099
01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:26.020
<v 0>one of the worst museums I ever went to was when we went,</v>

1100
01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:29.200
we were in Vatican City and we should have gone to the right just to look at

1101
01:04:29.201 --> 01:04:33.030
that overrated painting on the fucking ceiling. We went to the and said,

1102
01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.860
can we just pause and I just ain't know what I'm talking about.

1103
01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:41.020
They know the Sistine Chapel, so fucking overrated.

1104
01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:44.440
The art that was in the Madigan, like this art,

1105
01:04:44.441 --> 01:04:48.160
that's like a hundreds upon hundreds. I'll tell you what now, like this amazing,

1106
01:04:48.161 --> 01:04:51.520
if I bought that building Oracle fucking art,

1107
01:04:51.550 --> 01:04:53.800
if I bought that building the Sistine Chapel,

1108
01:04:53.801 --> 01:04:57.340
I would turn that into a cigar room and I would let that smoke go right up into

1109
01:04:57.341 --> 01:05:00.580
that overrated. Do they make it seem like it's fucking huge?

1110
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:02.680
There's no way it took that long.

1111
01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.013
<v 1>Did bill</v>

1112
01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.360
<v 0>there and you looked at it for like five seconds and then you were like ready to</v>

1113
01:05:08.361 --> 01:05:10.820
get a fucking Panini. Oh Shit. Yeah. I'm going to tell you. Take him.

1114
01:05:10.821 --> 01:05:12.530
I'm gonna fucking guy. You know what he was?

1115
01:05:12.531 --> 01:05:16.160
He was like the original contractor. They said, hey, can you paint my ceiling?

1116
01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:20.080
Yeah. Yeah. This will be easy. I'll have this done in like three fucking weeks.

1117
01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:23.600
Fucking four years later. Yeah.

1118
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.320
They're fucking the green pages on back order.

1119
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.380
He's got 20 other sealants he's fucking working on.

1120
01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:32.290
Um,

1121
01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:34.930
you can't tell me when you went through the whole Vatican thing and you watched

1122
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:38.020
every fucking vestment that every God damn pope war,

1123
01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:39.730
like after a while you like, I get it.

1124
01:05:39.731 --> 01:05:41.950
They all wore these ponchos with a cross on it.

1125
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.090
I was fascinated by it because I love religious art. Okay.

1126
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:51.990
What about sexual assault? What about a fucking 800 pound gorilla? What?

1127
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:56.170
Did they have a little something about that in there? Yeah,

1128
01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.520
cause I kind of went, yeah,

1129
01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.370
well that would have ruined the year while it was an art,

1130
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:02.380
the way they hit all those pedophiles, all those years.

1131
01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:06.610
That's an art form and be moving all those chess pieces around while still

1132
01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:08.320
collecting the money and not paying taxes.

1133
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.570
What does that have to do with the art that we're talking about?

1134
01:06:10.571 --> 01:06:13.860
Saying at the Vatican? Well,

1135
01:06:13.861 --> 01:06:16.860
if I was to talk about a certain somebody Sitcom right now,

1136
01:06:16.861 --> 01:06:19.620
I think you would bring up some of his offstage behavior.

1137
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:27.160
Are we talking about Cosby? No, we're talking about fucking slappy.

1138
01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.393
<v 2>Right?</v>

1139
01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:36.760
<v 0>The priests, the ones that were painting the fucking Sistine Chapel Bill. No,</v>

1140
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:38.390
I taught, I'm not talking about that.

1141
01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:43.220
I'm talking about when we looked at every fucking fork and challenged that Pope

1142
01:06:43.221 --> 01:06:47.870
John Paul the fucking 58 when you go into the Sistine Chapel,

1143
01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:51.920
which admittedly I thought was this 16 chapel. Did you really?

1144
01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.200
You don't remember that we have staying alive. Remember I said,

1145
01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:57.680
you know what I would do, cause this line is so fucking long. If I lived here,

1146
01:06:57.681 --> 01:07:01.010
I would open a bar across the street and I would call it the 17 chapel.

1147
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:05.690
And you're like, why would you call it that? I was like 16 chapel,

1148
01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:09.860
the 70 chapel. And you just looked at me and your eyes narrowed and you said,

1149
01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:13.670
Bill, it's the Sistine Chapel.

1150
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:16.443
And I said, oh.

1151
01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.220
And that's my story about Rome.

1152
01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.133
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1153
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:29.890
<v 0>Alrighty. Fuck all you guys. All right. 37 years old, ladies and gentlemen.</v>

1154
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:35.920
Let's see what, well yeah, I'm not into that shit. Okay. You know. Okay.

1155
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:39.730
See that, look at you. You're an angel. You can see through my stupidity.

1156
01:07:39.731 --> 01:07:42.490
You don't have to be into it. I still love you. It's, you know,

1157
01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:45.610
good guy is still, you know what?

1158
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:49.870
But the reality is that there are certain things that are common knowledge.

1159
01:07:49.871 --> 01:07:53.080
I really should have known that. I would think so.

1160
01:07:53.081 --> 01:07:56.020
But I bet a lot of people think it's the 16th chapel.

1161
01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.040
You know something I don't, uh, I don't like,

1162
01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.660
I don't get embarrassed by shit like that.

1163
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:06.580
You really don't know if I think I would. Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was the 16th.

1164
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:10.690
I didn't know it was this thing. And then everyone, oh my God, it's assisting.

1165
01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:15.160
It's like, did, is anything in there from something that you created

1166
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:21.560
then shut up. What are you, oh, that was the Apollo 13 mission.

1167
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.400
Oh really? You will fucking astronauts.

1168
01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:30.260
It's just sitting in this diner with me getting fucking eggs, aren't ya?

1169
01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:34.470
And they're not the farmer's market once either. That's why you don't like the,

1170
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.331
the museums.

1171
01:08:35.331 --> 01:08:38.540
Do you feel like there is a pretension in people who like art and stuff like

1172
01:08:38.541 --> 01:08:41.030
that? It's too much fucking shit.

1173
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:44.520
It's too much reading and it's reading. Oh my God.

1174
01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:49.250
Ain't just keeps going and going and going. And then there's people whispering,

1175
01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:52.040
<v 2>I got like this up here to see this day.</v>

1176
01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:56.910
<v 0>That's what happened to me in this,</v>

1177
01:08:56.970 --> 01:09:00.920
in the Sistine Chapel when we walked in and I was just like, oh wow.

1178
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:01.860
It's kind of small. Anyway.

1179
01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:04.043
<v 2>Oh,</v>

1180
01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:04.430
<v 0>oh,</v>

1181
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:07.130
I want to put that guy's head right through the fucking stained glass window.

1182
01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:11.900
We were in a church, so it's like a holy place. So you know, you got to keep it.

1183
01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:15.170
Why we think they went on a certain level of noise to drown out the children's

1184
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:19.520
screen in the basement. Oh my God. They deserve it. Fuck them. Pieces of shit.

1185
01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:22.870
Um, we can't, we can't end up in that.

1186
01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.220
Why isn't the dog coming in here? I'm a little concerned. Oh,

1187
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:33.260
play out because she's a low Oh, poor thing. She's right there,

1188
01:09:33.261 --> 01:09:38.000
right baby. All right. That's the podcast for this week.

1189
01:09:38.001 --> 01:09:42.020
I'll check. Get audio. She was sleeping on Thursday.

1190
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:45.350
What's that? Oh, she was sleeping. Okay, cool. All right.

1191
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.000
She was just sleeping well, thank you for Ra hanging out on the podcast.

1192
01:09:50.001 --> 01:09:52.820
Thanks for having me, man. All right. I'm glad you came by.

1193
01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:55.580
I don't think those stories of people falling off shit would have been as funny

1194
01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.590
and somebody to bounce it off of. Oh, look who's here. Sleepy old gray bear.

1195
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.240
Yeah. Our seeing your dog. I know. We just realized that dog's is senior now.

1196
01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:07.580
She's eight, she's eight and a half years old.

1197
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:10.280
Starting to get a little bit of white and her face. Yeah.

1198
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:13.310
That made me sad and it made me happy. You know,

1199
01:10:13.311 --> 01:10:16.850
she had a rough first year and a half when she's just been fucking chill and

1200
01:10:16.851 --> 01:10:19.130
ever since a shit cleo.

1201
01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:22.010
She looks great though and she's still adorable.

1202
01:10:22.011 --> 01:10:25.610
She's still our little baby no matter what as well.

1203
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.270
I think she had to pay rent at this point. All right, that's it.

1204
01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.940
I'll talk to you guys on Thursday and once again, seriously man.

1205
