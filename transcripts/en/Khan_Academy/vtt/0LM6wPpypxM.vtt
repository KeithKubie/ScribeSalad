00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.890
We've seen a reasonable
number of acid

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.390
reactions and base reactions.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.160
So let's just write down a few
of them for review and let's

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.450
see if we can see a general
pattern here.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.630
And a lot of this might not
be any news to you.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.990
So if we have hydrogen flouride,
or if it's in an

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.110
aqueous solution it's
hydrofluoric acid.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.320
We know that this is a weak
acid-- it doesn't disassociate

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.850
completely.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.930
So it's in equilibrium.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.090
Some type of equilibrium.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.860
That doesn't mean the
concentrations are equal.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.110
This hydrogen disassociates.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.080
Actually, we know in reality,
it tags a ride along with

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.700
another water molecule
and forms hydronium.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.760
And then you have-- and, of
course, this is still aqueous.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.330
Everything is going
on inside water.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.090
And then you have left over
your fluoride anion, or

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.940
negative ion.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.650
And that's also in an
aqueous solution.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.000
And we could have rewritten--
actually, let me write another

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.210
reaction here, just so you can
see the general pattern.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.500
Let me write another
acidic reaction.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.720
Let me write ammonium.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.820
So that's NH4 plus-- it's
ammonia with an extra hydrogen

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.600
in an-- let me just write that--
in an aqueous solution.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.400
That can disassociate to one of
those hydrogens popping off

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.790
in an aqueous solution.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.120
And then you have
ammonia, NH3.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.190
That's also in an aqueous
solution.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.480
Now both of these describe an
equilibrium reaction, but it

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.110
kind of implies that we're
dealing with weak acids.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.360
You take an acid, and they're
producing hydrogen, which is

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.700
at least the Arrhenius
definition of an acid if you

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.560
looked at the Bronsted-Lowry
definition where they're

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.920
donating protons to
the solution.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.410
They're creating hyrdonium,
they're donating protons to

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.180
the water around it.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.330
But it kind of describes
it as an acid.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.940
But we know it's a weak acid,
so this reaction goes in two

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.370
directions.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.310
So we can write the same
reaction essentially as a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.050
basic reaction.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.550
So we can-- instead of saying
hydrofluoric acid is our

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.790
acid-- we could say hey, if I
just have a fluoride anion, if

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.140
I just have a negative fluoride
here, I could say a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.430
negative fluoride, if I put
that in-- actually, I keep

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.370
making that same mistake.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.290
The fluorine does not
have an l in it.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.520
I do that because
chloride does.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.690
Let me erase this.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.860
Hydrogen fluoride is HF.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.830
So it's just F there.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.440
Let me go to the
periodic table.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.910
See, I always confused fluorine
with chlorine because

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.490
F is just for flourine.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.780
But you get the point.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.090
OK.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.260
So I could rewrite the same
weak acid equilibrium as a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.730
weak base equilibrium.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.150
Or I could say a negative
fluorine anion in an aqueous

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.610
solution is in equilibrium
with-- and now we're saying

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.810
I'm considering this a base,
which means that it's going to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.800
increase the concentration
of [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.310
So what this might want to do is
it might want to grab some

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.240
hydrogen from some of
the water that's

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.290
in the aqueous solution.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:25.120
So it grabs some hydrogen and
becomes hydrogen flouride, or

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.010
hydrofluoric acid.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.680
Let me do that in that
magenta color.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.190
It's aqueous.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.210
And where did it get
this hydrogen from?

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.230
Well, it got it from one of
the surrounding water

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.420
molecules, which was H2O.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.540
Since it gave away one
of the hydrogens now

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.630
it's just OH minus.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.290
So the surrounding water
molecule is OH minus aqueous.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.680
Now these might look
different.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.750
This is donating a hydrogen to
the surrounding medium, and

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.940
then you're left with just
the fluorine molecule.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.980
Well, this is essentially
creating a hydroxide molecule

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.750
out of the surrounding medium so
it looks basic, but if you

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.390
think about it, these reactions
are the same.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.020
I mean, you could have just
gone in reverse direction.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.190
You could say, hey, this is
going to react with some

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.540
random hydronium molecule or
some random, free-standing

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.520
proton out there.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.730
And then it could form hydrogen
fluoride, but we know

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.020
that hydronium isn't just
sitting everywhere, that

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.570
whenever you take the reverse
reaction, whenever you're

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.500
going in this direction this
doesn't have to grab this

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.130
hydrogen from an H3O.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.840
It could grab it from an H2O.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.270
And then you would have
this reaction.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.500
These are equivalent.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:46.250
And we could do the same thing
here for ammonium and amonia.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.160
We could write ammonia
as a base.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.000
NH3 is in equilibrium as a weak
base with-- it can grab a

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.460
hydrogen from its surrounding
medium and become NH4 plus in

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.920
an aqueous solution.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.010
And then it would have grabbed
that hydrogen, probably from a

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.430
water molecule because that's
what's around it.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.230
And so that water molecule
will become an OH minus.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.470
And so now this looks ammonia
is a weak base.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.960
Ammonium is a weak acid.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.680
But these are equivalent
reactions.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.470
Now, you're probably already
seeing a relationship here.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.940
Ammonium is a weak acid.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.680
Ammonia is a weak base.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.570
And what's the difference
between the two?

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.810
Just an H.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.760
Hydrofluoric acid is a weak
acid, just a fluorine anion.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.090
A negative fluorine
is a weak base.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.580
And what's the difference
between the two?

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.870
They're just difference
of a hydrogen.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.880
Let me write that down.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.130
So let me write weak acid.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.235
And then you have
your weak base.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.150
So your weak base-- let me write
our weak acid is first.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.750
We had hydrofluoric acid, and
then the weak base is when you

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.930
essentially just dump
the hydrogen, just

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.320
the hydrogen proton.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.480
You kept the electron, so that's
why it's a negative

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.880
charge right there.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.180
Hydrogen without its one
electron is just a proton

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.010
because it has no neutrons.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:26.500
The other one was NH4 plus.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.150
You dump one of the hydrogens
and you get NH3.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.200
So what's the difference
going on?

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.160
These are all minus
a hydrogen.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.700
Or if you go this way, you're
plus a hydrogen.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.400
So you have these kind
of conjugates.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.800
And this has all been a
long-winded way of introducing

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.020
you to this idea that you have
these conjugate pairs.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.230
Like hydrofluoric acid, or
hydrogen fluoride and just the

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.960
fluorine anions.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.675
So these are conjugate pairs.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.960
Which are essentially two
molecules that are identical

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.070
except for a difference
in one hydrogen.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.860
No more than one hydrogen.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.720
One day there might be a test
where someone shows you two

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.070
molecules that are separated by
two hydrogens-- those would

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.940
not be conjugate pairs.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:28.980
For example, if I show you H2O
and OH minus, these are

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.220
conjugate pairs.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.660
Because this over here is
exactly this minus a proton.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.500
And, in fact, let me be clear
that it's not just minus the

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.850
hydrogen-- minus the proton.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.630
One of them is keeping
the electron.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.150
So this is minus a hydrogen
proton, this is plus a

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.160
hydrogen proton.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.420
So the difference between
these two are

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.320
just a hydrogen proton.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.730
So these are conjugate pairs.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:58.410
Now, if I were to say that H3O
and OH minus, you might be

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.580
tempted to say, hey, this is
very acidic, this is a base,

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.720
this is a conjugate pair.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.630
But no, there's a 2 H,
2 proton difference.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.160
This is H3O plus.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.980
There's a 2 proton difference,
so these are

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.815
not conjugate pairs.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.410
So let me just cross that out.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.510
But these are.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.200
Now, you could say, if you have
H3O, you might say, hey,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.650
what's the conjugate base-- and
that's a new word I just

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.350
introduced you to-- what's the
conjugate base for H3O if H3O

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.179
is an acid?

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:38.080
Well, you take one H from
it and you get H2O.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.510
So this is a conjugate pair.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.150
And I just said a word without
defining it, so now

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.050
let me define it.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.050
Within every conjugate pair you
have an acid and a base.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.740
And if you say, oh, what is
the conjugate base for

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.580
hydrofluoric acid, you get rid
of a hydrogen and you say, oh,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.350
it's just this fluorine anion.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.760
If you said, I have some of
ammonia, as a base, what is

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.310
its conjugate acid?

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.350
So if someone asks you, what is
a conjugate acid, you add a

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.980
hydrogen proton to it and
you get ammonium.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.280
So I could call these
the conjugate acid.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.590
Let me just change terminology--
conjugate.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.130
And we'll see that actually, you
don't have to be using a

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.150
weak acid or a weak base.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:31.070
Conjugate acid, and then you
have a conjugate base.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.440
And even though something might
be a conjugate acid or

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.340
conjugate base, it doesn't
necessarily mean that they're

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.740
very basic, for example,
or very acidic.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.870
If I have hydrogen chloride, we
know this is a strong acid.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.990
Hydrogen chloride.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.460
Its conjugate base, we
essentially just get rid of

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.090
one of these hydrogen protons--
it doesn't take its

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.480
electron with it.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.720
So it's just going to be the
chlorine negative ion.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.300
This is its conjugate.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.280
If I gave you a chlorine
negative ion and said, what's

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.640
its conjugate base-- what's its
conjugate acid? you'd say

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.880
it's hydrochloric acid.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.590
If I gave you hydrochloric acid
and I say, what's its

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.300
conjugate base, you get rid of
a hydrogen proton only, and

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.100
you're left with the chlorine
negative ion-- You said that

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.280
its conjugate base.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.410
Now, with that said, we know
that when you put hydrochloric

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.190
acid, we know this reaction.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.000
This was I think the first
reaction we looked at in

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.780
aqueous solution.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:37.140
It disassociates completely to
form hydrogen protons plus

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.230
chlorine anions-- everything,
of course,

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.840
in an aqueous solution.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.900
Now, the fact that it
disassociates completely, that

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.700
this is not an equilibrium
reaction, this implies that

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.170
this guy is more basic
than water.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.630
He has no temptation-- no, no--
let me say that he is

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.230
less basic than water.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:03.710
He has no temptation to grab
these hydrogen protons from

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.710
the surrounding medium to reform
hydrochloric acid.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.150
This reaction does not
go in this direction.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.990
So even though this chlorine
anion, or negative ion of

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:24.560
chlorine, is a quote unquote
conjugate base of HCL, that

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.790
doesn't necessarily mean
it's that basic.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.980
This is less basic than water.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.140
It wants the hydrogen
protons less

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.180
than, let's say, hydronium.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.890
So if you put some chlorine plus
some hydronium, or let's

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.880
say you have some H plus, you're
not going to reform

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.250
hydrochloric acid.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:50.260
So this is not really basic even
though it's considered a

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.620
conjugate base.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.760
And that's generally the case
whenever you're dealing with

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.920
strong acids, like in the case
of hydrochloric acid.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:05.610
If I had a big solution of just
chlorine anions in water,

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.550
so I just had tons of a super
high concentration of chlorine

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.420
anions and water, because it's
not going to do anything to

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.550
change the actual hydrogen or
hydroxide concentration in the

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:22.510
water because it's less basic
than the water itself-- it

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.050
doesn't want to take or give
anything to the water-- the

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.380
PH, so if you have a soup,
the PH would be 7.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.730
If you have chlorine minus in
an aqueous solution-- and I

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.440
don't care what its
concentration is, you could

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.480
have 10 molar of it-- the PH is
still going to be 7 because

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.700
it's not going to change
its solution.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.640
It's not going to change the
PH, just this by itself.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.970
Obviously, if you put
hydrochloric acid in an

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.400
aqueous solution this will
change it, because you're

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.390
going to be dumping all of these
hydrogen protons into

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.420
the solution.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.310
So in general-- I mean, you can
kind of remember it, but I

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:05.080
think it's maybe common sense--
a strong acid's

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:10.940
conjugate base is neutral
in water.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.160
Neutral.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.560
So that means no impact on PH.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:27.400
You say chlorine plus H2O, I
mean, you're essentially still

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.520
going to have chlorine
plus H2O.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.760
You're not really changing
the concentration.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.480
Now, on the other hand, when
you're dealing with weak

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.960
acids, so this reaction will
go in the other direction.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:44.690
If you put some fluorine in
water, it will grab some

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.710
hydrogen-- not necessarily a
ton of it, but it will grab

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.910
some hydrogen from the
surrounding water-- and

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.470
increase the hydroxide
concentration.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.500
It's increasing the
concentration of this thing

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.220
right here.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.990
So it is making, in this
case, it is making the

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.130
solution more basic.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.030
It's increasing the PH
of the solution.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:18.610
So whenever you have a weak acid
its conjugate base will

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:19.860
be a weak base.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.430
And you could make
this statement

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.560
the other way around.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.950
If you have a conjugate-- let
me switch colors, this is

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:36.710
getting annoying-- conjugate
base-- sorry, a weak base, its

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.560
conjugate acid is going
to be a weak acid.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.450
So hopefully you get
the idea here.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.650
It's actually not that
fancy of an idea.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.860
It's just that if you have an
acid, its conjugate base is

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.535
just that acid minus
a hydrogen.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.220
If you have a base, its
conjugate acid is just that

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.410
thing plus a hydrogen.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:05.440
Actually, let me just do a bunch
of problems here just to

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.640
really hit the point home of
what we're talking about.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.810
Let's just do a bunch of them.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:19.940
So if this is the acid and this
is its conjugate base, so

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.010
if I have-- I mean, you don't
even have to know the words.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.130
If I have that, the conjugate
base, well, I'm just going to

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.270
get rid of a hydrogen proton.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.300
So NO3 minus.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.620
I didn't get rid of the whole
neutral hydrogen molecule.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.950
Remember, I just took a proton
away, the electrons stay the

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.360
same, so I have a
negative charge.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.460
Let's say we did H2SO4.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.890
So its conjugate base, get
rid of a hydrogen.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.760
HSO4 minus.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:55.440
If I have hydrogen bromide,
get rid of a hydrogen.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.420
It's BR minus.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.150
And this is a strong acid.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.010
So this is going to be a
neutral-- if you put this in

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.440
water, it's really not going to
do anything even though you

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.720
are calling it hydrogen
bromide's conjugate base.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.460
Now, if we go the other way.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.420
If we give you the base, if I
give you OH minus, what's its

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.570
conjugate acid?

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.320
Well, you add a proton
to it, you get H2O.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.090
If I have H2O-- we already did
that-- you add a proton to it,

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.410
you get H3O plus.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.540
If you have-- I mean, we
could just keep going.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.880
Let's say I have that.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.090
If I add a hydrogen
to it, I have H2.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.640
There you go.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.550
And it's neutral now because
I added a proton.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.640
Anyway, hopefully I haven't
beaten this horse to death and

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.520
you understand what conjugate
acid and bases are all about.
