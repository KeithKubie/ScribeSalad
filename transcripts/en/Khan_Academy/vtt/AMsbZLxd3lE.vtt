00:00:00.194 --> 00:00:01.832
- [Instructor] Function
G can be thought of

00:00:01.832 --> 00:00:05.413
as a scaled version of F
of X is equal to X squared.

00:00:05.413 --> 00:00:07.463
Write the equation for G of X.

00:00:07.463 --> 00:00:08.995
So like always, pause this video and see

00:00:08.995 --> 00:00:10.880
if you can do it on your own.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.140
Alright now, let's work
through this together.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.344
So the first thing that
we might appreciate

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:19.780
is that G seems not only to
be flipped over the x-axis,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.391
but then flipped over
and then stretched wider.

00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:24.300
So let's do these in steps.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.037
So first let's flip over,

00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:28.787
flip over the x-axis.

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:37.637
So if we were to do this
visually it would look like this.

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:40.105
Instead when X is equal to zero,

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:42.003
Y is still gonna be equal to zero.

00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:43.513
But when X is equal to negative one,

00:00:43.513 --> 00:00:45.044
instead of Y being equal to one,

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.775
it'd now be equal to negative one.

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:49.312
When X is equal to one,
instead of squaring one

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:52.081
and getting one, you then
take the negative of that

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:53.998
to get to negative one.

00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:58.205
So when you flip it, it looks like this.

00:00:58.205 --> 00:00:59.980
Y when is X is equal to negative two

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.838
instead of Y being equal to four,

00:01:01.838 --> 00:01:05.804
it would now be equal to negative four.

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:08.346
So it would look like this.

00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:10.679
So as we just talk through
as we're trying to draw

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:12.532
this flipped over version,

00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:15.963
whatever Y value we were
getting before for a given X,

00:01:15.963 --> 00:01:19.718
we would now get the opposite
of it, or the negative of it.

00:01:19.718 --> 00:01:21.988
So this green function right over here

00:01:21.988 --> 00:01:26.311
is going to be Y is equal
to the negative of F of X,

00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:29.871
or we could say Y is equal
to negative X squared.

00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:31.634
Whatever the X is, you square it,

00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:33.221
and then you take the negative of it.

00:01:33.221 --> 00:01:35.216
Whatever X is, you square it,

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:37.289
and then you take the negative of it,

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.825
and you see that that will
flip it over the x-axis.

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:44.633
But that by itself does
not get us to G of X.

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:47.634
G of X also seems to be stretched

00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:50.126
in the horizontal direction.

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:52.105
And so let's think about,
can we multiply this

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:56.275
times some scaling factor so
that it does that stretching

00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:58.809
so that we can match up to G of X?

00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:01.389
And the best way to do
this is to pick a point

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:04.633
that we know sits on G of X,
and they in fact give us one.

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:06.967
They show us right over
here that at the point

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:10.195
two comma negative one, sits on G of X.

00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:12.563
When X is equal to two,

00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:15.768
Y is equal to negative one on G of X.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:18.966
So you could say G of two is negative one.

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:22.908
Now on our green function,
when X is equal to two

00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:26.072
Y is equal to negative four.

00:02:26.072 --> 00:02:26.957
So let's see.

00:02:26.957 --> 00:02:31.124
Maybe we can just multiply
this by 1/4 to get our G.

00:02:32.428 --> 00:02:33.261
So let's see.

00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:36.996
If we were to, let's
see if we scale by 1/4,

00:02:36.996 --> 00:02:38.935
does that do the trick?

00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:41.563
Scale by 1/4.

00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:43.863
So in that case, we're gonna have Y

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.767
is equal to not just negative X squared,

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:48.934
but negative 1/4 X squared.

00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:54.184
And if you're saying hey,
so how did you get 1/4?

00:02:54.184 --> 00:02:56.982
Well I looked at when X is equal to two.

00:02:56.982 --> 00:02:59.046
On our green function,
when X is equal to two

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:01.081
I get to negative four.

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:03.246
Well we want that when X is equal to two

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:05.103
to be equal to negative one.

00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:08.451
Well negative one is 1/4 of negative four,

00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:10.802
so that's why I said
okay, well let's up take

00:03:10.802 --> 00:03:12.123
to see if we could take
our green function,

00:03:12.123 --> 00:03:14.567
and if I multiply it by 1/4,

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:18.713
that seems like it will
match up with G of X.

00:03:18.713 --> 00:03:20.606
And so let's verify that.

00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:23.493
When X is equal to
zero, well this is still

00:03:23.493 --> 00:03:25.818
all gonna be equal to
zero so that makes sense.

00:03:25.818 --> 00:03:27.735
When X is equal to one,

00:03:28.572 --> 00:03:31.572
let me do this in another color,

00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:33.489
when X is equal to one,

00:03:35.475 --> 00:03:37.542
then one squared times negative 1/4,

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:40.746
well that does indeed look
like negative 1/4 right there.

00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:44.531
When X is equal to two,
two squared is four,

00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:48.698
times negative 1/4 is indeed
equal to negative one.

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:51.272
Let's try this point
here 'cause it looks like

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:54.732
this is sitting on our graph as well.

00:03:54.732 --> 00:03:58.399
When X is equal to four,
four squared is 16.

00:03:59.715 --> 00:04:04.022
16 times negative 1/4 is
indeed equal to negative four.

00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:08.341
And it does work also for the
negative values of X as well.

00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:09.354
So I'm feeling really good

00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:11.458
that this is the equation of G of X.

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:16.281
G of X is equal to negative
1/4 times X squared.

00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:18.529
And so in general, that
when we were saying

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.359
we were scaling it, we're
scaling it by negative value.

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.025
This is what flips it over the x-axis,

00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:27.805
and then multiplying it by this fraction

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:30.626
that has an absolute value less than one,

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:32.931
this is actually stretching it wider.

00:04:32.931 --> 00:04:34.850
If this value right over here,

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.464
its absolute value was greater than one,

00:04:37.464 --> 00:04:39.275
then it would stretch it vertically,

00:04:39.275 --> 00:04:43.442
or would make it thinner in
the horizontal direction.
