Speaker 1:          00:01          Cancer is not only a micro evolutionary process as with standard biological evolution, micro evolution is a process that produces a pattern macro evolution that we can study with molecular filing genetics. It turns out that the evolutionary history of individual cancers is longer than we had anticipated. Cancer fight [inaudible] do reveal some convergent evolution. The heterogeneity revealed by phylogenies is also pointing to problems for therapies that are targeted to single samples.

Speaker 2:          00:37          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:37          well I could or file a geography of brain tumors shows that multiple clones survive chemotherapy and that are occupying different positions. And this also points to the complexity of therapy. Analysis of phylogenetic trees of cancers revealed that therapy with NSA ids, nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs reduced the rate of acquisition of somatic mutations and that suggests why Nsa ids reduce cancer risk. We'll step through this. Here is one study of a number of patients who had pancreatic cancer. And what you see here is a phylogenetic tree sketched out running, uh, from old to young, from top to bottom. It starts with a normal epithelial cell in a doc in the pancreas. Tumor cells starts with a mutation. There was a process of clonal evolution in which the dark blue clones were eliminated by competition that results in a parental clone. What they mean here is parental for the metastasis yields down a set of sub clones that have metastatic capacity and they then go out from the pancreas and were recovered when the patients died in lung and liver. What could, how long that took. It took about 12 years for this process of clonal evolution to go on. Then about seven years for the sub clones to build up with metastatic capacity and from metastasis to death was on average about three years. Normally the cancer is not detected until this point.

Speaker 2:          02:21          Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:23          so we usually think of pancreatic cancers killing quickly, but in these cases it started at least 18 years before the patients died. So there was clonal selection and the diagnosis came too late. There was some local adaptation of the metastasis to the lung into liver.

Speaker 2:          02:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Another example of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. What you have here is the ancestor and the names that are given in the boxes are labeling the ways that we recognize the sub clones. So this is the probable ancestor and these are the origins of the different sub clones. They're from one cancer patient. The numbers of copies in the different clones is in front of the gene name. So for example, this is starting off with one copy here, two of these, one of these and two of these. And if you look down here, you can see a clone which is lacking any of those genes. So they've been deleted and they've also been deleted down here, but it's picked up extra copies of this gene. So there are processes of deletion and duplication, which is are going on, no single call replaced. All of the others there were had been repeated loss of copy number variants and two genes packs five and ETV six and that generated a lot of genetic heterogeneity, which hadn't in that case, been completely resolved.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Here's a case of renal cell carcinoma and this one is analyzed in great detail and it shows that there's been evolutionary divergence among clones that are persisting in that evolutionary divergence poses real problems for therapy. So a primary tumor in this case on the kidney sent metasticies into the long end of the chest wall. Both the primary tumor and the metastasis consistent of sets of clones. They weren't simple. They were genetically heterogeneous therapies that were designed to treat the primary tumor would miss the variation in the metastasis. So that would be an effective therapies designed to treat one metastasis would miss variation in the others. Normally this is done by taking a biopsy and the problem is that a biopsy would normally be coming from just one metastasis. So they were sequenced and what you can see here are you tations that are in different samples. So the samples are the roles and the mutations are in jeans, which are the columns and the ubiquitously mutations are the ones which are found in many different samples. Then there are some shared primary mutations which are shared among a few samples in the primary tumor. Then there are some shared mutations in metastasis. However, these are all of the private mutations over here. So these are found only in individual samples.

Speaker 3:          05:47          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:48          so gray is the mutation is present. Blue is that it's absent. The purple gene names are that the mutation was validated are these and the orange gene names. It's where validation failed. There were a few of those. The point of the picture is that in the cancer like this, this is a kidney cancer, this metastasized into the chest and lungs. There's such a huge amount of genetic variation that a sample from one part of the primary tumor or from only one of the metastasis is not going to give characteristics that could lead to the cure of the whole thing. It's too diverse, so this was another way to look at all of that genetic heterogeneity in that kidney cancer. Here we see a phylogenetic tree. The mutations that are ubiquitous are in blue and the branch length here is proportional to the number of non synonymous mutations. So it basically is a measure of how much selection is going on. The potential driver mutations are indicated by arrows here. The shared primary or mutations are along this orange branch. The shared metastatic mutations are along the screen branch and then the private mutations, the ones that are unique to individual clones are in red point here is that we need to treat the branches, not the tweaks. We need to be able to find ways of targeting things that are shared by all the cells that are causing the problem.

Speaker 2:          07:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:32          Another example comes from a Glioblastoma and this was a molecular phylogenetic investigation of a cancer following chemotherapy. The surviving population was not a single resistant clone, but there were multiple clones that had different mutations for resistance. Glioblastoma is a brain cancer,

Speaker 2:          07:55          okay?

Speaker 1:          07:56          Unless the treatments eliminated all of the clones, the survivors would persist and probably flourish. So again, a single biopsy of one branch will not be a sample that's sufficient to indicate the problems that are posed by a tree. There's another kind of a useful information we can gain about cancers using phylogenetic methods. So this again is the system in which Barrett's esophagus progresses to a soft geo with INA carcinomas. And here we're using phylogenetic inference to see how effective is therapy using nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs, anti inflammatory drugs.

Speaker 1:          08:38          In this case, we have individuals that are indicated by letters a through m and we can see whether or not they were on or off the NSA id and then look at the somatic genomic abnormalities per genome per year. So these are individuals who are being followed, they're being sampled. At some point they start getting treatment with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs. Samples are being taken from their Barrett's esophagus. And in those samples we are looking at what is the frequency of any kind of somatic genomic abnormality. So both point mutations, abnormal chromosome numbers and so forth. As this makes clear the drug reduced the rate of the acquisition of these abnormalities tenfold. So athlete inflammatory drugs or reducing the rates of mutation that lead to cancer. To summarize, molecular phylogenetics can describe the history of the evolution of a metastatic cancer in a single patient.

Speaker 2:          09:50          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:50          The evidence for cancer is a process of clonal evolution is now overwhelming.

Speaker 2:          09:57          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:57          Cancers originate earlier. They are older than we had expected. Single biopsies of primary tumors. Seriously underestimate the clonal heterogeneity of metastasis. The are diff. The heterogeneity is difficult to sample.

Speaker 2:          10:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:14          We have to, however, treat the entire tree, not the single branch that sampled in a single biopsy. Thus, phylogenetic inference is another tool that we can use to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic medicine for cancer.
