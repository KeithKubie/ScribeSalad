where does all moons come from and why

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470
where does all moons come from and why
 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:22.250
where does all moons come from and why
does gas giants not have gas moves wow

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260
does gas giants not have gas moves wow
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.839
does gas giants not have gas moves wow
that is a great question area Wow

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849
that is a great question area Wow
 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.019
that is a great question area Wow
first of all I was alive when people

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
first of all I was alive when people
 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.389
first of all I was alive when people
figured out or satisfied themselves as

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
figured out or satisfied themselves as
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.260
figured out or satisfied themselves as
where our moon came from and it's

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
where our moon came from and it's
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270
where our moon came from and it's
generally agreed that our moon was

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
generally agreed that our moon was
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.310
generally agreed that our moon was
created when the earth was hit with

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
created when the earth was hit with
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.040
created when the earth was hit with
another pretty big thing another

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050

asteroid and the impact was very hot

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
asteroid and the impact was very hot
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.090
asteroid and the impact was very hot
very hard and the energy of the Smashing

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
very hard and the energy of the Smashing
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.939
very hard and the energy of the Smashing
was converted to heat and both the earth

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
was converted to heat and both the earth
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.819
was converted to heat and both the earth
and the moon were hot and molten and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
and the moon were hot and molten and
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.760
and the moon were hot and molten and
they both cooled off and here we are

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
they both cooled off and here we are
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.490
they both cooled off and here we are

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.060
with this other separate thing in orbit
around us now why do gas giants not have

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
around us now why do gas giants not have
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370
around us now why do gas giants not have
gas moons is a great question and the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
gas moons is a great question and the
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410
gas moons is a great question and the
answer is almost certainly because of

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
answer is almost certainly because of
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.429
answer is almost certainly because of
gravity so when you have these little

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
gravity so when you have these little
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.859
gravity so when you have these little
things that spun off of let's say

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
things that spun off of let's say
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.469
things that spun off of let's say
Jupiter or Saturn they were too small to

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
Jupiter or Saturn they were too small to
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.700
Jupiter or Saturn they were too small to
sustain themselves as just balls of gas

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710
sustain themselves as just balls of gas
 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.520
sustain themselves as just balls of gas
the gas shrunk down gravity pulled it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
the gas shrunk down gravity pulled it
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.420
the gas shrunk down gravity pulled it
down and formed a solid thing whereas on

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
down and formed a solid thing whereas on
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.179
down and formed a solid thing whereas on
Jupiter and Saturn there's so much spin

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189

in the gaseous state or what we call
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.300
in the gaseous state or what we call
gaseous state by the energy that's

gaseous state by the energy that's
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.760
gaseous state by the energy that's
coming out of them whereas the smaller

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
coming out of them whereas the smaller
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.100
coming out of them whereas the smaller
ones cooled off so much that they turn

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
ones cooled off so much that they turn
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.800
ones cooled off so much that they turn
solid it's just a fantastic question

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
solid it's just a fantastic question
 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.039

Wow and maybe more will be learned about
 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.210
Wow and maybe more will be learned about
this and I got to tell you Ari it's very

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220
this and I got to tell you Ari it's very
 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.690
this and I got to tell you Ari it's very
reasonable in your lifetime we will send

that heat is radiated into space so

that heat is radiated into space so
 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.289
that heat is radiated into space so
there's a crust of ice but the water

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299
there's a crust of ice but the water
 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.720
there's a crust of ice but the water
underneath is kept liquid by the
