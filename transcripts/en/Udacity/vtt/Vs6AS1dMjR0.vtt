00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.692
I wrote some broken pseudocode too. It sets temp to n and then while temp is

00:00:03.692 --> 00:00:07.412
greater than 10, increments count which was originally set to 1 and then

00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:12.212
divides temp by 10. It was meant to count the number of digits in the number n

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:16.989
but it's not doing it. Help me debug this by hand-tracing. If n is 123, what

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:22.385
value does count end up with? What if n is 100? What should this loop condition

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.000
be to get the right answer in all cases?
