Have you ever experienced a time that you think that you under performed or

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.494
optimally performed because of your arousal level. For example, have you ever

00:00:07.494 --> 00:00:10.140
given a speech that you knew by heart, but when you were on stage, and you were

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.786
really nervous and all the caffeine you drank, made you really shaky, so you

00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:17.940
messed up. Something like that ever happen to you? Try to think of something.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.441
I'm sure there's been a time that you either did really well, or not so well

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.024
because, I don't know, you didn't get enough sleep, or you were too anxious,

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:27.145
things like that, and write it here. And this could also be a really good time

00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:29.760
for you to discuss this with your peers on the forums.
