00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:11.291
These are the first five elements
of a number sequence.

00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:13.031
Can you figure out what comes next?

00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:14.956
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:00:14.956 --> 00:00:16.030
Answer in: 3

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.818
Answer in: 2

00:00:16.818 --> 00:00:17.731
Answer in: 1

00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:19.358
There is a pattern here,

00:00:19.358 --> 00:00:22.053
but it may not be the kind
of pattern you think it is.

00:00:22.053 --> 00:00:26.171
Look at the sequence again
and try reading it aloud.

00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:29.251
Now, look at the next number
in the sequence.

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.882
3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1.

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:37.432
Pause again if you'd like to think
about it some more.

00:00:37.432 --> 00:00:38.393
Answer in: 3

00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:39.292
Answer in: 2

00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:40.451
Answer in: 1

00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:43.882
This is what's known as
a look and say sequence.

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:45.572
Unlike many number sequences,

00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:49.450
this relies not on some mathematical
property of the numbers themselves,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.471
but on their notation.

00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:54.312
Start with the left-most digit
of the initial number.

00:00:54.312 --> 00:00:58.693
Now, read out how many times 
it repeats in succession

00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:01.603
followed by the name of the digit itself.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:06.894
Then move on to the next distinct digit
and repeat until you reach the end.

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:10.103
So the number 1 is read as "one one"

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:13.588
written down the same way 
we write eleven.

00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:17.604
Of course, as part of this sequence,
it's not actually the number eleven,

00:01:17.604 --> 00:01:19.153
but 2 ones,

00:01:19.153 --> 00:01:21.804
which we then write as 2 1.

00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:25.414
That number is then read out
as 1 2 1 1,

00:01:25.414 --> 00:01:31.984
which written out we'd read as
one one, one two, two ones, and so on.

00:01:31.984 --> 00:01:37.765
These kinds of sequences were first
analyzed by mathematician John Conway,

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:40.744
who noted they have 
some interesting properties.

00:01:40.744 --> 00:01:46.125
For instance, starting with the number 22,
yields an infinite loop of two twos.

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:48.393
But when seeded with any other number,

00:01:48.393 --> 00:01:51.655
the sequence grows in some
very specific ways.

00:01:51.655 --> 00:01:54.895
Notice that although the number
of digits keeps increasing,

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:58.885
the increase doesn't seem
to be either linear or random.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:04.166
In fact, if you extend the sequence
infinitely, a pattern emerges.

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:07.568
The ratio between the amount of digits
in two consecutive terms

00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:13.105
gradually converges to a single number
known as Conway's Constant.

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:16.017
This is equal to a little over 1.3,

00:02:16.017 --> 00:02:19.941
meaning that the amount of digits
increases by about 30%

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:22.938
with every step in the sequence.

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:25.717
What about the numbers themselves?

00:02:25.717 --> 00:02:27.997
That gets even more interesting.

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.296
Except for the repeating sequence of 22,

00:02:30.296 --> 00:02:36.106
every possible sequence eventually breaks
down into distinct strings of digits.

00:02:36.106 --> 00:02:38.387
No matter what order these strings
show up in,

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:43.657
each appears unbroken in its entirety
every time it occurs.

00:02:43.657 --> 00:02:46.568
Conway identified 92 of these elements,

00:02:46.568 --> 00:02:50.286
all composed only of digits 1, 2, and 3,

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:52.238
as well as two additional elements

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:56.969
whose variations
can end with any digit of 4 or greater.

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.447
No matter what number the sequence
is seeded with,

00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:02.841
eventually, it'll just consist
of these combinations,

00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:08.539
with digits 4 or higher only appearing
at the end of the two extra elements,

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.969
if at all.

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.839
Beyond being a neat puzzle,

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.659
the look and say sequence
has some practical applications.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.759
For example, run-length encoding,

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:23.109
a data compression that was once used for
television signals and digital graphics,

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.647
is based on a similar concept.

00:03:25.647 --> 00:03:28.590
The amount of times a data value repeats
within the code

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.592
is recorded as a data value itself.

00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:36.029
Sequences like this are a good example
of how numbers and other symbols

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:38.700
can convey meaning on multiple levels.
