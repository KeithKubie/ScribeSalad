a very hopeful sign now we have to give

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
a very hopeful sign now we have to give
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.819

them a stable economy and figure out how
 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.810
them a stable economy and figure out how
they can actually develop and work with

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820
they can actually develop and work with
 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.400
they can actually develop and work with
them on that and I think that there are

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410
them on that and I think that there are
 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.620
them on that and I think that there are
other places which could be big

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630
other places which could be big
