00:00:13.844 --> 00:00:15.931
Your car,

00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.838
the heating system in your house,

00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:21.779
your gas stove.

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.706
Most of the energy you use

00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:25.392
comes from fossil fuels,

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.812
which present a couple of problems.

00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:30.528
First, there are limited supplies of fossil fuels,

00:00:30.528 --> 00:00:33.722
so the more we use, the less we've got.

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:36.085
And second, the use of fossil fuels

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:38.472
is the main cause of climate change

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.155
because it releases large amounts

00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:43.471
of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.620
Biofuels come from natural, renewable sources like plants,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.731
so they have the potential to reduce our reliance

00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:58.260
on those limited supply fossil fuels

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.133
and reduce the risk of climate change.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.512
Most biofuels today are made from corn grain

00:01:04.512 --> 00:01:06.553
that is fermented into ethanol.

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:09.003
But we have a limited supply of this corn,

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.599
so it's not a solution to the limited supply

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:13.354
part of the quandary.

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:16.879
It also takes a lot of resources to grow corn grain.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.099
Strike 2!

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:19.448
A potential solution:

00:01:19.448 --> 00:01:23.075
Using cellulose instead of corn grain to make ethanol.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:25.619
Cellulose is far more abundant than corn grain

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.205
and takes less energy to produce.

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:33.179
In fact, it's the most abundant organic molecule on the planet!

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.670
Cellulose is the main ingredient

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.461
found in a plant's cell wall.

00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:39.320
Plants generate cellulose from water and carbon dioxide

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.427
during photosynthesis.

00:01:41.427 --> 00:01:44.285
So, where as using fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide,

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:47.750
using cellulose-based ethanol might help remove

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.582
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.844
The main obstacle is that the cellulose molecule,

00:01:54.844 --> 00:01:57.595
a long, connected chain of glucose sugar

00:01:57.595 --> 00:02:00.013
protected by a tough, molecular sheath,

00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:02.098
is difficult to break apart.

00:02:02.098 --> 00:02:03.641
Creating cellulose-based ethanol

00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:06.143
means first unwrapping that protective sheath

00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:07.893
and then chopping up the cellulose

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:10.306
into its individual glucose molecule.

00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:13.025
Only once we have unpacked each glucose molecule,

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:15.027
can we begin fermentation.

00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:16.761
But some microorganisms,

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.428
like bacteria or fungi,

00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:21.178
break down cellulose for energy all the time.

00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:23.327
For example, dairy cows eat foods

00:02:23.327 --> 00:02:26.748
like hay or alfalfa, which are full of cellulose.

00:02:26.748 --> 00:02:28.250
Microbes that live in their stomachs

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.584
produce an enzyme called cellulase,

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.434
which breaks apart the cellulose molecules

00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:36.822
so that the cow can use what's left for energy.

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.550
Researchers are now studying

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.045
these kinds of microorganisms

00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:41.767
in the hopes of finding better ways

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:43.424
to break down cellulose

00:02:43.424 --> 00:02:46.475
so we can use it for our own energy needs.

00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:48.310
The solution, they think,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.980
lies in finding microbes in nature that can produce

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.775
the kinds of cellulase enzymes that we need.

00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:56.151
This process of searching for species in nature

00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:57.737
that can produce valuable products

00:02:57.737 --> 00:03:00.364
is called bioprospecting.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:03.997
To test whether or not a sample of microbes

00:03:03.997 --> 00:03:06.185
can break down cellulose effectively,

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.645
researchers first grow the microbe in a test tube.

00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:10.308
Then, they add a source of cellulose

00:03:10.308 --> 00:03:12.320
as the sole form of energy.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.976
If the microbe can't produce cellulase

00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:15.561
and break down cellulose,

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:17.773
the test tube will remain unchanged.

00:03:17.773 --> 00:03:19.565
But if the microbe produces the enzymes

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:20.607
we are looking for,

00:03:20.607 --> 00:03:22.776
it will be able to break down cellulose,

00:03:22.776 --> 00:03:23.945
use it for energy,

00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:26.321
and thrive in its test tube environment.

00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:28.054
If our microbial sample can break down

00:03:28.054 --> 00:03:29.908
the cellulose in the test tube,

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:31.694
there is a chance we could use it to create

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:34.292
a renewable and sustainable source of fuel

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:37.373
for our cars from cellulose.
