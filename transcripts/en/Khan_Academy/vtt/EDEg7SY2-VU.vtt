00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.480
Welcome back.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.970
So I did this ahead of time, so
as to not waste your time

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:04.775
drawing it.

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:08.560
The question says, a merchant
sells three types of clocks

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.500
that chime as indicated
by the check marks

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.890
in the table above.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.610
What is the total number of
chimes of the inventory of

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.860
clocks in the 90-minute
period?

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.780
And we're talking about
7:15 to 8:45.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.405
So let's just make sure we
understand this chart.

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:31.700
So we have clocks of
type a, b, and c.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.730
This is the number of
each of those clocks

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.830
that the store has.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.540
Now these n times on the nth
hour, that means when it turns

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.680
7 o'clock, it's going to
chime seven times.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.895
When it turns 8 o'clock, it's
going to chime eight times, et

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:47.190
cetera, et cetera.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.200
This is once on the hour,
so right at the hour

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.150
does just one chime.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.785
And then these do once
on the half hour.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:06.360
So let's see, we have
clock a times 10.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.880
And how many times is each of
the clock a's going to chime

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.570
between this period?

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.340
Well, it does n times
on the nth hour.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.780
So between 7:15 and 8:45,
there's only one hour that

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.660
happens, which is 8 o'clock.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.220
And at 8 o'clock it's going
to chime n times.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.965
It's going to chime eight
chimes at 8 o'clock.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.730
And it also does one
on the half hour.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.100
So what half hours are there?

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.230
Well there's 7:30 and there's
8:30 that pass up.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.520
So there are two half hours.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.420
It's going to chime at 7:30
and 8:30, each of these.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.910
So then plus 2, once at 7:30
and once at 8:30, times 10,

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.750
because there's ten clocks.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.190
Let's see, b times 5 clocks,
n times on the nth hour.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.660
Well, once again that's eight
chimes at 8:00, and it doesn't

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.639
do anything else.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.419
So times 5.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.260
And then finally c times
three clocks.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.380
It doesn't do this n
times the nth hour.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.740
It does once on the hour.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.880
It's going to do it
once at 8 o'clock.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.410
And then once on the half
hour, so plus 1 at

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.350
7:30 plus 1 at 8:30.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.550
So that's 3 times
three clocks.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.070
So what's this?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.180
It's 8 plus 2.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.110
Eight chimes plus two chimes.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.190
So that's ten chimes per
clock times 10 is

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.360
equal to a 100 chimes.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.770
Eight chimes per clock
times five clocks

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.930
is equal to 40 chimes.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.360
And then three chimes per clock
times three clocks is

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.010
equal to 9.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.910
You add all this up together,
and the whole store in this

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.250
time period, if I haven't made
a mistake, will chime 149 or

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.850
there'll be 149 chimes of the
inventory of clocks in this

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.210
90-minute period.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.460
Next question.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.440
So they draw a bunch
of random things.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.300
I'll just replace them with
numbers because that's easier

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.020
for me to think, or letters
a, b, c, d, and e.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.930
I mean those pictures
are useless.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.410
They say, if the five cards
shown above are placed in a

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.320
row so that the shaded box, but
I'll call that c, so that

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.510
c is never at either end, how
many different arrangements

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.700
are possible?

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.250
Well, this is how I
think about it.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.140
c is the most restricted.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.550
Let's say that we're placing
them in order.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.790
Let's say these are the spots.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.620
They're in a row.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.560
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.870
And when we come along,
we have c.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.660
We know that c can't be
placed here, and it

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.570
can't be placed here.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.920
So it can only be placed in
one of these three spots.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.480
So there's three possible
situations

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.000
where c can be placed.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.890
Let's say you place c in one
of these three spots.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.280
Now it's our turn to place a.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.880
How many spots are
left to place a?

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.550
Well, one of these three is
going to be taken by c.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.820
But then a can be in any
of the other four.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.720
So then there's four
possibilities for a.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.840
And then once you place a, then
for b, well two of the

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.650
spots are going to be
taken up in b, so

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.850
there's three spots left.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.380
So there's three possibilities
for b.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.990
And then there's only
two openings for d.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.220
And then there's
only one for e.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.100
So if you multiply this out,
you get 3 times 4 is 12.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.910
12 times 3 is 36.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.700
36 times 2 is 72.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.480
So there are 72 possible
arrangements where the middle

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.470
card or that grey card is never
placed at either end.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.220
That's how I always think about
these because you just

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.250
think about placing them-- well
this first one can only

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.560
go in three-- well
you get the idea.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.570
Hopefully you get the idea.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.510
Well, that's this section,
so I will see

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.160
you in the next section.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.410
Have fun.
