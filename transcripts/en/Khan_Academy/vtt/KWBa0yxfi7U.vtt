00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.810
Now on problem number 15.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.110
When it is noon Eastern Standard
Time in New York

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.820
City, it is 9 am Pacific

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.250
Standard Time in San Francisco.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.690
Well we know that.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.520
There's a three hour difference
between New York

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.850
and San Francisco.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.750
A plane took off from New
York City at noon

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.120
Eastern Standard Time.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.770
So it takes off from New York
City at 12 noon Eastern

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.350
Standard Time.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.159
What time is that in Pacific
Standard Time?

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.600
Well they're three hours back,
so that's also 9 Pacific

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.420
Standard Time.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.640
A plane took off in New York
City at 12 noon Eastern

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.100
Standard Time and arrived at San
Francisco at 4 pm Pacific

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.632
Standard Time.

00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:48.010
So this is am.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.370
And so it goes to SFO, it goes
to San Francisco where I live.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.020
I live a little south
of San Francisco.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.610
But anyway, so it goes to San
Francisco and what time does

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.400
it get there?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.560
It says 4 pm Pacific
Standard Time.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.530
And we know that New York is
three hours ahead, so that's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.290
Eastern Standard Time there,
so that's also 7 pm Eastern

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.900
Standard Time.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.640
I'm an expert at this because I
work for a hedge fund where

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.640
all we do is schedule a lot
of calls with the company

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.390
management.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.940
And they happen to, normally,
not be in the same time zone

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.170
as we are, so we're
pros at scheduling

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.740
calls across time zones.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.400
So this is like second nature.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.240
I'm enjoying this problem
more than most people.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240
Back to the problem.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.800
If a second plane left San
Francisco at noon Pacific

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:50.460
Standard Time-- so at 12 pm
Pacific Standard Time, and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.830
what is that?

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.180
That's also 3 pm Eastern
Standard Time-- and took the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.650
exact, same amount of time for
the trip, what was the arrival

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.560
time Eastern Standard Time
in New York City?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.440
So what time is it in Eastern
Standard Time?

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.259
So the first thing we just have
to figure out is how long

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.940
does the trip take, and then
do the second part.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.940
So how long did this
trip take?

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.000
This plane left at 12 Eastern
and arrived at 7 pm Eastern,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.480
so it took 7 hours.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.410
And that was easy, because
we started from 12 and

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.760
we went to 7, right?

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.780
Similarly, if we're going to
leave at 3 pm Eastern Time--

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.600
because we want to stay in
Eastern Time, because our

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.080
final answer has to be Eastern
Time-- if we leave at 3 pm

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.060
Eastern Time and take 7 hours,
we're going to get there at 10

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.440
pm Eastern Standard Time,
which is choice A.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.640
The trick of this problem is
really just staying in one,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.620
consistent time zone
the whole time.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.370
You could stay in, maybe, the
Eastern Standard Time the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.460
whole time.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.710
Next problem.

00:02:53.262 --> 00:02:56.380
It looks like I'll have
to draw something.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.110
I'll draw this rectangle.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.095
I'll draw it in yellow.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:02.310
So let's say this
is a rectangle.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.510
And then I'll try my best to
draw some of these circles.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.570
So we'll just look at the part
that's inside of the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.920
rectangle, because I don't feel
like erasing all that

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.960
other stuff.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.150
Well this is not perfect.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.940
These points touch, right?

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.030
Actually, let me erase all that
other stuff, because it's

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.280
distracting.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.136
So I'll erase this.

00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:38.050
I'm trying my best
to draw neat.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.320
Let me erase all of the rest
of the circle just so it

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.440
doesn't distract you from what's
already drawn there.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.260
Almost done.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.200
Sometimes I feel like that guy
who paints pictures on PBS,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.120
because I spend so much time
drawing these diagrams. What's

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.050
his name, Bob?

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.380
OK.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.930
So let's see, I was
using yellow.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.150
Let me fill that in
a little bit.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.240
OK.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.916
What are the points
that they draw?

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:19.510
They say that that's point
Q, point P, point T,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.180
point R, point S.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:34.560
In rectangle P, Q, R, S above,
arcs Q, T and R, T are quarter

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.220
circles with centers
at P and S.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.570
OK.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.140
So these are quarter circles
with centers at P and S.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.640
If the radius of each circle is
1-- so the radius is 1, so

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.810
this is 1, right?

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.045
Because this is a radius.

00:04:45.045 --> 00:04:47.310
This is the radius of
the circle-- this

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.070
distance is also 1.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.160
What is the area of
the shaded region?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.570
So they drew the shaded
region as this.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.580
That's the shaded
region they did.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.510
So to figure that out we just
have to figure out the area of

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.040
the larger rectangle, and then
subtract out the areas of

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.720
these quarter circles.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.360
So what's the area of this
larger rectangle?

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.840
Well we know its base because
this distance is 1, this

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.760
distance is 1.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.130
And we know, in general,
that this radius is 1.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.530
This distance is 1, and also
this distance is 1.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.690
So the entire rectangle
is 2 by 1, right?

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.290
This is 1.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.910
1 plus 1 is 2, 2 by 1.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.410
So the area of the rectangle--
I'll call that area sub r-- is

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.290
equal to 2 times 1, which
is equal to 2.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.000
Now we just have to figure
out the area of

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.910
these quarter circles.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.710
So if I had a whole circle
with radius 1, what

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.220
would its area be?

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.430
So it would be area
is pi r squared.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.250
And if the radius is 1, the area
would is equal to-- well

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.700
pi times 1 squared is
just pi, pi times 1.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.660
So the area would be pi for
a full circle, right?

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.765
So the area for a quarter
circle-- I could do it in this

00:05:59.765 --> 00:06:09.372
color-- the area of that
blue right there, would

00:06:09.372 --> 00:06:11.110
be pi over 4, right?

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.245
Because it's a quarter
circle, this is pi/4.

00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:18.220
And similarly, that one would
also be another pi over 4.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.270
So the area of the shaded area
would be the area of the

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.610
rectangle, which is 2.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.280
You probably can't even
see that blue.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.860
The area of the rectangle is
2 minus the area of each of

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.020
these quarter circles,
minus pi over 4.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:45.540
And so this would be 2 minus pi
over 2, which is choice B.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.140
Next problem.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.300
Looks like more drawing
for me.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:57.840
OK.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.160
So they drew this graph, and
I guess I will draw it too,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.580
because the whole point of what
I'm doing is trying to

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:13.470
explain to you how to do these
problems. Let's see, so draw

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.660
my axes x and y.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.800
And then the graph comes
in like this.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.725
Then it dips down like this.

00:07:26.725 --> 00:07:29.540
And then it goes up like this.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.060
And they give us a couple
of points on the graph.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.500
They say that this point
here is, 0, 1.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.080
And they say that this point,
right there, is 1, 0.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.580
And they say the graph of y
equals f of x is shown above.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.130
So this is y is equal
to f of x.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.440
Which of the following could be
the graph of y is equal to

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.020
f of x plus 2?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.150
So if you've done this in
class, this is kind of a

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.420
traditional shifting problem.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:09.780
So what you have to realize is,
when you take x plus 2--

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.220
before when you had,
let's say, when x--

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.130
let's put it this way.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.900
Before when x and
f of-- and y.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.190
Let's do x and y.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.350
When x was equal to 0, y
was equal to 1, right?

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.900
And when x is equal 1,
y is equal to 0.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:34.990
Now what happens
when x and y--

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.030
I still want to input 0
into f of x, right?

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.919
I still want to input 0 into f
of x, because f of 0 is going

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:43.795
to be the same thing.

00:08:43.795 --> 00:08:47.400
But if I want to put 0 into f of
x, I have to put a negative

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.000
2 in here, right?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.490
Now when x is equal to
negative 2, then this

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.650
expression here becomes 0,
right? f of negative 2 plus 2

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:00.450
is equal to 0, so that's equal
to the old f of 0.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.710
So then that equals 1.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:08.640
And if I wanted a 1 here, I
would have to put a minus 1 in

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.110
for x, right?

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.680
Think about it.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.040
If I take a minus 1, and I input
it into this expression,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.135
then I get f of 1, right?

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.270
If I put minus 1-- my phone
is ringing, it's slightly

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:26.870
distracting.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.765
But anyway, focus.

00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:29.900
I only have 30 seconds left.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.590
But f of minus 1-- Actually, let
me continue this into the

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.230
next thing, and let me
answer my phone.
