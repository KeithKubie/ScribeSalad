SPEAKER:  GOOD AFTERNOON.  WHAT 

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:57.010
A PANEL WE HAVE HERE TODAY.  
WE'RE IN FOR A TREAT.  I'M KAREN

00:08:58.331 --> 00:09:01.726
 LLOYD, DIRECTOR OF THE PROJECT 
AND IT'S MY PLEASURE TO WELCOME 

00:09:01.851 --> 00:09:04.112
YOU TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL 
BUILDING IN WASHINGTON, D.C.  

00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:07.414
THE INFORMATION CENTER WHICH IS 
LOCATED ACROSS THE STREET IN THE

00:09:07.819 --> 00:09:11.684
 MADISON BUILDING IS A MYA 
ANDREW QUOTE WHICH PERHAPS YOU 

00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:19.212
HEARD BEFORE.  THERE IS NO 
GREATER AGONY THAN TELLING AN 

00:09:19.213 --> 00:09:24.391
UNBEARING STORY INSIDE YOU.  
MONDAY IS MEMORIAL DAY.  TAKE A 

00:09:24.392 --> 00:09:28.328
MINUTE TO REMEMBER THE LIVES WHO
 GAVE THEIR LIVES TO OUR 

00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:32.346
COUNTRY.  THE ULTIMATE 
SACRIFICE.  WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL

00:09:32.587 --> 00:09:37.703
 THAT MANY WHO DID NOT RETURN 
HOME FROM WAR, WE ARE GATHERED 

00:09:37.704 --> 00:09:40.514
HERE TODAY.  POST TRAUMATIC 
STRESS DISORDER, PTSD, THE 

00:09:40.515 --> 00:09:46.467
INVISIBLE WOUND THAT AFFECTS 
HUNDREDS OF VETERANS.  OVER 30% 

00:09:46.624 --> 00:09:51.576
OF VIETNAM VETERANS AND OVER 10%
 OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 

00:09:51.577 --> 00:09:55.916
VETERANS EXPERIENCE PTSD.  IT'S 
NOT JUST THE COMBAT VETS AT 

00:09:56.153 --> 00:10:00.795
RISK.  SEXUAL ASSAULT AND TRAUMA
 CAN PRODUCE THIS DEBILITATING 

00:10:01.144 --> 00:10:04.951
DISORDER.  
PTSD CAN AFFECT THE VETERANS' 

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.669
ABILITY TO WORK, INTERACT WITH 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY.  AND JUST TO

00:10:09.413 --> 00:10:12.143
 LIVE.  WHILE IT'S A MAJOR 
FACTOR IN VETERANS BECOMING 

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:16.202
INVOLVED AND ALSO A MAJOR FACTOR
 WITH VETERANS BECOMING INVOLVED

00:10:16.598 --> 00:10:19.831
 WITH OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM.  
WHILE WE ARE PARTICIPATING IN 

00:10:23.119 --> 00:10:28.225
THE VETERAN'S PROJECT, AND 
CANNOT CURE PTSD, UNBURDENING 

00:10:28.385 --> 00:10:31.614
THE WEIGHT OF THEIR STORY 
PROVIDES SOME RELIEF.  AT THE 

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:36.452
VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT, WE 
MAKE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO 

00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:39.452
RESEARCHERS SO THEY CAN BE 
BETTER UNDERSTOOD.  WE HOLD 

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:43.110
EVENTS LIKE THIS TO LET VETERANS
 KNOW THEY ARE NOT ALONE.  TO 

00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:47.928
RAISE THE AWARENESS LIKE THE 
VETERANS TREATMENT CORE THAT 

00:10:48.694 --> 00:10:52.659
CREATES POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR 
VETERANS WITH PTSD.  TODAY YOU 

00:10:52.894 --> 00:10:58.280
WILL HEAR PLENTY OF IDEAS ABOUT 
PTSD AND VETERANS TREATMENT 

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.538
COURT.  THOSE IDEAS WILL BE 
USELESS IF THEY STAY IN THIS 

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:04.630
ROOM.  I HOPE YOU WILL LEARN 
SOMETHING FROM THIS PANEL AND 

00:11:04.862 --> 00:11:08.115
KEEP IT WITH YOU AND USE IT TO 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE'S 

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:12.285
LIFE.  EVEN IF IN A SMALL WAY.  
JUNE IS NATIONAL PTSD AWARENESS 

00:11:12.518 --> 00:11:14.611
MONTH.  THE PERFECT TIME TO GET 
INVOLVED.  WHETHER IT'S 

00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:16.961
VOLUNTEERING WITH THE VETERANS 
SERVICE ORGANIZATION OR 

00:11:17.074 --> 00:11:22.912
INTERVIEWING THE VETERAN IN YOUR
 LIFE FOR VHP.  

00:11:22.913 --> 00:11:25.269
AGAIN WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING 
HERE TODAY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT 

00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:29.380
PTSD AND HOW WE CAN SUPPORT OUR 
VETERANS.  IT IS NOW MY PLEASURE

00:11:29.733 --> 00:11:35.655
 TO INTRODUCE OUR KEYNOTE 
SPEAKER, CNN'S VERY OWN CHIEF 

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.641
WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, MR. 
JAKE TAPPER.  [APPLAUSE].

00:11:45.394 --> 00:11:48.708
INVITING ME TO SPEAK BEFORE SUCH
 AN IMPORTANT GROUP OF PEOPLE, 

00:11:51.626 --> 00:11:54.093
HAVING SUCH A CRUCIAL 
CONVERSATION.  I DID NOT SERVE. 

00:11:54.283 --> 00:11:59.120
BUT I COVER PEOPLE WHO DID, AND 
WHO DO.  IT IS THE HONOR AND 

00:11:59.529 --> 00:12:02.858
RESPONSIBILITY OF WHAT I DO TO 
TELL THESE STORIES.  AND IT IS 

00:12:03.477 --> 00:12:09.329
THE HONOR OF A LIFETIME TO DO 
SO.  I THOUGHT THAT THE BEST 

00:12:09.644 --> 00:12:12.625
THING I CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS 
EVENT WOULD BE TO TELL YOU ABOUT

00:12:12.967 --> 00:12:19.946
 A YOUNG MAN NAMED ED FAWKNER 
JUNIOR AND MAYBE THROUGH HIS 

00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:22.071
STORY, PEOPLE COULD COME TO 
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE STRUGGLES

00:12:22.273 --> 00:12:27.713
 AND SOME OF THE REASONS WHY 
PTSD EXACTS THE TOLE THAT IT 

00:12:28.089 --> 00:12:29.898
DOES.  
AND WHY PEOPLE HAVE SUCH A 

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:35.263
DIFFICULT TIME FIGURING OUT HOW 
TO FIX IT.  ED FOSTER JUNIOR WAS

00:12:35.626 --> 00:12:38.183
 FROM NORTH CAROLINA AND SERVED 
WITH 361 CAMPS AND WAS ONE OF 

00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:40.449
THE MANY

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:46.625
 HEROS DURING THE OCTOBER THIRD 
2009 ATTACK ON COMBAT OUTPOST.  

00:12:46.626 --> 00:12:48.626
I WROTE A BOOK

00:12:51.424 --> 00:12:56.979
 ABOUT THE OUT POST.  AND THE 
BOOK FOCUSES QUITE A BIT ON THE 

00:12:57.598 --> 00:13:01.048
HEROS WHO DO NOT MAKE IT HOME.  
ED WAS A HERO WHO MADE IT HOME 

00:13:01.346 --> 00:13:04.738
AND NOT ABLE TO LEAVE THE BATTLE
 BEHIND HIM.  AND I THOUGHT 

00:13:05.249 --> 00:13:08.346
SHARING HIS STORY MIGHT HELP 
ALUMINATE THE CONVERSATION IN 

00:13:09.257 --> 00:13:14.183
SOME SMALL DEGREE.  AFTER THE 
BATTLE WHERE ED WAS WOUNDED, HE 

00:13:14.532 --> 00:13:20.795
HAD A PURPLE HEART FROM SERVING 
IN IRAQ.  AND DURING THE INTENSE

00:13:22.018 --> 00:13:24.368
 BATTLE OF COMBAT, HE WAS 
WOUNDED AGAIN IN THE SAME SPOT 

00:13:24.369 --> 00:13:30.156
AND WAS PUMPED BECAUSE HE WAS 
GOING TO HAVE TWO PURPLE HEARTS.

00:13:30.157 --> 00:13:33.059
  AND ONLY ONE SCAR.  WHICH HE 
THOUGHT WAS NOT FAIR.  AFTER THE

00:13:33.498 --> 00:13:38.935
 BATTLE HE WAS SENT TO 
RECUPERATE AT FORT CARSON IN 

00:13:38.936 --> 00:13:43.234
COLORADO WHERE HIS PHYSICAL 
WOUNDS WERE TREATED.  AND HE WAS

00:13:43.468 --> 00:13:46.295
 IN PRIVATE SECOND CLASS AND HE 
WAS ENCOURAGED TO REJOIN HIS 

00:13:46.296 --> 00:13:51.117
TEAM IN AFGHANISTAN.  THE 
OFFICER ASKED HIM, DON'T YOU 

00:13:51.118 --> 00:13:56.601
WANT TO BE A REAL MAN AND RETURN
 TO YOUR AFGHANISTAN UNIT?  HE 

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:58.602
SAID 

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:05.650
SOMETHING THAT HE DIDN'T THINK 
HE WAS CAPABLE OF GOING BACK TO 

00:14:05.857 --> 00:14:10.566
WAR.  TOO MANY VOICES IN HIS 
HEAD.  INTENSE NIGHTMARES.  AND 

00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:13.288
AN ARMY PHYSICIAN TOLD HIM THAT 
HE HAD POST TRAUMATIC STRESS 

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:16.505
DISORDER AND HE WAS ALREADY TO 
BE FAIR TO THE ARMY.  AND HAD 

00:14:16.728 --> 00:14:21.710
COME INTO THE ARMY ALREADY.  
SOMETHING THAT -- SOME SOMETHING

00:14:22.043 --> 00:14:25.154
 OF AN UNSTABLE PLACE 
EMOTIONALLY.  AND THE

00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:32.497
 BATTLE HAD TIPPED HIM AT SORTS.
  HE LOST TWO OF HIS BEST 

00:14:32.846 --> 00:14:36.744
FRIENDS.  
MICHAEL SCUUZA AND GRIFFON.  

00:14:36.868 --> 00:14:43.324
DURING AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE FIVE 
MEN WHO WERE TRAPPED IN A HUM-V,

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:48.925
 HIM, GRIFFON AND ANOTHER GUY 
NAMED JOSHUA HEART TRIED TO 

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.405
RESCUE THEM.  AT THE END OF THE 
DAY, THE THREE MEN IN THE RESCUE

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.186
 TRUCK AND THE FIVE MEN THAT 
WERE TRAPPED, ONLY THREE OF THEM

00:14:56.904 --> 00:15:01.927
 SURVIVED.  AND FAWKNER WAS ONE 
OF THEM.  AND HE HAS, AS A LOT 

00:15:02.062 --> 00:15:06.725
OF PEOPLE HAVE, SURVIVOR'S 
GUILT.  

00:15:06.726 --> 00:15:11.240
FAWKNER'S COMMANDER AT FORT 
CARSON ALREADY SUSPECTED THAT HE

00:15:12.247 --> 00:15:14.202
 WAS SELF-MEDICATING WITH 
ILLEGAL DRUGS AND HE THOUGHT IT 

00:15:14.203 --> 00:15:16.912
WAS CONTRIBUTING TO WHAT HE WAS 
GOING THROUGH.  HE DECIDED IT 

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.059
WOULD BE BETTER TO DISCHARGE 
FAWKNER BEFORE HE GOT IN SO MUCH

00:15:23.524 --> 00:15:33.523
 TROUBLE THAT HE WAS 
DISHONORABLEY DISCHARGED.  IT 

00:15:34.503 --> 00:15:40.830
UPSET HIS FATHER, FAWKNER 
SENIOR.  THE SON NEEDED PHYSICAL

00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:46.538
 THERAPIST AND NOT HUMILIATION. 

00:15:46.539 --> 00:15:49.631
BUT THEY KICKED HIM OUT IN A WAY
 THAT THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE

00:15:49.993 --> 00:15:56.859
 ACCESS TO THE VA AND THE 
BENEFITS.  APRIL 1ST, 2010, ED 

00:15:57.762 --> 00:16:01.559
FAWKNER JUNIOR AND ED FAWKNER 
SENIOR BOARDED A PLANE BACK TO 

00:16:01.683 --> 00:16:05.410
SOUTH CAROLINA.  AS SOON AS HE 
GOT BACK TO NORTH CAROLINA, HE 

00:16:05.599 --> 00:16:08.453
RETREATED INTO HIS OWN HEAD.  HE
 DID KEEP IN TOUCH WITH SOME OF 

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.251
HIS FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK AND HE 
DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS HAUNTED.  

00:16:15.134 --> 00:16:19.741
HE DREAMT ABOUT IRAQIS GOING TO 
THEIR DOOR AND BRINGING DEAD 

00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:25.926
BABIES TO HIM.  HE SAID TO HIS 
FATHER THAT HE COULD HAVE DONE 

00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:30.077
SOMETHING TO SAVE GRIFFON'S LIFE
 BUT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO.  WHEN 

00:16:30.454 --> 00:16:34.380
THE MOON WAS OUT, HE WAS SCARED 
AWAY BY NIGHTMARES.  MICHAEL 

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:42.954
SCOOZA HIS FRIEND WAS ONCE ABLE 
TO COMFORT FAWKNER.  AND HE WAS 

00:16:43.147 --> 00:16:45.722
NOW GONE.  AND WASN'T ABLE TO 
SAY THAT ANYMORE.  IN APRIL 

00:16:46.122 --> 00:16:49.761
2010, STARTED IN A CLEANING JOB.
AND WOULD GET UP AT 6:00 A.M. 

00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:56.535
EVERY DAY AND THE BOSS SHOWED 
HIM HOW TO USE THE VAN.  

00:16:56.536 --> 00:17:01.106
AND HE STEPPED INTO A BUCKET OF 
HOT WATER AND SAID IT HURT THE 

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:04.484
BLISTER WOUNDS.  HE TRIED TO 
MAKE A LIFE FOR HIMSELF.  HE 

00:17:04.956 --> 00:17:09.354
WOULD STAY UP LATE AT NIGHT 
WATCHING THE VIDEOS THAT WERE 

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.442
POSTED ON YOUTUBE.  HE TOLD HIS 
FRIENDS FROM 361 THAT HE HEARD 

00:17:13.661 --> 00:17:18.074
GUN FIRE AND SAW TALIBAN EVERY 
DAY.  HIS FATHER TOOK HIM TO A 

00:17:18.248 --> 00:17:21.481
GREENS BOROUGH GRASS HOPPERS 
GAME ON THE 4TH OF JULY.  WHEN 

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:27.587
THE FIRE WORKS STARTED, FAWKNER 
HIT THE GROUND, AS IF HE WAS 

00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:31.133
UNDER ATTACK.  
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, 

00:17:31.261 --> 00:17:36.394
FAWKNER'S MOM COULD NOT FIND 
HIM.  HE DIDN'T ANSWER HIS 

00:17:36.594 --> 00:17:39.302
CELLPHONE.  SHE DROVE AROUND THE
 NEIGHBORHOOD AND COULD NOT FIND

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:42.866
 HIM ANYWHERE.  WHEN SHE 
RETURNED TO THE DRIVEWAY, SHE 

00:17:42.867 --> 00:17:48.971
SAW A SHADOW IN THE BUSHES AND 
SAW HER SON CROUCHED DOWN AS IF 

00:17:48.972 --> 00:17:52.405
HE HAD A RIFLE AND LOOKING 
THROUGH THE SCOPE AS IF THERE 

00:17:52.406 --> 00:17:55.070
WAS AN ENEMY. 
AND THERE WAS A RADIO AND HE WAS

00:17:55.608 --> 00:18:00.994
 TALKING TO IT LIKE HE WAS IN 
COMBAT.  AND SHE GUIDED HIM HIS 

00:18:01.503 --> 00:18:06.278
BED.  AT THE END OF JULY 2010, 
FAWKNER RAN NAKED IN THE STREET 

00:18:06.873 --> 00:18:11.669
AND YELLED THE END OF THE WORLD 
HAS BEEN COMING AND STOPPED 

00:18:11.811 --> 00:18:16.681
PEOPLE IN THE STREET ASKING THEM
 IF JESUS CHRIST WAS THEIR LORD 

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:22.549
AND SAVIOR.  AND RECENTLY HAD 
TRAP INJURIES AND SUFFERING FROM

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:26.714
 PTSD.  I KNEW IT, SAID THE 
POLICE OFFICER.  WHEN SHE 

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.783
DETAINED HIM HE WAS TALKING ON 
THE RADIO TO FELLOW SOLDIERS 

00:18:32.242 --> 00:18:38.811
THAT WERE NOT THERE.  THEY WERE 
BOTH IMAGINARY.  THE POLICE DID 

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.934
NOT WANT TO ARREST FAWKNER.  
SARAH AGREED TO VISIT HIM.  AT 

00:18:45.075 --> 00:18:49.085
THE CENTER IN NORTH CAROLINA.  
FIRST SHE WALKED RIGHT PAST HIS 

00:18:49.219 --> 00:18:53.266
ROOM.  MATTRESS WAS THROWN TO 
THE FLOOR AND OCCUPANT WAS 

00:18:54.542 --> 00:18:57.907
COVERED VIA SHEET.  THE ROOM 
BELONGED TO SOMEBODY ELSE.  NOT 

00:18:58.641 --> 00:19:03.655
HER BROTHER.  WHOEVER THAT IS, 
BEFORE REALIZING IT WAS ED.  SHE

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:07.428
 WALKED IN AND TRIED TO HAVE 
CONVERSATION.  SOMETHING HAD 

00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:11.153
TAKEN HIM OVER.  SCARED HER.  I 
CAN'T SIT IN THIS NUT HOUSE.  

00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:15.187
THE REALIZATION KNOCKED THE WIND
 OUT OF HER.  MY BROTHER IS VERY

00:19:15.323 --> 00:19:18.610
 ILL RIGHT NOW.  HE SAID THIS IS
 THE END FOR ME.  YOU HAVE NO 

00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:21.991
IDEA.  I AM SO STRESSED OUT.  I 
DON'T KNOW WHY I DID WHAT I DID.

00:19:22.204 --> 00:19:25.316
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT HAPPENED.  
SHE TRIED TO TELL HIM TO GIVE 

00:19:25.616 --> 00:19:28.775
HIS LIFE OVER TO GOD AND ONLY 
GOD CAN SAVE HIM.  NOT DRUGS.  

00:19:29.161 --> 00:19:31.551
THE TO HER, HER BROTHER SEEMED 
BEYOND SAVING.  

00:19:31.552 --> 00:19:35.115
THERE IS ALL THIS NOISE IN MY 
MIND HE TOLD HER.  IT WON'T 

00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:40.107
STOP.  WON'T QUIET DOWN.  
FAWKNER WAS TRANSFERRED TO A 

00:19:40.233 --> 00:19:43.906
VETERAN'S HOSPITAL FOR A COUPLE 
OF DAYS.  ASSIGNED A SOCIAL 

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.141
WORKER AND THEN WAS DISCHARGED. 
PARENTS WERE NOT IMPRESSED ABOUT

00:19:47.558 --> 00:19:49.792
 THE CARE THEIR SON HAD 
RECEIVED.

00:19:49.793 --> 00:19:52.364
SEEMED CASUAL AND OBLIVIOUS.  HE
 REALLY NEEDED SOME HELP.  

00:19:52.365 --> 00:19:55.400
FATHER WOULD SAY IF YOU ARE OUT 
IN A STORM, YOU SEEK SHELTER AND

00:19:55.586 --> 00:19:59.484
 HAD THE STORM GOING ON IN HIS 
BRAIN.

00:19:59.485 --> 00:20:05.489
BUT HIS GOVERNMENT, HIS COUNTRY 
PROVIDED HIS SON WITH NO SUCH 

00:20:05.601 --> 00:20:12.265
SHELTER.  FAWKNER SOON MET A 
WOMAN NAMED CHARLENE IN AUGUST 

00:20:12.403 --> 00:20:16.229
AND SHE SAID SHE SUFFERED FROM 
DEPRESSION.  FOR THE FIRST TIME,

00:20:16.395 --> 00:20:20.792
 FAWKNER DID NOT FEEL ALONE.  HE
 HAD CHARLENE.  SHE HAD A YOUNG 

00:20:21.072 --> 00:20:25.263
DAUGHTER.  HE HELPED HER WITH 
HER HOMEWORK.  A NORMAL LIFE.  

00:20:25.743 --> 00:20:29.180
ALMOST.  HE MOVED INTO HER 
APARTMENT WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF 

00:20:29.558 --> 00:20:31.558
MEETING 

00:20:34.073 --> 00:20:36.073
HER.  SHE WAS PROVIDED

00:20:40.546 --> 00:20:44.490
 BENEFITS.  AND ALL OF THIS 
SEEMED ALARMING.  I DON'T HAVE 

00:20:44.769 --> 00:20:51.460
TO LIVE IN THE BIGGEST HOUSE HE 
SAYS.  SO WHAT IF SHE IS ON 

00:20:52.032 --> 00:20:57.427
WELFARE OR HOUSING?  THESE 
PEOPLE ARE CLOSE TO GOD.  GOT ON

00:20:57.737 --> 00:20:59.976
 THE PHONE ONCE WITH ED'S 
CENTER.

00:20:59.977 --> 00:21:04.236
SHE SEEMED SPACED OUT.  I CAN 
TELL YOU'RE ON DRUGS SARAH 

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.284
REPLIED.  LOCK THEM UP.  MY 
BROTHER WAS ONCE ADDICTED TO 

00:21:07.827 --> 00:21:11.904
PAIN PILLS.  KEEP THEM OUT OF 
HIS REACH.  SHE PROMISED SHE 

00:21:12.403 --> 00:21:17.453
WOULD.  SHE HAD A LITTLE GIRL AS
 WELL.  ON THE NIGHT OF 15TH OF 

00:21:17.639 --> 00:21:23.187
SEPTEMBER 2010, FOUND DRIFTED 
OFF ASLEEP BY THE STEERING 

00:21:23.387 --> 00:21:26.122
WHEEL.  WHEN ASKED WHAT WAS 
WRONG, DIDN'T ANSWER.  THE NEXT 

00:21:26.319 --> 00:21:30.051
MORNING CHARLENE WOKE UP AND GOT
 HER DAUGHTER READY TO GO TO 

00:21:30.341 --> 00:21:33.698
SCHOOL AND TOOK HER TO THE BUS 
STOP.  SHE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE 

00:21:34.802 --> 00:21:39.469
ED WAS NOT MOVING AN INCH.  SHE 
CALLED 911, THEY ARRIVED AND 

00:21:39.586 --> 00:21:43.569
TOOK OVER THE CPR.  THE FIRST 
RESPONDERS NOTED THAT THERE WAS 

00:21:44.657 --> 00:21:51.455
SEVERAL BUCKETS OF MERKY WATER 
IN THE HALLWAY.  THE MATTRESS ON

00:21:51.782 --> 00:21:56.259
 WHICH ED FAWKNER WAS LYING HAD 
CIGARETTE BURNS AND PACKED WITH 

00:21:56.442 --> 00:22:01.024
PILES OF CLOTHING AND TRASH.  
THE BATHROOMS WAS COATED WITH 

00:22:01.169 --> 00:22:05.313
FILTH.  THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL 
TECHNICIANS RAN IN AND CONFIRMED

00:22:05.955 --> 00:22:09.510
 THAT ED FAWKNER JUNIOR WAS 
DEAD.

00:22:09.511 --> 00:22:12.933
THEY WHEELED HIM OUT AND PLACED 
HIM TO THE BACK OF THE EMERGENCY

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:18.594
 ROOM.  THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS 
ACCUSE METHADONE TOXICITY.  A 

00:22:20.586 --> 00:22:25.413
FEW DAYS LATER, ADMINISTRATION 
CALLED AND SAID, WOULD YOU 

00:22:25.523 --> 00:22:29.288
PLEASE LET YOUR SON KNOW HE IS 
LATE FOR HIS APPOINTMENT.  

00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:34.865
AS WORDS READ, FORMER SERGEANT 
JONATHAN HILL CALLED TY CARTER, 

00:22:35.113 --> 00:22:40.798
ANOTHER FELLOW SOLDIER TO HOUSE 
HOW THE ARMY AND THE VA HAD 

00:22:41.187 --> 00:22:46.674
TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEIR 
FRIEND.  TY CARTER SAID I THINK 

00:22:48.163 --> 00:22:53.042
ED WAS THE 9TH VICTIM OF COP 
KEEPING.  AND I DON'T THINK HE 

00:22:53.211 --> 00:22:58.174
WILL BE THE LAST.  THERE NEEDS 
TO BE A PLACE IN SOCIETY FOR THE

00:22:58.295 --> 00:23:00.220
 ED FAWKNER JUNIORS OF THE 
WORLD.

00:23:00.221 --> 00:23:02.988
I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER.  I'M A 
REPORTER.  I'M NOT A POLICY 

00:23:03.144 --> 00:23:06.320
MAKER.  WHETHER IT'S IN THE ARMY
 OR THE VA OR IN OUR LOCAL 

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.489
COMMUNITIES, THEY ARE NOT 
SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM.  THEY 

00:23:10.602 --> 00:23:12.854
ARE NOT SOMEBODY IN THE STREET 
JUST BLOCKING YOU FROM GETTING 

00:23:13.048 --> 00:23:18.581
TO WORK WHEN YOU WANT TO GET TO 
WORK.  THEY ARE OUR PROBLEM.  

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:25.414
THAT WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO 
SAVE MEN LIKE ED FAWKNER JUNIOR 

00:23:25.998 --> 00:23:27.998
AND IT'S A NATIONAL DISGRACE

00:23:30.091 --> 00:23:32.091
.  
I'M GOING TO

00:23:37.975 --> 00:23:42.717
 INTRODUCE THE COUNCIL.  
CURRENTLY SERVES AS PRESIDENT 

00:23:42.718 --> 00:23:46.126
FOR THE AMERICAN BAR 
ASSOCIATION.  MELISSA FITZGERALD

00:23:46.248 --> 00:23:50.529
 IS BEST KNOWN FOR THE TV SERIES
 WEST WING.  SHE LEFT HOLLYWOOD 

00:23:50.741 --> 00:23:53.159
TO LEAVE THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF DRUG COURT 

00:23:53.577 --> 00:23:56.698
PROFESSIONALS WHERE SHE WILL NOW
 BE EXPANDING HER ROLE TO HEAD 

00:23:56.699 --> 00:24:00.035
UP A NEW INITIATIVE ADVANCING 
JUSTICE.  I WANT TO THANK YOU 

00:24:00.356 --> 00:24:04.438
FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN TO
 MY STORY ABOUT ED FAWKNER 

00:24:04.439 --> 00:24:09.402
JUNIOR AND I HOPE THIS STORY 
TODAY PREVENTS FUTURE TRAGEDIES 

00:24:09.403 --> 00:24:11.403
FROM HAPPENING.  IT HAS BEEN MY

00:24:32.303 --> 00:24:40.846
 HONOR.  [APPLAUSE].  HONOR.  
[APPLAUSE]. 

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.607
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU JAKE FOR ALL
 THAT YOU DO ON BEHALF

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.834
 OF VETERANS.  AND I WOULD LIKE 
TO THANK GREG CRAWFORD HERE ON 

00:24:37.835 --> 00:24:40.479
THE PANEL FROM THE NATIONAL 
INSTITUTE OF CORRECTIONS IN 

00:24:40.658 --> 00:24:43.909
JOINING US FOR THIS EVENT.  I 
APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT AND THE 

00:24:44.111 --> 00:24:46.111
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF 
CORRECTIONS SUPPORT THE VETERANS

00:24:46.366 --> 00:24:49.049
 WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.  IT HAS

00:24:49.255 --> 00:24:54.366
 BEEN THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY 
LIFE TO BE PART OF JUSTICE FOR 

00:24:54.367 --> 00:24:58.241
VETS.  AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS 
HAVING A PROFOUND IMPACT AND 

00:24:58.242 --> 00:25:00.993
REAL IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF 
VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES.  I 

00:25:00.994 --> 00:25:08.368
AM EXCITED TO EXPAND MY ROLE AND
 LAUNCH THE NEW INITIATIVE OF 

00:25:08.369 --> 00:25:12.001
ADVANCING JUSTICE.  I THINK WE 
ALL KNOW THAT OUR VETERANS ARE 

00:25:12.002 --> 00:25:17.170
AMONG OUR NATION'S GREATEST AND 
MOST VALUABLE CIVIC ASSETS.  

00:25:17.171 --> 00:25:20.799
THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF 
AMERICAN SOCIETY INSTILLED WITH 

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:26.461
THE VALUES THAT MOST OF US 
ASPIRE TO.  HONOR, DUTY,

00:25:31.931 --> 00:25:36.475
 LEADERSHIP, RESPECT.  WE KNOW 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR 

00:25:36.998 --> 00:25:41.344
NATION'S VETERANS RETURN HOME AS
 LEADERS, PART OF OUR 

00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:43.345
COMMUNITIES AND VALUED LEADING 

00:25:51.023 --> 00:25:53.749
EXEMPLARY LIVES.  WE KNOW THAT 
EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCE IS NOT THE

00:25:54.007 --> 00:25:57.394
 SAME.  WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT
 THAT ONE IN FIVE VETERANS 

00:25:57.395 --> 00:26:01.393
RETURNING SUFFERS FROM PTSD AND 
ONE IN SIX SUFFERS FROM A 

00:26:01.394 --> 00:26:06.087
SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER.  WE 
CANNOT IGNORE THE DEBILITATING 

00:26:06.088 --> 00:26:09.174
AFFECT OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN 
INJURIES ON THE LIVES OF 

00:26:09.343 --> 00:26:12.423
MILITARY FAMILIES.  WE CANNOT 
IGNORE THAT THESE ISSUES OFTEN 

00:26:12.554 --> 00:26:14.554
LEAD TO

00:26:15.757 --> 00:26:18.779
 HOMELESSNESS, UNEMPLOYMENT, 
ARREST OR WORTH.  

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.085
IF WE DO NOT INTERCEPT, THESE 
VULNERABLE VETERANS AT THE KEY 

00:26:22.523 --> 00:26:26.466
MOMENT OF CRISIS, WE MAY NOT 
HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY.  

00:26:26.467 --> 00:26:31.791
INSTEAD OF SENDING OUR VETERANS 
TO JAIL, VETERANS TREATMENT 

00:26:31.925 --> 00:26:37.494
COURTS ENSURE THAT THE VETERANS 
WHO STRUGGLE WITH THE SUBSTANCE 

00:26:38.259 --> 00:26:43.676
ABUSE DISORDER.  AND/OR MENTAL 
HEALTH CONDITION TRAUMA, AND 

00:26:43.677 --> 00:26:47.946
WHAT THEY NEED TO GET THEIR 
LIVES BACK ON TRACK.  VETERANS 

00:26:48.265 --> 00:26:51.109
TREATMENT COURTS GIVE OUR 
VETERANS THOSE WHO DEFENDED OUR 

00:26:51.488 --> 00:26:54.330
FREEDOMS, THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN FREEDOM.  

00:26:54.467 --> 00:26:57.177
FREEDOM FROM ADDICTION AND 
MENTAL ANGUISH AND UNEMPLOYMENT 

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:03.060
AND HOMELESSNESS AND FREEDOM 
FROM ISOLATION.  VETERANS 

00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:06.843
TREATMENT COURTS RECOGNIZE THAT 
RESTORING OUR VETERANS TO 

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.943
HEALTHY CITIZENS NOT ONLY HONOR 
THEIR SACRIFICE.  IT MAKES OUR 

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:18.147
COMMUNITIES STRONGER.  VETERANS 
TREATMENT COURTS WORK.  THEY 

00:27:18.856 --> 00:27:23.712
HELP REDUCE CRIME AND THEY WORK 
REDUCING TAXPAYER MONEY AND WORK

00:27:24.687 --> 00:27:27.118
 BY RETURNING HEALTHY VETERANS 
TO OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY 

00:27:27.119 --> 00:27:30.124
ARE GREATLY NEEDED AND WHERE 
THEY BELONG.  AT JUSTICE FOR 

00:27:31.496 --> 00:27:34.406
VETS, IT IS OUR MISSION TO PUT A
 VETERANS TREATMENT COURT WITHIN

00:27:34.537 --> 00:27:39.588
 REACH OF EVERY VETERAN IN NEED.
  JUSTICE FOR VETS IS THE ONLY 

00:27:39.589 --> 00:27:42.904
NATIONAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTED 
AND DEDICATED TO THE EXPANSION 

00:27:42.905 --> 00:27:47.355
OF VETERANS TREATMENT COURT.  
AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT TODAY 

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:55.392
THERE ARE 15,000 VETERANS THAT 
WOULD OTHERWISE BE INCARSERATED 

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.170
IN THE 330 LIFE SAVING TREATMENT
 CENTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  

00:28:00.171 --> 00:28:02.171
AND

00:28:03.461 --> 00:28:07.462
 WITH THAT, I WILL TURN IT OVER 
TO YOU, BUTCH.  

00:28:07.463 --> 00:28:09.463
SPEAKER:  LET ME JUST BRIEFLY 
ADD MY THANKS FOR THE 

00:28:09.588 --> 00:28:13.899
OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY
 AND OFFER MY THANKS FOR ALL OF 

00:28:14.592 --> 00:28:16.910
YOU JOINING THIS CONVERSATION.  
THE CONVERSATION THAT OUR NATION

00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:22.812
 MUST HAVE ABOUT PROVIDING A 
HOLISTIC SOLUTION TO THE 

00:28:22.975 --> 00:28:27.311
CHALLENGES FACING SOME OF OUR 
VETERANS.  

00:28:27.312 --> 00:28:31.593
WHEN A VETERAN AND HIS OR HER 
CONDUCTS COMES INTO CONTACT WITH

00:28:31.979 --> 00:28:35.835
 LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR FEDERAL
 JUSTICE SYSTEM, OUR NATION, WE 

00:28:36.133 --> 00:28:41.078
HAVE A CHOICE.  A CHOICE BETWEEN
 PLACING THEM IN A CRIMINAL 

00:28:41.201 --> 00:28:45.233
JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT MAY NOT HAVE
 THE CAPACITY OR THE CAPABILITY 

00:28:45.479 --> 00:28:48.857
TO CONSIDER THEIR UNIQUE 
EXPERIENCES AND CHALLENGES.  AND

00:28:49.329 --> 00:28:54.063
 A SYSTEM WHERE WE ARE LIKELY TO
 SEE THEM AGAIN.  OR WE CAN MAKE

00:28:54.831 --> 00:28:58.965
 THE CHOICE THAT BECAUSE OF 
THEIR SERVICE, WE ARE PLACING 

00:28:58.966 --> 00:29:03.240
THEM IN A CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE UNIQUE 

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:06.917
BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCES ARE 
UNDERSTOOD.  AND THE SYSTEM 

00:29:06.918 --> 00:29:11.849
MELTS TREATMENT WITH INTENSE 
SUPERVISION ALL AIMED AT 

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:15.765
IMPROVING OUTCOMES.  IN OTHER 
WORDS, PLACING THEM IN A 

00:29:15.907 --> 00:29:19.034
VETERANS TREATMENT COURT.  
VETERANS TREATMENT COURTS, IF 

00:29:19.204 --> 00:29:21.777
YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT 
MODEL, ARE A FORM OF 

00:29:22.674 --> 00:29:26.186
PROBLEM-SOLVING COURTS.  DRUG 
COURTS, WHICH NUMBER IN EXCESS 

00:29:26.512 --> 00:29:31.390
OF 3500 AND REALLY HAVE BEEN 
PART OF OUR JURISPRUDENCE SINCE 

00:29:31.945 --> 00:29:35.945
1989.  PROBLEM SOLVING COURTS 
LIKE DUI COURTS, WOMEN DRUG

00:29:39.092 --> 00:29:42.998
 COURTS, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, ALL 
BUT TO NAME A FEW CREATED TO 

00:29:43.417 --> 00:29:45.888
ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS AND 
CREATE THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCES OF

00:29:46.122 --> 00:29:50.639
 THEIR POPULATION.  BUT IT 
WASN'T UNTIL 2008 WHEN A 

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.121
COURAGEOUS JUDGE AND HIS STAFF 
IN BUFFALO, NEW YORK, RECOGNIZED

00:29:55.459 --> 00:30:02.050
 MORE COULD BE DONE TO IMPROVE 
THE OUTCOMES OF VETERANS IN 

00:30:02.051 --> 00:30:04.116
THEIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.  
AND A MOVEMENT BEGAN.  THEY 

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:07.017
CHOSE, AGAIN, A MATTER OF 
CHOICE.  THEY CHOSE TO DO 

00:30:07.018 --> 00:30:10.665
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.  AND 
STARTED THE CONVERSATION.  THE 

00:30:10.796 --> 00:30:16.102
CONVERSATION TODAY WHICH ALL OF 
US ARE PRIVILEGED TO CONTINUE.  

00:30:16.383 --> 00:30:19.000
I HAVE BEEN PART OF THESE COURTS
 SINCE I RETIRED FROM THE ARMY 

00:30:19.142 --> 00:30:22.444
THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO.  AND
 THE ARMY TAUGHT ME TO BE A 

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.500
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT PERSON.  
AND I HAVE HOWEVER, SPARED YOU 

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:32.354
THE USE OF POWER POINT TODAY.  
BUT MY BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT IS 

00:30:33.807 --> 00:30:37.181
THIS.  I BELIEVE THAT VETERANS 
TREATMENT COURTS ARE THE 

00:30:37.363 --> 00:30:42.374
GOVERNMENT, JUDICIARY AND THE 
COMMUNITY AT THEIR VERY, VERY 

00:30:42.531 --> 00:30:45.018
FINEST MOMENT.  IN TRYING TIMES,
 IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE IN 

00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:50.212
SOMETHING, I URGE YOU TO CHOOSE 
TO BELIEVE IN THE VALUE OF 

00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:52.351
VETERANS TREATMENT COURTS.  
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 

00:30:53.001 --> 00:30:55.045
DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF THESE
 COURTS THAT I WILL HIGHLIGHT 

00:30:55.046 --> 00:30:59.948
FOR YOU.  SPECIAL INGREDIENTS, 
IF YOU WILL.  THE USE OF 

00:30:59.949 --> 00:31:03.914
VOLUNTEER VETERAN MENTORS WHO 
CHOOSE TO BE A PART OF THESE 

00:31:04.178 --> 00:31:06.883
COURTS.  TRUST ME.  NO ONE 
RESPONDS TO A 

00:31:10.614 --> 00:31:14.421
VETERAN LIKE A VETERAN.  AND NO 
ONE CARES FOR A VETERAN LIKE 

00:31:14.762 --> 00:31:19.974
ANOTHER VETERAN.  AND THEY 
BECOME THEIR BATTLE BUDDIES.  

00:31:20.101 --> 00:31:24.151
JUSTICE OUT REACH OFFICERS, 
GREAT NEW STORIES FOR THE 

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.838
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. 
THESE BJO'S AS THEY ARE CALLED, 

00:31:29.028 --> 00:31:32.316
SIT IN COURT AND ALMOST 
INSTANTLY CONNECT THE JUSTICE 

00:31:33.342 --> 00:31:35.911
INVOLVED VETERANS TO BENEFIT 
FROM THE SERVICES THAT THEY MAY 

00:31:36.848 --> 00:31:39.533
NOT OTHERWISE PURSUE.  BUT WHY 
DO I URGE YOU TO

00:31:44.413 --> 00:31:49.744
 CHOOSE THESE COURTS.  AS MY 
COLLEAGUES AND BATTLE BUDDY AND 

00:31:49.745 --> 00:31:54.260
MY TEAMMATE MELISSA SAYS, THEY 
WORK.  THE BATTLE IS SHOWING 

00:31:59.327 --> 00:32:05.076
ANECDOTALLY SOMETIMES.  SUPPORT 
FROM VETERANS IMPROVES OUTCOMES 

00:32:05.208 --> 00:32:08.286
DRAMATICALLY FOR OUR 
JUSTICE-INVOLVED VETERANS.  AND 

00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:11.699
IMPORTANTLY, THESE COURTS 
RESTORE HOPE.  THEY UNLOCK 

00:32:12.233 --> 00:32:17.287
POTENTIAL AND THEY PROMOTE A 
LIFESTYLE OF RECOVERY.  AND AS A

00:32:17.587 --> 00:32:23.059
 NATION, ARE WE REALLY GOING TO 
CHOOSE ANYTHING LESS FOR OUR 

00:32:23.855 --> 00:32:26.574
VETERANS?  I HOPE NOT.  I AM 
GRATEFUL FOR OUR PANELISTS TODAY

00:32:26.783 --> 00:32:29.350
 AND THE INFORMATION YOU'RE 
ABOUT TO GET FROM THEM WHO WILL 

00:32:29.351 --> 00:32:32.669
GIVE UP THEIR TIME AND EXPERTISE
 TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND 

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:37.071
AND THUS TREAT ONE OF THE UNIQUE
 CHALLENGES FACING SOME OF OUR 

00:32:37.235 --> 00:32:40.609
VETERANS AND THAT IS PTSD.  
THE MORE WE KNOW AND THE MORE WE

00:32:40.969 --> 00:32:43.337
 UNDERSTAND, THE MORE LIVES WE 
CAN CHANGE AND THE MORE LIVES WE

00:32:43.453 --> 00:32:45.453
 CAN SAVE. 

00:32:52.058 --> 00:32:54.058
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
[APPLAUSE].

00:32:58.149 --> 00:33:00.758
VIDEO FROM THE NATIONAL 
INSTITUTE VETERANS LIFE BROAD 

00:33:00.924 --> 00:33:03.507
CAST ON TREATMENT COURTS, I 
WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS 

00:33:03.634 --> 00:33:07.674
VIDEO WILL HIGHLIGHT THE 
STRUGGLES THAT SOME OF OUR 

00:33:07.792 --> 00:33:11.541
VETERANS FACE.  I THINK IT'S 
VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO 

00:33:11.751 --> 00:33:13.751
REMEMBER AS WE WATCH THE VIDEO

00:33:16.468 --> 00:33:19.433
 AND THROUGHOUT TODAY'S 
CONVERSATION, AS SAID BEFORE, 

00:33:19.676 --> 00:33:23.127
THE VAST MAJORITY OF VETERANS 
ARE STRENGTHENED BY THE MILITARY

00:33:23.433 --> 00:33:25.433
 SERVICE AND RETURNING HOME 
TRULY

00:33:29.996 --> 00:33:34.501
 AS CIVIC ASSETS.  AND ALL OF 
THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT OUR 

00:33:34.781 --> 00:33:37.681
VETERANS SHARE, INCLUDING THE 
ONES THAT ARE STRUGGLING, IS 

00:33:37.853 --> 00:33:39.853
RESILIENCE.  GIVING THE 
STRUCTURE, THE TREATMENT AND THE

00:33:40.609 --> 00:33:45.787
 MENTORING IN VETERANS TREATMENT
 COURT, THE VETERANS WHO ARE 

00:33:50.208 --> 00:33:52.208
PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROGRAMS 
THRIVE.  THEY, TOO, RETURN HOME 

00:33:52.395 --> 00:33:54.709
TO OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY 
ARE VALUABLE VALUABLE MEMBERS OF

00:33:54.836 --> 00:33:56.836
 OUR COMMUNITIES, LEADERS AND

00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:07.679
 CIVIC ASSETS, WHAT HAS BEEN 
REMARKABLE TO SEE OVER THE PAST 

00:34:07.861 --> 00:34:09.998
THREE AND A HALF YEARS AROUND 
THE COUNTRY AND GETTING TO KNOW 

00:34:10.293 --> 00:34:16.076
THE MEN THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE 
VETERANS COURT PROGRAMS, THEY 

00:34:16.282 --> 00:34:19.838
ARE THE FINEST MEN AND WOMEN 
THAT I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED.  I

00:34:19.992 --> 00:34:23.316
 AM HUMBLED TO KNOW THEM AND 
WATCH ON THEIR BEHALF AND 

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:26.471
WATCHING HOW GRATEFUL THEY ARE 
FOR THE SECOND CHANCE AND HOW 

00:34:26.648 --> 00:34:29.257
COMMITTED THEY ARE TO GIVING 
BACK, PROVES TO ALL OF US EVERY 

00:34:30.141 --> 00:34:32.356
DAY WHY THESE PROGRAMS ARE SO 

00:34:39.865 --> 00:34:41.865
GREATLY NEEDED, THANK YOU. 

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.950
SPEAKER:  I SUFFER FROM GREAT 
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.  AND I 

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.760
FELT LIKE I WAS ALL ALONG WITH 
WHAT I AM DEALING WITH, MY 

00:35:20.411 --> 00:35:27.073
SITUATION.  JUST BUMMED OUT.  NO
 PLACE TO GO.  REALLY, REALLY 

00:35:27.204 --> 00:35:30.658
DEPRESSED.  REAL DEEP 
DEPRESSION.  

00:35:30.659 --> 00:35:33.210
SPEAKER:  I WANTED EVERYTHING TO
 END.  I WANTED TO GET REVENGE. 

00:35:41.907 --> 00:35:46.046
I WANTED TO DIE.  
SPEAKER:  I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH 

00:35:47.239 --> 00:35:50.570
PTSD AND OTHER DISORDERS.  I 
HAVE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND 

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:54.888
SUICIDAL ATTEMPTS.  I GOT 
ARRESTED FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, 

00:35:55.522 --> 00:35:59.728
TWO ASSAULTS.  AND I ENDED UP 
ATTACHING MY FIRST CASE, MY 

00:35:59.854 --> 00:36:02.112
FIRST LEGAL CASE THAT I WAS 
LOOKING AT IN PRISON.  

00:36:02.113 --> 00:36:05.811
SPEAKER:  WHEN I RETURNED HOME 
FROM VIETNAM IN 1968 I HAD NO 

00:36:05.948 --> 00:36:10.302
IDEA WHAT POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS 
DISORDER WAS.  EVERYTHING WAS 

00:36:10.425 --> 00:36:12.335
NORMAL.  
SPEAKER:  I GOT HIM TO DRINKING 

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:15.341
AND THE STUFF THAT GOES WITH 
THAT, KIND OF ACTING OUT.  

00:36:15.342 --> 00:36:18.821
SPEAKER:  I WAS ADDICTED TO 
DRUGS.  I WAS DRINKING A LOT.  I

00:36:19.268 --> 00:36:22.911
 WAS MAKING BAD DECISIONS.  AND 
BASICALLY IT ALL CAUGHT

00:36:26.144 --> 00:36:29.465
 UP WITH ME.  
SPEAKER:  IT PRETTY MUCH 

00:36:30.384 --> 00:36:35.247
SPIRALLED OUT OF CONTROL.  AND 
MY LOWEST POINT WAS, I WAS 

00:36:35.647 --> 00:36:40.034
HOMELESS.  I LIVED IN MY TRUCK 
FOR THREE MONTHS.  AND I GOT A

00:36:43.303 --> 00:36:47.485
 THIRD DUI AND I ENDED UP IN 
JAIL.  

00:36:47.486 --> 00:36:50.131
SPEAKER:  I TOLD PEOPLE THE 
HARDEST PART ABOUT GOING THERE 

00:36:50.557 --> 00:36:53.113
IS GOING HOME.  AND EVERYBODY 
CHANGES OVER THE COURSE OF BEING

00:36:53.663 --> 00:36:55.619
 GONE.  I FELT LIKE A STRANGER 
COMING BACK.  

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.485
SPEAKER:  THE FRIENDS THAT YOU 
MAKE IN THE CIVILIAN WORLD, 

00:36:58.629 --> 00:37:00.848
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE REALLY GREAT 
FRIENDS, THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE 

00:37:01.178 --> 00:37:04.057
FRIENDS YOU HAVE IN THE MARINE 
CORE.  WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MARINE

00:37:04.926 --> 00:37:09.712
 CORE, IT'S A SISTER HOOD AND A 
BROTHERHOOD.  

00:37:09.713 --> 00:37:12.543
SPEAKER:  ONE OF MY REALLY GOOD 
FRIENDS WAS KILLED.  IT REALLY 

00:37:12.842 --> 00:37:17.503
DEVASTATED ME.  I WANTED NOTHING
 TO DO WITH EVERYBODY.  BUT GO 

00:37:17.804 --> 00:37:20.605
DRINK.  
SPEAKER:  THERE WAS A YOUNG 

00:37:20.763 --> 00:37:25.831
GIRL, 15 OR 17 YEARS OLD.  AND 
SHE WAS A CASHIER.  AND I SAW 

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.911
HER, IN MY MIND, WEARING A 
BIRKA. 

00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:39.180
 INSTANTLY I WANTED TO PUNCH 
HER.  AND I REMEMBER TAPPING MY 

00:37:39.181 --> 00:37:42.615
FOOT LEFT AND RIGHT THINKING I'M

00:37:46.276 --> 00:37:48.276
 NOT IN ANOTHER 

00:37:53.554 --> 00:37:55.636
COUNTRY.  
SPEAKER:  GOOD AFTERNOON.  I'M 

00:37:56.231 --> 00:37:59.258
JONATHAN ELIAS.  NEWS ANCHOR 
OVER AT ABC7 NEWS HERE IN TOWN 

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:04.310
WHICH I HOPE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF
 YOU WATCH.  I'M ALSO A ADJUNCT 

00:38:07.006 --> 00:38:09.988
PROFESSOR  AT THE U.S. ARMY WAR 
COLLEGE.  IT STARTED 12 YEARS 

00:38:10.115 --> 00:38:12.856
AGO WHEN I STARTED A WELCOME 
HOME PROJECT AND IT WAS A SIMPLE

00:38:13.029 --> 00:38:15.110
 THING AND IN MY MIND I THOUGHT 
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I WANTED 

00:38:15.111 --> 00:38:20.238
TO DO AND I WANTED TO GIVE A 
HANDSHAKE AND A HUG TO VETERANS 

00:38:20.455 --> 00:38:23.257
RECEIVING A PURPLE HEART.  GOOD 
TO HAVE YOU HOME.  WE LOVE YOU. 

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:30.838
YOU ARE VALUED.  I WAS A HISTORY
 STUDENT IN COLLEGE AFTER WORLD 

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:36.049
WAR II.  THEY DIDN'T CALL IT 
PTSD AT THAT TIME.  THEY SMOKED,

00:38:37.577 --> 00:38:43.122
 THEY DRANKED.  THEY ARE 
ESCAPIST.  I REMEMBER THERE WAS 

00:38:43.412 --> 00:38:45.412
A YOUNG GOOD LOOKING

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:55.717
 CORPSMAN AND HE SAID WHY ARE 
YOU DOING THIS AND HE SHAKED AND

00:38:56.436 --> 00:38:59.993
 HUGGED ME IN MY ARMS.  HERE I 
AM CELEBRATING THESE SPIRITS 

00:38:59.994 --> 00:39:04.925
THAT HAVE SEEMED TO BE UNTOUCHED
 AND UNBROKEN BY WAR, THEY WERE 

00:39:04.926 --> 00:39:11.056
NOT ONLY BEING TOUCHED BUT BEING
 SHATTERED.  IT HAS TO BE 

00:39:11.854 --> 00:39:16.028
EMPHASIZED, IT WAS SOME.  THERE 
IS A STORY.  AND IT NEEDS TO BE 

00:39:16.141 --> 00:39:19.645
TOLD AND IT'S OUR PROBLEM TO 
FIX.  THESE ARE OUR WARRIORS TO 

00:39:19.944 --> 00:39:22.595
GO PROTECT OUR FREEDOMS.  THE 
LEAST WE CAN DO IS FIGURE IT 

00:39:22.726 --> 00:39:27.756
OUT.  THE BEST I CAN TELL FROM 
TALKING TO VETERANS, IF YOU HAVE

00:39:27.874 --> 00:39:31.885
 NEVER EXPERIENCED COMBAT, IT'S 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TRULY TO 

00:39:32.177 --> 00:39:36.491
UNDERSTAND IT.  AND HE WAS WITH 
THE UNIT AND INFANTRY.  HE SAID 

00:39:36.669 --> 00:39:40.888
WITHIN A FIVE-MINUTE PERIOD IN 
MY LIFETIME, I WALKED INTO A 

00:39:41.014 --> 00:39:43.462
SITUATION AND I REMEMBER 
SMELLING GUN SMOKE AND GUN 

00:39:43.686 --> 00:39:46.511
POWDER AND SEEING THREE OF MY 
FRIENDS DEAD ON THE GROUND.  OR 

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.201
AT LEAST PIECES OF THEM.  
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TRANSLATE 

00:39:50.517 --> 00:39:53.012
THAT TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER 
EXPERIENCED COMBAT AND EXPECT 

00:39:53.262 --> 00:39:57.287
THEM TO COME HOME AND OBEY A 
TRAFFIC LIGHT AND HAVE BASEBALL 

00:39:57.517 --> 00:39:59.480
GAMES IN THE BACKGROUND.  THOSE 
ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE 

00:39:59.481 --> 00:40:02.880
DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO
 TRANSITION.  THAT REALLY IS THE

00:40:03.898 --> 00:40:07.277
 GOAL.  HAVING RESOURCES AND 
EXPERTS LIKE YOU SEE HERE IN 

00:40:07.397 --> 00:40:09.814
FRONT OF YOU IS GETTING THE 
CONVERSATION GOING.  THEY HAVE 

00:40:09.992 --> 00:40:13.084
BEEN HAVING THE CONVERSATION A 
LONG TIME.  PERHAPS THE AUDIENCE

00:40:13.347 --> 00:40:18.763

A DEBT OF GRATITUDE.  AND ON THE

00:44:32.485 --> 00:44:36.775
 NEW YORK VIETNAM VETERANS 
MEMORIAL COMMISSION I SERVED ON 

00:44:37.132 --> 00:44:41.326
A COMMITTEE THAT CHOSE DESIGN 
FOR THE MEMORIAL, AND THAT

00:44:47.237 --> 00:44:52.721
 WAS THE BASIS FOR THE BOOK 
WHICH I DID IN ABOUT TEN WEEKS, 

00:44:52.722 --> 00:44:58.061
WITH SEVEN OR EIGHT WEEKS OF 
FINE TUNING.  DID IT FOR THE 

00:44:58.195 --> 00:45:00.195
COMMISSION, HBO DID A FILM

00:45:07.194 --> 00:45:10.809
 BASED ON THIS BOOK.  AND TWO OF
 THE FIRST THREE 

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:20.821

AWARD.  AND MEANWHILE I WAS

NAMED THE FIRST DIRECTOR IN THE 
MAYOR'S OFFICE FROM VETERANS 

00:45:24.452 --> 00:45:27.786

00:45:27.787 --> 00:45:29.787
AND 

00:45:33.745 --> 00:45:37.446
BERNIE LEFT HIS.  
AND I DID SOME OTHER THINGS AND 

00:45:37.995 --> 00:45:40.680
VIETNAM KEEPS COMING BACK.  
I'M A WRITER, A PHOTOGRAPHER, AN

00:45:41.281 --> 00:45:46.276
 EDITOR AND I HAVE DONE A COUPLE
 OF OTHER BOOKS AND I CONSIDER A

00:45:46.437 --> 00:45:48.437
 SECOND CHANCE

00:45:50.082 --> 00:45:53.572
 TO BE ONE OF THE BOOKS.  WHEN I
 MET GREG AND HE ASKED ME TO DO 

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.762
SOMETHING, I THINK HE WAS 
THINKING OF, YOU KNOW, 16 PAGE 

00:45:58.023 --> 00:46:01.810
BROCHURE, SHORT BOOKLET ABOUT 
HOW TO DEAL WITH VETERANS 

00:46:01.811 --> 00:46:07.213
TREATMENT CORE.  I TOLD HIM I 
WOULD DO SOMETHING UNLIKE ANY 

00:46:07.214 --> 00:46:10.283
GOVERNMENT PUBLICATION.  AND I 
THINK WE HAVE SUCCEEDED ON THAT.

00:46:10.284 --> 00:46:16.375
  I GAVE HIM 40,000 WORDS AND A 
LOT OF IT WOULD BE WORDS OF THE 

00:46:16.376 --> 00:46:24.439
FOLKS WE SPOKE WITH TOGETHER.  
DR. BURGER, MYSELF, GREG.  IT 

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.774
WAS AN EXPERIENCE.  I WAS SO 
IMPRESSED,

00:46:30.792 --> 00:46:36.983
 SO TAKEN BY THE SENSE OF 
COMMITMENT.  THE ELEGANCE OF THE

00:46:37.397 --> 00:46:41.869
 FOLKS WE SPOKE WITH, WHETHER 
THEY WERE GRADUATES OF THE 

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.848
VETERANS TREATMENT COURT OR 
WORKED IN THE VETERANS TREATMENT

00:46:45.181 --> 00:46:50.835
 COURT.  AND THEY TOLD THE 
STORIES BEAUTIFULLY.  AND THIS 

00:46:50.836 --> 00:46:54.923
IS SOMETHING THAT STUCK WITH ME.

00:46:54.924 --> 00:47:00.829
NIC DESERVES ALL OF THE CREDIT 
IN THE WORLD FOR DOING A LOT OF 

00:47:01.424 --> 00:47:04.620
STUFF TO HELP JUSTICE-INVOLVED 
VETERANS.  THEY FORMED THE 

00:47:05.574 --> 00:47:09.134
JUSTICE-INVOLVED VETERANS 
NETWORK.  FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE 

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:15.972
FIELD AND MYSELF SERVE ON IT.  
AND WE HOPE TO DO THINGS THAT 

00:47:16.412 --> 00:47:20.345
WILL AFFECT POLICY.  
NOT ONLY ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, 

00:47:20.702 --> 00:47:22.702
BUT FROM STATE

00:47:27.257 --> 00:47:31.686
 TO STATE TO STATE.  BECAUSE 
VETERANS TODAY CHOOSE TO SERVE 

00:47:31.687 --> 00:47:36.935
IN THE MILITARY.
NO LONGER IS ANYONE CONSCRIPTED.

00:47:37.209 --> 00:47:41.553
IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT OF BIRTH 
THAT YOU SERVE IN THE MILITARY. 

00:47:42.565 --> 00:47:46.802
WE OWE SOMETHING TO THOSE WHO 
SERVE.  AND IF THEY GET IN 

00:47:47.075 --> 00:47:52.287
TROUBLE WITH THE LAW, AND GET 
CAUGHT UP AND THE GREAT CRIMINAL

00:47:52.406 --> 00:47:59.010
 JUSTICE SYSTEM, WE HAVE TO DO 
EVERYTHING WE CAN DO HELP THEM 

00:47:59.819 --> 00:48:03.074
DIVERT FROM IMPRISONMENT, HELP 
THEM GET THEIR LIVES TOGETHER, 

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:09.496
IF THEY ARE IMPRISONED.  HELP 
THEM WHEN THEY GET OUT WITH 

00:48:09.702 --> 00:48:14.274
MENTORS.  HELP THEM REACT TO THE
 SOCIETY THAT A LOT OF FOLKS 

00:48:14.275 --> 00:48:21.555
FEEL HAS ABANDONED THEM.  AND 
WITH THAT?  

00:48:21.556 --> 00:48:24.511
SPEAKER:  JUDGE?  
SPEAKER:  I'M VANCE PETERSON.  

00:48:25.016 --> 00:48:28.276
I'M DISTRICT COURT JUDGE IN 
SPOKANE AND I HAVE BEEN ON THE 

00:48:28.524 --> 00:48:31.124
BENCH FOR 26 YEARS AND DURING 
THE COURSE OF THAT TIME I SERVED

00:48:31.301 --> 00:48:37.471
 29 YEARS ACTIVE RESERVE AND 
GUARD.  UNLIKE BERNIE I WAS NOT 

00:48:37.645 --> 00:48:43.908
IN THE PROJECTS IN NEW YORK.  I 
GREW UP IN A SMALL RANCH.  AND 

00:48:44.349 --> 00:48:46.648
AT THAT TIME I WANTED AN 
EDUCATION BADLY.  OUR HIGH 

00:48:46.884 --> 00:48:51.152
SCHOOL HAD LOST 5 INDIVIDUALS IN
 VIETNAM.  AND THAT WAS NOT A 

00:48:51.363 --> 00:48:54.787
CONSIDERATION OF COURSE WHEN YOU
 ARE 18.  AND THE COURSE FOR ME 

00:48:55.029 --> 00:48:58.111
IS TO FOLLOW A LONG STANDING 
FAMILY TRADITION OF ENLISTING IN

00:48:58.512 --> 00:49:01.076
 THE MARINE CORE WHICH EVERYBODY
 IN MY FAMILY WAS.  OR ONE DAY I

00:49:01.305 --> 00:49:06.677
 GOT AN ENVELOPE FROM THE ARMY 
SAYS CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE A

00:49:07.364 --> 00:49:10.567
 FOUR-YEAR SCHOLARSHIP AND I 
TOOK THAT OPPORTUNITY AND WENT 

00:49:10.568 --> 00:49:16.308
TO SCHOOL AT GONZOGA AND AFTER 
THAT I SERVED FOUR YEARS ON 

00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:20.974
ACTIVE DUTY.  TWO AND A HALF TO 
THREE YEARS IN THE INFANTRY AND 

00:49:20.975 --> 00:49:25.190
GOT INVOLVED WITH THE SPECIAL 
FORCES AND WENT TO THE 

00:49:25.191 --> 00:49:29.142
QUALIFICATIONS COURSE AT RANGER 
SCHOOL AND ENDED UP IN 28 YEARS 

00:49:29.143 --> 00:49:34.045
OF SERVICE IN 2003 AT THE AGE OF
 50, BEING TOLD BY THE GUARD, 

00:49:34.046 --> 00:49:36.430
YOU'RE TOO OLD.  SO YOU'RE OUT. 

00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:39.565
SO I KIND OF JUST WENT BACK TO 
BEING A JUDGE, WHICH IS WHAT I 

00:49:39.769 --> 00:49:44.974
WAS DOING FOR A LIVING ANYWAY.  
ABOUT 2000, I THINK IT WAS THE 

00:49:45.147 --> 00:49:49.530
FALL OF 2009, WE STARTED SEEING,
 ON OUR BENCH, AN INFLUX OF 

00:49:49.652 --> 00:49:53.420
PRIMARILY YOUNG MALES, AND SOME 
YOUNG FEMALES WHO WERE COMING IN

00:49:53.606 --> 00:49:56.369
 REALLY WITH NO CRIMINAL HISTORY
 AND NO BACKGROUND.  IT WAS MORE

00:49:56.490 --> 00:50:01.583
 OR LESS LIKELY NORMALLY SO WITH
 "NORMAL 

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.512
 CRIMINALS" AND THERE WAS 
MILITARY SERVANTS AND I NOTICED 

00:50:09.513 --> 00:50:15.096
THAT THEY WERE ALL VETERANS.  AT
 THAT TIME I WAS RUNNING A 

00:50:15.097 --> 00:50:19.010
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COURT AND I 
RESEARCHED AND FOUND OUT WITH 

00:50:19.011 --> 00:50:25.504
JUDGE ROBERT RUSSEL, AN 
INCREDIBLE MAN.  AND WE MODELLED

00:50:25.758 --> 00:50:29.132
 EVERYTHING WE DID AFTER HIM IN 
SPOKANE COUNTY.  AND WE PUT 

00:50:29.328 --> 00:50:32.936
TOGETHER A VETERANS COURT.  AND 
AFTER THE FIRST YEAR WE ARE 

00:50:33.117 --> 00:50:34.848
GETTING READY TO GO TO 
GRADUATION.  WE'RE GOING TO 

00:50:34.849 --> 00:50:38.979
GRADUATE THE FIRST GUY.  WE ARE 
VERY VERY EXCITED.  I WON'T GIVE

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:46.469
 YOU HIS LAST NAME.  BUT SERVED 
TWO TOURS WITH THE BATTALION IN 

00:50:47.298 --> 00:50:52.968
IRAQ AND DID TWO NATIONAL GUARD 
TOURS WITH THE 161 INFANTRY AND 

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.956
HE WAS A PSYCHOLOGY STUDENT AT 
WSU.  SPOKANE WASHINGTON, ABOUT 

00:50:56.534 --> 00:51:00.649
60 MILES NORTH.  THE HIS BE 
LOVED GIRLFRIEND THEN CALLED HIM

00:51:00.864 --> 00:51:05.238
 UP ONE DAY AND SAID I THINK 
WE'RE GOING TO BREAK UP AND DID 

00:51:06.203 --> 00:51:09.270
WHAT ANY GUY WOULD HAVE DONE AT 
THAT TIME.  

00:51:09.271 --> 00:51:12.950
DRANK WHISKEY AND DROVE ALL OF 
THE WAY TO SPOKANE AND 

00:51:13.181 --> 00:51:18.314
PROFESSING HIS LOVE TO HIS 
GIRLFRIEND.  AND TWO LAW 

00:51:18.564 --> 00:51:21.274
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CAME UP 
BEHIND HIM AND TURNED INTO THREE

00:51:22.131 --> 00:51:25.344
 FELONIES.  HE HAD TWO ASSAULTS 
ON AN OFFICER AND HAD THE 

00:51:25.472 --> 00:51:30.318
BREAKING AND ENTERING LEAK INTO 
THE APARTMENT AND WHEN THEY GOT 

00:51:30.526 --> 00:51:34.246
THERE THAT YEAR EARLIER, THEY 
REDUCED THE FELONIES TO 

00:51:34.538 --> 00:51:36.945
MISDEMEANORS AND CARRIED THEM TO
 DISMISSAL IF HE COMPLETED THE 

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.415
PROGRAM.  AND HE DID COMPLETE 
THE PROGRAM.  AS A MATTER OF 

00:51:40.841 --> 00:51:43.395
FACT HE REQUESTED TO GET OUT 
EARLY BY ABOUT TWO WEEKS BECAUSE

00:51:43.538 --> 00:51:47.015
 HE HAD TO GO ON HIS FIFTH 
DEPLOYMENT.  AND HE DEFINITELY 

00:51:47.319 --> 00:51:52.083
HAD PTSD BUT AT THAT TIME, HE 
JUST WENT AHEAD ANYWAY.  

00:51:52.084 --> 00:51:57.419
WE GRADUATED HIM EARLY AND AT 
THAT TIME MY PHONE RANG.  A 

00:51:57.545 --> 00:52:02.535
FRIEND OF MINE IN DC SAYS HEY, 
YOU RETIRED.  YOU ARE 58.  HOW 

00:52:02.662 --> 00:52:06.047
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO 
AFGHANISTAN FOR A YEAR.  AND I 

00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:12.615
SAID, I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO 
COSTA RICA AND I WOULD LIKE TO 

00:52:12.746 --> 00:52:17.646
GO TO HAWAII AND IT WOULD BE FOR
 THE AFGHAN UNIT.  AND I GAVE 

00:52:17.647 --> 00:52:22.660
HIM A YEAR.  I LEARNED MORE IN 
THAT YEAR ABOUT PTSD AND THE 

00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:24.661
YOUNG PEOPLE FIGHTING THIS ARE 
WA,

00:52:31.725 --> 00:52:34.004
R.  
AND EVERY DAY OF 26, ALL 

00:52:34.405 --> 00:52:39.493
NATIONAL GUARDS MAN, WITH AN 
AVERAGE OF ABOUT TWO YEARS OF 

00:52:40.798 --> 00:52:43.567
COMBAT TOURS.  THAT'S HOW THEY 
MADE THEIR LIVING.  ODDLY ENOUGH

00:52:43.775 --> 00:52:47.438
 WHEN I GOT INVITED TO THE UNIT,
 ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS WAS THE 

00:52:47.862 --> 00:52:52.121
GUY THAT FIRST GRADUATED FROM 
OUR CLASS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY 

00:52:52.385 --> 00:52:56.105
HE WAS MY GUARDIAN ANGEL IN THE 
PAST TWO MONTHS IN AFGHANISTAN. 

00:52:56.216 --> 00:53:00.374
AND WITH THAT, GRADUATED 140 
PEOPLE AND EVERYONE IS REQUIRED 

00:53:00.505 --> 00:53:05.224
TO READ A LETTER TO THE COURT 
UPON GRADUATION.  20 OF THEM 

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:08.550
INDICATED ON THE RECORD THEY 
COULD HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE, 

00:53:08.623 --> 00:53:12.327
BUT FOR THIS PROGRAM.  SO ITS 
BEEN AN INCREDIBLE EVENT FOR ME 

00:53:12.975 --> 00:53:16.753
AND INCREDIBLE HONOR TO BE WITH 
THIS PANEL AND BEING SANDWICHED 

00:53:16.968 --> 00:53:24.066
BETWEEN THESE TWO VIETNAM VETS, 
I FEEL SOMEWHAT SMALL.  

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:27.548
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU.  ON TOM 
BERGER.  

00:53:27.549 --> 00:53:33.798
SPEAKER:  DR. TOM BERGER.  I AM 
THE SON OF TWO WORLD WAR II 

00:53:34.834 --> 00:53:39.735
VETS.  MY FATHER WAS WITH 
CARLTON RADARS, A MARINE 

00:53:39.868 --> 00:53:46.854
BATTALION WHO WAS WOUNDED AND AT
 THE TIME, MARINES SPENT THEM TO

00:53:47.035 --> 00:53:53.017
 THE BALBOA HOSPITAL, AND THIS 
REDHEADED NURSE.  SO HERE I AM. 

00:53:53.167 --> 00:53:58.966
IN ANY CASE, I GREW UP IN A 
FAMILY THAT WAS VERY IN TUNE TO 

00:53:59.862 --> 00:54:03.015
MILITARY SERVICE.  NOT ONLY MY 
PARENTS.  MY GRAND PARENTS ON 

00:54:03.373 --> 00:54:10.202
BOTH SIDES SERVED IN WORLD WAR 
ONE.  IN FACT MY PATERNAL 

00:54:10.329 --> 00:54:13.784
GRANDFATHER WAS A TANKER IN 
WORLD WAR ONE AND GREW UP WITH A

00:54:13.907 --> 00:54:17.356
 PICTURE OF HIM STANDING OUTSIDE
 THIS VEHICLE THAT LOOKED LIKE 

00:54:19.282 --> 00:54:24.684
THE MILLENNIUM FALCON.  ALL 
RIGHT.  IT PROBABLY RAN THREE 

00:54:24.879 --> 00:54:34.500
MILES AND THEN IT BROKE DOWN.  
BUT ANYWAY, SO IN 1965, I GOT A 

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:40.381
LETTER FROM THE ARMY THAT SAYS 
WE REQUEST YOUR PRESENCE.  SO 

00:54:41.505 --> 00:54:47.257
NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO, I CALLED
 MY DAD.  AND I SAID POPS, WHAT 

00:54:47.558 --> 00:54:49.558
DO I DO?  HE SAID, I DON'T WANT 

00:54:53.586 --> 00:54:59.248
YOU IN THE ARMY.  AND I DON'T 
WANT YOU IN THE MARINES.  

00:54:59.249 --> 00:55:01.806
BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY OVER 
THERE AND THEY ARE GETTING THEIR

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:04.430
 ASS KICKED.  WHY DON'T YOU TRY 

00:55:10.265 --> 00:55:15.069
THE NAVY?  SO I FOUND OUT WHERE 
THE NEAREST NAVY RECRUITER WAS 

00:55:15.619 --> 00:55:18.702
AND RAN OVER THERE AND JOINED.  
AND JUST AFTER I RAISED MY HAND,

00:55:19.043 --> 00:55:22.394
 I RAN INTO A HIGH SCHOOL 
CLASSMATE IN HIS UNIFORM, REALLY

00:55:23.231 --> 00:55:25.231
 LOOKED SHORP. 

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:31.077
  AND HE SAID TOM, ARE YOU STILL
 GOING TO SCHOOL?  

00:55:31.078 --> 00:55:36.771
AND I SAID YEAH, I DON'T HAVE 
ENOUGH HOURS.  SO I GOT DRAFTED.

00:55:36.894 --> 00:55:41.839
AND HE SAID WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR. 
AND I SAID PRE-MED.  YOU OUGHT 

00:55:42.256 --> 00:55:48.149
TO SIGN UP TO BE A CORPSMAN.  I 
JUST DID TWO YEARS AT MEMPHIS 

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.733
NAVAL AIR STATION.  THERE WERE 
WOMEN.  SKILLS THAT I LEARNED.  

00:55:52.191 --> 00:55:55.800
AND IT WAS COOL.  AND I RAN 
RIGHT IN AND SIGNED UP TO GO TO 

00:55:56.202 --> 00:55:59.362
CORPSMAN SCHOOL AND WHEN I GOT 
HOME, I THOUGHT MY FATHER WAS 

00:55:59.508 --> 00:56:03.657
GOING TO BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF 
ME.  HE SAID, DO YOU KNOW WHAT 

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.584
CORPSMAN DO?  I SAID NO, POPS.  
THE HE SAID, THEY SERVE WITH THE

00:56:08.489 --> 00:56:15.440
 MARINES.  SO I SERVED WITH THE 
MARINES IN VIETNAM.  OFF AND ON.

00:56:15.715 --> 00:56:20.412
THIRD DIVISION, THIRD BATTALION 
AND THIRD RECOMP.  GOT THE MAGIC

00:56:20.678 --> 00:56:25.978
 WOUND IN THE SPRING OF 1968 AT 
CASON.  WHEN I CAME HOME,

00:56:29.179 --> 00:56:32.836
 THE COUNTRY WAS NUTS, I TRIED 
TO BE AN EMT OR WHAT THEY CALL 

00:56:33.401 --> 00:56:37.495
EMTS NOW, BUT THERE WAS NO 
COORDINATION AMONGST POLICE, 

00:56:38.975 --> 00:56:40.975
FIRE OR EMERGENCY

00:56:42.721 --> 00:56:49.108
 MEDICAL PEOPLE.  SO WE WENT 
INTO A SITUATION IN ROCKSBURY, 

00:56:49.224 --> 00:56:53.390
MASSACHUSETTS.  AND I WENT BACK 
TO BOSTON FOR THE LOVE OF A 

00:56:53.554 --> 00:56:56.535
WOMAN WHICH DIDN'T WORK OUT.  
AND THEN GOT CALLED DOWN TO 

00:56:56.729 --> 00:57:00.291
PROJECTS FOR GUNSHOT WOUNDS ON 
THE 7TH FLOOR WHILE THE 

00:57:00.514 --> 00:57:08.683
ELEVATORS WEREN'T WORKING AND WE
 HAD TO TAKE A DOOR OFF AND PUT 

00:57:08.919 --> 00:57:13.663
THIS LARGE PERSON ON THE DOOR 
AND TAKE HER DOWN SEVEN FLOORS 

00:57:13.979 --> 00:57:18.144
WHILE PEOPLE WERE SHOOTING.  
AND I THOUGHT, YOU JUST CAME 

00:57:18.474 --> 00:57:21.653
BACK FROM TWO YEARS OF THIS 
STUFF, AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHY 

00:57:21.785 --> 00:57:26.175
YOU WERE THERE.  NOW YOU ARE 
HERE IN THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, 

00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:32.071
OKAY AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS 
GOING ON HERE.  SO I FOOLED 

00:57:32.274 --> 00:57:36.882
AROUND A LITTLE ABOUT WITH 
ANTIWAR GROUPS, SDS.  A COUPLE 

00:57:36.984 --> 00:57:39.817
OF OTHER GROUPS AND DECIDED THE 
ONLY WAY I CAN DEAL WITH THINGS 

00:57:40.304 --> 00:57:42.304
WAS TO THROW MYSELF INTO 

00:57:44.933 --> 00:57:46.933
SCHOOL, WHICH I DID.  
THAT'S HOW I

00:57:52.603 --> 00:57:56.924
 DEALT WITH MY STUFF, 
PARTICIPATING IN WHAT WE CALL 

00:57:56.925 --> 00:58:01.674
RAP GROUPS.  WE MET IN THE 
LIBRARY MEETING ROOMS, CHURCH

00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:07.745
 BASEMENTS AND BARS IN THE BACK 
ROOMS WHERE WE TALK ABOUT OUR 

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:11.698
COMMON EXPERIENCES.  THERE WERE 
NO VET CENTERS AT THE TIME.  AND

00:58:12.234 --> 00:58:15.614
 IN FACT THE CURRENT VET CENTER 
SYSTEM AS WE KNOW IT CAME OUT OF

00:58:15.942 --> 00:58:21.810
 VETS RAP GROUPS STARTED BY 
VIETNAM VETS.  IN ANY CASE, I 

00:58:21.942 --> 00:58:27.933
JUST THREW MYSELF INTO SCHOOL 
AND GOT MORE DEGREES THAN A 

00:58:28.154 --> 00:58:30.154
THERMOMETER.  POINT BEING, 
THAT'S HOW I DEALT

00:58:35.553 --> 00:58:39.525
 WITH IT AND GOT INTERESTED.  
AND THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT OF THEM

00:58:39.857 --> 00:58:45.403
 IN MY ACADEMIC WORK.  MY LAST 
POSITION, I RAN A LITTLE CENTER,

00:58:45.631 --> 00:58:51.292
 RESEARCH CENTER, AND WE STUDY 
HIGH RISK BEHAVIORS INCLUDING 

00:58:54.355 --> 00:58:58.425
SUICIDE, AND VIOLENCE.
SO THAT'S HOW I GOT FROM THERE 

00:58:58.553 --> 00:59:07.599
TO HERE.  I THINK THE COURTS ARE
 A PHENOMENAL, PHENOMENAL 

00:59:07.787 --> 00:59:09.787
HAPPENING.  AND THE WORD

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:16.853
 NEEDS TO BE SPREAD.  AS SOME OF
 MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID VIA 

00:59:16.854 --> 00:59:21.183
THEIR EXPERIENCE.  IT'S 
INCREDIBLE.  

00:59:21.184 --> 00:59:26.445
ONE STORY AND THEN I WILL 
SHORTEN THINGS UP HERE.  AS PART

00:59:26.612 --> 00:59:30.213
 OF THE WHITE BOOK PROCEDURES, I
 SPENT SOME TIME OUT ON THE WEST

00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:36.997
 COAST IN A VETERANS COURT OUT 
THERE IN SANTA ANNA.  AND SO 

00:59:37.601 --> 00:59:42.726
SANTA ANNA WHERE THE COURTS ARE 
LOCATED, IT'S NOT IN A VERY NICE

00:59:43.159 --> 00:59:46.540
 NEIGHBORHOOD.  IN FACT WHEN I 
GOT THERE, THEY WANTED TO KNOW 

00:59:46.689 --> 00:59:50.385
IF I WANTED AN ESCORT BECAUSE I 
WOULD COME IN AT LIKE 7:30 IN 

00:59:51.052 --> 00:59:54.020
THE MORNING AND NOT LEAVE UNTIL 
7:30 IN THE EVENING DOING MY 

00:59:54.226 --> 00:59:57.869
INTERVIEWS AND STUFF.  THE MOST 
IMPRESSIVE THING ABOUT IT WAS 

00:59:57.998 --> 01:00:03.104
THAT A NEW JUDGE HAD TAKEN OVER 
IN THE VET COURT THERE.  AND HE 

01:00:03.794 --> 01:00:10.097
WAS TRYING TO FILL THE SHOES OF 
SOMEONE WHO HAD BIG SHOES TO 

01:00:10.293 --> 01:00:12.293
FILL IN THE

01:00:13.345 --> 01:00:18.181
 VET TREATMENT COURT BUSINESS.  
AND SO WHEN I WALKED INTO HIS 

01:00:18.679 --> 01:00:21.348
CHAMBERS, HERE ARE ALL OF THESE 
BOOKS, WRITTEN BY

01:00:24.751 --> 01:00:27.823
 VETERANS, ABOUT VETERANS.  AND 
I THOUGHT THIS WAS PRETTY 

01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:32.114
SCHOOL.  HE HAD SURROUNDED 
HIMSELF WITH VETERANS AS PART OF

01:00:32.115 --> 01:00:38.394
 THE VETERAN TREATMENT COURT IN 
SANTA ANNA.  AND THEN THE MOST 

01:00:38.395 --> 01:00:43.117
AMAZING THING HAPPENED, THEY 
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DOCKET.  

01:00:43.118 --> 01:00:46.352
PEOPLE ON THE DOCKET FOR THE 
DAY.  AND THE JUDGE LOOKED AT ME

01:00:46.526 --> 01:00:51.389
 AND HE SAID, DOC, WOULD YOU 
MIND STAYING AROUND?  

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:55.919
I THINK MAYBE WE WOULD LIKE YOUR
 PROFESSIONAL OPINION.  I HAVE 

01:00:56.043 --> 01:01:00.125
SOME DEGREES IN MENTAL HEALTH.  
SO I SAID, SURE.  AND I DID.  

01:01:00.259 --> 01:01:07.444
THIS IS THE VERY, VERY, VERY 
SERIOUS CASE.  WE ARE TALKING 

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:15.145
PY ROMANIA HERE.  NOT ONLY THE 
INDIVIDUAL.  BUT EVERYTHING 

01:01:15.534 --> 01:01:19.179
AROUND HIM.  THE PERSON REALLY 
NEEDED HELP.  SO THE DISCUSSION 

01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:23.825
FOCUSED ON HOW CAN WE BEST HELP 
THIS PERSON?  HELP THIS PERSON. 

01:01:24.108 --> 01:01:28.875
THE WHO HAS THIS REALLY SERIOUS 

01:01:33.165 --> 01:01:36.102
PROBLEM CAUSED BY THIS PERSON 
WHO HAS REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEMS.

01:01:38.058 --> 01:01:41.156
TBI AND OTHER THINGS.  I THINK 
IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, THEY DID 

01:01:41.361 --> 01:01:46.933
THE BEST THING THEY COULD.  AND 
THAT IS, THEY PUT HIM IN

01:01:50.813 --> 01:01:55.351
 SUPERVISED LIVING CONDITIONS 
WHERE HE WAS MONITORED.  IF HE 

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.533
WOULD HAVE LIVED ON THE OUTSIDE,
 HE DID WANT TO LIVE WITH HIS 

01:01:58.844 --> 01:02:02.163
SISTER.  AND IF HE HAD LIVED 
WITH HIS SISTER AND BURNED THE 

01:02:02.354 --> 01:02:06.275
HOUSE DOWN, PERHAPS WOULD KILL 
HER AND THE FAMILY AS WELL.  AND

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:13.201
 I THOUGHT, WOW, WOW.  
AND IT WAS THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED 

01:02:13.383 --> 01:02:19.721
BY ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE 
COURT, THERE WAS NO ACRIMONY 

01:02:19.976 --> 01:02:22.977
INVOLVED AND HE HAD BURNED DOWN 
HOUSES AND DONE THESE THINGS AND

01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:26.183
 WE NEED TO LOCK HIM UP.  IT WAS

01:02:29.304 --> 01:02:33.159
AN AMAZING EVENT FOR ME.  SO I 
THINK THE VET COURTS, AS I SAID 

01:02:33.532 --> 01:02:37.745
EARLIER, ARE THE BEST THING THAT
 HAVE HAPPENED.  

01:02:37.746 --> 01:02:40.794
I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT SOME 
FOLKS ARE DOING NOW.  LOOKING AT

01:02:41.173 --> 01:02:45.878
 WHEN FOLKS GET OUT OF THE 
SYSTEM AND HOW WE GET THEM BACK 

01:02:45.879 --> 01:02:52.442
INTO LIFE.  BECAUSE PRISON IS A 
DIFFERENT LIFE.  BUT IN ANY 

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:56.201
CASE, IT'S THE BEST THING THAT 
HAS HAPPENED TO VETERANS SINCE 

01:02:56.202 --> 01:03:01.025
THE VA WAS STARTED AND WE ALL 
KNOW ABOUT THE VA.  BUT IN ANY 

01:03:01.227 --> 01:03:04.757
CASE, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO 
THIS MARINE OVER HERE.  

01:03:10.004 --> 01:03:12.004
SPEAKER:  TIMOTHY WYNN.  
SPEAKER:  MY NAME IS TIMOTHY 

01:03:12.281 --> 01:03:15.264
WYNN.  I'M FROM PHILADELPHIA AND
 I SERVED IN THE GREATEST 

01:03:15.452 --> 01:03:19.258
FIGHTING FORCE KNOWN TO MAN 
KIND, THE UNITED STATES MARINE 

01:03:19.388 --> 01:03:22.825
CORE.  I'M A LITTLE BIAS I 
GUESS.  

01:03:22.826 --> 01:03:28.628
SPEAKER:  ALL OF THE ARMIES, 
NAVY, COASTIES.  

01:03:28.629 --> 01:03:31.599
SPEAKER:  WE ROCK.  
SPEAKER:  NO, BUT I HAVEN'T 

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.741
WRITTEN A BOOK.  BUT AFTER 
TODAY, I THINK I MAY BE WILLING 

01:03:37.503 --> 01:03:41.457
TO DO THAT.  I HAVE A STORY TO 
TELL AND I AM LUCKY ENOUGH TO GO

01:03:41.694 --> 01:03:44.513
 AROUND AND TELL MY STORY.  I 
GRADUATED FROM THE PHILADELPHIA 

01:03:44.685 --> 01:03:47.267
VETERANS COURT AND NOW I'M A 
MENTOR IN THE SAME COURT THAT I 

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:50.965
GRADUATED FROM.  I STICK AROUND 
THERE BECAUSE THERE IS ALWAYS A 

01:03:51.096 --> 01:03:54.238
YOUNGER VERSION OF ME COMING 
THROUGH THE DOOR EVERY WEEK.  I 

01:03:54.451 --> 01:03:56.895
LIKE TO HELP THEM.  I REMEMBER 
WALKING THROUGH THE DOOR NOT 

01:03:57.356 --> 01:04:00.330
HAVING ANY HOPE.  AND PEOPLE 
LEND IT TO ME.  SO I AM THERE TO

01:04:00.448 --> 01:04:06.122
 LEND HOPE TO THE VETERANS THAT 
ARE COMING THROUGH.  I HAD SEVEN

01:04:06.516 --> 01:04:09.742
 ARRESTS BEFORE I ENDED UP IN 
PHILADELPHIA VETERANS COURT.  

01:04:09.884 --> 01:04:12.919
WHEN I GOT INTO PHILADELPHIA 
VETERANS COURT, THAT WAS MY LAST

01:04:13.405 --> 01:04:16.488
 ARREST.  I HAVEN'T BEEN 
ARRESTED SINCE.  I'M WORKING ON 

01:04:16.489 --> 01:04:20.310
SEVEN YEARS CLEAN AND SOBER.  IT
 HAS ABSOLUTELY CHANGED MY LIFE 

01:04:20.438 --> 01:04:24.757
AROUND, TO SAY THE LEAST.  I WAS
 HOUSED IN THE PHILADELPHIA 

01:04:25.021 --> 01:04:28.600
COUNTY JAIL FOR A YEAR OF MY 
LIFE DURING SEVERAL YEARS OF 

01:04:29.352 --> 01:04:34.646
ARREST.  AND ADDICTION AND 
EVERYTHING ELSE.  AND I AM NOW 

01:04:35.036 --> 01:04:38.190
IN THAT PRISON ON MONDAYS AND 
FRIDAYS, FACILITATING TRAUMA 

01:04:38.381 --> 01:04:42.062
GROUPS AND INMATES WHO ARE 
LOCKED UP IN THAT SAME PRISON.  

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.792
WHEN I WAS IN THAT PRISON, THERE
 WAS NOBODY THERE.  I WAS KIND 

01:04:44.793 --> 01:04:48.673
OF BY MYSELF.  SOCIETY REALLY 
WASN'T READY FOR THE VETERANS 

01:04:48.846 --> 01:04:53.389
THAT WERE COMING BACK FROM IRAQ 
AND AFGHANISTAN.  IT WAS A 

01:04:53.636 --> 01:04:59.718
LONELY TIME IN MY LIFE.  I MAKE 
SURE THAT I AM THERE FOR THE 

01:04:59.902 --> 01:05:03.074
VETERANS THERE BEHIND THAT WALL 
EVERY DAY.  I TRY TO CONTINUE TO

01:05:03.223 --> 01:05:07.421
 DO THIS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND I 
AM LUCKY TO BE HERE AND LUCKY 

01:05:07.787 --> 01:05:10.866
THAT I HAVE FRIENDS AT JUSTICE 
FOR VETS.  AN ORGANIZATION THAT 

01:05:11.042 --> 01:05:13.988
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT.  WHAT 
THEY DO FOR VETERANS IN THIS 

01:05:14.356 --> 01:05:17.430
COUNTRY EVERY SINGLE DAY IT'S 
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  

01:05:17.431 --> 01:05:20.970
SPEAKER:  GOOD TO HAVE ALL OF 
YOU HERE.  GOOD TO POINT OUT, IF

01:05:21.298 --> 01:05:25.476
 YOU ARE NEW TO THE TERM PTSD OR
 DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS, 

01:05:25.686 --> 01:05:28.284
IF YOU HAVE A COMMON COLD, THE 
SYMPTOMS ARE EASY.  YOU HAVE A 

01:05:28.456 --> 01:05:32.051
FEVER, CHILL, YOU STAY IN BED 
FOR A WEEK.  PTSD IS NOT SO 

01:05:32.273 --> 01:05:34.824
SIMPLE.  DOESN'T HAVE ANY KIND 
OF SYMPTOMS THAT YOU NECESSARILY

01:05:34.948 --> 01:05:39.028
 CAN POINT TO.  IN ONE 
INDIVIDUAL IT CAN BE SEVERE, 

01:05:41.148 --> 01:05:42.838
CHRONIC, DEBILITATING TO THE 
POINT WHERE THEY CAN'T GET OUT 

01:05:42.839 --> 01:05:47.538
OF BED.  THE OTHER, FULLY 
FUNCTIONING.  SO YOU CAN'T HAVE 

01:05:47.539 --> 01:05:51.820
A BLANKET TO TREAT PTSD.  I AM 
SURE ALL OF YOU ON STAGE AGREE 

01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:54.479
WITH THAT AS WELL.  JUDGE, I 
WANTED TO START WITH YOU.  YOU 

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.767
TALK ABOUT IT IN A LITTLE BIT OF
 THE INTRODUCTION.  IN MOST OF 

01:05:57.768 --> 01:06:01.971
THE CASES, WHAT PERCENTAGE WOULD
 YOU ATTACH FOR THE FOLKS THAT 

01:06:01.972 --> 01:06:05.708
COME BEFORE YOUR BENCH AS 
VETERANS, HOW MANY WOULD NOT BE 

01:06:05.709 --> 01:06:08.217
BEFORE YOU HAD THEY NOT 
EXPERIENCED WHAT THEY DID IN 

01:06:08.404 --> 01:06:12.093
SERVICE?  
SPEAKER:  I WOULD SAY AS MUCH AS

01:06:14.229 --> 01:06:17.692
 80%.  THESE FOLKS, THE PATTERN,
 THERE IS A PROGRESSION THAT WE 

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:23.873
SEE AS JUVENILES GO INTO ADULT 
HOOD, THERE MIGHT BE LIGHTWEIGHT

01:06:24.827 --> 01:06:28.183
 THINGS.  AND IT COULD BE A 
SERIES OF SPEEDING TICKETS.  

01:06:28.521 --> 01:06:31.858
RECKLESS DRIVING AND MAYBE A 
MINOR ASSAULT AT SOME KIND.  BUT

01:06:32.083 --> 01:06:35.656
 THE PATTERN THAT WE SAW WASN'T 
LIKE THAT AT ALL.  THE INSTANCES

01:06:36.766 --> 01:06:42.431
 GENERALLY OCCURRED AFTER THEIR 
TOURS OF DUTY.  AND I WOULD 

01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:47.283
EASILY SAY 80% OF THEM WOULDN'T 
BE IN FRONT OF US, DUE TO 

01:06:47.489 --> 01:06:50.516
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THEM IN THE
 DEPLOYMENTS.  

01:06:50.517 --> 01:06:52.951
SPEAKER:  IN THE COURT AND 
CORRECTIONS, THEY ALWAYS HAD A 

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:57.440
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO 
VETERANS, THAT HAS CHANGED.  

01:06:57.957 --> 01:07:02.400
SPEAKER:  THAT HAS CHANGED.  I 
WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THE 3,000 

01:07:02.627 --> 01:07:04.936
MIDDLE, EXCUSE ME, DRUG COURTS 
IN THE NATION TODAY.  I KNOW 

01:07:05.059 --> 01:07:07.059
THERE IS 330

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:15.866
 VETERANS COURTS, MY PUSH IS TO 
GET 3,000 VETERANS COURTS.  

01:07:15.867 --> 01:07:19.565
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.  
THE CHANGE IS SUBSTANTIAL.  THE 

01:07:20.878 --> 01:07:23.732
VETERANS -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY 
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT, BUT IT'S

01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:26.657
 GREATER THAN WHAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO HAVE TO DO, THAN IF 

01:07:26.658 --> 01:07:31.276
THEY JUST WENT TO WHAT I CALL 
THE ALPHA COURTS.  THE STRAIGHT 

01:07:31.277 --> 01:07:34.055
CRIMINAL COURTS.  EACH DEFENDANT
 THAT COMES BEFORE US, WE SPEND 

01:07:34.056 --> 01:07:37.167
ABOUT THREE TIMES AS MUCH TIME 
ON INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS JUST 

01:07:37.719 --> 01:07:40.667
ENGAGING.  BECAUSE THAT'S 
IMPORTANT TO PROCESS.  BUT THE 

01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:43.351
IDEA THROUGHOUT THE STAFF, WITH 
THE MENTORS THAT WE HAVE, WITH 

01:07:44.038 --> 01:07:48.417
THE MENTOR COORDINATOR, AND THE 
PROBATION DEPARTMENT FOLKS, THE 

01:07:48.611 --> 01:07:52.796
IDEA IS TO GET THEM THROUGH THE 
PROGRAM AND TO MAKE THEM 

01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:56.997
SUCCEED.  AND STARTED WHAT WE 
CALL A HUMAN SALVAGE OPERATION. 

01:07:57.324 --> 01:08:00.884
UNLIKE THE COURTS WHERE IT'S 
MORE PROCESSED.  AND YOU MIGHT 

01:08:01.232 --> 01:08:04.720
HAVE THREE CASES SET FOR TRIAL 
AND EVERYBODY WILL SETTLE AND 

01:08:04.979 --> 01:08:06.985
EVERYBODY WILL HAVE AN AGREEMENT
 IN TERMS OF THE SENTENCE AND 

01:08:06.986 --> 01:08:09.825
YOU ARE DONE IN TWO MINUTES.  
AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES OR MORE

01:08:10.627 --> 01:08:15.743
 FOR THE NEXT ONE AND YOU SPEND 
A LOT MORE TIMES IN THE 

01:08:15.744 --> 01:08:17.744
VETERANS.  
SPEAKER:  THE TIME THEY GET TO 

01:08:17.996 --> 01:08:20.838
YOU, IT'S TOO LATE.  A LOT OF 
THE TIMES WHEN YOU ARE DEALING 

01:08:20.985 --> 01:08:24.333
WITH PTSD AS WE POINTED OUT, 
IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL BY INDIVIDUAL

01:08:24.473 --> 01:08:27.617
 CASE BASIS.  IS THERE A SWITCH 
INSIDE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE

01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:33.285
 PEOPLE THAT AT SOME POINT YOU 
CAN GET TO OR HOPEFULLY GET TO, 

01:08:33.485 --> 01:08:36.943
TO FLIP THE SWITCH, AND THINGS 
CAN BE PUT ON A PRODUCTIVE 

01:08:37.065 --> 01:08:40.172
PLANE?  
SPEAKER:  I THINK SO, JONATHAN. 

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:44.530
IF I CAN COME BACK A SECOND, 
WHEN I WAS A PROBATION OFFICER, 

01:08:44.824 --> 01:08:49.526
UP THE STREET FROM JOINT BASE 
LOUIS MCCORD, WE DIDN'T HAVE 

01:08:49.852 --> 01:08:52.827
VETERANS IMPROVEMENT COURTS AND 
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF 

01:08:53.009 --> 01:08:55.048
PROGRAMMING IN THE JUSTICE 
SYSTEM AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, 

01:08:55.658 --> 01:08:59.261
THE WARS IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ
 STARTED AND SOLDIERS STARTED TO

01:08:59.447 --> 01:09:02.881
 COME HOME AND WE STARTED TO SEE
 A LARGE INFLUX LIKE YOU ALL DID

01:09:03.224 --> 01:09:05.883
 IN THE VETERANS SYSTEM AND WE 
DIDN'T HAVE TREATMENT COURTS AND

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:10.352
 I WAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
OFFICER AND THEY WERE THERE FOR 

01:09:11.078 --> 01:09:15.062
THE VIOLENCE CHARGE AND WE 
DIDN'T TOUCH THE UNDER LYING 

01:09:15.674 --> 01:09:17.674
ISSUES.  
SPEAKER:  THE VAST MAJORITY 

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:21.604
CASES THAT YOU COME BACK INTO 
THE SYSTEM ARE DOMESTIC 

01:09:21.736 --> 01:09:23.736
VIOLENCE?  
SPEAKER:  AT LEAST ON MY WORK 

01:09:23.881 --> 01:09:25.881
LOAD.  THEY SIT BEFORE ME

01:09:34.248 --> 01:09:40.212
 BROKEN.  WAITING TO BE 
DISCHARGED, HONORABLE, 

01:09:40.448 --> 01:09:42.468
DISHONORABLE, THAT WAS BEFORE 
VETERANS TREATMENT COURTS AND 

01:09:42.606 --> 01:09:46.893
SINCE 2008, WE HAVE 330 SINCE 
NEARLY 100 IN VARIOUS STAGES OF 

01:09:48.004 --> 01:09:51.037
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION, 
WATCHING FIRE ACROSS THE 

01:09:51.477 --> 01:09:56.032
COUNTRY.  AND DIGGING DEEP 
BESIDES THE CHARGE AT HAND.  AND

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.240
 TALKED ABOUT THE HOLISTIC 
APPROACH TO

01:10:01.334 --> 01:10:04.394
 TREATING VETERANS.  
AND I HAVE A COLLEAGUE, I WON'T 

01:10:04.648 --> 01:10:07.446
SAY HIS NAME.  BUT AFTER A 
COUPLE OF MONTHS HE WAS IN 

01:10:07.631 --> 01:10:10.104
DENIAL ABOUT, YOU KNOW, 
COMMITTING TO A VETERANS 

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:14.296
TREATMENT COURT.  AND AFTER A 
WHILE, HE JUST CLICKED AND FELT 

01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:18.950
HE HAD A SENSE OF PURPOSE BACK. 
AND I THINK THE VETERANS 

01:10:19.366 --> 01:10:22.009
TREATMENT COURTS HAVE UNDER 
LYING ISSUES AND AT SOME POINT, 

01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:24.709
THE VALUE OF THE MENTOR AND 
HELPING TO WALK THEM THROUGH THE

01:10:25.606 --> 01:10:29.228
 SYSTEM AND PROVIDING THAT, AT 
SOME POINT THEY GET IT. 

01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:31.340
SPEAKER:  TIM, YOU WOULD BE THE 
BEST ONE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:35.996
 TOO.  YOU CAME THROUGH THE 
PROGRAM.  AT WHAT POINT DID THAT

01:10:36.386 --> 01:10:39.279
 SWITCH GO OFF FOR YOU?  WHERE 
YOU REALIZED THAT YOU KNOW WHAT,

01:10:39.593 --> 01:10:42.902
 THAT IS NOT THE LIFE THAT I 
WANT TO LEAD.  WHEN DID THE 

01:10:42.903 --> 01:10:48.096
SWITCH GO OFF?  WHEN DID THE 
RESOURCE BE MADE AVAILABLE TO 

01:10:48.215 --> 01:10:50.215
YOU?  
SPEAKER:  I THINK THE CHANGING 

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.737
MOMENT FOR ME WAS WHEN I WAS 
WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH UNIT IN 

01:10:53.864 --> 01:11:00.345
PRISON.  AND THEY KEPT GIVING ME
 MEDICATION AND I WAS JUST DONE 

01:11:00.741 --> 01:11:02.741
WITH MEDICATION AT THIS POINT.  
I HAD GOTTEN SO MUCH FROM THE VA

01:11:03.188 --> 01:11:07.051
 AND I JUST ABUSED THEM AND 
TIRED OF FEELING LIKE THAT.  AND

01:11:07.217 --> 01:11:13.743
 I FELT VULNERABLE AND DIDN'T 
WANT TO TAKE MORE PILLS.  I WAS 

01:11:13.859 --> 01:11:19.566
ARGUING WITH A LADY.  AND THE 
DOOR SLOWLY SLID OPEN AND IN 

01:11:19.694 --> 01:11:21.754
WALKS A MAN, WHO I HAD NO IDEA 
WHO HE WAS. 

01:11:28.306 --> 01:11:32.147
 HE SAYS TO THE LADY, AND SHE 
GOT UP, LEFT, AND SAT DOWN.  

01:11:32.148 --> 01:11:35.093
WASN'T A THERAPIST.  
AND WASN'T LICENSED TO TREATMENT

01:11:35.748 --> 01:11:40.763
 PTSD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  
WHAT HE WAS IS A VIETNAM 

01:11:41.178 --> 01:11:43.335
VETERAN.  AND THAT'S THE FIRST 
TIME I WAS INTRODUCED TO PEER TO

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:47.034
 PEER SUPPORT.  I WILL NEVER 
FORGET WHAT HE SAID TO ME.  THAT

01:11:47.326 --> 01:11:49.326
 PERSON YOU WERE BEFORE YOU LEFT

01:11:52.626 --> 01:11:55.789
 IS GONE FOREVER.  YOU'RE NEVER 
COMING BACK.  AND YOU'RE A 

01:11:56.083 --> 01:11:58.777
CHANGED PERSON AND YOU NEED TO 
FIND A DIFFERENT WAY TO COMBAT 

01:11:59.004 --> 01:12:04.444
THIS.  I THINK THE FIRST TIME I 
HEARD THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I 

01:12:04.604 --> 01:12:08.383
REALIZED I HAD A SURRENDER TO 
WIN.  SURRENDER IS NOT IN OUR 

01:12:08.742 --> 01:12:14.990
VOCABULARY.  BUT IT'S VERY HARD 
THING TO ACCEPT.  AND FROM THAT 

01:12:15.205 --> 01:12:17.525
POINT ON, I STARTED TO TURN MY 
LIFE AROUND.  

01:12:17.526 --> 01:12:23.866
SPEAKER:  IS THERE ANY PART OF 
YOU WITH COMBAT THAT YOU FEEL 

01:12:24.255 --> 01:12:28.379
COME ALIVE?  I SAW THAT VIDEO. 
MENT IT'S LIKE ALL MY FRIENDS 

01:12:28.942 --> 01:12:31.529
HAVE CHANGEDED AND WE'RE ALL 
SITTING IN THE ROOM AS EDUCATED 

01:12:31.702 --> 01:12:35.776
FOLKS.  NO, NO, NO.  YOU 
CHANGED.  THOSE WHO LEAVE ARE 

01:12:36.188 --> 01:12:39.997
THE ONES THAT EVOLVE OR CHANGE 
OR ARE DIFFERENT AND THEY EXPECT

01:12:40.609 --> 01:12:43.255
 EVERYTHING TO BE THE SAME.  BUT
 THEY'RE NOT.  

01:12:43.256 --> 01:12:45.664
SPEAKER:  IT'S DEFINITELY NOT 
THE SAME.  I REMEMBER NOT BEING 

01:12:45.873 --> 01:12:49.246
ABLE TO COME HOME AND TALK TO 
EVERYBODY.  AND I CAN'T TALK TO 

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:52.560
MY OWN MOTHER.  I CAN'T TALK TO 
MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR.  

01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:54.551
SPEAKER:  BECAUSE THEY JUST 
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND?  

01:12:54.552 --> 01:12:57.998
SPEAKER:  YEAH.  IT'S JUST NOT 
THEIR FAULT THAT THEY WOULDN'T 

01:12:58.213 --> 01:13:01.369
UNDERSTAND.  THAT'S OKAY.  
THAT'S WHY I THINK PEER TO PEER 

01:13:01.596 --> 01:13:07.385
SUPPORT IS SO IMPORTANT WHEN IT 
COMES TO THIS.  HOW DOC TALKED 

01:13:07.952 --> 01:13:11.203
ABOUT SITTING IN THOSE RAP 
GROUPS.  MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS 

01:13:11.808 --> 01:13:14.881
SITTING HERE TODAY, WE HAVE OUR 
OWN RAP GROUPS EVERY MONDAY 

01:13:15.303 --> 01:13:17.303
NIGHT WITH COMMUNITY WITH

01:13:20.315 --> 01:13:22.315
 VETERANS AND.  
SPEAKER:  AND

01:13:24.925 --> 01:13:29.202
  YOU CAME BACK FROM THE WAR.  
THEY GET A TREATMENT.  A RED 

01:13:29.203 --> 01:13:33.031
CARPET TREATMENT, IF YOU WILL.  
LET'S FACE IT.  THE MILITARY 

01:13:33.032 --> 01:13:38.107
DOES A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT.  AND
 WHAT THEY ARE NOT GOOD AT IS 

01:13:38.402 --> 01:13:42.750
TRANSITIONING WARRIOR BASED 
ETHOS INTO A CIVILIAN BASED 

01:13:44.114 --> 01:13:47.311
ETHOS.  THAT'S LIKE JUMPING FROM
 A NASCAR IN THE FAST LANE TO A 

01:13:48.398 --> 01:13:52.491
PRIUS AT 10 MILES AN HOUR.  AND 
DOC, I WANT TO BRING YOU BACK 

01:13:52.931 --> 01:13:57.850
IN.  YOU CAME BACK FROM AN 
UNPOPULAR WAR WHERE YOU HAD TO 

01:13:58.075 --> 01:14:00.769
BURY THAT YOU SERVED, OR AT 
LEAST PROTECT THE FACT THAT YOU 

01:14:00.981 --> 01:14:03.048
DID.  
SPEAKER:  SURE.  I CAME BACK AND

01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:07.747
 I WAS IN ST. LOUIS AIRPORT.  
AND I'M HONORED AS A NAVY

01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:13.673
 CORPSMAN. 
I CAN WEAR THE MARINE GREEN 

01:14:14.485 --> 01:14:20.730
UNIFORM.  THERE IS A SPECIAL 
BAND ON THE SLEEVES THAT 

01:14:20.921 --> 01:14:28.100
DISTINGUISHES ME AS A CORPSMAN. 
I HAD MY MEDALS ON AND MY 

01:14:28.238 --> 01:14:32.267
RIBBONS ON AND WENT UP TO THE 
BAR IN THE AIRPORT AND ORDERED A

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.807
 DRINK AND HAD A FEW ON THE 
AIRPLANE.  AND THERE IS A GUY 

01:14:37.209 --> 01:14:41.217
THAT LOOKS AT MY UNIFORM.  AND 
HE SAYS HOW MANY BABIES DID YOU 

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:46.422
KILL?  AND BEFORE I CAN HIT HIM 
WITH THE BEER BOTTLE, THE 

01:14:46.814 --> 01:14:49.807
BARTENDER THE GUY AND THREW HIM 
OUT OF THE BAR.  THIS IS MY 

01:14:49.808 --> 01:14:52.754
FIRST EXPERIENCE COMING BACK.  
THE GUY WAS PROBABLY SLOSHED AND

01:14:52.959 --> 01:14:57.136
 THE WHOLE BUSINESS. 
BUT THAT IS MY REACTION.  AND 

01:14:57.431 --> 01:15:04.075
THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO GO PLACES
 IN UNIFORM BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE 

01:15:04.076 --> 01:15:07.935
LET'S SAY REALLY RUDE TO YOU.  
WITH LANGUAGE WE DIDN'T EVEN USE

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.728
 IN THE CORE.  OKAY.  BUT TIM IS
 EXACTLY RIGHT.  WHEN YOU COME 

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:20.454
BACK, IT'S SO DIFFERENT.  IT'S 
SO DIFFERENT.  AND NOBODY KNOWS 

01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:22.830
HOW TO DEAL WITH YOU.  BECAUSE

01:15:25.612 --> 01:15:28.214
 OF IT.  I APPRECIATE THE 
COUNTRY HOW IT VALUES

01:15:31.931 --> 01:15:37.363
 ITS VETERANS.  BUT THEY NEED TO
 UNDERSTAND, WAR CHANGES PEOPLE.

01:15:37.364 --> 01:15:41.671
  IT CHANGES PEOPLE.  SO IT'S 
NOT JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

01:15:41.953 --> 01:15:46.153
SERVICE.  IT'S WELCOME HOME.  
AND THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE 

01:15:46.154 --> 01:15:48.154
BETWEEN

01:15:50.454 --> 01:15:52.454
 THOSE TWO

01:15:55.191 --> 01:15:57.191
 PHRASES. 

01:16:03.493 --> 01:16:09.398
SPEAKER:  WELL TWO YEARS AGO I 
WENT TO THE FIRST REUNION OF MY 

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.779
FRATERNITY FROM COLLEGE IN 50 
YEARS.  A REALLY NICE RESTAURANT

01:16:15.886 --> 01:16:18.702
 IN NEW YORK CITY IN MANHATTAN. 

01:16:18.703 --> 01:16:22.683
AND THESE ARE GOOD GUYS.  GUYS 
THAT I WAS FRIENDS WITH.  

01:16:22.684 --> 01:16:24.684
THEY'RE LAWYERS.  THEY'RE 

01:16:26.621 --> 01:16:32.644
DOCTORS, DENTISTS, COLLEGE 
PROFESSORS AND IN THE '50S, 

01:16:32.759 --> 01:16:35.677
THERE WERE FOUR OF US WHO SERVED
 IN SOME CAPACITY IN THE 

01:16:35.797 --> 01:16:41.806
MILITARY.  ONE FRIEND OF MINE 
WAS IN THE NATIONAL GUARD.  

01:16:41.807 --> 01:16:44.867
ANOTHER GUY, HE WAS IN THE 
BRAVO.  AND THEY DIDN'T SEND HIM

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:51.914
 TO VIETNAM.  THEY SEND HIM TO 
GERMANY.  THE THIRD GUY DID NOT 

01:16:52.026 --> 01:16:55.479
WANT TO GET DRAFTED.  HE THOUGHT
 HE WAS SMART AND JOINED THE AIR

01:16:55.759 --> 01:16:59.011
 FORCE AND WOUND UP IN THAILAND 
WHERE HE LOST HIS BEST FRIEND 

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:01.248
AND LOST A LOT OF

01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:05.013
 OTHER GUYS.  
AND IT'S --

01:17:12.445 --> 01:17:15.701
 THERE WAS, TO ME, AND THERE WAS
 A BARRIER IN THE WAY BETWEEN ME

01:17:16.888 --> 01:17:20.943
 AND THE FELLOWS. 
AND THE PEOPLE MOST COMFORTABLE 

01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:30.292
AROUND, OUR VETERANS.  AND I 
KNOW WHEN I CAME HOME, IT'S 

01:17:31.238 --> 01:17:34.198
SOMETHING THAT YOU DIDN'T 
NECESSARILY TALK ABOUT.  BUT I 

01:17:34.609 --> 01:17:39.250
WAS LIKE DOC, A LITTLE BIT ANGRY
 AT WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON.  I 

01:17:39.378 --> 01:17:44.902
WAS THERE IN 1970.  WE WERE 
DOING THE SO-CALLED PHASED 

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.864
WITHDRAWAL.  I COULDN'T SEE 
LOGICALLY WHY AMERICAN TROOPS 

01:17:49.293 --> 01:17:56.129
WERE STILL GOING OUT ON COMBAT 
MISSIONS AND DYING.  SO I 

01:17:56.398 --> 01:18:00.436
PROTESTED THE WAR.  AND CAME 
DOWN HERE IN THE BIG ANTIWAR 

01:18:00.844 --> 01:18:07.358
DEMONSTRATION CALLED DEWEY 
CANYON THREE.  AND IT WAS THE 

01:18:08.731 --> 01:18:14.286
FIRST TIME SINCE THE BONUS SINCE
 1932 I BELIEVE IT WAS, WHO CAME

01:18:14.595 --> 01:18:21.606
 TO WASHINGTON TO LOOK IT UP.  
AND GET OUT OF VIETNAM NOW.  AND

01:18:21.737 --> 01:18:24.180
 I THINK IT HAD AN AFFECT, I 
CERTAINLY HOPE

01:18:31.538 --> 01:18:36.747
 IT HAD AN AFFECT BUT IT WAS 
CERTAINLY IN ME.  AND A LOT OF 

01:18:36.748 --> 01:18:38.748
OTHER FOLKS, THE SENSE OF ALIEN

01:18:42.342 --> 01:18:47.310
ATION.  I WAS THERE.  I HAD TOP 
SECRET CLEARANCE AND CAN TRAVEL 

01:18:47.851 --> 01:18:53.487
AROUND.  IN A PLACE CALLED 
SCHULI WITH A PLACE WITH DOCTORS

01:18:53.488 --> 01:18:57.730
 AND NURSES.  AS MUCH OF THE 
BASEMENT AND THE DEBRIS OF 

01:19:01.223 --> 01:19:07.983
WAR, AS MOST DID.  AND AS DOC 
SAID, IT CHANGES YOU.  AND 

01:19:08.496 --> 01:19:11.795
UNLESS YOU'RE THERE, YOU CAN'T 
UNDERSTAND.  EVEN IF YOU WATCH 

01:19:11.796 --> 01:19:14.164
THE BEST WAR MOVIES THAT WERE 
EVER MADE.  

01:19:14.165 --> 01:19:18.201
SPEAKER:  LET'S TALK ABOUT FOR A
 SECOND DEMONSTRATING THE TAIL 

01:19:18.467 --> 01:19:20.467
TELL SCIENCE

01:19:22.267 --> 01:19:26.258
 OF PTSD.  FROM MY 
UNDERSTANDING, ALCOHOL, DRUG 

01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:32.032
USE, THOSE ARE ABOUT AS COMMON 
ACROSS THE BOARD TELLTALE SIGNS 

01:19:32.384 --> 01:19:35.975
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE.  
ESCAPISM.  MAYBE NOT BEING ABLE 

01:19:36.337 --> 01:19:39.992
TO SOCIALIZE.  THEY WERE IN A 
SOCIAL SETTING, MAYBE PERHAPS IN

01:19:40.262 --> 01:19:44.936
 THEIR HOMETOWN AND WITH THEIR 
HIGH SCHOOL BUDDIES AND YACKING 

01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:48.812
ABOUT A FOOTBALL GAME.  MAYBE 
THEY DON'T CONTRIBUTE.  AND GIVE

01:19:49.956 --> 01:19:53.201
 SOME OTHER TELLTALE SIGNS FOR 
ANYBODY WATCHING IN THE AUDIENCE

01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:56.788
 OR MAYBE HAVE A LOVED ONE GOING
 THROUGH THIS.  AND AT LEAST 

01:19:56.789 --> 01:20:02.256
WHAT ARE THEY UP AGAINST?  
SPEAKER:  I WILL BET EVERY 

01:20:02.457 --> 01:20:05.156
COMBAT VET IN THIS ROOM KNOWS 
EXACTLY WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT.

01:20:05.279 --> 01:20:10.086
IT HAPPENED TO ME THIS MORNING, 
A COLLEAGUE.  NOW I PLACE MY 

01:20:10.711 --> 01:20:15.648
DESK SO IT FACES THE DOOR.  NOW 
MOST, YOU KNOW, OFFICE 

01:20:16.002 --> 01:20:18.714
MANAGEMENT THINGS SAYS WELL, 
THAT'S KIND OF -- PUT IT TO THE 

01:20:18.899 --> 01:20:23.713
SIDE OR WHATEVER.  THE I CAN'T 
DO THAT BECAUSE EVEN WITH MY 

01:20:24.008 --> 01:20:27.291
DESK FACING THE DOORWAY.  IF I 
AM FOCUSED ON READING SOMETHING 

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:32.951
OR WHATEVER AND SOMEBODY JUST 
SAYS HI DOC, IT SCARES THE YOU 

01:20:33.164 --> 01:20:36.684
KNOW WHAT OUT OF ME.  AND THAT 
CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE.  IF I AM 

01:20:37.205 --> 01:20:40.382
FOCUSED ON SOMETHING AND PEOPLE 
CALL MY NAME OR I HEAR A LOUD 

01:20:40.789 --> 01:20:44.287
NOISE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  
THAT IS CERTAINLY A PROBLEM.  

01:20:44.412 --> 01:20:48.653
THE OTHER THING HAS BEEN 
MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE 

01:20:49.152 --> 01:20:53.875
CONVERSATION, NIGHTMARES AND 
FLASHBACKS.  AND THOSE ARE TWO 

01:20:54.165 --> 01:20:56.712
DIFFERENT THINGS.  OKAY.  YOU 
HAVE NIGHTMARES WHEN YOU SLEEP 

01:20:56.845 --> 01:20:58.845
AT NIGHT.  AND THEY

01:21:00.531 --> 01:21:06.245
 MAY BE THE SAME NIGHTMARE.  
FLASHBACKS HAPPEN ANY TIME AND 

01:21:06.246 --> 01:21:11.888
YOU ARE BACK THERE.  BECAUSE 
TRAUMA IS, AND PARTICULARLY 

01:21:11.889 --> 01:21:15.366
SEVERE TRAUMA CAN CHANGE THE 
CIRCUITRY OF THE BRAIN SO THAT 

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:24.522
CERTAIN, YOU WANT TO CALL THEM 
TRIGGERS, WILL PUT YOU RIGHT 

01:21:24.523 --> 01:21:27.254
BACK WHERE A PARTICULAR 
TRAUMATIC EVENT OCCURRED.  SO 

01:21:27.255 --> 01:21:36.413
THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHERS.  
SPEAKER:  LET ME ASK YOU THIS.  

01:21:37.013 --> 01:21:40.753
42 YEARS SINCE WAR, HAS IT FREED
 YOU?  OR IS IT RIGHT AT THE 

01:21:41.994 --> 01:21:44.360
FOREFRONT AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN?
SPEAKER:  I DON'T WANT TO GO 

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:50.893
BACK TO VIETNAM.  DESPITE ALL OF
 THE OVERTURES IN FRIENDSHIP.  

01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:54.990
VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA 
WHERE I WORK HAS LED THE WAY.  

01:21:55.109 --> 01:21:58.369
WE HAVE A VETERANS INITIATIVE 
WHICH WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANOTHER 

01:21:58.579 --> 01:22:00.645
TIME, ANOTHER PLACE.  I DON'T 
WANT TO GO BACK THERE.  BECAUSE 

01:22:01.897 --> 01:22:07.367
I AM AFRAID THAT IT WILL BRING 
BACK STUFF THAT I HAD TO DEAL 

01:22:08.217 --> 01:22:10.875
WITH, THROUGH THERAPY AND 
THROUGH RAP GROUPS AND STUFF.  

01:22:11.186 --> 01:22:13.283
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH 
THAT AGAIN.  

01:22:13.284 --> 01:22:17.379
BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF 
RECURRING NIGHTMARES THAT I 

01:22:17.606 --> 01:22:23.045
CAN'T SEEM TO GET RID OF.  AND 
THEY WERE PRETTY TRAUMATIC 

01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:25.703
SITUATIONS.  BUT THEY COME BACK.
AND IT'S USUALLY WHEN I AM 

01:22:26.072 --> 01:22:29.840
STRESSED OUT.  OKAY.  
SPEAKER:  TIM?  

01:22:29.841 --> 01:22:33.607
SPEAKER:  I THINK ANGER IS A 
MAIN ONE.  YOU KNOW.  SPEAKING 

01:22:34.037 --> 01:22:36.470
FOR MYSELF.  
SPEAKER:  EXPLODE QUICKLY.  

01:22:36.471 --> 01:22:39.704
SPEAKER:  I OBVIOUSLY FOUND WAYS
 TO COMBAT THAT, YOU KNOW, 

01:22:39.976 --> 01:22:45.028
THROUGH GROUP THERAPY AND STUFF 
LIKE THAT.  

01:22:45.029 --> 01:22:48.970
SPEAKER:  NOW, LET ME ASK YOU 
THIS, THE LOVED ONES AROUND YOU,

01:22:49.329 --> 01:22:52.523
 THAT'S THE WAY HE HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN.  HAVE THEY TRIED TO 

01:22:52.656 --> 01:22:55.467
RATIONALIZE THE BEHAVIOR, RATHER
 THAN TRYING TO COPE WITH IT?  

01:22:55.644 --> 01:22:57.574
SPEAKER:  THEY DIDN'T REALLY 
UNDERSTAND IT.  THEY KNEW THAT 

01:22:57.575 --> 01:22:59.972
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.  AND AGAIN 
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS 

01:23:00.177 --> 01:23:02.636
WRONG.  AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW 
WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT AND 

01:23:03.038 --> 01:23:08.950
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE 
FACING.  AND ANGER, I THINK IT 

01:23:09.092 --> 01:23:13.442
STEMS FROM, I CALL IT STANDING 
IN THE SHALLOWS OF THE WAVES AND

01:23:13.641 --> 01:23:16.676
 THE OCEAN.  AND IT'S THE WAVE 
OF EMOTIONS THAT KEEP COMING AND

01:23:16.797 --> 01:23:20.008
 YOU HAVE NEVER FELT THIS STUFF 
BEFORE.  YOU GET ANGRY.  BECAUSE

01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:23.767
 YOU CAN'T NAVIGATE THROUGH THE 
DAY AND CAN'T BE THAT SOCIAL 

01:23:23.936 --> 01:23:27.700
PERSON AND CAN'T GO HANG OUT 
WITH THE GUYS AND TALK ABOUT THE

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:32.237
 FOOTBALL GAME.  YOU WOULD 
RATHER ISOLATE, THAT'S WHAT I 

01:23:32.478 --> 01:23:36.964
DID.  I WOULD USE DRUGS AND 
ALCOHOL, THEY ARE 100% EFFECTIVE

01:23:37.288 --> 01:23:41.772
 EVERY TIME.  THEY NUMB IT.  
SPEAKER:  AS A NATION, WE HAVE 

01:23:42.878 --> 01:23:47.572
BEEN AT WAR FOR 240 YEARS, A LOT
 OF THE TIME, AND ALWAYS CALL IT

01:23:48.063 --> 01:23:51.624
 A SHELL SHOCK OR BEING QUIET 
AND NOW WE HAVE IDENTIFIED PTSD 

01:23:51.771 --> 01:23:54.279
BECAUSE IT'S A PROBLEM AND THIS 
IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS PLAYED THE

01:23:54.778 --> 01:23:57.886
 RETURNING WARRIORS SINCE WE 
HAVE BEEN AT IT IN THE BATTLE 

01:23:58.111 --> 01:24:02.973
FIELD. 
AND JUDGE, I AM CURIOUS OF WHAT 

01:24:03.096 --> 01:24:08.276
YOU HAVE SEEN.  I AM SURE YOU 
HAVE TELLTALE SIGNS FROM A TO Z 

01:24:08.507 --> 01:24:13.240
ON THIS ONE.  
SPEAKER:  SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS 

01:24:13.503 --> 01:24:20.613
REALLY THE REACTION.  UNDER 
LYING OCCURRENCE IS THE ANGER.  

01:24:21.518 --> 01:24:23.976
AND GETTING READY TO LEAVE 
AFGHANISTAN AT THE TIME, SOME OF

01:24:24.097 --> 01:24:29.978
 THE YOUNGER FOLKS, INFANTRY 
TROOPERS, GOSH, WE WENT TO 

01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:33.494
AFGHANISTAN AND THE REST OF THE 
COUNTRY WENT TO WALMART.  IT'S 

01:24:34.696 --> 01:24:39.031
ALMOST A RESENTMENT WHEN YOU GET
 BACK.  AND OF COURSE ON THE 

01:24:39.169 --> 01:24:46.906
RETURN OF THE IRAQ AND AFGHAN 
GUYS, IT'S MUCH DIFFERENT THAN 

01:24:47.134 --> 01:24:53.158
THE VIETNAM ERA.  YOU HEAR THANK
 YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE A LOT.  I 

01:24:54.014 --> 01:24:58.590
WAS ANGRY WHEN I GOT BACK.  THE 
WAY THE ARMY HANDLED YOU.  

01:24:58.591 --> 01:25:03.032
SPEAKER:  LET ME ASK ALL OF YOU.
BECAUSE THE MILITARY SPENDS 

01:25:03.361 --> 01:25:06.533
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON 
EVERYTHING, FROM PROTECTING 

01:25:06.806 --> 01:25:11.127
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTANDING THE WAR 
AND UNDERSTANDING INTELLIGENCE, 

01:25:11.503 --> 01:25:15.903
IS THERE ANY KIND OF MECHANISM 
THAT ANYONE CAN PROVIDE TO READY

01:25:16.157 --> 01:25:20.753
 THEM FOR EXPERIENCE?  I KNOW 
THEY ARE TRAINED FOR COMBAT.  

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:24.982
BUT TRAINING FOR COMBAT AND 
LIVING THROUGH IT, TOTALLY 

01:25:25.145 --> 01:25:27.281
DIFFERENT THINGS.  
SPEAKER:  SPOT ON WHAT YOU JUST 

01:25:27.548 --> 01:25:30.084
SAID.  THEY TRAIN YOU FOR 
SITUATIONS THAT THREATEN YOU, 

01:25:30.342 --> 01:25:35.120
THAT PUTS YOU IN THE SENSE OF 
DANGER AND YOU REACT.  AND IF 

01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:38.602
YOU FOLLOW THAT TRAINING, 
CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:46.359
 IT THROUGH THAT SITUATION.  
WHEN YOU COME HOME, OKAY: YOU 

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.444
HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE OLD WAY 
OF THINKING,

01:25:51.597 --> 01:25:57.955
 WHICH IS, JUST BECAUSE PHYTO 
POOPED ON THE FLOOR, THAT'S NOT 

01:25:57.956 --> 01:26:02.115
A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION.  
BUT YOU REACT THAT WAY.  AND SO 

01:26:02.116 --> 01:26:07.657
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SHOULD 
CONSIDER IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, 

01:26:07.658 --> 01:26:11.850
AND CANADA DID IT FOR A WHILE 
AND THE UK DID IT FOR A WHILE.  

01:26:11.851 --> 01:26:17.967
THEY PUT THEIR TROOPS IN SORT OF
 A DECOMPRESSION.  AND I BELIEVE

01:26:18.079 --> 01:26:24.807
 IT WAS THE UK, THE CANADIANS 
HAD A PLACE ON CYPHRUS AND IN 

01:26:24.808 --> 01:26:28.222
SOME CASES THERE WERE MARRIED 
COUPLES AND STUFF.  GOOD.  

01:26:28.223 --> 01:26:34.157
AND THEY HELPED THEM DECOMPRESS.
THE SORT OF LIKE A POST SERVICE 

01:26:34.396 --> 01:26:37.455
BOOT CAMP.  NOW WHETHER THAT 
WOULD GET A LOT OF SUPPORT DOWN 

01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:43.067
THE STREET OR NOT, YOU KNOW, 
THAT'S NEITHER HERE OR THERE.  

01:26:43.284 --> 01:26:47.637
BUT WE COULD DO SOMETHING BETTER
 ON THE END OF IT, TO GET US 

01:26:47.638 --> 01:26:49.638
BACK IN TERMS

01:26:52.757 --> 01:26:55.225
 OF THE TRANSITION SYSTEM.  
SPEAKER:  SO YOU KNOW, I WORK 

01:26:55.593 --> 01:26:58.581
AND MY JOB IS REALLY TO IDENTIFY
 THE GAPS BETWEEN CRIMINAL 

01:26:58.938 --> 01:27:01.682
JUSTICE TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR 
VETERANS AND ONE OF THE 

01:27:01.812 --> 01:27:06.145
INTERVIEWS THAT I WAS CONDUCTING
 WITH A VETERAN, YOU KNOW, 

01:27:06.447 --> 01:27:09.294
TRAINED ME TO GET BASIC TRAINING
 AND TRAINED ME TO GO TO THE 

01:27:09.638 --> 01:27:14.560
FIRST DUTY AND TRAINED ME TO GO 
TO COMBAT AND DIDN'T TRAIN ME TO

01:27:14.693 --> 01:27:18.675
 COME HOME.  THAT'S A REAL GAP 
IN OUR SYSTEM.  A COUPLE OF 

01:27:18.676 --> 01:27:24.026
POINTS, ONE, WE NEED TO REDUCE 
THE STIGMA FOR SOLDIERS TO ASK 

01:27:24.027 --> 01:27:27.337
FOR HELP AND WE NEED TO DO A 
BETTER JOB HELPING THEM.  AND 

01:27:27.338 --> 01:27:33.441
WHY DOES THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY 
TO CONVENE THEIR LIVES HAVE TO 

01:27:33.442 --> 01:27:37.188
DO WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM?  I 
THINK THERE IS SPECIFIC FUNDING 

01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:40.295
IN DOD TO PAY FOR UNIFORMS AND 
TRAVEL.  

01:27:40.296 --> 01:27:44.423
BUT THERE IS NO SPECIFIC FUNDING
 TO COME HOME AND HELP THEM 

01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:47.416
ACCLIMATE HOME.  I THINK THAT'S 
A REAL GAP THAT WE NEED TO 

01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:48.924
ADDRESS.  
SPEAKER:  LET ME ASK YOU A 

01:27:48.925 --> 01:27:50.528
QUESTION.  
SPEAKER:  I THINK THERE IS A 

01:27:50.529 --> 01:27:54.567
REAL PROBLEM ALSO.  THE MILITARY
 HAS CHANGED.  ALTHOUGH IT IS 

01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:59.305
STILL AFFECTED IN A LOT OF WAYS 
LIKE IT WAS IN WORLD WAR TWO, I 

01:27:59.439 --> 01:28:03.436
SAY THIS BECAUSE I HAVE GONE 
CLINICAL WORK WITH DELTA FORCE 

01:28:03.799 --> 01:28:07.373
PEOPLE AND SEALS.  SOMEONE SAID 
IT EARLIER.  MOST PERSONS DON'T 

01:28:07.487 --> 01:28:12.013
APPRECIATE THE TEMPLE OF 
OPERATIONS OVER IN THE BIG 

01:28:13.267 --> 01:28:18.461
SANDBOX.  IT'S, I MEAN, HEAVY 
DUTY INTENSE.  

01:28:18.462 --> 01:28:22.011
THE GENERAL AND MY COLLEAGUE 
SITTING NEXT TO ME, THE JUDGE 

01:28:22.152 --> 01:28:27.227
WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT'S LIKE.  
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS 

01:28:27.604 --> 01:28:31.374
THAT THESE FOLKS ARE UNDER SUCH 
INTENSE, PARTICULARLY IN OUR 

01:28:33.627 --> 01:28:38.414
SPECIAL OPS GROUPS.  UNDER SUCH 
INTENSE PRESSURE THAT LIFE BACK 

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:41.430
HERE IS NOT VERY REALISTIC TO 
THEM WHEN THEY COME HOME.  THEY

01:28:45.016 --> 01:28:50.448
 TRY AND ADJUST.  OKAY.  BUT WHY
 DO SO MANY OF OUR SPECIAL OPS 

01:28:50.664 --> 01:28:52.778
PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY WERE MORE 
AT HOME BACK THERE?  

01:28:52.779 --> 01:28:54.966
SPEAKER:  LET ME ASK THIS 
QUESTION, TOO.  I KNOW WE LIVE 

01:28:55.071 --> 01:29:00.945
IN AN ADD SOCIETY.  AND I DON'T 
MEAN TO USE THAT TERM.  BUT YOU 

01:29:01.201 --> 01:29:04.248
WILL SEE NINE OR TEN PEOPLE 
WALKING AROUND TODAY WITH THEIR 

01:29:04.359 --> 01:29:07.734
PHONES.  THEY ARE CONNECTED TO I
 DON'T KNOW WHAT.  A TEXT THAT 

01:29:07.935 --> 01:29:11.551
THEY CAN'T GO WITHOUT OR A 
HEADLINE WHO THEY CAN'T GO 

01:29:11.683 --> 01:29:15.422
WITHOUT.  AND FOLKS IN COMBAT, I
 HAVE HEARD THIS 99% OF THE 

01:29:15.569 --> 01:29:20.181
TIME, TIME STANDS STILL.  TIME 
SLOWS DOWN.  THE CONTINUUM GOES 

01:29:20.182 --> 01:29:25.492
TO A GRINDING HALT.  AND WHEN 
THEY COME HOME, THEY FEEL THE 

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:30.771
RUNNING AROUND THEM 1,000 MILES 
AN HOUR AND THEY ARE STUCK IN A 

01:29:30.772 --> 01:29:34.513
SPOT WHERE THEY NEED SOMEBODY TO
 TALK TO.  LET'S GET INTO THE 

01:29:34.652 --> 01:29:36.652
RESOURCES.  WE HAVE THE

01:29:38.588 --> 01:29:41.714
 VETERANS COURTS THAT HAVE 
SPREAD AND GROW A LOT MORE.  

01:29:41.715 --> 01:29:45.562
WHAT AVAILABLE RESOURCES ARE 
THERE THAT VETERANS CAN REACH 

01:29:45.563 --> 01:29:50.746
OUT TO?  WE HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE 
WATCHING ON TV AND PERHAPS 

01:29:50.747 --> 01:29:57.562
SITTING THERE SAYING, I DIDN'T 
GET OUT OF BED UNTIL 11 THIS 

01:29:57.563 --> 01:30:03.584
MORNING AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GET
 OUT OF BED.  

01:30:03.585 --> 01:30:07.451
WHAT ARE THE RESOURCES?  
SPEAKER:  THERE ARE A LOT.  I 

01:30:07.659 --> 01:30:10.390
WOULD SAY FOR THOSE, BECAUSE WE 
KNOW ALL OF THE MEDIA 

01:30:10.697 --> 01:30:14.472
SURROUNDING WITH THE VA, THEY 
DON'T TRUST THE VA HOSPITALS FOR

01:30:14.935 --> 01:30:16.935
 WHATEVER REASON.  THE VET 
CENTERS. 

01:30:20.322 --> 01:30:25.051
 TRY THE VET CENTERS.  
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST CLASS 

01:30:25.305 --> 01:30:27.851
EFFICIENT MENTAL HEALTH 
OPERATIONS IN THE VA SYSTEMS.  

01:30:28.044 --> 01:30:30.579
SPEAKER:  ALL THEY NEED TO DO IS
 WALK IN AND SAY I NEED SOMEBODY

01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:34.182
 TO TALK TO.  YOU DON'T NEED TO 
FILL OUT THE PAPERWORK AND GO 

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:37.409
THROUGH RED TAPE.  
SPEAKER:  YOUR MENTAL HEALTH 

01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:39.699
INFORMATION THAT YOU CHOOSE TO 
SHARE AT A VET CENTER, DOESN'T 

01:30:40.013 --> 01:30:45.820
GO TO THE MOTHERSHIP, UNLESS YOU
 SIGN A CONSENT.  AND FOR THOSE 

01:30:46.017 --> 01:30:49.087
VET CENTERS THAT HAVE THE 
RESOURCES, MEANING THE MONEY AND

01:30:49.217 --> 01:30:52.849
 THE PEOPLE, THEY ALSO CAN WORK 
WITH FAMILIES AND THAT'S A BIG 

01:30:53.089 --> 01:30:56.769
DEAL.  BECAUSE THE BIG HOSPITALS
 AND STUFF AREN'T ALLOWED TO DO 

01:30:58.425 --> 01:31:01.833
THAT.  THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS. 
BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE VET 

01:31:02.978 --> 01:31:06.917
CENTERS AND A LOT OF THE TEAM 
LEADERS, WHAT THEY CALL THE VET 

01:31:07.143 --> 01:31:09.622
CENTERS, ARE COMBAT VETERANS 
THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHAT MADE 

01:31:09.936 --> 01:31:13.953
IT SUCH A SUCCESS.  THAT TEN 
YEARS AGO, FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, I 

01:31:14.317 --> 01:31:19.761
GUESS NOW, BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN 
IN THIS LATEST MORASS FOR THAT 

01:31:20.008 --> 01:31:26.374
LONG, MOST OF THE LEADERS WERE 
COMBAT VIETNAM VETERANS.  

01:31:26.375 --> 01:31:28.899
SPEAKER:  330 OR SO 

01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:38.066
VTC'S AT THE TREATMENT POSTS, 
THERE ARE EXACTLY 300 VET 

01:31:38.067 --> 01:31:43.217
CENTERS LOCATED IN CITIES AND 
STRIP MALLS.  IT SHOULD BE TWICE

01:31:43.218 --> 01:31:47.704
 THAT NUMBER AT LEAST. MENT 
THAT'S WHEN RESOURCES NEED TO 

01:31:47.918 --> 01:31:52.400
GO.  BUT IT'S ALSO, WE DEPEND 
UPON THE VA TO, AND THE 

01:31:52.401 --> 01:31:54.401
GOVERNMENT TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE

01:31:58.899 --> 01:32:08.744
 SEVERELY COMBAT WOUNDED TO HELP
 THEM FISCALLY, PHYSICALLY, 

01:32:08.745 --> 01:32:10.745
SPIRITUAL LY

01:32:12.501 --> 01:32:17.547
  AND YOU HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE 
COMMUNITY YOU LIVE IN.  STOP TO 

01:32:17.777 --> 01:32:21.857
THINK ABOUT THIS.  AFTER THE 
SECOND WORLD WAR, WHEN THE 

01:32:22.232 --> 01:32:25.662
POPULATION OF THIS COUNTRY WAS 
ABOUT 130 MILLION OR SO, 16 

01:32:26.864 --> 01:32:30.758
MILLION AMERICANS, MEN AND WOMEN
 WERE IN UNIFORM.  JUST ABOUT 

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:33.923
EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY WAS 
INVOLVED IN THE WAR EFFORTS.  I 

01:32:34.416 --> 01:32:38.374
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NUMBERS WERE
 FOR KOREA.  IN VIETNAM HAD 

01:32:38.523 --> 01:32:41.421
SHRUNK TO SOMETHING LIKE 9%.  
SOME PEOPLE SAID 

01:32:44.463 --> 01:32:49.712
4%.  RIGHT NOW, LESS THAN ONE 
HALF OF 1% OF AMERICANS, AND 

01:32:49.713 --> 01:32:54.782
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT 
5-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN, BUT 

01:32:54.924 --> 01:33:00.005
AMERICANS I GUESS 18 OR ABOVE, 
SERVE IN THE MILITARY.  THIS IS 

01:33:00.327 --> 01:33:03.022
A TINY NUMBER.  PEOPLE GO TO 
COLLEGE AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO 

01:33:03.387 --> 01:33:06.256
WORRY ABOUT BEING DRAFTED OR 
ANYTHING.  

01:33:06.257 --> 01:33:08.317
WHEN WE WERE IN SCHOOL, THAT 
WAS, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS

01:33:08.567 --> 01:33:17.389
 THAT KEPT US IN SCHOOL, AS LONG
 AS WE HAD THE GRADES.  BUT 

01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:23.813
PEOPLE COME HOME AND A LOT OF 
TIMES THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING

01:33:24.031 --> 01:33:29.009
 IN COMMUNITY.  WHICH IS TRAGIC 
AND IT REACHES TO MORE AREAS.  

01:33:29.144 --> 01:33:32.004
PEOPLE AREN'T WELCOMED HOME INTO
 THE GRATEFUL NATION.  BECAUSE 

01:33:32.297 --> 01:33:36.621
TOO OFTEN THE NATION IS NOT 
GRATEFUL FOR A WAR WITHOUT END. 

01:33:36.736 --> 01:33:42.255
AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAD IN 
VIETNAM.  AND THAT'S WHAT WE 

01:33:42.378 --> 01:33:45.341
HAVE NOW.  
SPEAKER:  THE VETERANS CRISIS 

01:33:45.657 --> 01:33:49.131
LINE IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND GIVING
 OUT THAT NUMBER.  

01:33:49.132 --> 01:33:51.215
SPEAKER:  THE VETERANS CRISIS 
LINE, 

01:33:54.710 --> 01:33:58.653
1800-273-8255 AND WHEN YOU CALL 
THAT NUMBER, JUST PRESS 1. 

01:33:58.654 --> 01:34:02.848
SPEAKER:  PRESS 1.  AND TIM, LET
 ME GO TO YOU, YOU CAME BACK 

01:34:02.849 --> 01:34:06.735
FROM THIS WAR.  HOPE WAS THE 
WORD THAT YOU USED.  THE 

01:34:06.736 --> 01:34:09.201
VETERANS THAT I TALKED TO IN 
THIS WAR, THEY SEEM TO THINK 

01:34:09.202 --> 01:34:11.959
THAT THE PEOPLE AT HOME, WHILE 
THEY ARE GRATEFUL FOR THEIR 

01:34:12.223 --> 01:34:15.231
SERVICE, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND 
WHAT THE SERVICE WAS FOR.  AND 

01:34:15.232 --> 01:34:18.515
THEN THE TRANSLATION TO YOU WAS,
 WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?  IS 

01:34:18.516 --> 01:34:21.602
THAT A PART OF WHAT YOU 
PROCESSED?  OR ARE STILL 

01:34:21.979 --> 01:34:23.507
PROCESSING?  
SPEAKER:  I THINK FOR A SHORT 

01:34:23.508 --> 01:34:28.331
PERIOD OF TIME I WENT THROUGH 
THAT.  NOT SO MUCH NOW.  TO ME 

01:34:29.466 --> 01:34:31.855
WHAT I DID OVER THERE WAS 
STAYING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER 

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:37.991
WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.  
WE DID WHAT WE HAD TO DO TO GO 

01:34:38.257 --> 01:34:43.929
THROUGH EVERY SINGLE DAY TO 
PROTECT ONE ANOTHER.  I DON'T 

01:34:44.166 --> 01:34:47.387
GET TOO FAR INTO IT POLITICAL, 
WHY WE DID WHAT WE DID.  THAT'S 

01:34:47.639 --> 01:34:52.167
NOT MY CONCERN.  THEN WAS 
PROTECTING THE PEOPLE TO THE 

01:34:52.755 --> 01:34:54.755
RIGHT AND LEFT OF ME.  
SPEAKER:  DID YOU HAVE A CLEARLY

01:34:55.330 --> 01:34:58.960
 DEFINED OBJECTIVE AS A WARRIOR 
IN BATTLE?  DID YOU UNDERSTAND 

01:34:59.154 --> 01:35:02.826
DAY TO DAY WHAT IT IS WHAT YOU 
WERE TRYING TO DO OR ACCOMPLISH?

01:35:04.144 --> 01:35:09.218
SPEAKER:  YES.  I HAD -- I WAS A
 SERGEANT AND MY JOB WAS TO 

01:35:09.436 --> 01:35:12.313
PROTECT THE PEOPLE UNDERNEATH ME
 AND THAT WAS MY MAIN OBJECTIVE 

01:35:14.303 --> 01:35:19.904
EVERY SINGLE DAY.  I WAS A 50 
CAL GUNNER.  MY OBJECTIVE WAS TO

01:35:20.096 --> 01:35:25.517
 GET THE PEOPLE FROM POINT A TO 
POINT B.  THAT WAS MY OBJECTIVE.

01:35:25.954 --> 01:35:30.161
THERE ARE ALSO GOOD PEOPLE IN 
THE COUNTRY OF IRAQ WHO NEED 

01:35:30.319 --> 01:35:37.501
PROTECTION.  AND WE PROTECTED 
THEM AS WELL.  

01:35:37.502 --> 01:35:40.961
SPEAKER:  I WANT TO KNOW, HERE 

01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:49.265
IN THE AUDIENCE, COMES FROM 
MASSACHUSETTS, FOR THE PAST 

01:35:49.447 --> 01:35:52.791
SEVERAL YEARS, HE AND I, HIS 
WIFE, AND A COUPLE OF OTHER 

01:35:53.243 --> 01:35:58.974
FOLKS HAVE GONE UP TO QUINSY AT 
THE END OF APRIL FOR A CEREMONY.

01:35:59.371 --> 01:36:06.037
UNITED COMBAT VETERANS OF QUINS,
 WHY, 95% OF VETERANS WHO SERVED

01:36:06.396 --> 01:36:08.584
 IN THE MARINE CORE.  TALK ABOUT

01:36:12.605 --> 01:36:17.618
 VETERANS, YOU HAVE IT.  AND YOU
 USED TO GO DOWN TO THE CLOCK 

01:36:17.874 --> 01:36:22.950
TOWER.  48 OF THE SONS OF QUINSY
 WHO DIED DURING THE VIETNAM 

01:36:23.479 --> 01:36:25.462
WAR.
THEY WOULD READ THE NAMES AND GO

01:36:25.463 --> 01:36:33.415
 TO THIS FAIRLY AWFUL CHINESE 
RESTAURANT.  BUT THERE WAS A 

01:36:34.126 --> 01:36:36.126
CERTAIN LOYALTY THERE.  AND

01:36:38.894 --> 01:36:43.832
 WHEN THEY ADDED BOB'S BROTHER'S
 NAME TO THE ROSTER OF THE DEAD,

01:36:44.205 --> 01:36:47.373
 THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE.  YOU 
HAD A SITUATION WHERE MORE AND 

01:36:48.587 --> 01:36:52.385
MORE PEOPLE STARTED COMING, 
POLITICAL LEADERS STARTED 

01:36:52.585 --> 01:36:58.055
COMING.  FOLKS LIKE PAUL 
BUCKHAM, HONOR RECIPIENT WAS A 

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:02.765
GUEST SPEAKER.  THIS YEAR 
GENERAL JOE DUNFORD, CHAIRMAN OF

01:37:02.893 --> 01:37:10.622
 THE JOINT CHIEF OF STAFF, ALSO 
QUINSY RESIDENT, CAME TO GIVEN 

01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:15.677
THE KEYNOTE SPEECH.  HE HAD A 
SITUATION WHERE THE COMMUNITY 

01:37:15.852 --> 01:37:19.376
EMBRACES THOSE WHO SERVE AND 
TRIES TO HELP THEM HEAL.  IT'S A

01:37:19.515 --> 01:37:24.231
 SMALL PART OF THE COMMUNITY.  
BUT IT'S ALWAYS, IT SEEMS, 

01:37:24.963 --> 01:37:30.554
VETERANS HELPING VETERANS.  
THOSE WHO DIDN'T SERVE, YOU 

01:37:30.691 --> 01:37:35.146
DON'T GET IT THE SAME WAY.  A 
LOT OF NONVETERANS WILL SAY 

01:37:35.526 --> 01:37:39.277
WELCOME HOME.  THAT'S NICE.  
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.  

01:37:39.506 --> 01:37:43.904
THAT'S NICE.  BUT THEY DON'T 
UNDERSTAND IT.  WHEN A VETERAN 

01:37:43.905 --> 01:37:47.735
SAYS THAT TO SOMEONE WHO HAS 
COME BACK, IT HAS A DIFFERENT 

01:37:47.850 --> 01:37:55.365
CONTEXT ALMOST.  AND IN QUINSY, 
IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I THINK 

01:37:55.492 --> 01:37:58.893
A LOT OF OTHER COMMUNITIES CAN 
DO AND SHOULD DO.  NOT ONLY FOR 

01:37:59.452 --> 01:38:03.575
THE YOUNGER GUYS, BUT FOR ALL 
VETERANS.  A LOT OF THE VETERANS

01:38:04.104 --> 01:38:08.189
 TREATMENT COURTS, THERE ARE 
MORE VIETNAM ERA VETERANS THAN 

01:38:08.190 --> 01:38:11.696
THERE ARE IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
VETERANS.  

01:38:11.697 --> 01:38:14.083
SPEAKER:  RIGHT.  
SPEAKER:  WHEN YOU WERE 

01:38:14.234 --> 01:38:19.258
MENTIONING THE FILM CLIP WE SAW.
22 VETERANS COMMIT SUICIDE EVERY

01:38:19.993 --> 01:38:21.063
 DAY.  
SPEAKER:  20.  

01:38:21.064 --> 01:38:26.046
SPEAKER:  IT SAID 22 THERE.  
SPEAKER:  EVEN ONE A DAY IS TOO 

01:38:26.272 --> 01:38:28.272
MUCH.  
SPEAKER:  SOMETHING LIKE 70% OF 

01:38:28.518 --> 01:38:33.658
THOSE VETERANS ARE AGE 55 AND 
OLDER.  THEY'RE NOT THE YOUNG 

01:38:33.773 --> 01:38:36.757
PEOPLE WHO CAME BACK.  THE 
CONNOTATION WAS HERE LOOK AT THE

01:38:37.179 --> 01:38:41.434
 DAMAGED PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING 
HOME.  A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO 

01:38:41.729 --> 01:38:45.451
ARE AMONG -- 
SPEAKER:  ONE OF THE LARGEST 

01:38:46.773 --> 01:38:50.410
HOMELESS POPULATIONS IN OUR 
COUNTRY IS VETERANS FROM THE 

01:38:50.542 --> 01:38:52.440
VIETNAM WAR.  
SPEAKER:  AND EXCUSE ME, I WOULD

01:38:52.441 --> 01:38:54.713
 ARGUE.  HERE IS A DISCUSSION 
POINT.  OKAY.  BECAUSE NOT ALL 

01:38:54.978 --> 01:39:00.276
OF YOU ARE IN THE AUDIENCE AND 
ARE VETERANS.  WHAT BERNIE SAID 

01:39:00.612 --> 01:39:06.007
ABOUT THE VETERANS IN THE 
COMMUNITY IS FINE.  TO DRAW 

01:39:06.284 --> 01:39:10.076
VETERANS TOGETHER.  WHAT I WOULD
 SAY IS, INSTEAD OF HAVING 

01:39:10.203 --> 01:39:18.764
VETERANS NIGHT AT THE BALLPARK, 
TAKE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE USED

01:39:18.951 --> 01:39:22.811
 TO DO THAT, MAKE SURE THAT YOUR
 COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH OFFICE 

01:39:22.936 --> 01:39:26.847
IS NOT ONLY OPEN 24/7 SEVERAL 
DAYS A WEEK, BUT IS STAFFED WITH

01:39:26.958 --> 01:39:33.565
 SOMEBODY THAT CAN HANDLE 
MILITARY PTSD OR MST.  THAT IS 

01:39:34.670 --> 01:39:37.679
SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY CAN
 DO TO HELP OUR VETERANS.  THE. 

01:39:37.818 --> 01:39:40.057
SPEAKER:  GREG, LET ME ASK YOU 
THIS: ESPECIALLY NOW WE'RE 

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.398
TALKING ABOUT RESOURCES THAT MAY
 BE TIGHTENING UP AND BUDGETS 

01:39:43.399 --> 01:39:46.987
MAY BE CHANGING AND THERE MAY 
NOT BE AS MUCH MONEY TO HELP 

01:39:46.988 --> 01:39:49.516
FUND PROGRAMS THAT ARE THERE.  
WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO?  I 

01:39:49.517 --> 01:39:52.296
ESPECIALLY WANT TO DEAL WITH 
FOLKS RURAL.  

01:39:52.297 --> 01:39:55.924
I'M FROM A SMALLER TOWN OUTSIDE 
OF CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW PEOPLE 

01:39:56.487 --> 01:39:59.399
IN OUR POPULATIONS ENDED UP 
GOING IN AND LISTING INTO THE 

01:39:59.524 --> 01:40:02.918
MILITARY.  WHAT DO FOLKS IN 
RURAL COMMUNITIES DO?  HOW DO 

01:40:03.061 --> 01:40:06.428
THEY DEAL WITH WARRIORS WHO 
BECOME SOMEWHAT ISOLATED AND 

01:40:06.610 --> 01:40:10.283
PERHAPS TURN TO DRUGS AND 
ALCOHOL AS AN ESCAPE, WHAT DO 

01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:12.420
YOU THINK FOR THEM?  
SPEAKER:  NUMBER ONE, NATIONAL 

01:40:12.677 --> 01:40:15.835
INSTITUTE OF CORRECTIONS 
PROVIDES TRAINING.  AND IF THEY 

01:40:16.576 --> 01:40:20.286
ARE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT A 
VETERANS CORE TREATMENT PROGRAM,

01:40:20.479 --> 01:40:27.786
 CAN CONTACT NIC AT NIC.GOV AND 
WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHETHER YOU 

01:40:27.941 --> 01:40:32.758
WANT TO START A TREATMENT COURT 
OR SOME OTHER PROGRAMMING.  OR 

01:40:33.054 --> 01:40:35.054
THEY CAN CONTACT JUSTICE

01:40:38.279 --> 01:40:42.254
 FOR VETS OR THERE IS GRANTS 
AVAILABLE.  BUT YOU HAVE TO 

01:40:42.566 --> 01:40:45.723
UNDERSTAND YOUR POPULATION AND I
 THINK DATA DRIVES A LOT OF 

01:40:46.323 --> 01:40:48.984
DECISIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  
AND IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW 

01:40:49.525 --> 01:40:53.780
MANY VETERANS YOU HAVE IN YOUR 
JAIL OR CASE LOADS, I THINK THEY

01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:58.360
 CAN HELP LEAD TO WARRANTING A 
PROGRAM IN YOUR JURISDICTION.  

01:40:58.566 --> 01:41:01.235
DON'T JUST ASK IF YOU'RE A 
VETERAN.  SOMETIMES THEY ONLY 

01:41:01.592 --> 01:41:04.934
THINK YOU'RE ONLY A VETERAN IF 
YOU SERVED IN COMBAT.  YOU HAVE 

01:41:05.162 --> 01:41:08.947
TO ASK, HAVE YOU SERVED IN THE 
MILITARY.  ONCE YOU HAVE 

01:41:09.068 --> 01:41:13.245
JUSTIFIED YOUR PROGRAMMING.  AND
 I THINK JUDGE PETERSON I THINK 

01:41:13.372 --> 01:41:16.760
YOU CAN SPEAK TO THIS.  YOU CAN 
CREATE SOMETHING WITH EXISTING 

01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:18.990
RESOURCES.  
SPEAKER:  YEAH I'M DYING TO 

01:41:19.014 --> 01:41:22.550
KNOW, IF WE HAD 5,000 JUDGES 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY SITTING HERE 

01:41:22.673 --> 01:41:27.121
WATCHING THIS, WHAT CAN YOU TELL
 THEM ABOUT THINGS BEING 

01:41:27.122 --> 01:41:30.031
MODIFIED ABOUT RETURNING VETS 
WHO MAY BE DEALING WITH SOME OF 

01:41:30.032 --> 01:41:32.953
THE ISSUES?
SPEAKER:  I TELL THEM FIRST, 

01:41:33.234 --> 01:41:36.894
YOU'RE GOING TO PROSECUTE THESE 
GUYS ANYWAY.  YOU'RE GOING TO 

01:41:37.305 --> 01:41:41.833
DEFEND THEM.  THEY'RE GOING TO 
BE CHARGED AND HAVE THE COURT 

01:41:42.223 --> 01:41:46.006
CLERK PULL THE FILE.  WHY DON'T 
YOU PUT THEM ALL ON THE SAME 

01:41:46.007 --> 01:41:49.028
DOCKET?  IT DOESN'T COST YOU ANY
 MORE TO DO THAT.  AND FROM THAT

01:41:49.185 --> 01:41:52.265
 YOU CAN DEVELOP A VETERANS 
COURT DOCKET AND YOU CAN START 

01:41:52.266 --> 01:41:54.848
LOOKING INTO LOCAL RESOURCES.  
AT SOME POINT IN TIME I REMEMBER

01:41:55.167 --> 01:41:59.352
 TALKING TO JUDGE RUSSEL AND 
THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT MAKING

01:41:59.681 --> 01:42:04.091
 COOKIE CUTTER COURTS AND ALL OF
 THE VETERANS COURTS WOULD LOOK 

01:42:04.215 --> 01:42:08.249
ALIKE.  
THE REALITY IS EVERYONE HAS A 

01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:15.809
DIFFERENT GROUP OF VETERANS.  IN
 IDAHO, 90% IS MARINES.  AND IN 

01:42:15.938 --> 01:42:20.026
OUR JURISDICTION, IT'S ARMY.  
AND SOME COURTS WILL HANDLE 

01:42:20.407 --> 01:42:24.492
FELONY-LEVEL EVENTS AND SOME DO 
MISDEMEANOR EVENTS.  AND SOME DO

01:42:24.614 --> 01:42:27.701
 A COMBINATION.  
BUT YOU CAN DO THIS AND SET A 

01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:31.050
PROGRAM TOGETHER AND SET UP THE 
DOCKETS.  IT DOESN'T COST YOU 

01:42:31.051 --> 01:42:33.051
ANYTHING.  
SPEAKER:  YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT 

01:42:33.077 --> 01:42:34.718
PUTTING RESOURCES TOGETHER.  
THEY'RE GOING TO BE CHARGED WITH

01:42:34.719 --> 01:42:39.709
 THE CRIME AND GO THROUGH THE 
JUDICIAL SYSTEM BUT YOU'RE GOING

01:42:39.853 --> 01:42:44.855
 TO HAVE ONE ON ONE.  WITH THE 
VETS.  

01:42:44.856 --> 01:42:48.212
SPEAKER:  EACH COURT HAS 
DEVELOPED THEIR OWN MENTORIZED 

01:42:48.345 --> 01:42:53.281
SYSTEM.  WE HAVE DEVELOPED A 
FORUM.  MEETS ONCE A MONTH AND 

01:42:53.282 --> 01:42:58.541
EVERY VETERAN HAS TO ATTEND SIX 
FORUMS.  IF YOU HAVE 12 MONTHS 

01:42:59.450 --> 01:43:03.098
OF PROBATION, YOU LOSE A MONTH 
OF PROBATION EVERY TIME YOU COME

01:43:03.274 --> 01:43:07.495
 TO THE FORUM.  THE INCENTIVE IS
 TO COME TO THE FORUM.  AT THE 

01:43:07.703 --> 01:43:11.333
FORUM, WE FEED THEM AND GIVE 
THEM A DINNER AND THEN WE HAVE 

01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:15.630
THEM SET UP A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT
 COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR CHILD 

01:43:15.949 --> 01:43:18.588
SUPPORT AND LICENSING FOR 
DRIVER'S LICENSE AND LANDLORD 

01:43:19.324 --> 01:43:21.829
TENANT ATTORNEYS AND WE PUT 
EVERY RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO A 

01:43:22.730 --> 01:43:26.414
VETERAN IN ONE ROOM.  AFTER WE 
GO THROUGH THE RESOURCE 

01:43:26.632 --> 01:43:30.490
PORTIONS, GO THROUGH TWO 
ONE-HOUR THERAPY SESSIONS.  AND 

01:43:30.638 --> 01:43:32.413
AFTER THAT GET THROUGH THE 
PROGRAM.  

01:43:32.414 --> 01:43:34.414
SPEAKER:  LET ME STOP YOU.  A 
LOT OF THE RESOURCES THAT YOU'RE

01:43:34.926 --> 01:43:37.977
 TALKING ABOUT.  IN MOST CASES 
IT'S A PHONE CALL.  THEY ARE 

01:43:38.186 --> 01:43:40.186
WILLING TO VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME 
AND SERVICE BECAUSE OF THE 

01:43:40.650 --> 01:43:45.762
POPULATION WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.
GREG YOU HAD SOMETHING?  

01:43:45.763 --> 01:43:50.310
SPEAKER:  YEAH, I WANT TO SAY, 
YOU CAN LOOK AT TREATMENT COURTS

01:43:51.038 --> 01:43:54.710
 FOR VETS.  YOU CAN ASK YOUR 
JURISDICTION.  YOU CAN CONTACT 

01:43:55.034 --> 01:43:57.634
JUSTICE FOR VETS.  THEY HAVE 
FOUR MENTOR COURTS.  AND YOU CAN

01:43:58.458 --> 01:44:01.379
 MAKE A REQUEST TO TAKE A TEAM 
ON SITE AND SEE WHAT IS GOING ON

01:44:02.767 --> 01:44:07.462
 AND VIEW THAT COURT.  
SPEAKER:  YEAH, IF YOU ARE IN 

01:44:07.617 --> 01:44:13.299
ANY WAY INTERESTED IN GOING TO 
THE VETERANS COURT.  GO TO THE 

01:44:13.747 --> 01:44:15.561
WEBSITE.  
SPEAKER:  LET ME DO THIS REAL 

01:44:15.562 --> 01:44:19.949
QUICK.  TIM, WHEN YOU CAME BACK,
 THE GOAL WITH PTSD IS FIGURING 

01:44:20.103 --> 01:44:22.564
OUT THE DIAGNOSIS AND WHAT YOU 
ARE UP AGAINST AND INTERVENING 

01:44:22.732 --> 01:44:26.315
IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO YOU
 CAN HELP THAT FROM TURNING TO 

01:44:26.791 --> 01:44:29.363
REALLY BAD DECISIONS AND 
ULTIMATELY TURNING INTO SOMEBODY

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:35.909
 WHO PERHAPS ACTS OUT AND COULD 
BE COMMITTING CRIMES.  

01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:39.250
WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE THING 
THAT IMMEDIATELY INTERCEPTED YOU

01:44:39.536 --> 01:44:43.216
 WHEN COMING BACK FROM COMBAT 
IMMENSELY?  

01:44:43.217 --> 01:44:47.052
SPEAKER:  VETERANS COURT.  NO 
DOUBT IN MY MIND.  I WOULDN'T 

01:44:47.319 --> 01:44:52.763
HAVE HAD SEVEN ARRESTS AND 
WOULDN'T HAVE SPENT YEARS IN MY 

01:44:52.914 --> 01:44:56.643
LIFE IN PRISONS.  I WOULD HAVE 
BEEN IN MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.  

01:44:56.804 --> 01:44:59.997
SPEAKER:  YOU NEED A VET TO TELL
 YOU, YOU ARE A CHANGED MAN.  

01:44:59.998 --> 01:45:02.720
YOU CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.  
SPEAKER:  YEAH, AND I NEED A 

01:45:02.888 --> 01:45:06.102
ROOM WHERE YOU CAN WALK IN AND 
THE RESOURCES ARE RIGHT THERE.  

01:45:07.424 --> 01:45:12.288
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PERPLEXED 
THAT VETERAN

01:45:15.293 --> 01:45:20.395
 COURTS WORK.  IN REALITY, IT'S 
ONE STAFF, ONE JUDGE, ONE 

01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:24.092
COURTROOM, ONE DAY A WEEK.  
SPEAKER:  THEY ARE SPEAKING YOUR

01:45:24.093 --> 01:45:26.093
 LANGUAGE.  
SPEAKER:  THEY ARE SPEAKING MY 

01:45:26.133 --> 01:45:28.155
LANGUAGE AND I CAN WALK INTO 
THAT ROOM AND GET EVERYTHING 

01:45:28.156 --> 01:45:31.941
THAT I NEED.  YOU CAN'T GET THAT
 ANYWHERE ELSE. 

01:45:31.942 --> 01:45:38.052
SPEAKER:  AND EVEN BEFORE ALL 
THAT, IF SOMEBODY COMMITS A 

01:45:38.165 --> 01:45:40.458
CRIME, THE FIRST PEOPLE IN THE 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT 

01:45:40.619 --> 01:45:43.552
THEY ARE GOING TO COME ACROSS 
ARE THE POLICE.  AND THE 

01:45:45.263 --> 01:45:48.498
JUSTICE-INVOLVED VETERANS 
NETWORK IS ONE GENTLEMAN, 

01:45:48.624 --> 01:45:52.139
CAPTAIN BLAIR MYHAND IN NORTH 
CAROLINA.  

01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:55.137
SPEAKER:  NOW CHIEF.  
SPEAKER:  OKAY.  THAT I DIDN'T 

01:45:55.412 --> 01:45:59.173
KNOW.  AND WHAT HE DOES IS HE 
TAKES A COUPLE OF VETS WHO ARE 

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:07.982
ON THE POLICE FORCE, AND TRAINS 
THEM IN HOW TO DEAL WITH A 

01:46:08.159 --> 01:46:11.382
CRISIS IF SOMEBODY IS A VETERAN 
AND IF THEY KNOW THE PERSON IS A

01:46:13.209 --> 01:46:18.993
 VETERAN BECAUSE THE SPOUSE 
TELLS THE FIRST, THESE GUYS COME

01:46:19.128 --> 01:46:23.756
 AND THEY KNOW WHAT TO SAY AND 
THEY KNOW HOW TO BRING SOMEBODY 

01:46:23.757 --> 01:46:27.113
DOWN FROM THE CRISIS HE IS IN OR
 SHE IS IN.  AND ALSO DOES THIS 

01:46:27.503 --> 01:46:30.702
TRAINING FOR OTHER POLICE 
DEPARTMENTS.  I THINK TWICE A 

01:46:30.848 --> 01:46:35.688
YEAR.  BUT THE POLICE HAVE A 
GREATER ROLE THAT THEY CAN PLAY.

01:46:36.337 --> 01:46:41.883
AND IT'S NOT GOING ON NEARLY AS 
MUCH.  

01:46:41.884 --> 01:46:44.435
SPEAKER:  IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT
 THE BARRIER RIGHT NOW THAT 

01:46:44.599 --> 01:46:47.436
EXISTS, ESPECIALLY WITH LAW 
ENFORCEMENT?  A LOT OF MY 

01:46:47.678 --> 01:46:50.724
FRIENDS WHO ARE POLICE OFFICERS 
TEND TO GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF THE

01:46:50.830 --> 01:46:55.898
 DOUBT TO A RETURNING VET.  THEY
 WILL PAT THEM ON THE BACK AND 

01:46:56.121 --> 01:46:59.194
SAY DON'T DO THIS.  IS THAT 
DOING THEM A FAVOR OR IS THAT 

01:46:59.527 --> 01:47:05.098
HURTING THEM?  YOU ARE BASICALLY
 IN DENIAL.  YOU'RE A VET.  I'M 

01:47:05.239 --> 01:47:08.412
CUTTING YOU SOME SLACK HERE.  
SPEAKER:  IN MY OPINION IT'S 

01:47:08.996 --> 01:47:10.996
DEFINITELY HURTING THEM.  
SPEAKER:  JUST A KICK IN THE 

01:47:11.074 --> 01:47:12.299
CAN.  
SPEAKER:  DEFINITELY.  ONE OF 

01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:15.259
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN MY 
JOB IS TO DO CRISIS INTERVENTION

01:47:15.865 --> 01:47:18.516
 TRAINING WITH THE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT.  I GO OVER TO THE 

01:47:18.639 --> 01:47:21.755
PHILADELPHIA POLICE DEPARTMENT 
AND GO OVER TO CAMDEN, NEW 

01:47:22.201 --> 01:47:24.649
JERSEY AND TELL THEM MY STORY 
FLAT OUT.  THE BEST THING THAT 

01:47:24.786 --> 01:47:28.082
HAPPENED TO ME WAS GETTING THAT 
FINAL ARREST AND NOT GETTING LET

01:47:28.266 --> 01:47:31.625
 GO THAT WAY AND ACTUALLY 
GETTING PUT IN A VETERANS COURT.

01:47:31.626 --> 01:47:35.943
  IT ABSOLUTELY CHANGED MY LIFE.
  I EDUCATE THE POLICE ON PTSD, 

01:47:36.497 --> 01:47:40.807
TBI, YOU KNOW, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
 WHICH IS VERY HIGH AMONGST 

01:47:40.933 --> 01:47:43.752
VETERANS.  
AND I TELL MY STORY.  AND IT 

01:47:43.929 --> 01:47:46.200
REALLY STRIKES HOME WITH THEM.  
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY 

01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:49.415
THEY'RE THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND
 THE ONES OUT ON THE STREET 

01:47:49.616 --> 01:47:54.629
COMING IN CONTACT WITH THESE 
VETERANVETERANS.  THE ONES OUT 

01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:57.755
THERE BUYING HEROIN AND GETTING 
IN BAR FIGHTS AND STUFF LIKE 

01:47:57.869 --> 01:47:59.797
THAT.  
THEY ARE SHOWING UP ON THE SCENE

01:47:59.798 --> 01:48:03.779
 AND THE DECISIONS THEY MAKE 
THAT DAY CAN ABSOLUTELY CHANGE 

01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:06.484
THEIR LIFE FOR THE BETTER.  
GETTING ARRESTED IS NOT THE 

01:48:06.485 --> 01:48:09.483
WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO 
THE VET.  

01:48:09.484 --> 01:48:12.383
SPEAKER:  IT CAN BE KICKING A 
CAN DOWN THE ROAD.  BUT UNLESS 

01:48:12.556 --> 01:48:14.795
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, YOU
 HAVE TO UNDERSTAND YOUR 

01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:17.145
RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY AND 
HAVE TO BE WILLING TO MAKE A 

01:48:17.146 --> 01:48:20.355
REFERRAL.  I THINK SOME OF THE 
THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON IN 

01:48:20.717 --> 01:48:25.992
NIC AND WITH FOLKS UP HERE REAL 
QUICK, INCREASING WHAT THEY CALL

01:48:26.168 --> 01:48:31.097
 THE RESPONSIBILITY ISSUES OF 
VETERANS.  AND LOOKING AT 

01:48:31.365 --> 01:48:35.347
DEVELOPING TRAINING AND CULTURE 
AS YOU ARE TRANSITIONING FROM 

01:48:36.110 --> 01:48:38.601
MILITARY TO CIVILIAN LIFE AND 
WORKING ON THE CURRICULUM FOR 

01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:41.866
THE INNOVATION AND HOPING TO 
MAKE THIS AVAILABLE TO THE 

01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:43.996
FIELD.  
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE 

01:48:43.997 --> 01:48:47.628
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF 
CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT PARTNERED

01:48:49.031 --> 01:48:51.031
 WITH BUR

01:48:52.419 --> 01:48:58.530
EAU OF JUSTICE ASSISTANCE TO 
WORK WITH A COMPREHENSIVE TOOL 

01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:02.539
AND PROTOCOL TO HELP BEST SERVE 
THE VETERANS IN THE JUSTICE 

01:49:02.724 --> 01:49:04.724
SYSTEM.  
SPEAKER:  OKAY.  WE JUST HAVE A 

01:49:04.885 --> 01:49:07.516
FEW MINUTES LEFT FOR THE PANEL. 
I WANT TO GET SOME CLOSING 

01:49:07.642 --> 01:49:11.862
REMARKS.  IF WE CAN GET IT BRIEF
 THOUGH AS WE GO DOWN THE LINE. 

01:49:13.898 --> 01:49:18.108
AT THE END.  IS THERE A HOPEFUL 
MESSAGE TO PASS ALONG.  WHAT IS 

01:49:18.228 --> 01:49:21.566
IT THAT YOU HOPE WOULD HAPPEN 
FOR YEARS TO COME?  WE HAVE 

01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:24.557
ALREADY IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM. 
WE'RE A NATION OF LIKING TO FIX 

01:49:24.942 --> 01:49:27.069
PROBLEMS.  WE WILL START WITH 
YOU TIM AT THE END.  

01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:30.087
SPEAKER:  I HOPE THAT ALL OF THE
 WORK UP UNTIL THIS POINT DOES 

01:49:30.443 --> 01:49:34.087
NOT GO TO WASTE AND I HOPE THAT 
THE PEOPLE KEEP THEIR FIRE LIT 

01:49:34.305 --> 01:49:37.540
AND KEEP THEIR FOOT TO THE PEDAL
 AND KEEP THEIR FEET ON THE GAS.

01:49:39.701 --> 01:49:43.062
TO CLEAR UP ANY TIME SOON.  WE 
HAVE VIETNAM VETS WHO ARE COMING

01:49:43.372 --> 01:49:46.487
 INTO OUR COURTS WHO HAVE NEVER 
DEALT WITH ANYTHING FOR YEARS 

01:49:46.641 --> 01:49:50.564
AND YEARS AND YEARS AND COMING 
INTO THE COURTS AND CHANGING 

01:49:50.686 --> 01:49:52.757
THEIR LIVES AROUND.  IT'S NEVER 
TOO LATE.  IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT 

01:49:52.957 --> 01:49:56.610
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.  IT'S 
ABOUT VIETNAM VETS AND A TON OF 

01:49:56.854 --> 01:50:00.033
VETERANS OUT THERE GOING THROUGH
 CERTAIN THINGS IN THEIR LIVES. 

01:50:02.496 --> 01:50:05.653
AS A COMMUNITY AND AS A NATION 
TO COMBAT THIS.  

01:50:05.654 --> 01:50:08.135
WE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER AND 
EDUCATE OURSELVES.  EVERYBODY 

01:50:08.499 --> 01:50:11.932
NEEDS TO BE EDUCATED IN THIS 
AREA IN VETERANS ISSUES IF WE 

01:50:12.417 --> 01:50:15.396
WANT TO SUCCEED.  
SPEAKER:  TOM?  

01:50:15.397 --> 01:50:18.300
SPEAKER:  I WOULD JUST ECHO WHAT
 TIM SAID.  KEEP UP THE GOOD 

01:50:18.301 --> 01:50:21.233
WORK FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO 
LEARNED SOMETHING TODAY, TAKE IT

01:50:21.586 --> 01:50:26.981
 BACK TO YOUR COMMUNITY AND PUSH
 IT.  AS FAR AS YOU CAN.  

01:50:26.982 --> 01:50:30.009
SPEAKER:  JUDGE?  
SPEAKER:  ONE OF THE MOST 

01:50:30.650 --> 01:50:33.433
IMPORTANT THERAPEUTIC FACTORS 
FOR ANY VETERANS IS SIMPLY 

01:50:33.628 --> 01:50:36.726
TALKING TO ANOTHER VETERAN.  WE 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN 

01:50:36.857 --> 01:50:40.043
PRIOR TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
INVOLVEMENT.  BUT CERTAINLY THE 

01:50:40.425 --> 01:50:43.261
VETERANS TALKING TO VETERANS IS 
ONE OF THE BEST THERAPIES 

01:50:43.479 --> 01:50:45.936
AVAILABLE OUT THERE.  THE 
COMMUNITIES NEED TO GET 

01:50:46.069 --> 01:50:49.463
INVOLVED.  THE COMMUNITIES NEED 
TO GET DEEPER INTO THE VETERANS 

01:50:49.643 --> 01:50:54.988
SYSTEM AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IS 
GOING ON WITH THEM AND DO AS 

01:50:56.140 --> 01:51:00.914
MUCH PRE-EMPTIVE THINGS THEY CAN
 DO.  IT DOESN'T REALLY COST A 

01:51:01.031 --> 01:51:04.248
LOT OF MONEY TO DO IT.  
SPEAKER:  BERNIE?  

01:51:04.249 --> 01:51:06.249
SPEAKER:  NEXT TIME OUR 
GOVERNMENT MAKES A DECISION TO 

01:51:06.395 --> 01:51:12.608
SEND MEN AND WOMEN, MOSTLY 
YOUNG, OFF TO WAR, THEY NEED TO 

01:51:13.145 --> 01:51:20.373
ALSO PLAN FISCALLY FOR WHEN 
THESE FOLKS COME BACK.  SO THAT 

01:51:20.610 --> 01:51:24.705
THERE ARE PROGRAMS FOR THEM.  
THAT DOES NOT GO ON.  ONCE 

01:51:24.828 --> 01:51:30.838
YOU'RE USED UP, TOO OFTEN THE 
MILITARY WANTS TO SAY BYE BYE TO

01:51:31.493 --> 01:51:36.171
 YOU.  AND PEOPLE COME BACK AND 
THEY ARE -- THEY HAVEN'T 

01:51:36.391 --> 01:51:39.838
REACCLIMATED AND THEY ARE 
DRIFTING AND THEY ARE HURTING 

01:51:40.749 --> 01:51:45.401
AND THEN THEY GET -- TOO MANY OF
 THEM GET IN TROUBLE.  WE NEED 

01:51:45.684 --> 01:51:49.810
TO, IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON WAR, 

01:51:50.016 --> 01:51:54.513
SPEND A COUPLE OF BILLION, PUT 
IT AWAY TO BUILD UP YOUR 

01:51:55.046 --> 01:51:58.296
RESOURCES HERE.  WE HAVE TALKED 
ABOUT A LOT OF THE RESOURCES FOR

01:51:58.752 --> 01:52:02.621
 WHEN THE TROOPS COME BACK AND 
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL THAT YOU'RE 

01:52:02.763 --> 01:52:06.864
GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF THEM WHO 
ARE SUFFERING FROM TBI AND PTSD 

01:52:07.648 --> 01:52:11.884
AND ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION.  YOU
 GOT TO HELP THESE GUYS BEING 

01:52:12.124 --> 01:52:14.158
PROACTIVE IN DOING IT.  
SPEAKER:  WELL FIRST OF ALL I 

01:52:14.445 --> 01:52:16.864
WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN JONATHAN
 FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND I ALSO

01:52:17.017 --> 01:52:21.031
 WANT TO POINT OUT, BERNIE, YOU 
TOUCHED ON IT.  VETERANS 

01:52:21.178 --> 01:52:24.205
TYPICALLY WANT TO HELP VETERANS 
AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE 

01:52:24.324 --> 01:52:27.427
PANEL MEMBERS I CALLED, AND 
THERE WASN'T EVEN A HESITATION 

01:52:27.545 --> 01:52:30.960
THAT THEY WANTED TO HELP.  THERE
 WASN'T A HESITATION THAT YOU 

01:52:31.095 --> 01:52:33.497
WANTED TO BE HERE.  I WOULD SAY 
TO YOU IF YOU'RE IN A 

01:52:34.041 --> 01:52:36.291
JURISDICTION SOMEWHERE YOU GOT 
TO FIND A CHAMPION AND DON'T 

01:52:36.494 --> 01:52:40.218
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.  THERE IS
 A LOT OF HELP OUT THERE FOR 

01:52:40.493 --> 01:52:44.091
FOLKS WHO WANT TO IMPLEMENT SOME
 SORT OF VETERANS PLANNING.  

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:46.862
SPEAKER:  I WANT TO THANK THE 
ENTIRE PANEL.  THANK YOU VERY 

01:52:47.064 --> 01:52:49.756
MUCH.  AND ONE FINAL THOUGHT.  
AS YOU HAVE HEARD A LOT OF 

01:52:49.942 --> 01:52:53.714
CONVERSATION ABOUT VETERANS 
TALKING TO VETERANS, I WOULD 

01:52:55.819 --> 01:52:58.594
IMPLORE FOLKS, IF YOU'RE A 
CIVILIAN, AND YOU CARE DEEPLY 

01:52:58.974 --> 01:53:02.143
ABOUT THE SUBJECT, THESE ARE OUR
 WARRIORS THAT WE SEND OFF TO 

01:53:02.368 --> 01:53:04.886
SERVE AND SACRIFICE, IF YOU 
WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP A CENTER 

01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:09.168
LIKE THIS AND FACILITATE IT.  
PLEASE DO.  YOU CAN CALL THE 

01:53:09.375 --> 01:53:10.548
NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE MADE 
AVAILABLE TO YOU.  GO TO THE 

01:53:10.549 --> 01:53:13.659
WEBSITE.  LOOK IT UP.  PUT IT 
TOGETHER YOURSELF.  IT WILL MAKE

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:19.079
 A HUGE DIFFERENCE.  YOU 
ACTUALLY COULD SAVE A LIFE.  

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:25.966
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING 
HERE.  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

01:53:28.589 --> 01:53:31.143
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU, SIR.  
APPRECIATE IT.  

01:53:31.144 --> 01:53:33.788
SPEAKER:  MY PLEASURE.  
SPEAKER:  WE DO HAVE A FEW 

01:53:34.315 --> 01:53:38.003
MINUTES FOR QUESTIONS AND 
ANSWERS, IF PEOPLE WANT TO STAY 

01:53:38.361 --> 01:53:40.496
BEHIND.  WE HAVE GOT ABOUT FIVE 

01:53:43.576 --> 01:53:45.576
MINUTES TO TAKE QUICK 

01:53:48.533 --> 01:53:50.634
QUESTIONS.
SPEAKER:  ALL RIGHT.  

01:53:50.635 --> 01:53:53.573
SPEAKER:  ANDREW, YOU WANT SOME 
Q AND A GOING?  IF ANYBODY HAS 

01:53:53.756 --> 01:53:56.570
QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL, YOU CAN 
STAY FOR A FEW MINUTES AND ASK 

01:53:56.699 --> 01:53:59.142
WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE.  
SPEAKER:  I'M A VIETNAM VETERAN 

01:53:59.258 --> 01:54:04.686
AND I'M A MENTOR AT THE FAIRFAX,
 VIRGINIA VETERANS COURT DOCKET.

01:54:07.605 --> 01:54:13.001
AND THEN ASK THE JUDGE A 
QUESTION.  THE COMMENCE IS OUR 

01:54:13.551 --> 01:54:17.264
PARTICULAR VETERANS COURT WAS 
THE FIRST IN VIRGINIA TO GET 

01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:21.219
STARTED.  ITS BEEN A SLOW 
PROCESS.  WE HAVE GOTTEN A FEW

01:54:25.217 --> 01:54:28.753
 PEOPLE THROUGH TO GRADUATE.  
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS WHETHER 

01:54:28.754 --> 01:54:33.650
WE HAVE ENOUGH INCENTIVES TO 
OFFER TROUBLED VETERANS

01:54:37.115 --> 01:54:40.815
 GOING THROUGH THE PROGRAM.  FOR
 EXAMPLE THERE MAY BE A FEW WITH

01:54:41.185 --> 01:54:43.925
 MULTIPLE DUIS.
AND WHEN THEY ARE PRESENTED WITH

01:54:44.087 --> 01:54:47.387
 THE CHOICE OF WHETHER TO GO 
INTO THE PROGRAM OR WHETHER TO 

01:54:47.388 --> 01:54:53.615
SERVE TIME, THEY DECIDE TO SERVE
 TIME BECAUSE THEIR CHARGES ARE 

01:54:53.616 --> 01:54:57.042
NOT EXPUNGED FROM THE RECORD IN 
THE STATE OF VIRGINIA.  AND 

01:54:57.269 --> 01:55:00.759
THAT, I UNDERSTAND AND SOME OF 
THE VETERANS COURT DOCKETS IN 

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:05.597
THE COUNTRY, EXPUNGEMENT IS A 
POSSIBILITY.  AND IS AN 

01:55:05.711 --> 01:55:10.319
INCENTIVE TO GET TROUBLED 
VETERANS THROUGH THE PROGRAM.  

01:55:10.526 --> 01:55:16.084
THE SECOND ISSUE THAT I WOULD 
LIKE TO HEAR YOU ADDRESS, BEING 

01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:21.600
THE FIRST VETERANS COURT DOCKET 
IN VIRGINIA, WE HAVE GONE TO 

01:55:21.718 --> 01:55:25.380
RICHMOND TO LOBBY POLITICALLY TO
 EXPAND THE VETERANS COURT 

01:55:25.381 --> 01:55:29.463
DOCKET PROGRAM IN THE STATE.  
AND WE RUN INTO PROBLEMS 

01:55:29.464 --> 01:55:32.893
POLITICALLY WITH SOME OF THE 
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, MANY OF THEM

01:55:33.765 --> 01:55:38.874
 CONSERVATIVE.  WHO DON'T SEE 
THE VALUE OF THE VETERANS COURT 

01:55:39.019 --> 01:55:44.554
DOCKET PROGRAMS.  THEY THINK, 
WHY GIVE VETERANS SPECIAL 

01:55:44.742 --> 01:55:47.640
TREATMENT COMPARED TO THE REST 
OF THE POPULATION.  AND IT'S A 

01:55:47.781 --> 01:55:51.149
MAJOR PROBLEM.  WE WOULD LOVE TO
 SEE THIS PROGRAM EXPAND 

01:55:51.275 --> 01:55:54.855
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.  HOW DO 
YOU DEAL WITH THAT?  HOW CAN WE 

01:55:55.029 --> 01:55:59.304
CHANGE SOME OF THE POLITICAL 
ATTITUDES IN THE STATE CAPITOLS?

01:55:59.496 --> 01:56:02.410
SPEAKER:  I KEEP RUNNING INTO 
THAT ON A DAILY BASIS.  IT'S 

01:56:03.619 --> 01:56:06.240
VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GO AND 
ASK FOR ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING. 

01:56:06.656 --> 01:56:08.971
WE FUND MOST OF OUR STUFF 
LOCALLY.  

01:56:08.972 --> 01:56:12.918
BUT THE QUESTION, WHY VETERANS 
COURTS?  I HAD, ODDLY ENOUGH, A 

01:56:13.604 --> 01:56:17.531
PUBLIC DEFENDER COME UP TO SEE 
AND SAY WHY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE 

01:56:18.225 --> 01:56:21.930
A VETERANS COURT?  THE NEXT 
THING YOU WILL HAVE A SPECIAL 

01:56:22.069 --> 01:56:24.994
COURT FOR POLICE AND SPECIAL 
COURT FOR FIREMEN AND WE ALREADY

01:56:26.211 --> 01:56:30.502
 HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH COURT AND 
A DRUG COURT.  WHY DO THIS?  

01:56:32.276 --> 01:56:35.473
VETERANS DON'T NECESSARILY FIT 
INTO THOSE SYSTEMS.  AND ONE OF 

01:56:35.681 --> 01:56:40.320
MY EXAMPLES THAT I JUST USED WAS
 OKAY.  IN NO OTHER JOB IN THE 

01:56:40.944 --> 01:56:44.456
WORLD WILL YOU HAVE A 
21-YEAR-OLD SERGEANT.  THERE IS 

01:56:44.676 --> 01:56:48.177
GUN FIRE OVER THERE, CHECK IT 
OUT.  THERE IS NO OTHER JOB.  

01:56:48.392 --> 01:56:51.400
AND AFTER YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED 
THAT.  AND AFTER YOU HAVE GONE 

01:56:51.529 --> 01:56:54.405
THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS YOU 
WILL NEVER COME BACK AND BE A 

01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:58.707
CIVILIAN AGAIN.  YOU WILL ALWAYS
 BE A VETERAN.  YOU MIGHT HAVE A

01:56:58.825 --> 01:57:05.485
 DRUG PROBLEM AND MIGHT HAVE A 
MENTAL HEALTH HOW AND HAVE TBI 

01:57:06.189 --> 01:57:11.833
OR PTSD, THAT COURT WILL MAKE 
THEM SUCCESSFUL.  RATES MOST 

01:57:12.272 --> 01:57:20.823
VETERANS COURTS 11%.  THESE 
COURTS ARE SUCCESSFUL.  THESE  

01:57:21.876 --> 01:57:25.373
MENTEES AND VETERANS DON'T COME 
BACK AFTER THE PROGRAM.  IT'S A 

01:57:25.767 --> 01:57:29.502
HARD PUSH WHEN YOU ARE DEALING 
WITH THE GUYS THAT HOLD THE 

01:57:29.634 --> 01:57:32.821
MONEY.  THEY HAVE TO BE 
CONVINCED.  BUT IF YOU CAN DO IT

01:57:33.134 --> 01:57:37.899
 WITHOUT THAT MONEY.  IF YOU 
START OUT ON YOUR OWN, YOU CAN 

01:57:38.559 --> 01:57:41.583
MAKE THEM EAT THEIR WORDS. 
SPEAKER:  AND I GOT TO 

01:57:41.723 --> 01:57:45.720
REITERATE, YOU HAVE GOT TO WORK 
OUT YOUR NUMBERS AND FIND OUT 

01:57:47.229 --> 01:57:49.455
HOW MANY VETERANS ARE IN YOUR 
STATE.  

01:57:49.456 --> 01:57:51.456
SPEAKER:  WE HAVE HAD 
SITUATIONS, ONE IN PARTICULAR, 

01:57:51.557 --> 01:57:54.301
THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF 
VETERANS TREATMENT COURTS THAT 

01:57:54.447 --> 01:57:58.410
HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN SEVERAL
 COUNTIES IN ARIZONA AND THERE
