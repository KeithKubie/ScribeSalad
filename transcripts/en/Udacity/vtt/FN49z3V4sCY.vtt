00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.520
In the last lecture I showed you this traditional old camera from 1950s.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.582
An important part of this camera is still that it has these lenses that

00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:11.920
are used to focus the rays of light into the sensor chamber.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.510
This is a more recent digital SLR, this is the camera used these days.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.709
And of course, it also has a lens.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.010
And one of the things that we will talk about in this lesson is what kinds of

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.860
things that a lens like this does.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.050
And of course, it has things like focal length, variety of things of

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.220
this lens actually then control the view that we actually get from the image or

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.000
from the scene that actually is represented on the image.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.410
And we also talk about things like what sensor sizes these types of

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.300
cameras have.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.590
Varieties from digital SLRs to full frame ones

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.210
to simple cellphone cameras that we use.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.390
We'll also talk about how images are formed and

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.370
also things like perspective projections.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.480
The simple mathematical representations will be introduced to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.710
show you how we can actually go from information in a real 3D world

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.470
to what's actually seen inside a camera.
