00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.589
Gee, nest egg!

00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:04.402
My goodness.

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:05.993
Thank God.

00:00:05.993 --> 00:00:08.348
It was only a dream,
it was only a dream.

00:00:08.348 --> 00:00:10.194
A dream of the future.

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:18.345
Make sure to keep data denormalized.

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:28.747
What will happen to ShoppingList++
with denormalized data?

00:00:28.747 --> 00:00:31.708
What will happen to ShoppingList++
with denormalized data?

00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:34.529
What will happen to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:37.604
[MUSIC]

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:42.380
Walter, do you have any idea when
they're going to turn the heat back on?

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.920
I'm just not sure how else
we're going to brave this harsh

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.230
San Francisco summer.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.820
&gt;&gt; No heat if we can't pay the bills.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.750
I guess we'll have to keep
burning these ShoppingList++

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.080
promotional posters for warmth.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.480
Man, I really wish that we
could call JP right now.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.860
&gt;&gt; Did someone say my name?

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.490
&gt;&gt; My gosh.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.080
JP, where do you come from?

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.060
&gt;&gt; Well,
I've been living in your crawl space.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.350
Like Walter, I invested everything
in ShoppingList++ during its heyday.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.970
Although you had that pesky
technical issue about many-to-many

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.810
relationships and
didn't have any users yet,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.135
I was sure it was going to be
a viable product, so here I am.

00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:18.950
&gt;&gt; Hey,
since we've got nothing better to do,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.070
why don't you tell us a little bit
more about that technical issue?

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.709
You can use the last of my worldly
possessions to help, my tablet.
