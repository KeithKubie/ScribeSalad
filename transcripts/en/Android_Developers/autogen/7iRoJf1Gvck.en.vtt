tablet then we would recommend putting

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220
tablet then we would recommend putting
 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.440
tablet then we would recommend putting
two things side by side so you have your

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
two things side by side so you have your
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.969
two things side by side so you have your
detail in your list on the same place

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
detail in your list on the same place
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.550
detail in your list on the same place
and then you run that same app on a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
and then you run that same app on a
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.740
and then you run that same app on a
smaller device like a phone you should

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750

in one fragment in the detail in another

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
in one fragment in the detail in another
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.100

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.290
okay it's not google okay yeah maybe
that's a stupid question but maybe an

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:09.300
that's a stupid question but maybe an
 

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.970
that's a stupid question but maybe an
obvious one like why isn't x 86 the

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980
obvious one like why isn't x 86 the
 

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.480
obvious one like why isn't x 86 the
primary target for emulator images

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:17.490
primary target for emulator images
 

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.360
primary target for emulator images
because that's where developers are

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:20.370
because that's where developers are
 

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.810
because that's where developers are
anyway right I guess well the answer is

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:23.820
anyway right I guess well the answer is
 

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.370
anyway right I guess well the answer is
in the title regulator that you were

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380
in the title regulator that you were
 

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.660
in the title regulator that you were
really we were really trying to emulate

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:26.670
really we were really trying to emulate
 

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.520
really we were really trying to emulate
the devices it was actually running on

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:28.530
the devices it was actually running on
 

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.070
the devices it was actually running on
so I think you know the arm-based api's

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080
so I think you know the arm-based api's
 

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.220
so I think you know the arm-based api's
were the vast vast majority devices out

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:34.230
were the vast vast majority devices out
 

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.810
were the vast vast majority devices out
there so we will try I think I was our

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820
there so we will try I think I was our
 

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.000
there so we will try I think I was our
primary focus to you know provide a

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.010
primary focus to you know provide a
 

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.110
primary focus to you know provide a
platform where people can develop

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120
platform where people can develop
 

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.790
platform where people can develop
against what it's going to run all the

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:40.800
against what it's going to run all the
 

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.770
against what it's going to run all the
phones I think that's you know

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780
phones I think that's you know
 

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.780
phones I think that's you know
historically where we came from I don't

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:44.790
historically where we came from I don't
 

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.220
historically where we came from I don't
know if that's going to change in the

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:46.230
know if that's going to change in the
 

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.680
know if that's going to change in the
future or what but I think that's where

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:48.690
future or what but I think that's where
 

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.490
future or what but I think that's where
we are yeah yeah yeah I kind of see the

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:52.500
we are yeah yeah yeah I kind of see the
 

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.340
we are yeah yeah yeah I kind of see the
point it's just a farm for front-end

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:55.350
point it's just a farm for front-end
 

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.930
point it's just a farm for front-end
development most of the time you don't

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940
development most of the time you don't
 

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.000
development most of the time you don't
you don't really care about the

00:22:59.000 --> 00:22:59.010
you don't really care about the
 

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.670
you don't really care about the
d'architecture you just care about

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:00.680
d'architecture you just care about
 

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.860
d'architecture you just care about
seeing how the app feels even very

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:03.870
seeing how the app feels even very
 

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:10.040
seeing how the app feels even very
quickly and having a very quick is so

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:10.050
quickly and having a very quick is so
 

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:13.280
quickly and having a very quick is so
nice like when you get the emulator with

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:13.290
nice like when you get the emulator with
 

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:17.060
nice like when you get the emulator with
an 8 x86 image it's just makes a big

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:17.070
an 8 x86 image it's just makes a big
 

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.980
an 8 x86 image it's just makes a big
difference yeah well maybe that's just

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:18.990
difference yeah well maybe that's just
 

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:23.570
difference yeah well maybe that's just
the editor video point Joe vez and in

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580
the editor video point Joe vez and in
 

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.500
the editor video point Joe vez and in
face building tools in Eclipse yeah I

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:27.510
face building tools in Eclipse yeah I
 

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.770
face building tools in Eclipse yeah I
use it yeah it helps but like for things

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780
use it yeah it helps but like for things
 

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.870
use it yeah it helps but like for things
like animations and stuff I I mean

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880
like animations and stuff I I mean
 

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.550
like animations and stuff I I mean
there's a lot of like back and forth

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:34.560
there's a lot of like back and forth
 

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.430
there's a lot of like back and forth
just to see like tweaking different

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440
just to see like tweaking different
 

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.680
just to see like tweaking different
properties to see how it feels yeah and

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:39.690
properties to see how it feels yeah and
 

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.870
properties to see how it feels yeah and
for animations I mean if you if we had a

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880
for animations I mean if you if we had a
 

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.769
for animations I mean if you if we had a
like a quick way to like preview

00:23:45.769 --> 00:23:45.779
like a quick way to like preview
 

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:48.200
like a quick way to like preview
animation that would be nice but so like

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:48.210
animation that would be nice but so like
 

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:49.700
animation that would be nice but so like
for now we just have to run the

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:49.710
for now we just have to run the
 

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:53.060
for now we just have to run the
application and yet go so simple detents

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.070
application and yet go so simple detents
 

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.709
application and yet go so simple detents
do tend to develop on device instead

00:23:54.709 --> 00:23:54.719
do tend to develop on device instead
 

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:57.680
do tend to develop on device instead
yeah for nexus 7 it was interesting

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:57.690
yeah for nexus 7 it was interesting
 

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.989
yeah for nexus 7 it was interesting
because i didn't have any device while

00:23:59.989 --> 00:23:59.999
because i didn't have any device while
 

00:23:59.999 --> 00:24:03.529
because i didn't have any device while
writing the app so i released the tablet

00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539
writing the app so i released the tablet
 

00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:05.779
writing the app so i released the tablet
version the tablet UI for pattern before

00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:05.789
version the tablet UI for pattern before
 

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:08.539
version the tablet UI for pattern before
having the device and I was a bit scared

00:24:08.539 --> 00:24:08.549
having the device and I was a bit scared
 

00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:11.139
having the device and I was a bit scared
scared of like what could happen because

00:24:11.139 --> 00:24:11.149
scared of like what could happen because
 

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:15.700
scared of like what could happen because
things like I was using the didn't you

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:15.710
things like I was using the didn't you
 

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.709
things like I was using the didn't you
so bad on the emulator I couldn't really

00:24:18.709 --> 00:24:18.719
so bad on the emulator I couldn't really
 

00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:21.109
so bad on the emulator I couldn't really
see how it worked so it was a kind of

00:24:21.109 --> 00:24:21.119
see how it worked so it was a kind of
 

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:24.619
see how it worked so it was a kind of
really a big guess like that it would

00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:24.629
really a big guess like that it would
 

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:26.930
really a big guess like that it would
work well but I wasn't sure so I was

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940
work well but I wasn't sure so I was
 

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.759
work well but I wasn't sure so I was
happy that it turned out to be pretty

00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:28.769
happy that it turned out to be pretty
 

00:24:28.769 --> 00:24:33.049
happy that it turned out to be pretty
good but yeah each other so what tricks

00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059
good but yeah each other so what tricks
 

00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:35.810
good but yeah each other so what tricks
you got a trickster for optimizing to

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:35.820
you got a trickster for optimizing to
 

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.259
you got a trickster for optimizing to
the servants you're using what the

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:38.269
the servants you're using what the
 

00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:42.349
the servants you're using what the
esterday 600d p yeah yeah yeah

00:24:42.349 --> 00:24:42.359
esterday 600d p yeah yeah yeah
 

00:24:42.359 --> 00:24:44.690
esterday 600d p yeah yeah yeah
design-wise i think the interesting

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:44.700
design-wise i think the interesting
 

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.339
design-wise i think the interesting
thing about 7-inch tablets is it on i

00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:49.349
thing about 7-inch tablets is it on i
 

00:24:49.349 --> 00:24:52.009
thing about 7-inch tablets is it on i
think it's a type of form factor that is

00:24:52.009 --> 00:24:52.019
think it's a type of form factor that is
 

00:24:52.019 --> 00:24:54.739
think it's a type of form factor that is
unique in the sense that in portrait and

00:24:54.739 --> 00:24:54.749
unique in the sense that in portrait and
 

00:24:54.749 --> 00:24:57.649
unique in the sense that in portrait and
landscape it behaves very differently

00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659
landscape it behaves very differently
 

00:24:57.659 --> 00:24:59.509
landscape it behaves very differently
it's different than tablets that you

00:24:59.509 --> 00:24:59.519
it's different than tablets that you
 

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:01.690
it's different than tablets that you
have a lot of space on both orientations

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:01.700
have a lot of space on both orientations
 

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.839
have a lot of space on both orientations
but on on 7-inch tablets on portrait

00:25:05.839 --> 00:25:05.849
but on on 7-inch tablets on portrait
 

00:25:05.849 --> 00:25:08.419
but on on 7-inch tablets on portrait
mode it's almost like a phone but not

00:25:08.419 --> 00:25:08.429
mode it's almost like a phone but not
 

00:25:08.429 --> 00:25:11.509
mode it's almost like a phone but not
really and in landscape mode it's more

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:11.519
really and in landscape mode it's more
 

00:25:11.519 --> 00:25:15.019
really and in landscape mode it's more
like a tablet but smaller so it's a kind

00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:15.029
like a tablet but smaller so it's a kind
 

00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:17.269
like a tablet but smaller so it's a kind
of a very big it's a kind of a gray area

00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279
of a very big it's a kind of a gray area
 

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:21.039
of a very big it's a kind of a gray area
type of device so it's an interesting

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:21.049
type of device so it's an interesting
 

00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:24.799
type of device so it's an interesting
exercise in terms of design so what I

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:24.809
exercise in terms of design so what I
 

00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:26.899
exercise in terms of design so what I
did with pattern was pretty much

00:25:26.899 --> 00:25:26.909
did with pattern was pretty much
 

00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:30.609
did with pattern was pretty much
blending the design of the tablet and

00:25:30.609 --> 00:25:30.619
blending the design of the tablet and
 

00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:34.099
blending the design of the tablet and
phones on portrait mode so you have a

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:34.109
phones on portrait mode so you have a
 

00:25:34.109 --> 00:25:37.849
phones on portrait mode so you have a
one-column thing but you have the

00:25:37.849 --> 00:25:37.859
one-column thing but you have the
 

00:25:37.859 --> 00:25:42.289
one-column thing but you have the
sidebar yeah but on landscape you have a

00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299
sidebar yeah but on landscape you have a
 

00:25:42.299 --> 00:25:45.049
sidebar yeah but on landscape you have a
more tablet like thing with a grid and

00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:45.059
more tablet like thing with a grid and
 

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:47.389
more tablet like thing with a grid and
the sidebar while on phones you only

00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399
the sidebar while on phones you only
 

00:25:47.399 --> 00:25:50.930
the sidebar while on phones you only
have one column and that's it and then i

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940
have one column and that's it and then i
 

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.049
have one column and that's it and then i
use the sliding tabs to to give access

00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059
use the sliding tabs to to give access
 

00:25:54.059 --> 00:25:57.889
use the sliding tabs to to give access
to different types of content we're like

00:25:57.889 --> 00:25:57.899
to different types of content we're like
 

00:25:57.899 --> 00:25:59.180
to different types of content we're like
sidebars and work

00:25:59.180 --> 00:25:59.190
sidebars and work
 

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.360
sidebars and work
don't work well on phones anyway sir

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:01.370
don't work well on phones anyway sir
 

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.310
don't work well on phones anyway sir
yeah exactly this isn't in a hard place

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320
yeah exactly this isn't in a hard place
 

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.120
yeah exactly this isn't in a hard place
yeah and and also i mean i'm not i'm not

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:08.130
yeah and and also i mean i'm not i'm not
 

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:12.020
yeah and and also i mean i'm not i'm not
really keen on the howdy college flight

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:12.030
really keen on the howdy college flight
 

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:16.370
really keen on the howdy college flight
fly out menu think we could the trails

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:16.380
fly out menu think we could the trails
 

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.790
fly out menu think we could the trails
where I infrared flying in menu or

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:19.800
where I infrared flying in menu or
 

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:24.950
where I infrared flying in menu or

bit more to get it right because there's
 

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.920
bit more to get it right because there's
a lot of implementations right now right

a lot of implementations right now right
 

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:31.010
a lot of implementations right now right
I'm going to recommend it to how many to

consolidating itself yeah but it
 

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:56.180
consolidating itself yeah but it
shouldn't take too long because i think

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:56.190

okay yeah I see the book in I great with
 

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:39.140
okay yeah I see the book in I great with
the tag and my conclusion is that the

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:39.150
the tag and my conclusion is that the
 

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:42.680
the tag and my conclusion is that the
stack just doesn't allow so yeah

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:42.690
stack just doesn't allow so yeah
 

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.360
stack just doesn't allow so yeah

we see as it's the most common use case

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:55.470
we see as it's the most common use case
 

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:57.380
we see as it's the most common use case
in this useful use case but you still

00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:57.390
in this useful use case but you still
 

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:58.880
in this useful use case but you still
can do all the tech stuff like you still

00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:58.890
can do all the tech stuff like you still
 

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.790
can do all the tech stuff like you still
can read the raw bytes and so on I guess

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800
can read the raw bytes and so on I guess
 

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.960
can read the raw bytes and so on I guess
definitely supported use case well like

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:05.970
definitely supported use case well like
 

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:08.870
definitely supported use case well like
