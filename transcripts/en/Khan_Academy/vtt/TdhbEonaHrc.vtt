00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.524
- [Voiceover] So what we have
right over here, we have the

00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:06.482
vector U and we've defined it
by giving its X &amp; Y components

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:10.522
it's a two-dimensional vector,
and we have the vector W.

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:12.665
And we've graphed them, the vector U,

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:16.565
its X component is two, its
Y component is negative one.

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:19.839
So if we put its initial point
at the origin, the terminal

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:24.285
point, or its head, will
be at the point two, comma,

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.764
negative one, which is right over there.

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:29.980
And for vector W, it's
negative five, comma, five.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.033
So its X component is negative five.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.121
So if we start at the origin
we would move five to the left.

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.501
And its Y component is
positive five, so we

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:42.436
would move five up then to
get to the head of the vector,

00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:45.037
or to get to the terminal point.

00:00:45.037 --> 00:00:48.241
Now given these two vectors,
what we wanna do is evaluate

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:52.420
what three times the
vector U, plus one fifth

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.974
times the vector W is, and I encourage you

00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:57.911
to pause the video and to give a go at it.

00:00:57.911 --> 00:01:00.070
Well three and one fifth are scalers.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.079
They are going to scale these
vectors and we're gonna see

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.493
them, see that happen visually.

00:01:04.493 --> 00:01:07.373
So we're gonna scale up
vector U by three, we're gonna

00:01:07.373 --> 00:01:11.215
scale down vector W, we're
gonna multiply it by one fifth,

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:13.595
and then we're gonna add
the resulting vectors.

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:14.814
So let's do that.

00:01:14.814 --> 00:01:18.413
So when we scale vector U by
three, we could just do this

00:01:18.413 --> 00:01:23.119
as three times vector U, we
know is a vector two, comma,

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.006
negative one, and so that's
going to be, we could write it

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:30.936
this way, so let me write
the two, let me write

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:35.914
the negative one, that's
going to be three times two,

00:01:37.554 --> 00:01:39.853
for the new X component
once we scale it up.

00:01:39.853 --> 00:01:44.797
And three times negative
one for the new Y component,

00:01:44.797 --> 00:01:48.388
and of course that's going
to be, result in the vector

00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:51.766
three times two, our new X
component is six, and our new

00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:55.969
Y component is going to be negative three.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.155
And so let's plot that.

00:01:57.155 --> 00:01:59.080
So everything I've done just now

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.586
is that part of the expression,
that part of the expression.

00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:04.548
So the vector six, comma, negative three,

00:02:04.548 --> 00:02:08.971
if we start it at the origin,
we're going to move, let's see

00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:13.948
we're going to move one,
two, three, four, five, six

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.717
in the X direction and negative
three in the Y direction.

00:02:19.717 --> 00:02:23.754
So one, two, three,

00:02:23.754 --> 00:02:26.903
one, two, three,

00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:31.398
so we would get right about there.

00:02:31.398 --> 00:02:35.414
So there you have it, this
is the vector three U.

00:02:35.414 --> 00:02:38.479
And we're at one, two,
three, four, five, six

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:41.335
in the X direction, or six to the right,

00:02:41.335 --> 00:02:45.038
and then we went down
three, one, two, three,

00:02:45.038 --> 00:02:48.393
in the Y direction, and
notice, it's in the exact same

00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:52.572
direction as vector U, it just
has three times the magnitude

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:56.136
that's vector U, that would be two U.

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:59.793
And then we get to three U,
three times the magnitude.

00:02:59.793 --> 00:03:03.694
Alright, now let's figure out
what one fifth times W is.

00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:07.072
Let's see one fifth times W,
well let me just write this,

00:03:07.072 --> 00:03:11.992
it's gonna be plus one fifth,
W is the vector, is the vector

00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:17.626
negative five, comma, five,
and so this is gonna be plus,

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.362
so that's gonna be, let me
write the components down.

00:03:23.362 --> 00:03:28.282
So it's gonna be plus one fifth, times,

00:03:28.282 --> 00:03:31.478
one fifth times negative five,

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:35.194
and the Y component is gonna
be one fifth times five,

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:38.305
and so that's gonna be plus,
whoops I wrote one half,

00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:40.592
my brains not working properly,

00:03:40.592 --> 00:03:45.572
one fifth times negative five,
and one fifth times five.

00:03:45.572 --> 00:03:50.007
And so, this part right over
here is going to be one fifth

00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:53.792
times negative five, is negative one,

00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:56.880
and one fifth times five is positive one.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.573
And so this new vector, one fifth W,

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:02.080
is gonna be W scaled down.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.147
And so it's negative one,
comma, one if we start it

00:04:04.147 --> 00:04:07.258
at the origin, so
negative one, comma, one.

00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:09.429
We'd get right over there, and notice,

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.004
it's going in the same direction as W,

00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:15.255
it's just one fifth, it's
just one fifth as long.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.902
And now we just wanna
add these two vectors.

00:04:17.902 --> 00:04:20.119
So if we add them by just
looking at its components,

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:23.695
the resulting vector,
the resulting vector,

00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:27.537
let me do this in a new color
that I have not used yet,

00:04:27.537 --> 00:04:31.182
so the resulting vector, we're
gonna add the corresponding

00:04:31.182 --> 00:04:33.501
X components, so it's going to be

00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:37.738
six plus negative one,

00:04:37.738 --> 00:04:41.836
six plus negative one, and
the resulting Y component

00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:46.619
is going to be negative three plus one.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:51.158
Negative three plus one.

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:55.844
And so the resulting vector
is going to be equal to

00:04:55.844 --> 00:05:00.793
five, comma, negative two.

00:05:00.793 --> 00:05:03.141
And we can also see that visually.

00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:06.322
If we start with this blue
vector, three times the vector U,

00:05:06.322 --> 00:05:10.257
and we were to add the
green vector, one fifth W,

00:05:10.257 --> 00:05:14.204
well we were to add that we
would just start at the head of

00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:18.256
three U, then we're gonna
add negative one, comma, one,

00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:20.856
so we're gonna move one
to the left and one up,

00:05:20.856 --> 00:05:22.934
we're gonna get right over there.

00:05:22.934 --> 00:05:25.527
So let me see if I can draw that.

00:05:25.527 --> 00:05:27.675
So, just gonna do a
little head to tail method

00:05:27.675 --> 00:05:30.194
right over here, so the
head of the first vector

00:05:30.194 --> 00:05:31.390
is gonna be where the tail of the

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.134
next vector starts, that we're adding.

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:36.698
And so the resulting vector
is going to be, if we started

00:05:36.698 --> 00:05:41.539
at the tail of the first
vector, three U right over here,

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.288
or at the origin, and then
we bring it to the head of

00:05:45.288 --> 00:05:48.748
the second vector, we get, once again,

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:52.451
the vector five, comma, negative two.

00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:54.866
Its X component is five, we're
gonna move five to the right,

00:05:54.866 --> 00:05:58.075
and we move two down.
