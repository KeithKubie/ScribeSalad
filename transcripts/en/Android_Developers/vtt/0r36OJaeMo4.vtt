[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:10.510
RUSSELL IVANOVIC: We had
this point we thought,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.204
if we don't make
the jump now, when

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:14.370
are you going to have another
opportunity like this?

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.220
So, yeah, we decided to
start our own company.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.780
I'm Russell.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.290
I work at Shifty Jelly,
and I'm a co-founder here.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.149
But, more importantly than
that, I'm one of our developers.

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:26.440
PHILIP SIMPSON: Hi, I'm Philip.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.560
I work at Shifty Jelly.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.104
I'm a co-founder, but
also an Android developer.

00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:32.729
RUSSELL IVANOVIC: We decided we
wanted to get into mobile apps.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.080
So we'd see each other
every day at work,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.390
and then we'd to go home
on the couch, sit back,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.420
and we start coding.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.365
PHILIP SIMPSON: And we
did that for two years.

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:42.823
It's been worth it, the fact
that we can actually go create

00:00:42.823 --> 00:00:44.105
our own company off of it.

00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:45.480
RUSSELL IVANOVIC:
Shifty Jelly is

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.356
an Adelaide-based mobile
development company.

00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:48.855
PHILIP SIMPSON: And
we've grown now.

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.415
So we've got our
designer, Chris.

00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:53.097
We've got Monica, who
helps us with support.

00:00:53.097 --> 00:00:54.680
We've just taken on
another developer.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.274
So the team's
growing and growing.

00:00:56.274 --> 00:00:58.440
RUSSELL IVANOVIC: We've
always wanted to create apps

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.648
that we want to use our self.

00:00:59.648 --> 00:01:01.815
We really got into
podcasts in a big way,

00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:03.530
and there was no
good apps for it.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.519
And we thought, what's
the first brand new app

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.602
we can bring out now that
we're working full time?

00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:09.380
And that's where
Pocket Casts started.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.120
PHILIP SIMPSON: I
just really wanted

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.210
to sell one bit of
software to someone.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.000
But now we're number
one in the chart

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.274
and people are actually
using it around the country.

00:01:20.274 --> 00:01:22.440
RUSSELL IVANOVIC: One thing
that was really exciting

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.715
that happened recently is
we actually cast $1 million

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:26.110
worth of Pocket Casts hours.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.690
And that's a really
big milestone.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.600
To put out just one
application on one platform?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.150
And there's half a million
people using it now.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.780
We're always looking for new
features to give our customers.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.940
They're always
saying, what's new?

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.440
What's new?

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.165
And, with the pace
that Android moves at,

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:41.040
we're always able to
give them something new.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.039
PHILIP SIMPSON: So we've
added the Wear support,

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.157
we've added Chromecast support,
Android Auto, and one of them

00:01:46.157 --> 00:01:46.990
was material design.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.365
And we think it's
really paid off

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:49.790
and made our app much better.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.290
RUSSELL IVANOVIC:
We found that when

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.230
we switched to material design,
when we updated our app, when

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.410
we embraced all these new things
that Google was giving us,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.550
we found our sales actually
see increased by 30%.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.400
And the reception
we had was amazing.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.390
People love it.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.840
They see this brand
new design of an app

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.499
they're familiar with, but
just a different take on it.

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:11.790
PHILIP SIMPSON: We recently
implemented media sessions.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.160
It allowed our users to have a
consistent playback experience

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.080
across all their
different devices.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.399
And it made our life, as
developers, much easier.

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:22.440
RUSSELL IVANOVIC: One of
the most exciting things

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.290
we got to work on was the
Android Auto platform.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.935
So you plug your phone in
and, bang, play your podcasts.

00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:30.820
It's just really cool.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.700
And there's a really
nice forum around that.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.430
So you can just jump on the
forum and within five minutes,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.140
someone's on there saying,
have you tried this?

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.973
Have you tried that?

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:38.870
And we found that
really different

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.422
to any other platform.

00:02:40.422 --> 00:02:42.880
It seems like, in the Android
space, you do something good,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.520
you put it out to the world,
and they make it even better.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.228
PHILIP SIMPSON: Google's
always improving

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:48.990
their software, their
APIs, so that really

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.182
helps us out as well.

00:02:50.182 --> 00:02:51.640
And it makes our
life a lot easier.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.507
Just this new technology
coming out all time

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:54.590
is really exciting for me.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.335
So I can't wait to
see what Google's

00:02:56.335 --> 00:02:58.300
going to bring out next.
