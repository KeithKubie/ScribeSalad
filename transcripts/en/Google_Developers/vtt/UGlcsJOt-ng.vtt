CLAY BAVOR: Good morning.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.810
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.940
It's great to see so
many people fired up

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.170
about VR here at 9:00 AM.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.640
Thanks for being here, yeah.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.230
I'm Clay Bavor, I lead
the VR team at Google.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.310
I'm also pretty
fired up about VR.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.930
Pro tip for the
people in the back,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.390
I saw some pretty intense
tans, sunburns yesterday.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.370
The sun comes in
this way, so people

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.070
on the border right
there, you might

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.220
want to come down unless
you want a great tan.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.240
So hopefully caught the keynote
yesterday about Daydream,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.880
and that's what today is about.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.200
We're going to go a lot deeper
on all of the components of it.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.630
But before we do that, I wanted
to talk just briefly about VR

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.430
and why it's important to us.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.415
And if I can just do a quick
poll, how many people have been

00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:58.480
in a VR system where you've
had that moment of like,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.610
oh my god I'm there,
I'm somewhere else.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.290
I love this.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.629
This is like the highest
ratio of any talk I've given,

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.750
so that's great.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.540
So you know what
this is about, you

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.840
know what I'm talking about.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.170
Now for people who haven't,
for folks on the Livestream,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.900
there's no substitute
for actually

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.380
being in one of these demo
rooms, in one of these systems.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.250
But I want to walk you
through an experience

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.940
that we share with
a lot of people

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.140
who are seeing VR for the
first time in one of our labs.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.260
And it starts here,
poolside And it's

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.090
kind of this abstract
pool, there's

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.560
like a white grid
for the ground.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560
And you look around, and
you look to your right,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.760
and there is a diving board.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.560
And then you look up and
there's another diving board.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.950
And you know where
this is going.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.730
So that diving board is 150
feet tall, 50 meters or so.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.270
And we teleport you up
there, and what happens

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.910
next is pretty interesting.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.640
People immediately lower
their center of gravity,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.460
they crouch down.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.625
Some reach for a hand railing
that's not actually there.

00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:59.140
And we ask people
to walk to the edge,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.503
and look over, and step off.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.979
And it looks really
scary even from here.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.009
I'm imagining from
there it looks scarier.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.287
And most people can't step
off, they can't do it.

00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:16.620
Even I have a hard time,
knowing that I'm just in, like,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.210
a room in Mountain View.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.090
And so what's happening here?

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.890
Now for those of you
who are deep into VR,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.470
you know what this is
about, it's presence.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.510
And presence is the VR
jargon for that feeling

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.380
that you're really
somewhere else.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.440
And it happens when all
of your different senses--

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.790
sight, sound, how
you're moving your body,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.680
proprioception, your vestibular
system, all line up and agree.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.900
And your brain just
says, yep, I'm there.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.490
And it's how VR can make you
feel like you're experiencing

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.700
something directly.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.510
And that's pretty
important to us at Google.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.370
That's because we've always
cared about information,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.630
organizing it, making it
useful and accessible.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.430
But people think of information
as, like, numbers and words,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.940
sentences, and so on.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.410
But experience, in many
cases, is the most direct form

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.404
of information.

00:03:03.404 --> 00:03:04.820
And if you think
about it, there's

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.360
a world of difference
between reading some words

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.150
and sentences, a
book about Paris,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.310
and then actually
visiting Paris,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.110
and walking the
streets yourself,

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.430
and actually being there.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.770
And so we think that
VR has the potential

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.160
to connect people with
this kind of information,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.060
experiential information,
in a pretty profound way.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.440
We just think VR is amazing.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.860
We want to bring it to the
world and make it for everyone.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.640
And our next step
in that is Daydream,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.560
and we talked about
Daydream yesterday.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.380
If you didn't catch
the session yesterday,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.220
I just wanted to roll a quick
video which we shared yesterday

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.690
really highlighting most of
all the Daydream controller,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.600
but it'll give you a flavor for
how this all comes together.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.334
Can we roll the video?

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:52.322
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:52.322 --> 00:04:04.250
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:41.525 --> 00:04:43.580
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.010
For some reason
yesterday, people

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.594
were especially excited about
flipping pancakes in VR.

00:04:48.594 --> 00:04:50.260
So yeah, that's one
of the things you'll

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.740
be able to do in Daydream.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.777
So daydream has
three parts to it.

00:04:54.777 --> 00:04:56.860
And we're going to go into
a number of these today

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.150
in a lot more detail.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.630
First, our VR
optimized smartphones,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.690
what we call Daydream
ready smartphones that

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.170
have very high
specifications, and displays,

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.400
and sensors, and the
SOC, the processor in it.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.080
And also VR optimizations, which
we've made as part of Android N

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.649
at really all
levels of the stack.

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:16.190
The second part is
a reference design

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.390
for headsets and controllers,
a really comfortable VR

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.280
viewer, and a powerful
but expressive controller.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.100
And then finally, apps,
including Google Play,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.390
to make it really easy for
users to discover, buy, find,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.270
and install VR apps.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.160
So to get us started going
one level deeper on this,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.080
I'd like to turn it
over to Nathan Martz who

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.390
leads our developer products.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.890
Nathan.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.310
NATHAN MARTZ: Thanks, Clay.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.710
I have to say it is so
exciting to be here today.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.530
You know, one of my
earliest memories

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.810
was the night my dad came
home with our first computer.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.520
It was an Atari 800
XL-- yeah, there you go.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.170
48 kilobytes bytes
of RAM, support

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.840
for upper and lowercase
characters, pretty awesome.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.630
But the thing I
loved most about it

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.960
was the fact that when
you put in the cartridge

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.970
and turned it on, this entire
world sprang into existence

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.830
inside the computer.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.910
And for five-year-old Nathan,
that was as good as it got.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.900
It's amazing that today we have
technology that's so advanced,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.090
that's so powerful,
it doesn't just

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.140
have great graphics or
realistic sound effects,

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.070
it can actually make you
feel like you're physically

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.960
present in another world.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.030
That is phenomenal.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.890
And the fact that you can
do all of this on a computer

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.600
small enough that it fits in
your pocket is just incredible.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.310
We live in amazing times.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.770
But of course, creating presence
on a smartphone is easier

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.290
said than done.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.660
Of course, just hitting
the 20 millisecond motion

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.049
to photon latency bar,
getting below that,

00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:02.340
which is the gold standard
of VR, doing that on a phone

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.650
is hard.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.210
But we have a more
fundamental problem, I think,

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.612
which is that we're all taking
devices that run on batteries

00:07:10.612 --> 00:07:13.070
and trying to create experiences
for them that feel just as

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.670
compelling as
experiences for computers

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.520
that plug into your front
neighborhood power plant.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.880
And closing that gap is
fundamentally difficult.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.690
So the way we solved
that with Daydream

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.760
is through hardware and
software designed in concert

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.760
with one another.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.760
We've tried to make sure that
every facet of the platform

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.331
supports every other.

00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:36.330
Today I'm going to walk
you through the hardware

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.674
and software that
makes that possible.

00:07:38.674 --> 00:07:40.090
And the developer
tools that we're

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.660
going to be providing
that help you

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.170
take advantage of all of it.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.600
Of course for us, the
foundation of Daydream

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.120
is the phone itself.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.290
And great VR experiences
require great hardware.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.380
You have to have all
of the right parts

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.600
to ensure a high quality,
low latency experience.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.170
So we've ensured that
every Daydream phone has

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.210
a low persistence
display to make

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.690
sure there's no ghosting
or unnecessary lag coming

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.870
from the display itself.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.880
We have a high quality SOC
which will let all of you

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.850
create amazing experiences
and render them at 60 frames

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.580
a second.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.880
And of course, the sensors in
the phone are super critical.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.050
We've made sure that they're all
high performance, high quality,

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.180
low latency sensors
so that there's

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.710
a direct connection between
what you do in the real world

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.130
and what you see in
the virtual world.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.020
Now it's not actually a
single phone for Daydream,

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.880
it's a standard for phones
called Daydream ready.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.520
And the great thing
about the standard

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.140
is that for developers, it
gives you a platform that you

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.470
can feel confident about.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.800
You know that if you're building
for the Daydream ready spec,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.610
any Daydream phone
will run your app well.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.300
And it gives
consumers confidence

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.940
that when they buy
a Daydream app,

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.010
it'll run well on
any phone they have

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.900
as long as it's Daydream ready.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.560
Now of course, great
hardware doesn't just

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.130
give you a sense of presence,
it requires great software

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:02.960
as well.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.720
Which is why we've work very
closely with the Android team

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.920
on Android N and its VR mode.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.280
We've worked to make
sure that Android is just

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.540
as good as a great OS for VR.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.380
And there's a few key
components that we've

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.190
made available to developers.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:22.730
The first of those is a low
latency support for Android N.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:27.510
And that's the foundation
for VR and for presence.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.750
We have a sustained performance
mode which manages the hardware

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.560
and makes sure that when
users decide to get in VR

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.800
they can stay in VR
as long as they want.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.160
We have high quality
head tracking algorithms

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.280
that fuse all of the data
from the sensors in the phone

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.930
and track your head movement.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.860
So that looking around
in the virtual world

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.870
is just as natural as
it is in the real world.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.270
But for all of this, we know
that your phone is still

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.702
fundamentally your phone.

00:09:55.702 --> 00:09:57.410
And you're going to
get calls, and you're

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.900
going to get text messages.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.100
So we've made sure to port key
components of the Android UI

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.240
into VR.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.330
So that if you get a call
or get a text message,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.540
we render it for you
in stereo, and you

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.844
can decide whether
you want to stay in VR

00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:12.385
or leave to act on
that notification.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.800
Now if you take a Daydream
phone running Android N,

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.110
and you combine
it with a viewer,

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.300
you get an incredible
sense of presence.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.390
You feel like you're
somewhere else.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.870
But to a certain extent, all
you can do is look around.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.460
I spent much of my career
as a game developer,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.170
and I developed a deep respect
for the power of interactivity.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.070
You know, when you think about
the things we learn really

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.100
early in life, in
infancy, the first thing

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.295
we learn is how to look around.

00:10:44.295 --> 00:10:45.920
And then we learn
how to use our hands.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.380
We learn how to reach
out and touch the world.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.400
We learn about our heads
and our hands together.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.120
In Daydream, we
saw an opportunity

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.460
to provide access to both
heads and hands in VR.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.350
We did that through the creation
of the Daydream controller.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.500
This controller is
simple enough that anyone

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.210
can use it even
while they're in VR

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.320
and can't actually
see their hands.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.090
But we've also made
it expressive enough

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.740
that developers can
use it to create

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.160
rich, amazing interactions.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.520
It's precise enough that you
can use it as a laser pointer,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.250
but it's also responsive
enough to swing it

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.160
like a tennis racket.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.620
We've added a
clickable touch pad

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.070
so you can both grab and
interact with virtual objects

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.020
as well as effortlessly
browse a media collection.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.610
There's an App button, which is
totally under the developers'

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.760
control, and a
Home button, which

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.420
we reserve for critical
user interactions

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.350
like returning to the
Daydream home screen.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.600
Now we know that for developers,
you need a stable platform.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.830
You need input you can rely on.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.440
So we've designed the
viewer and the phone

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.300
to go together literally,
and will require every user

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.620
to have the Daydream
controller when they enter VR.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.140
That way when someone
launches your Daydream app,

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.610
you know exactly what controller
they have in their hand.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.390
And we believe that
this combination

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.430
of Daydream ready phones
with Daydream viewers

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.330
and the controller
will let developers

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.290
create incredible, rich,
immersive VR experiences.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.554
But that's not just a theory.

00:12:16.554 --> 00:12:18.220
We've been working
with some of the best

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.570
developers in the world
to make that a reality.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.570
I'd like to welcome a
studio to the stage who

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.820
is known for continually
pushing the balance of what's

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.197
possible in real time graphics.

00:12:29.197 --> 00:12:31.280
One of the most innovative
developers in the world

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.960
the creators of the
amazing Unreal Engine.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.550
We've been working with them
very closely on Daydream.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.020
To tell you more about
that partnership,

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.624
I'd like to introduce
their CTO, Kim Libreri.

00:12:42.624 --> 00:12:43.582
KIM LIBRERI: Thank you.

00:12:43.582 --> 00:12:46.956
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.730
Thanks, Nathan, and hello,
Google I/O. And Epic,

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.420
our mission is to
give developers

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.800
the very best tools for
building immersive and visually

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.450
impressive experiences
with fantastic performance

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:03.257
on all the platforms
that we support.

00:13:03.257 --> 00:13:04.840
We've been creating
VR experiences now

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.680
for many years that not
only push visual fidelity,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.150
but also what's possible in
terms of input, interaction,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.440
characters, and
gameplay mechanics.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.320
Every project that we work
on extends the capabilities

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.390
of Unreal Engine, and
we give these back

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.620
to developers on a daily
basis through GitHub.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.360
Today we're very,
very proud to be

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.450
part of a new chapter
in VR history,

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.372
and we've been eagerly preparing
for the arrival of Daydream,

00:13:30.372 --> 00:13:32.330
and we're ready to give
you a look at a project

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.205
that we've been working
on that helps realize

00:13:34.205 --> 00:13:36.240
the potential of this
awesome new platform

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.800
and what developers can do
with it on Unreal Engine 4.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.992
Check out the video.

00:13:42.992 --> 00:13:48.150
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.100
-For years we made video
games where you would

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.010
sit on other side of the glass.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.850
Now you're inside
the real 3D world

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.840
with a real feeling of presence.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.900
-Daydream's an exciting
new mobile VR platform,

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.160
and what it does is take
some of the high VR features

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.330
that we've seen in
desktop VR applications

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.460
and brings them to Android
so that we can really

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.630
up the level of fidelity in
our mobile VR experiences.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.440
-What's especially
exciting about Daydream

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.040
is that you have complete
freedom of movement.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.070
You don't have a
cord tangling you up.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.070
You also have this
amazing controller

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.280
that lets you interact,
it lets you throw things,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.417
it lets you choose
where you want to move.

00:14:21.417 --> 00:14:23.000
-So when people think
about mobile VR,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.220
you generally think
of look aiming,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.200
are your hands
locked to your head?

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.730
But with a Daydream controller,
it's a whole new ball game.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.420
You can actually freely
interact with the world

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.107
in a natural way, and
that feels really good.

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:36.690
-The Daydream
integration with Unreal,

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.000
it works out of the box with
all the interfaces for VR

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.220
that you're already
familiar with.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.470
So there's nothing new to
learn, you can jump in there

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.830
and start creating experiences
with the tools from UE4.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.880
-At Epic, we're really
excited about Daydream

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.450
because, well,
everyone has a phone.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.380
This really takes
VR to the masses.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.260
It gives you the ability to
have the same kind of experience

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.580
you would have on really
high end VR systems,

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.392
but now completely immersive and
with this beautiful controller.

00:15:00.392 --> 00:15:01.850
And we know that
Unreal Engine 4 is

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.540
going to power some absolutely
amazing and incredible

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.400
experiences there.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.580
-This is a sample project
I made using assets

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.610
from the marketplace.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.530
I'm really excited to see
what you guys do with Daydream

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.530
and Unreal Engine 4.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.006
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:17.006 --> 00:15:20.687
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:20.687 --> 00:15:21.645
KIM LIBRERI: Thank you.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.080
Pretty amazing.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.029
Mobile VR is going to look
that good, it's amazing.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:30.570
This is barely
scratching the surface

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.130
of what's going to be possible.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.790
The Daydream controller
is a major advancement

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.170
in terms of how you can
craft gameplay mechanics,

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.800
explore a virtual world,
all on your mobile device.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.630
Natural input that's
made for VR is

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.440
hugely important
in terms of making

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.130
you believe that you've been
transported to another place.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.607
And what's better is that if
you incorporate motion controls,

00:15:51.607 --> 00:15:53.690
you really, really feel a
high level of immersion.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.960
Daydream empowers you
to create rich, deeply

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.510
interactive content for mobile.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:05.172
And we can't wait to see the
awesome content and games,

00:16:05.172 --> 00:16:06.755
demos, and all the
amazing things that

00:16:06.755 --> 00:16:10.320
are going to follow using
Daydream and Unreal Engine 4.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.300
Thanks very much.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.106
Back to Nathan.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.510
NATHAN MARTZ: Thanks, Kim.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.310
Thanks so much.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.540
So that's so cool to see
what people are already

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.310
making for Daydream.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.480
But I'm sure many of you
are wondering, when can I

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.320
be a Daydream developer?

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.710
And I'm really proud to say
that you can do that right now.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.290
For those of you who
are C++ developers--

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.030
and we know that many of our
core VR developers love C++--

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.840
we've just launched an NDK for
Daydream that gives you direct

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.830
low level access to all of
the features of our hardware

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.780
and software platform.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.520
And we know that
many of you actually

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.300
like to use game engines
like Unity and Unreal,

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.690
and we've got you
covered, as well.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.610
If you're a Unity
developer, we're

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.560
really proud to say that there's
a plugin available today,

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.860
and we'll have a native
integration coming out

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.160
this summer.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.220
If you're an Unreal
developer, you

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.089
can start today, right
now, using the preview

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:13.420
version of Unreal 4.12.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.990
For all of this information
about how you can be a Daydream

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.220
developer, including how
to build your own Daydream

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:24.510
Developer Kit, check out
developers.google.com/vr.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.930
And I'm going to hand it
over to Lindsay Metcalf, one

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.980
of our team's lead
designers to show you

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.720
the Daydream experiences
and what they'll

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.560
look like for our
users, and how we're

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.540
going to help them discover the
incredible experiences that all

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.680
of you will create.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.711
Thank you.

00:17:37.711 --> 00:17:41.078
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:45.017 --> 00:17:46.350
LINDSAY METCALF: Thanks, Nathan.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.872
We've learned so much
about designing good VR,

00:17:48.872 --> 00:17:51.330
and we're looking forward to
sharing it with you all at I/O

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.330
this week.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.490
So I'm going to walk you
through Daydream Home

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.170
and take a look at how we've
designed the experience

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.819
to really connect people to
the very best VR content.

00:17:59.819 --> 00:18:02.110
Then I'm going to take you
through a couple of the apps

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.479
that we've designed and
share some of the things

00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:06.020
that we've learned
that will help you

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.580
create your very own VR apps.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.910
This is Daydream Home.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.800
It comes with every
Daydream ready phone,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.299
and it's the first
thing that people

00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:17.930
will see when they enter
their Daydream VR experience.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.870
And for VR, crafting
the right environment

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.450
is so important for
facilitating presence.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.150
So for Daydream Home,
we really wanted

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.924
to create a welcoming space that
had a bit of wonder and delight

00:18:26.924 --> 00:18:28.340
inside of it, and
it was somewhere

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.760
that you'd want to stop
and hang out for a bit

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.320
before you embarked on
your next experience.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.600
Daydream Home is also
your experience launcher.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.430
This is where you can see and
launch your favorite apps,

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.670
access Play Store
to get new content,

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:44.560
and also access system settings.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.070
But Daydream Home isn't
just a list of apps.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.660
So up here on the top row,
these are discovery windows.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.360
And discovery windows
are where we're

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.200
going to promote and curate
the very best content

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.670
that you create.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.220
Discovery windows we've
designed with a sense

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.760
of depth and parallax.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.740
So you can really get a sense
of peeking into a new 3D world.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.570
You can step up to
a discovery window,

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.850
and peer in, and really get
a sense for the world that

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.440
will teleport you to.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.020
And using Android
deep links, you

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.660
can add intent filters to
these discovery windows,

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.710
and they will take users
to directly the content

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.020
inside of your apps.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.620
And the importance
of this is it means

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.710
that if you add a new episode
or a level to your game,

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.040
it means that you can
promote it, or them,

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.000
and you don't actually
have to have a new app.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.330
The users can already have the
app installed on their phone.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.450
Next let's take a look
at Play Store in VR.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.590
Play Store will connect
people to all of your apps.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.370
And since this is
Play Store, it means

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.010
we're starting with a large
developer community, all of you

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.820
out here.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.120
And it also means that
we have a global payments

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.070
and distribution
infrastructure that

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.530
will support things like
in-app purchases from day one.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.480
We designed Store to
make it easy to browse

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.710
for apps and games in VR
by showcasing collections

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.920
of curated content,
as well as making

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.260
it easy to navigate by
swiping through the content

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.050
with the Daydream controller.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.140
Now I'm going to dive into
the Google Street View

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.612
app in Play Store VR and
take a more detailed look.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.440
Here we've added
VR-specific features

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.820
to help you promote
your apps, such as 360

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.030
photosphere previews that you
can preview all around you

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.590
instead of just flat,
static screenshots.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.537
And in VR, even with
the most exciting games,

00:20:29.537 --> 00:20:31.620
it's really important to
make sure we're designing

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.250
comfortable experiences.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.910
So we've added a
motion intensity rating

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.844
to help people find content
that's right for them.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.700
And let's be realistic here.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.340
No matter how
awesome VR is, we're

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.890
still going to spend most of
our time in the real world.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.042
So for the times that you're
away from your Daydream viewer,

00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:03.000
or Daydream mobile app
will make it really easy

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.690
to discover and queue up
content to try out later.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.560
So when you're on the go and
you have some time to browse,

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.360
but you don't have
your viewer on hand,

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.520
you can queue up VR
videos to watch later.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.410
Or if you're at a
friend's house and you

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.490
hear about an
incredible new VR game,

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.350
you can download the app right
there from your mobile phone

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.710
and the game will be there
waiting for you next time you

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:22.930
return to Daydream Home.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.790
Yesterday we mentioned that a
VR version of YouTube is coming,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.960
so now let's take a look.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:40.160
With stereoscopic VR
video, 360 livestreaming,

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.770
and spacial audio, we've built
an awesome foundation for truly

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.590
immersive video with YouTube.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.750
You can step inside a video
and have it all around you,

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.545
and you can really
feel like you're there.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.990
Including hanging out with great
white sharks, which in VR, is

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.410
actually pretty scary.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.390
YouTube is also a huge
part of discovery for VR.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.684
I think many of
us and many people

00:22:03.684 --> 00:22:05.850
have had their first
experience with virtual reality

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:06.649
here in YouTube.

00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:08.690
So we've been working with
our friends at YouTube

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.980
to bring this all together
in a standalone VR app.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.480
I'm sharing this
with you because we

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.960
think YouTube is going to be
one of the best ways for you

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.780
to reach users and
show off your apps.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.950
A lot of us are already
using YouTube to share

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.070
development tips and tricks.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.470
Now with the VR video creation
tools that the YouTube team is

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.210
hard at work on, it will also
be an incredible way for you

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.820
to connect with your audience
and build a community.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.110
So you'll be able to upload
360 video, trailers, gameplay,

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.612
basically everything
that you'd want

00:22:38.612 --> 00:22:40.820
to get people really excited
about the content you're

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:41.486
going to create.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.080
So we've designed the
Daydream experience

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.500
around helping people
connect to your content

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.140
and continue to reengage
with it over time.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.800
But more than anything, what
we're really excited about

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.980
is seeing what you are
all going to create.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.480
And we know that
there are thousands

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.740
of undiscovered things
left to explore in VR.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.710
So to help, whatever we learn,
from performance optimisations

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.990
to user experience, we want
to share that with you.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:18.120
So today we're excited to
introduce Daydream Labs.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.000
Daydeam Labs is where we're
going to experiment and share

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.900
what we learned with the world.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.300
We're hard at work right
here in Mountain View,

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.580
and we're exploring
everything from usability,

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.580
to hardware, to new
user experiences

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.630
for virtual reality.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.360
And as part of
this effort, we're

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.390
rapid prototyping to explore
what makes VR useful, fun,

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.240
and also sometimes bad.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.020
So so far, we've been building
about two app experiments

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.067
a week for a while.

00:23:43.067 --> 00:23:44.650
And today we're going
to start sharing

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:45.816
these lessons with everyone.

00:23:53.174 --> 00:23:54.840
First we're going to
start by giving you

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.790
access to our Daydream
design playground

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:01.026
to get you started developing
for the Daydream controller.

00:24:01.026 --> 00:24:03.650
We'll give you access to all the
different types of experiences

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.327
that we've created so far,
and from flipping pancakes

00:24:06.327 --> 00:24:08.410
to playing tennis, we have
about 15 different ways

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.680
to interact with the controller
that we've thought of so far.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.300
We're also giving another
talk this morning on lessons

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.510
learned from Daydream Labs.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.907
This is focused on our rapid
prototyping initiative,

00:24:18.907 --> 00:24:20.740
and we're going to start
sharing all of this

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.290
regularly on the Google VR blog.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.530
We're so excited to
join the conversation,

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.780
and we can't wait to see
what everyone builds.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.580
I'd now like to hand
this back to Clay.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.042
Thank you.

00:24:31.042 --> 00:24:34.514
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.280
CLAY BAVOR: One
of the prototypes

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.050
we get to see as part of the
session Lindsay mentioned

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.190
is a VR watering can.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.050
We took a Vive
controller and jammed it

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.530
in the front of a watering can.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.222
And turns out, it's very
natural to water things in VR

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:51.430
when you have a watering can.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:54.390
So anyway, stay tuned for that.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.570
Maybe even better
than the pancakes.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.260
So hopefully this
all gives you an idea

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.050
of how some of the
parts of Daydream

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.370
come together, from the Daydream
ready smartphones and the VR

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.246
optimisations as part of N,
the controller, the viewer,

00:25:06.246 --> 00:25:07.620
and some of the
tools that you'll

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.710
have access to as developers.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.210
Like the discovery
windows where you

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.720
can push new experiences
and so on to users

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.670
as part of Daydream Home.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.700
But of course, the smartphones,
the operating systems,

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.440
the headset, the controller,
it's not what VR is about.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.970
It's about the stuff that
you can do, the experiences.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.880
And we hope you're going
to create many of those.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.280
And from the beginning,
from early on with Daydream,

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.020
we've been very focused
on making it really easy

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.600
for developers.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.500
And one of the companies that's
been at the forefront of VR

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.430
development is Unity.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.560
And John Riccitiello,
their CEO, has

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.240
been one of the
earliest supporters

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.480
of what we're doing at Google
in VR and with Daydream.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.240
And he gets what
Daydream is about,

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.720
and I think he sees
where VR is going.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.690
And I'm delighted to have
him here to say a few words.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.663
So John, please.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.770
JOHN RICCITIELLO:
So thanks, Clay.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.830
It's an incredible
honor to be here.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.400
And I want to start by just
making a simple observation.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.090
Google and Unity are deeply
aligned on our values,

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:16.340
in particular about the
way we see virtual reality,

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.150
how we see VR.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.020
Now the mission
of democratization

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:25.270
has been at the core of Unity
Technologies since our founding

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.360
about 10 years ago.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.900
Democratization,
what that means is

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.130
putting the power
of our technology

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.110
in the hands of
developers globally,

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.480
whether they can afford or not.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.470
A very big deal.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:42.360
Now, Google VR under
Clay is about mobile.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.270
Leveraging the power of the
CPU literally in billions

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.380
of pockets around the world.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.780
Everyone's included.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.040
That's another type
of democratization,

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.380
and it's at this core value that
we're fundamentally aligned.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:00.890
Now from the beginning,
our orientation

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:02.900
to supporting the
developer has brought us

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.150
a fairly sizable audience.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.080
As you can see behind me, 5
and 1/2 million developers.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.940
That's a large number of
people using a game engine,

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.390
or game technology.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.010
These developers in
aggregate produce games

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:19.670
that are downloaded 600
to 700 times per second,

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.040
1.6 billion times per month.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.860
And if you want to think about
that as an aggregate audience,

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.910
it's about 500 million DAUs
of games built on Unity.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.530
So this development
community, all of you,

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.320
is a very, very big thing.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.920
If you think about
it, perhaps you'd

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.060
that democratization across
five million developers

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.240
is very serious scale.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.150
Now Unity, as Clay has
mentioned, from the beginning,

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.280
has been making big
investments in VR.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.710
Some of you may have seen
our version of the metaverse,

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.004
creating VR from within VR.

00:27:55.004 --> 00:27:56.420
That certainly got
a lot of people

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.640
lit up on YouTube
and in our community.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.600
And were also very much aware
of Google's roadmap in VR,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.670
and we intend to be and are
there every step of the way.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.720
Now as part of that,
we're announcing

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.770
support for Daydream.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.320
Surprise.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.850
We'll be there, we are there.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.030
It'll be native inside of
Unity, very easy to use.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.340
And we're also providing
support for Vulcan, which

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.730
we're launching next quarter.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.270
So the core fundamental
technologies that you need

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:27.860
will be right out of the
box, easy to use from Unity.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.960
But beyond that, simple
announcement, we're here,

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.130
we're ready, to get on board.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:37.700
I got two things I want to
talk about briefly, two ideas.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.750
The first of them,
really, is that I

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:45.600
think VR is going to
be driven by mobile.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.200
We envision a world where
literally billions of people

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.360
have access to VR.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.760
And the fact that there's
really twice as many people

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.550
with mobile devices as
PCs makes that obvious.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.200
It's just math.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.190
So mobile's going to drive
this in the fullness of time,

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.710
and again, we're
there to support that.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.780
And the second idea that
I want to get across

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.880
is I don't believe that VR
is going to be about games

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.020
or simple shopping apps.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.480
I think it's literally going
to extend the human experience.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.850
Imagine a world 10 years from
now, where you blink and you're

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:22.920
standing in the Taj Mahal.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.670
Or you blink and you're
in New York City.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.500
Or you Blink yet
again, and instead

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.430
of being in a silver
tube flying 40,000 feet,

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.190
you're soaring on the
wing tips of the plane

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:37.050
and experiencing flight like
you've never seen before.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.130
Or you're on stage with
your favorite band.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.890
Not in front like all of
you are, but right there,

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.740
involved in a way that
feels intimate and connected

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.380
to the people you idolize.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.650
Or blink again,
you're in a classroom

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:55.860
taking a physics class from your
favorite professor at Caltech,

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.100
or you're inside a game in a
way you've never seen before.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.540
Or perhaps you're talking
to your best friend,

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.265
and your best friend is
thousands of miles away.

00:30:04.265 --> 00:30:06.140
But they're sitting next
to you in your couch

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.360
in a way that feels intimate,
full, and fully present.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.060
These will all happen.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.540
Imagine, if you
want another one,

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.080
think about that old
silly movie, Innerspace,

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.790
or Fantastic Voyage.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.330
You'll be in that
capsule traveling

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.913
through the bloodstream
from the brain

00:30:20.913 --> 00:30:24.440
and quite possibly through to
the end of it in the bowel.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.550
It's all going to be
possible, and maybe you

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.920
don't want that last experience.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.110
But think about shopping online.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.870
Except it'll be
social, and you can

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.840
try the clothes on
against an avatar

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.710
that matches your
body's dimensions.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.990
Again, all a lot closer.

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.640
Walking alongside the
surface of the Mars

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.360
with a future astronaut.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.450
Except unlike he or she, who's
going to be probably stuck

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.200
there for the rest of their
lives, all you have to do

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.820
is take off the HMD
and you're home.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.010
So the holodeck will happen.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.780
We've all seen Star Trek,
that level of presence

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.150
is going to happen.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.480
You'll be closer to your
nearest and dearest.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.130
My two daughters live in
cities far away from me,

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.020
and I'm looking forward
to the opportunity

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.860
to connect with them in a
much more close way that makes

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.260
me feel like I'm right there.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.580
And I've already experienced
that in some VR chat

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.840
development that's
pretty amazing.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:23.440
And at the core of all this,
is we built the Unity engine

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.310
to support 3D development
and quite naturally

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.900
to support Daydream.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.850
We've got 5 million
developers, all of you,

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:31.510
ready to jump on board.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:34.410
And all of you, I hope you're
dreaming about all the ideas

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.960
that I laid out and
many, many more.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.200
Dream them, build them,
life will never be the same,

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.150
it will be one heck
of a lot better.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.725
And with that, Clay,
you're back on stage.

00:31:45.725 --> 00:31:50.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.500
CLAY BAVOR: Thank
you so much, John.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.030
As John said, we're just
deeply aligned on this idea

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.110
of democratizing access to VR.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.920
Both the creation of it, and
also the consumption of it.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.410
And so it's been a natural
partnership from the beginning.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.940
And I want to thank
John, and I want

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.040
to thank all the folks
at Unity who've been so

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.740
supportive of what we're doing.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.050
John talked about the
future, and that's

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.900
where I want to end as well.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.381
And one of the ways
of figuring out

00:32:14.381 --> 00:32:15.880
what's going to
happen in the future

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.590
is to look back on the recent
past and recent progress.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:23.140
So I want to look back less than
a year to last year's Google

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.570
I/O, and a couple things
we talked about there.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.950
The first was something
we called Expeditions.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.810
And Expeditions,
if you remember,

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:32.540
is this tool for teachers
that make it possible

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.510
for them to take classes
on field trips to anywhere.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:39.760
From coral reefs to Machu
Picchu, all virtually.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.890
And for the last school
year, Expeditions

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:44.570
has been on the road
throughout the United States

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:46.640
and in countries
around the world.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.460
And in just this
school year, we've

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.797
taken over one million
students on expeditions.

00:32:52.797 --> 00:32:56.613
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.740
The other thing we
announced last year

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.400
was something we called Jump.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.160
Jump is a camera system
and processing software

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.100
that works in the cloud that
makes the creation of VR video

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.640
seamless at very high quality.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.230
And we built it because we
think the world is awesome,

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:18.470
but we didn't see a great way
of capturing it immersive in VR.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.800
And we partnered
with GoPro to build

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.360
what's called the Odyssey.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.560
And actually, we happen
to have one here.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.331
And if you're tuning in from
VR later, great to see you.

00:33:28.331 --> 00:33:29.580
Thanks for being here with us.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:34.180
If everyone could just, like,
wave and say hi to our-- great,

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.440
thanks, thanks for being here.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.670
So the Odyssey is rolling
out to some amazing creators.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:44.752
And the likes of Discovery,
Paramount the New York Times.

00:33:44.752 --> 00:33:46.835
And people are saying
really nice things about it.

00:33:46.835 --> 00:33:49.970
The quality, how fast it
is, how seamless it is.

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.720
But I think the
best summary of it

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.519
was we were at the
New York Times,

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:56.060
and one of the New York Times
creative leads, after seeing it

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.190
all came together,
just turned to one

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:03.490
of the tech leads of Jump and
said, can I give you a hug?

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:07.155
So we took that hug,
thank you very much.

00:34:07.155 --> 00:34:10.350
So Jump, from the beginning,
was built as a platform.

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:13.440
Meaning the software, which
we called the Jump Assembler,

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.290
the stuff that does the
magic of turning 16 camera

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:19.500
views into omnidirectional
stereoscopic video,

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.855
we built it to be flexible,
to support multiple camera

00:34:21.855 --> 00:34:22.810
architectures.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:25.620
And there are two new ones
we'd like to introduce today.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.360
The first is from Yi Technology.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.330
Yi is a Chinese company with
a strong presence in Asia,

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:33.520
and they're going to be
using their 4k action

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.690
cam to build a Jump-ready
camera that will be available

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.639
later this year.

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:41.900
We've got a lot of interest
from another area as well,

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.290
and that's from Hollywood.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:47.219
Hollywood is asking us for
a cinema grade Jump camera.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:50.022
And we're going to build
them one with IMAX.

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:53.639
I'm excited about that.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.814
So IMAX, of course, is known
around the world for incredibly

00:34:59.814 --> 00:35:01.480
immersive capture and
audio, and they're

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.890
going to be bringing their
decades of experience

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.967
in camera design, optics,
sensors, and more, to Jump.

00:35:06.967 --> 00:35:09.300
And we're just incredibly
excited about what we're going

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.100
to be able to do with them.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.240
So looking ahead, it's
exciting to think about just

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.032
where we'll be in the
near future with Daydream.

00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:18.490
By the end of this
year, there will

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:21.400
be multiple Daydream ready
phones out on the market,

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.100
and I hope your next
phone is one of them.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.020
The first Daydream ready
headsets and controllers

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.270
will be rolling out from
the reference design.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.810
And by the way,
it's not just going

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:33.200
to be partners building
from the reference design.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.400
We, Google, are
also going to build

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.628
a controller and a headset,
and make it available.

00:35:39.628 --> 00:35:43.016
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:47.431
Beyond that, the technology
just gets better, and better,

00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:47.930
and better.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.430
VR is just going to get
better, and better, and better.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.550
And one of the ways that
we see it getting better

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.660
is with Project Tango.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:00.000
Now Tango and Daydream were
part of the same team at Google.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.170
We sit in the same building.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.140
And I'll let you
extrapolate from there,

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.350
but we're pretty excited
about what's ahead.

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:13.070
So over the next two days, there
are 17 sessions covering all

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.360
of this in a lot more detail.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.340
Everything from how to monetize
and distribute VR apps,

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.600
designing with the
controller, everything

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.780
you need to build for
daydream and also for Tango.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.740
And there are some great
sessions on all of this.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.580
So we really hope
to see you there.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.442
Thank you so much
for joining us here.

00:36:30.442 --> 00:36:31.400
I really appreciate it.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:31.950
Thank you.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:33.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:39.800
