PAUL BAKAUS: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:07.826 --> 00:00:09.200
Welcome, everyone,
to our session

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.760
about the latest and
hottest in DevTools in 2014.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.590
Now my name is Paul Bakaus, and
I work with the DevTools team

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.320
to enable you to create,
develop and design

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.300
and obviously debug your
sites and applications.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.630
So for those of
you that don't know

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.150
and haven't worked with
DevTools before, now here's

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.590
a quick primer.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.380
The Chrome DevTools are
dedicated to delivering

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.050
you a real time
debugging, profiling,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.260
and development environment.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.520
So here's just a quick few
images of what it enables.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.030
But we'll dig into some of that.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.360
So we think they're
your DevTools.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.930
That's very important to stress.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.160
We'd like you think of DevTools
as a friendly assistant

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.250
in your daily life, guiding you
and hiding unneeded complexity,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.239
and helping you focus on
work that matters most.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.300
So in 2014, more so
than ever, the time

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.040
has come to build fully
responsive websites and apps

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.100
to serve the whole screen
continuum of devices, rather

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.410
than just the single device
category, because right now,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.050
many sites just have a
mobile version of the site

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.090
and then a desktop
version of the site.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.660
And the desktop version
can be used on the iPads.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.580
But the iPad
obviously uses touch.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.304
And it's not the
same environment.

00:01:32.304 --> 00:01:34.720
And then, obviously, right in
the middle, there's tablets.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.990
And really, the lines
are getting blurry.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.470
With my watch here, there's
another completely different

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.395
screen.

00:01:41.395 --> 00:01:45.860
And so it's very important
to build out the whole screen

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.590
continuum.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.640
And if you're not convinced,
just look at the data.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.140
Right?

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.931
If we're looking at
the mobile web traffic,

00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:56.700
not just smartphones in general,
but the mobile web traffic

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.360
clearly shows that we need
to do something about this.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.270
We need to build mobile
websites and mobile

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.290
in a very broad sense.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.210
But are we up for the challenge?

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.970
Is our workflow good enough?

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.850
And I think it's not.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.624
I think, clearly, there's
really some challenges

00:02:13.624 --> 00:02:14.540
that we're looking at.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.920
We moved so quickly
to that wave,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.800
to mobile, that we forgot
to build the right tools.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:30.910
And I mean that in the best
sense of the word, "flow."

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.763
Workflow has the
word, "flow" in it.

00:02:32.763 --> 00:02:34.820
And flow is really
the state of mind

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.000
where you're very immersed.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.160
So really, the ideal case is
this meditating Buddhist monk.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.550
And you're in this
immersed state of mind.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.540
You're very energized.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.060
It's like when you
have a coding session,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.518
and you develop
for a couple hours,

00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:51.960
and you listen to great music,
and you're very in there.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.880
And you're very fully involved,
and it's a great feeling,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.380
right?

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.640
You're enjoying yourself.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.770
You're getting stuff done.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.130
It's great.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.390
But I think if you're
working with lots of devices,

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.560
you'd probably rather
look like this guy,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.440
because what do you do when you
develop with actual devices?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.746
Well, first of all, you
have to buy actual devices.

00:03:12.746 --> 00:03:13.620
You have to get them.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.090
You have to put
them in the closet.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.550
You have to charge them.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.050
You have to, obviously,
connect them when you need them

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.770
and play with the
finicky eye to reload.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.750
And it's all just not very nice.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.070
It breaks you out of your
development workflow.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.050
And you have to
come back and forth,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.130
because you're debugging
on your desktop.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.300
And then finally you
realize, OK, I probably

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.460
need to check on my phone.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.960
And obviously, that's
not the ideal workflow.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.780
So we went back to
the drawing board

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.580
and really thought hard
about this problem.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.620
How can we come up with a
disruptive flow that works?

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.950
That just works and gets the
job done and doesn't really

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.810
disrupt the flow, a
non-disruptive flow,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.680
we'll have to say,
so a flow that

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.450
doesn't disrupt
you from your work?

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.020
Right?

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.240
Something that feels natural.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.650
And we found there
are really three areas

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.150
for radical improvement,
design, develop, and iterate.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
And in that order,
actually, because when

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.779
you start developing, you
probably get a designer PSD.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.380
So you take the PSD, and
you transform it into code,

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.370
into HTML and CSS.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.180
And then you probably expand it.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.490
Because the designer only
gave you one resolution,

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.980
you expand it to multiple media
queries and work off there.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.050
And then next is development.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.810
And actually, I think
that's design as well.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.650
I think you're doing a design
work if you're an engineer.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.210
Then you move over to develop.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.640
And so you're
developing, you're trying

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.470
to develop under conditions that
feel relatively similar to what

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.370
you want to achieve.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.390
So you resize your
browser window.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.530
You're trying to
make sense of, OK,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.760
if this is a Nexus 5 resolution,
this is a iPhone resolution.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.270
And then, finally,
once you're ready,

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.670
you want to iterate
on actual devices,

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.930
because they have unique works
and nasty bugs sometimes.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.720
So really, you need
to get in there

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.230
and test some actual devices.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.550
So let's focus on each of these
and write it into design first.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.330
So I mentioned it
before, but we have

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.470
the screen continuum of devices.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.090
And what's really
important, we're

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.610
looking at responsive
layouts here.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.805
We want a layout that stretches
to a multitude of resolutions.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.290
And that's because mobile
is the number one platform.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.070
So you want to make
sure your content just

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.020
flows like water, flows into
different containers easily.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.970
There's lots of
tools that actually

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.810
try to see something
similar nowadays,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.090
but many start from the desktop,
so designed for the desktop.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.070
And then you break down
and write media queries

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.016
for smaller resolutions.

00:05:53.016 --> 00:05:55.640
But you really want to make sure
to start with the mobile site,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.780
because otherwise, you
forget about the mobile site.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.370
And if you don't have
a mobile website,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.650
you just don't have
a website in 2014.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.117
It's easy as that.

00:06:06.117 --> 00:06:08.450
If you don't have a mobile
website, you have no website.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.270
Well, let me explain you the
old web flow for a bit, right?

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.670
In the design process,
I take my website--

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.070
so that's my website--
I build it mobile first.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.230
So what are we doing next?

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.152
Well, I go back to
my editor, and I'm

00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:28.860
going to add some
media queries in there.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.360
Right?

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.050
I'm going to put media
queries in there,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.980
and I'm going to build a tablet
media query for instance.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.030
Now, I go back to my website,
reload under the roughly tablet

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.390
conditions, and find out that
it's still not the right size.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.440
So I get back to my editor,
I change some values again,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.710
go back to the
preview, reload again,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.050
shift pixels around,
until my elements appear

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.930
where they should be appearing.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.080
And it's painful.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.070
I'm going back and forth
and back and forth,

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.710
and I don't like that.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.530
I mean, I'm not sure
about you, but I'm

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.000
really am not a fan
of that workflow.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.520
So we thought we could do
better than that, much better,

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.642
actually.

00:07:08.642 --> 00:07:15.470
But let's go one step next to
emulation and the development

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.190
aspect of it.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.650
So now, you have all
media queries in there.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.630
And you have a
responsive layout.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.670
You still realize that
browser window resizing is not

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.900
the same as emulating
a smartphone, Right?

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.760
So show me some hands.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.030
Who actually tests
on real devices?

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.180
All right, quite a few.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.650
Who tests on more
than 10 devices?

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.512
Oh, I see much less hands.

00:07:42.512 --> 00:07:44.095
There's some of you,
and you're great.

00:07:44.095 --> 00:07:45.540
You're amazing.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.060
But really, you know
how painful it is.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.070
I mean, not everyone
has the ability

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.030
to acquire all these devices
to get a device lab set up,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.860
in order to get all
kinds of data plans.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.840
And so we went out
a couple months ago

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.280
and we put in emulation
controls into DevTools.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.300
So some of you might
already have seen that.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.480
It wasn't ready at
last I/O, but emulation

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.300
controls that
emulate the viewport,

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.280
emulate touch events,
and various other things,

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.810
the user agent.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.400
But that was just a start.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.650
It was [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.890
And I think we could do
much better than that.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.140
So how can we get from this
guy, the very frustrated guy,

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.320
to the Buddhist monk
that's meditating?

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.620
Well, I'm incredibly
[INAUDIBLE] today

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:42.260
to announce, to introduce,
our new device mode.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.330
Here we go.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.340
So the device mode is
a one-click action--

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.660
I'm going to show
it you obviously--

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.800
that combines the
best of media queries

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.430
with emulation and much more.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.610
So are you ready for a demo?

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.595
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:59.595 --> 00:09:00.095
All right.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.093
Let me show you some
of the Device Mode.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.630
There we go.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.040
Just move that over here.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.020
And we want to make it bigger.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.375
Actually, just give
me a tiny second.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.910
I hope that works.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.750
I'm going to try to change
the resolution quickly

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.330
to make more sense out of this.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.530
Yes.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.150
All right.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.160
There we go.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.138
So I'll just click the button.

00:09:58.138 --> 00:09:58.910
Here we go.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.100
So this is one of
our sites that we

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.780
built where you can learn all
about mobile development, web

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.050
fundamentals.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.700
And web fundamentals
is a nice example

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.740
for a responsive website,
which is why I picked it.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.000
So I'm going to bring
up DevTools here.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.390
And here we go.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.240
And now, in DevTools,
you'll notice--

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.370
I'm just going to zoom
in, so you can see this--

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.920
you'll notice a new icon
next to the Inspect icon,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.960
and it's a mobile phone.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.730
So if click that icon, it brings
up our new responsive design

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.470
mode, or device mode,
as we now call it.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.120
Now let me focus
on a few things.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.067
First of all, it makes it very
easy to change your layout.

00:10:44.067 --> 00:10:46.650
So you can quickly change your
layout to whatever you want to.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.700
And as you can see, now
it emulates touch events

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.950
right out of the box.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.690
So it's a one-click action
into mobile web development.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.210
Really, we wanted to make
it as simple as possible

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.320
to get you there.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.360
So to emulate the
viewport characteristics

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.950
of a mobile phone, but it
also emulates touch events out

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.810
of the box.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.610
Now you can go further than
that because, as you can see up

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.300
here, you have all sorts
of device emulation

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.530
right in there.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.360
So we have a couple
of device presets

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.550
that you can choose
from to quickly emulate

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.320
a certain device.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.721
So let's try to pick out
one, let's say Nexus 5.

00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:21.220
All right.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.980
So this is the
Nexus 5 resolution.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.170
It's set the right
resolution here.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.330
I can mess with
that if I want to.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:34.414
I can also rotate it, of course,
to find out different ones.

00:11:34.414 --> 00:11:36.330
So I get a warning here
that I have to reload,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.620
because sometimes
there's service side

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.590
processing involved
into figuring out

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.700
the right viewport.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.370
Let me re-log this to
actually make it look nice.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.650
Here we go.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.160
So this looks like
a mobile website.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.910
And now, again, I can rotate it.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.730
And also, very importantly,
I could test retina here.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.070
So some of these devices
have high DPI screens.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:04.210
And I can easily change the
device pixel ratio right here--

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:08.210
yes, I think I'm pointing
to it-- to actually test

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.780
my images with the new
picture element or image set.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.841
So let's see.

00:12:15.841 --> 00:12:17.340
We also have a
[INAUDIBLE] in there.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.066
So if you're developing
on smaller screens,

00:12:20.066 --> 00:12:21.690
so I just change the
resolution to make

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.175
it a bit smaller in this one.

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:24.800
If you're developing
on smaller screens

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.870
and you pick
something that is big,

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.910
it shrinks the whole thing.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.700
So let me reload this again
to bring the rulers back.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.200
So now it's all shrinked.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.750
But you can disable
that if you want to.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.250
Oop.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.930
Here we go.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.750
So you can easily just preview.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.420
And this is just
scale, so you can still

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.120
work with it just naturally.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.880
So let's see.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.350
Let's go back to
Nexus 5 and show you

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.790
what the design aspect of
this is in there, of course.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.470
Because what we have in
here is this nice button,

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.510
and it brings up media queries.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.610
Here you go.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.150
So this is a view of all of
your media queries on the site

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.600
right there.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.180
So as you can see,
I'm resizing this,

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.424
so you can get a better view.

00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:11.840
Those are all
running on the site.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.110
And if I click on one of them,
it jumps to the right size.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.120
So I can easily
preview all of them

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.880
and edit them in
the style drawer.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.895
And one very important
thing as well.

00:13:24.895 --> 00:13:26.270
If I right-click
on one of them--

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.730
let's say this green
one over here--

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.210
and it gives me a
drop-down and tells me

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.160
exactly where that
media query is.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.890
So I could jump right into the
source here, this one right

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:38.520
there.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.980
Now this is obfuscated, so I
could freely print this one.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.070
And it would then go
directly to that media query.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.860
Let's try this again.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.540
Here we go.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.040
Oh.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.550
There we are.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:55.919
All right.

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:57.710
And then edit it right
in there, because we

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:01.560
have a new feature in
DevTools called Workspaces

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.290
that, if you
haven't used it yet,

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.870
connects your local file
system of your website

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.612
with the file
system in DevTools.

00:14:09.612 --> 00:14:13.103
And so I hit Control S,
for instance, to size

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:16.230
it directly back to
your file system.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.320
So finally, one feature that
is really nifty in combination

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.130
with media queries.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.180
Because if you're nesting
many media queries,

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.550
that would become very useful.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.410
Let's say I'm just
going up here,

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.820
and I want to change
this caption right there.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.005
So I inspect it-- well, I'm
trying to find the button.

00:14:34.005 --> 00:14:36.944
No, that's was the wrong one.

00:14:36.944 --> 00:14:38.290
OK, let's try it this way.

00:14:42.574 --> 00:14:47.940
Actually, it's pretty hard to
see the screen from over here.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.880
OK, let's actually
just do it like this.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.380
Right?

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.980
So I have an element here.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.530
And then what I can do
here is style filtering.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.860
So a nice nifty feature
that we brought in

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.960
that you might have
discovered yet already,

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.480
but it's very nifty
because, if you

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.150
have lots of styles
on top of an element

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.550
and you want to find something
out about the element,

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.579
you can quickly click in here.

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:14.870
Let's see what do we have here?

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.210
Line height for instance, right?

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.100
And just type a
couple of letters,

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.100
and it highlights
them, brings up

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.930
exactly what you
just searched for.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.540
And you can edit them.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.160
So that becomes very
useful with media queries.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.590
So finally, if you don't
want to have this view open

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.880
all the time, because you just
want to focus on your content,

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.150
well, if you close this
again, you'll notice--

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.940
and I hope you can see it-- but
there are some rulers in here.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.620
On the ruler, there are some
sticks that you can click.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.810
So those here are actually
the media queries right there.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.490
And if you click
on them, it just

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.550
brings up that view all again.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.960
So this is a nice preview
of what you're looking at.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.650
And finally, now some of
you that have used emulation

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.300
before, there's more, obviously.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.030
So there's still a lot
more that you can emulate.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.020
We just put the best,
what you probably

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.990
need right way up here.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.490
But if you click on
that button right here,

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.020
it opens up the original
emulation controls

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.474
in Detail mode.

00:16:22.474 --> 00:16:24.140
And that allows you
to emulate all kinds

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:28.540
of sensory information,
accelerometer, geolocation,

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.070
user agent, you name it.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:38.270
So finally, of course, you might
not just work on mobile, right?

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.630
Maybe you also want to
develop your website

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.370
so it looks fine on desktop.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.907
Well, you can do that as well.

00:16:44.907 --> 00:16:46.490
This jumps you right
into mobile view.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.420
But if you want to
do media queries

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.930
and design a desktop page,
you just hit the reset button.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.870
And the reset button,
as you can see,

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.620
removes the viewport rulers,
removes the touch event

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.850
emulation, so we're back
to normal mouse event,

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.330
and its hover
effects work again,

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.970
and you basically just keep
on resizing your window

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.930
like you did before,
but with media queries.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:13.210
So now, let's go back to the
presentation for a moment,

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.569
because we're not done yet.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:20.900
We think that we don't have
a complete story to tell yet.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:27.200
So let's talk a bit
about connectivity.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.530
Now in your office Wi-Fi,
if you have lots of devices

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.550
and they're all connected
to your office Wi-Fi,

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.890
you probably have a very good
experience loading your page.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.160
Now let's say, for the
sake of an argument,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.420
just for the sake
of an argument,

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.240
you're at the conference.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.800
Right?

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.340
And it's the same
connection type, right?

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.080
You're basically on
a Wi-Fi connection.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.750
But I argue it's probably
not the same experience

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.420
to your office.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.680
Now this is an important
aspect of testing,

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.570
because how do you know what
your users actually experience

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:10.450
if you don't have a 3G
connection to test on?

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.780
And it's like, you
know, I'm a German guy.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:17.060
German Autobahn, versus
American Autobahn.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.550
And we really think the
whole story is not complete,

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.480
the whole emulation
story is simply not

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.820
complete without connectivity,
without network emulation.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.380
So I'm incredibly
excited to show you--

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.300
and you might have seen it
already on the demo-- I mean,

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.690
crazy excited to show you.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:42.170
And I think we're the first
to do this, to show you

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.700
network emulation
right in your browser.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.260
So let's jump back to the demo.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.620
Here we go.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.040
And let's use a different page.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.540
I'm going to pick the
Huffington Post right here.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:59.690
It's the US device.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:00.720
OK.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:09.450
So OK, I'm going to bring
up the DevTools again.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.376
I have a new network panel here.

00:19:11.376 --> 00:19:12.110
Right?

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:16.230
So I'm looking at the
network data coming in.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.750
So let me reload the page,
just so you get a picture.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.500
OK, so stuff is loading here.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:34.500
And OK, it's obviously not that
fast, but we're getting there.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.950
And it's currently
set to no throttling.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.940
OK, page is loaded.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:44.210
And now, do I actually--
now, I don't want Flash.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.790
No!

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.400
OK.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.564
So now let's actually
bring this to a-- oh,

00:19:51.564 --> 00:19:52.730
this is why it took so long.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.574
So it brings us to
another resolution,

00:19:55.574 --> 00:19:56.490
and then reload again.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.200
Here we go.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.220
So now we have a mobile website.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:07.870
It's loading, but it's loading
too fast, because, OK, I'm

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.600
on a [? Grand AM ?]
on a conference Wi-Fi.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.134
It's not as good
as office Wi-Fi,

00:20:13.134 --> 00:20:15.550
but let's just try to simulate
the [INAUDIBLE] connection,

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:19.540
so let's go to--
what do we have here?

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.150
Let's say Edge, right?

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.790
Unfortunately, in
Germany, we still

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.017
have Edge in some
remote destinations.

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:29.100
And let's try to reload
this and see what happens.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.620
So here we go.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.450
Blank page.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.410
And pretend I didn't
know how the soccer

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.740
game went this morning.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.240
Right?

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.364
And I want to check it out.

00:20:43.364 --> 00:20:47.120
I'm like, no, what is happening?

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.035
Can't this train go
out of the tunnel?

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.771
And that might happen, as well.

00:20:57.771 --> 00:20:58.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.950
Yes.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:59.150
Right?

00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.705
Even worse.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.370
That's even worse.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.600
Now I can never find
out how that game went.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.930
Ah.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.340
OK, let's bring this up again.

00:21:12.724 --> 00:21:14.015
Just bear with me for a second.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.140
Here we go.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.970
Yes.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.580
All right.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.961
And yeah.

00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:30.210
So this is network throttling.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.520
You saw the connection
is actually quite slower.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.320
And this feature is
still experimental,

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.290
as with the others.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:37.605
It's Canary right now.

00:21:37.605 --> 00:21:39.480
So you can check it out,
you can download it,

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.100
and you can play with it.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.620
But this is the first time
I've been seeing that crash,

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.820
I swear.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.410
It's usually relatively stable.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.860
Now one important thing.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.290
And this is something
that was hard to do,

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.320
but is obvious once you use it.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.780
This network
emulation-- you might

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.220
have played with
some others, right?

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.303
You might have played with
tools that dragged down

00:22:00.303 --> 00:22:05.420
your entire connection, like
Link Conditioner or Apple

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.840
internal software.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.190
But those do it for
your whole system.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.020
Now this one does it per tab.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.010
So even if you completely
hog down one tab,

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.050
you can still query for
documentation in another tab.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.530
And not only does it
throttle, but it also

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.880
goes completely offline.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.650
So if I hit this one and go
to the offline one right here,

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.410
it does what I would expect.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.827
I reload the page, and it
tells me, hey, I'm offline.

00:22:31.827 --> 00:22:33.410
I didn't have to
unplug my connection.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.430
I didn't have to
[INAUDIBLE] my Wi-Fi.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.270
And I could still now Google for
documentation about App Cache,

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:41.970
because we all know
App Cache is horrible.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.690
So very useful feature.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.542
Yes, thank you.

00:22:47.542 --> 00:22:49.018
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.670
So let's go back to
the slides once more.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.530
Iteration.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.450
So now that I've showed
you all this emulation

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.840
stuff in the new Device
mode, let's switch

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.500
to actual devices for a second.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.330
And you might be thinking, what?

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.950
He just talked
about all this stuff

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.260
and how I can
improve my workflow.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.750
And now he still wants to get
me the devices and plug them in?

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.080
That's weird.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.920
But I think, that
was the world before.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.420
Right?

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.570
So this is the PainStation.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:31.680
And the PainStation
is a version of Pong.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.155
It's very fun to play, actually.

00:23:33.155 --> 00:23:35.750
It electrifies and
burns you when you fail.

00:23:39.665 --> 00:23:42.435
But that makes it kind
of adrenaline-pumping.

00:23:42.435 --> 00:23:44.370
It's adventurous.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:48.010
And that was the world
of device testing before.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.280
But luckily, it's easier now.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.260
And it has to be, because
testing with actual emulation

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.603
is not the same as a smartphone.

00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:02.820
No matter how hard we try, we
can't simulate the whole thing.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.540
We can't just, because there's
different graphics drivers,

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.240
there's different
characteristics

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.854
on every single device.

00:24:08.854 --> 00:24:11.020
There are devices out there,
like the Samsung Galaxy

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.810
S3, which is a great phone, but
it has three different hardware

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:19.270
versions across
the globe, I think.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.390
And it's very hard to
test for all of them.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.290
So you have to have
devices to actually test.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:30.660
Now what are the reasons for
you to actually use devices?

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.725
Well, performance profiling,
device-specific glitches,

00:24:34.725 --> 00:24:38.460
as I just mentioned,
and the context.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.800
What do I mean by context?

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.242
Well, the look and feel, right?

00:24:42.242 --> 00:24:44.200
If you're looking at
something on your desktop,

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.820
and everything is very big, and
you don't actually touch there,

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.060
but you use your
mouse to navigate,

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.900
you will press the buttons every
time, even if they're tiny.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.210
But if you have a
device in your hand

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.750
that's actually much tinier,
you'll have a harder time.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.760
So the context is
extremely important.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.135
So let's first talk about
performance profiling.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:12.080
And actually, no.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.710
Let's dig into
performance profiling,

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.360
because performance
profiling, in my opinion,

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.360
is one of the most
important aspects of it.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.570
And I want to show you
a demo for this as well.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:25.430
And as I said, before,
it was very painful,

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.270
but we tried to make
it very, very simple.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.780
Maybe not like this
keyboard right here,

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.950
because that becomes
a bit useless.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.910
But we try to make it
equally simple with remaining

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.370
functionality.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.570
So let's show you what we did.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.070
All right.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.885
I'm going to get my
Chromium up here again.

00:25:47.885 --> 00:25:49.456
Here we go.

00:25:49.456 --> 00:25:50.955
I'm going to switch
to another site.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.640
Here we go.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.220
And now I'm going
to open DevTools

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.830
to show you exactly
what happens.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.310
So I'm bringing up my Nexus 5K.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.790
That's just an
unmodified Nexus 5.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.056
I have my USB
connection right here.

00:26:12.056 --> 00:26:13.300
I'm going to plug this in.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.700
Here we go.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:22.650
What just happened?

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.940
Well, let me show you.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:30.570
Right in that corner we get
another small mobile icon,

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.580
and it shows me that
one device is connected.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.350
That's all I did.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:36.700
I just plugged my phone in.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.560
There's nothing I
did on my phone yet.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:43.470
Well, I'm clicking on this, and
it brings up a new device panel

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.270
right down here.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.160
Oop.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.700
Oop.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.080
Here we go.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.050
So this tells me that I
just connected my Nexus 5,

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.170
and it's running Chromium.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.730
So what can I do now?

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:00.285
Well, I'm going unlock
my screen just now.

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:01.060
Here we go.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.530
So I see this works.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.050
So I have Chrome
open on my screen.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.120
You'll just have to believe me.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.420
I'm going to click Try Here.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.590
Now what this does now-- let
me move this screen over-- this

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.520
just opened this new screen.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.850
And network connection
is a bit slow right now,

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.150
but let's just wait for it.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.670
So while we're waiting,
what just happened?

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.830
Well, I told
DevTools that I want

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.600
to try the page I just
opened on my phone,

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.890
and I want to test
it on my phone.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.150
So what it did when clicking Try
Here, it sent it to my phone,

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.470
it loaded it in
a new tab, and it

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.400
opened a new remote
debugging session right away.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.390
But not only that, it also
opened screencasts right away.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.250
So what this is
doing, it's actually

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:56.070
screencasting from my device
right on to my desktop.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:00.030
And if that wasn't cool enough,
now this is all interactive.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.770
So it's all emulation
right in there.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.170
Not actually emulation,
but this is my real phone.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.790
I'm navigating on my
real phone right now.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.300
I can click stuff here.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.620
I can even inspect
stuff here, right?

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.840
So this is all live.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:20.382
And the best of it is that
all of DevTools is in there.

00:28:20.382 --> 00:28:22.215
It's not just the light
version of DevTools,

00:28:22.215 --> 00:28:25.500
it's the full
version of DevTools.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.030
So let me show you
some of the features

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.010
that you could use to
debug performance in there.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.540
And I'm going to highlight
some of the new stuff.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.970
So first of all, this is a
nifty 3D effect, hopefully.

00:28:41.615 --> 00:28:42.600
Let's try again.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.320
I think it's not
a nifty 3D effect,

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.445
because it's still loading.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.290
OK, let's try this again.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:14.720
So the effect we're actually
looking at is this one.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.150
So this is the 3D effect.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.790
And let's try it again.

00:29:28.484 --> 00:29:30.920
There we go.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.920
The page is just very slow
right now, but you know what?

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.100
I'm going to show you the
feature outside of that tab.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:44.820
But you just have to
pretend that this one is

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.080
the mobile phone you
were just looking at.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.910
But again, the features
are all compatible.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:30:00.850
So now, as you can see, I have
a new Layers panel right here.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:04.530
So the Layers panel will give
me a presentation, a preview,

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.395
of what's happening on
my page, all the layers

00:30:07.395 --> 00:30:11.350
that I used to render
certain things in there.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.700
So now I can rotate this and
look at what's happening.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.390
So I can see that
many layers here

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.220
stacked on top of each other.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.800
And if I click the toggle,
check out what happens.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.410
Here we go.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.830
So all of this
rendered in real time.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.140
And I can click on them
and do stuff with it.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.360
But even better, one of the
new features in here-- and just

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.260
to let you know, all of
this is experimental,

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.920
and the UI will likely change--
but we built in a paint

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.890
profiler right here, because
one of the common problems

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.720
with mobile phones is painting.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.490
And painting happens often
on the GPU, but not always.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.690
So let me double-click this guy.

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.450
And now what it did here,
it rendered the whole page,

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.740
the whole document, onto
that background surface

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.900
of the graphical representation
that I have here.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.010
And now down here-- just
resizing that window

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:10.930
so you can see what I'm looking
at, here we go-- down here,

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.200
you actually get a profile.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:18.390
So now we can see what
painting that whole thing did.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.160
There we go.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.770
So let me zoom in again, just
to show you what happened.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:26.770
So now I'm going to select
a certain thing here.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:36.740
And then, as you can see, as I'm
dragging around and selecting

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:40.320
new parts, it renders
what is just drawn.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.630
So I see all the drawing
commands that just happened.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.280
And I can quickly
follow and find out

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.900
what took so long to paint.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.625
I have spikes right at
the beginning and here.

00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:52.750
And those, I think, are
some of the border radiuses

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.510
that we're seeing in
the Toggle button.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.820
So this is a very
nice, convenient way

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.540
to figure out what
took so long to paint.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.750
But let me show you
another feature.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.810
So let's talk about profiling.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:11.990
So when you want to know how
things animate on the timeline,

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:14.662
you go over into
Timeline, here we go,

00:32:14.662 --> 00:32:16.370
and you look at what's
happening in here.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.411
I'm going to reload this.

00:32:22.983 --> 00:32:24.084
There we go.

00:32:24.084 --> 00:32:25.500
Now we've got some
stuff recorded.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:36.370
And yes, I don't see anything.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.030
My cursor is just too big.

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:52.875
Here we go.

00:32:52.875 --> 00:32:56.210
I think now we're seeing stuff.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.491
It's hard to say.

00:32:58.491 --> 00:32:59.710
Just give me a second.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.930
OK.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.138
Why don't you try that again?

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.685
OK there we go.

00:33:24.685 --> 00:33:27.170
So now we actually have
some stuff down here.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.640
So we're seeing some of the
events that just happened.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.646
There's, for whatever reason,
just network events right now.

00:33:32.646 --> 00:33:34.020
But the timeline
is useful if you

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.290
want to see what's happening
while you're loading your page.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.920
So now we're seeing
what happened

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.300
in the network requests.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.380
But the problem is
sometimes I want

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.770
to know what took
so long to paint.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.510
But I also want to know
why did it paint so long?

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.410
And it's often JavaScript
that caused it to paint.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.990
So earlier, we didn't
have the ability

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.730
to combine those two
to actually find out,

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.450
hey, this job's just
run, and a relayout

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.580
happened because
a JavaScript run.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.780
And before, you basically
had to go through the profile

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.260
and then record a CPO
profile on JavaScripts.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.219
So you would run this.

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:11.750
And then you would stop it.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.370
And then you would
look at, OK, now

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.219
what happens here on
the page, obviously.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.420
But you would look at what
actually just happened.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.719
But now-- this is another
experimental feature,

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:23.100
but I think it's a very
good one-- now what

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:27.590
we did here is to combine
JavaScript profiling

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.030
with the Timeline.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.400
So if I click this Flame
Chart icon right here,

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.801
it switches to a different view.

00:34:33.801 --> 00:34:37.590
I'm going to record
this and reload.

00:34:42.206 --> 00:34:43.270
Let's hope this works.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.080
No?

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:55.310
All right.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.018
That doesn't make a
great demo right now.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:01.240
Weird.

00:35:06.261 --> 00:35:06.760
OK.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.980
So what's supposed to happen,
in that thing down here, you

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.510
will be able to
see your Timeline

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.540
commands in a nice
Flame Chart, as well as

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.260
what's happening in JavaScript.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.450
So for instance, if you're
loading Google Analytics,

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:24.250
and this page is loading
Google Analytics,

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.450
you see that it loaded
Google Analytics.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.880
But down there,
you also see what

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.140
just happened after it loaded
it, so what it initialized

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.030
and what is
happening after that.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:39.180
And so in the case
of Google Analytics,

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.190
it adds some stats to the
page that cause a relayout.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.260
And you will notice that, when
you have a working view that

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.260
actually shows you that.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.640
So a couple of
performance features

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.000
that didn't work out
that well in the demo.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.700
But again, toy
with them at home.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.380
And I hope they'll work
better on your computer.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.160
So let's move back.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.580
So again, all of these
features, everything

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.830
that's in DevTools, even the
most advanced performance

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:10.030
stuff, is available
to you everywhere,

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.240
including the ones
I just showed you.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.820
And they work with
every device run

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.800
in Chrome, even the Chromecast.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.950
So we have design, develop,
and iterate right here.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.280
We think today's
DevTools refresh

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.140
is going to make you a
lot happier, hopefully,

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.580
and more productive.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.670
And we'd love to hear
from you if it does,

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:30.840
and especially if it doesn't.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.680
So design went to
responsive layouts, develop

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.590
went to rich
emulation, and iterate

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.630
to a interremote debugging.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.940
So in responsive
layouts, I showed you

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.290
a rich representation of media
queries, style filtering, media

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:47.770
query editing.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.660
And it plays well
with inline emulation

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.900
all together in that big few.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.760
Now in emulation, you
have device presets

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:59.060
for most popular devices, rich
viewport emulation, sensor

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.910
emulation, and
the advanced panel

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:04.070
down there with touch
geolocation accelerometer,

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:07.370
and-- and this is a very
cool new feature-- network

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:11.452
throttling and offline
support per tab.

00:37:11.452 --> 00:37:12.910
And finally, with
remote debugging,

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.510
once you have a pretty
good website set up,

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:16.790
you just plug and play.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.130
It's as easy as that.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.980
You take your phone,
you plug it in.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:24.370
It brings up a new panel that
shows you one connected device.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.900
And it has the same
powerful features.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.890
It screencasts from your device
directly onto your laptop.

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.110
And it also supports
port forwarding

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.360
for those advanced
use cases where

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.750
you want to develop
a local host,

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:39.830
and not just on a remote
website, you can do that.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.540
There's an Advanced
panel down there

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.450
that supports port forwarding.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:46.020
So you just put in, hey, I
want to forward local host

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.000
to this port on my device.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.920
And as soon as
you have that, you

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.630
can debug local hosts
right on your device.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:57.190
So before we completely
finish, we've almost

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.340
arrived at the
end, but I want you

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.820
to know that you're all
invited to collaborate with us.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.470
Because if you look at that
screen, all of the things

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:08.020
that you're seeing here, they
all have something in common.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.680
They're coming from you.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.130
They're coming
from the community.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:15.300
All of these features are
because you just told us

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.800
what you want.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.210
So we really value
your feature requests,

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.130
no matter how big or small.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:22.760
See, if we don't
hear from you, we'll

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.370
build the DevTools
that we like, right?

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:28.370
But we'd much rather build
the DevTools you like.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:29.740
So do get in touch.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.200
Every bug ticket counts.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.830
So suddenly, this marks
the end of the session.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.370
Come speak with me and many
others involved in DevTools

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:39.170
at the Sandbox afterwards.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:41.950
And we'll have a QA
afterwards as well, so enjoy

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.233
the rest of your I/O. Thank you.

00:38:44.233 --> 00:38:52.842
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:52.842 --> 00:38:53.425
Any questions?

00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:07.410
AUDIENCE: Excuse me?

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:08.160
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah?

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.310
AUDIENCE: One more question.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.720
Does the connection
throttling feature

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:18.480
work for such technologies as
Web Artistry or [? WebSTAC ?]?

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.970
PAUL BAKAUS: Yes, it does.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:22.340
AUDIENCE: Even for [INAUDIBLE]
connection numbers?

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.881
PAUL BAKAUS: I'm
pretty sure it does.

00:39:23.881 --> 00:39:28.075
I will have to check
on UDP connections.

00:39:28.075 --> 00:39:28.700
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.090
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:31.131
I'm going to look into
that, but I'm pretty sure.

00:39:34.485 --> 00:39:36.860
AUDIENCE: Do these work with
WebView, all these features?

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.690
PAUL BAKAUS: With WebView?

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:38.315
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:38.315 --> 00:39:39.040
With the--

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.610
PAUL BAKAUS: The
remote debugging?

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:41.768
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:41.768 --> 00:39:42.476
PAUL BAKAUS: Yep.

00:39:42.476 --> 00:39:43.309
AUDIENCE: OK, great.

00:39:43.309 --> 00:39:44.410
Thanks.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:45.836
AUDIENCE: Hi, is this working?

00:39:45.836 --> 00:39:46.260
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:46.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:47.694
So just a quick question.

00:39:47.694 --> 00:39:49.610
I saw that you had a
list of drop-down devices

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.270
for mobile, like
that you can-- how

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:53.340
do you get a device in there?

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.550
Will it work for
other form factors,

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:57.420
like if there's Chrome on--

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.159
PAUL BAKAUS: Very good question.

00:39:59.159 --> 00:40:00.450
We're trying to customize this.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.280
We're trying to make
it customizable.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.490
And we're thinking about a
couple of interesting ideas

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.270
here.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.860
Like for instance,
you could potentially

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.630
plug in your phone
and remote debug it.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:15.050
And it would then ask you to add
the profile to your emulation.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.190
So we get that.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:19.530
It's a common use case that
not all of these devices

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:20.905
are the ones you
want to test on.

00:40:20.905 --> 00:40:24.120
And we're working on that.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.830
AUDIENCE: For the
emulation for the device,

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.670
if you can have
the Chrome browser

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.680
and the internet browser
that it comes with,

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.230
which one is it
that gets emulated?

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.860
PAUL BAKAUS: Sorry?

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.870
So you get the Chrome--

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:39.329
AUDIENCE: So on the Samsung,
on the Samsung notes and tabs,

00:40:39.329 --> 00:40:41.286
there's an internet
browser that it comes with.

00:40:41.286 --> 00:40:42.710
And then you can install Chrome.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.870
So which one is the
one that gets emulated?

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.210
PAUL BAKAUS: You mean
that gets emulated?

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:49.610
Or when you remote inspect it?

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.070
AUDIENCE: When it gets
emulated in the tool.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:55.320
PAUL BAKAUS: So probably Chrome.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.300
But there will be
quirks in there

00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.640
that we can't probably emulate.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.340
So even the Samsung browsers
nowadays is based on Chromium.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:07.420
And for instance, we don't
emulate the whole UI, right?

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:11.310
So there's limited things
that we can do there.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.230
So my guess is that
even if we would

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:14.790
have two different
profiles, they

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.000
will look roughly the
same, because they

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.416
have the same resolution.

00:41:19.416 --> 00:41:21.485
But yeah, I hope that
answers your question.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.680
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that the network emulator

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.440
worked on individual tabs.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.659
Is it the same for
the emulator as well?

00:41:31.659 --> 00:41:33.450
PAUL BAKAUS: Yes, for
the emulator as well.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.404
Absolutely.

00:41:35.404 --> 00:41:36.820
AUDIENCE: Does the
device emulator

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.589
primarily emulate
the resolution?

00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:40.630
Or does it actually emulate
the JavaScript engine

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:44.100
and the HTML renderer
for the device?

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.320
PAUL BAKAUS: Primarily the
sensors and the resolution,

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.760
so with JavaScript.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.220
So yes, and that will
be a cool feature.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:56.070
I mean, where we have
considered thinking

00:41:56.070 --> 00:42:00.010
about removing certain features
that don't work on the device.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:03.852
But we don't have that
in there right now.

00:42:03.852 --> 00:42:05.670
Yes?

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.610
AUDIENCE: Does the
device emulator

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:09.930
bring in Android fonts?

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.197
Or does it emulate
typography as well?

00:42:12.197 --> 00:42:13.530
PAUL BAKAUS: Very good question.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:14.970
No, right now it doesn't.

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:17.480
But that would be very
interesting, actually.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:17.980
Yeah.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.360
That's a good point.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.103
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:20.103 --> 00:42:21.000
PAUL BAKAUS: Yes?

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.720
AUDIENCE: The device emulator
and network throttling

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.795
are fantastic features.

00:42:23.795 --> 00:42:25.920
Is there any way to use
them with automated testing

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.900
tools like Selenium?

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.940
PAUL BAKAUS: Well, for that,
I guess you would need an API.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.530
And there's no API yet.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:35.200
But we're very early in the
life cycle of that feature,

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.340
so it's very
possible, especially

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.160
if you open a bug ticket and
tell me that you want it.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.510
So please do.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.710
And I can't promise, but I
think the use case is clear.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:47.340
And yes.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.489
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:49.489 --> 00:42:50.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.170
Is there any plan of
adding Android browsers

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:55.860
as well that can remote
debug Android browsers along

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.910
with Chromium?

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:01.330
PAUL BAKAUS: Well, we can only
do that if the Android browsers

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:03.880
are actually based on Chromium.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.730
If they are, we probably
should be able to,

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.110
but it's hard to say.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:10.720
I mean, with
Chrome, we obviously

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.890
control the environment
on both ends.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:17.620
And with the Android stock
browser, we often don't.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.689
But we try our best to
bring it everywhere we can.

00:43:20.689 --> 00:43:21.230
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.120
Thanks.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.780
AUDIENCE: Hey, is the
remote debugging only

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.600
possible in KitKat
and up Android?

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.660
Or it's also possible in iOS?

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.290
PAUL BAKAUS: It's right now
only possible on Android.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:39.810
I'm not sure if we can
change that for iOS.

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:42.230
It's just a technical
limitation right now,

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:48.630
because we can't put
Chromium onto iOS.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.000
We have to use their WebView.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.570
So for instance, if
they would implement

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.740
the same remote
debugging protocol,

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.287
we could probably connect them.

00:43:57.287 --> 00:43:59.120
But we don't have that
today, unfortunately.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.660
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.820
Can the bandwidth menu with
offline and then online can

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.470
be used to test up where you
have saved something locally

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:11.957
and then sync back
once you're online?

00:44:11.957 --> 00:44:13.290
You know, changes the state of--

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:13.998
PAUL BAKAUS: Yes.

00:44:13.998 --> 00:44:14.500
Absolutely.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.780
That's what it's for,
so you can completely

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:20.420
emulate application scenarios
and the upcoming service worker

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.730
scenarios.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:22.870
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:24.490
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:26.550
First off, thank you,
for all these features.

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.980
They look really useful.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.630
PAUL BAKAUS: You're welcome.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:30.425
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:30.425 --> 00:44:36.680
And my question is, this new
black design of the emulation

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:41.870
panel looks much different
than the rest of the DevTools.

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:44.910
Is it the beginning
of something bigger?

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:49.680
Are you introducing black theme
through the whole DevTools

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.750
or something like that?

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:52.083
PAUL BAKAUS: Very good question.

00:44:52.083 --> 00:44:54.800
So the reason why we designed
that feature different

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.750
than the rest of
the DevTools was

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.190
because it's inline
in the page, so it's

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:00.190
wrapped around the page.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.850
Right?

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:03.520
And we wanted it
to not be in focus,

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.050
once you concentrate
on the page.

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.650
We want it to be sort of
in the background, which

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:10.930
is why we choose for that
color theme and look.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:13.130
Now I think we
like that new look.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:16.680
And maybe it'll come to
more of the DevTools.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.670
But you'll have to tell
us what you like best.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.730
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:30.740
Casting from the device
to the desktop always

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.660
has a problem with lag,
because it's slower.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.130
Is there a way to read the real
frames per second of the device

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:40.090
and get that sent
through to the DevTools?

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:41.470
PAUL BAKAUS: I
think we're trying

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.072
to do that as much as possible.

00:45:43.072 --> 00:45:43.780
But you're right.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:47.056
I mean, there is a lag
problem, depending, of course,

00:45:47.056 --> 00:45:49.430
on the resolution and other
characteristics of the phone.

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.830
If we can speed it
up, we'll do it.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:56.790
I mean, we'll try
as much as possible.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:58.290
I can't actually
say more than that.

00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:58.831
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:58.831 --> 00:45:59.530
I'll file a bug.

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:00.312
PAUL BAKAUS: OK.

00:46:00.312 --> 00:46:01.710
Cool.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:02.210
Yes.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.710
All right.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:03.560
And that's it.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.380
Thank you.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.930
[APPLAUSE]
