00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.600
So today we've talked about common sense reasoning. Broadly, common sense

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.960
reasoning gives us a formal structure to interpret the world around us.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.708
Having that formal structure let's us build agents that can then do the same.

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:13.930
We started off with primitive actions, which like primitives in programming,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.890
are the simplest things we can interpret out the world. Then we looked at

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.750
composing those primitive actions into bigger actions. For a hierarchical,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.880
abstract view of the world. We then looked at how those primitives can

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.340
cause state changes, which let us predict the effect or cause of certain events.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.710
Next time, we're going to compose these simple frames into much longer stories,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.550
called scripts. Scripts help us make sense of complex repeated events with

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.750
relative ease, and generate expectations about the world around us.
