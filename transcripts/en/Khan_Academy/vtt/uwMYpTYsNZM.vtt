00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.250
In talking about the adaptive
immune system, we've already

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.830
seen that there's a
couple of actors.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.070
You have your humoral
response.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.370
So this is responding to things
that are floating

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.590
around in the fluids of the
body and not necessarily

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.820
things that have infiltrated
your body cells and then you

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.245
have your cell mediated
response.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.200
And then in the humoral
response-- and we're talking

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.680
about specific humoral
response-- this is where the B

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.220
cells, the B lymphocytes are
at their most active.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.540
And essentially what they do
is, you got a B cell here.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.900
It has a very specific antibody,
specific to just

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.640
this B cell, not B
cells in general.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.010
If this happens to be the one
of the billions of B cells

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.550
that happens to have the
matching key-- or maybe I

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.920
should say the matching lock
for the key that is the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.270
intruding pathogen--
that pathogen will

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.560
bind to that B cell.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.420
Maybe it's a virus, maybe
it's a bacteria.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.890
And then the B cell will get
activated and we'll talk about

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.450
in this video that
the activation

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.630
doesn't always happen.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.730
In fact, it usually doesn't
happen just from this, but so

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.860
far we've said it gets
activated, it goes into memory

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.320
B cells, which are essentially
multiple versions of this

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.450
original B cell-- just saying,
hey, let's have multiple

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.640
versions of this-- because it
tends to recognize this virus.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.160
So in the future if we get this
virus, those multiple

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.450
versions, those memory cells are
going to be there to have

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.240
this interaction.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.530
This interaction's going to be
more likely to happen in the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.210
future because I'm going
to have more of this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.640
variety of B cell.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.980
And then you have
effector cells.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.730
And these are essentially-- so
both of these are B cells.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.230
So this guy, once he gets
activated, he proliferates,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.430
keeps dividing and
cloning himself.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.910
The memory cells just stick
around waiting to be activated

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.890
in the future.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.570
And I'm only drawing one
of these membrane bound

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.530
antibodies, but there are
actually 10,000 on them.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.000
I mean, I could draw
a bunch of these.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.300
I don't have to just draw one.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.120
The memories just wade around
in the future, but there's

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.850
more of them now.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.610
So in the future, if we get
this virus again, this

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.350
interaction's going to happen
faster and so they're going to

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.800
get activated faster.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.300
And then the effector B
cells essentially turn

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.990
into antibody factories.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.100
This antibody goes in and it
says, let me just produce--

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.870
I've been activated.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.200
Let me produce many,
many more versions

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.460
of that exact antibody.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.710
So they get spit out.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.670
I drew that one little wrong.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.040
So that exact antibody, that
can then be spit out to go

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.170
disable or tag antigens-- and
not just any antigen-- this

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.290
antigen right here.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.550
And we also saw that the other
thing that the B cell does is

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.190
it becomes an antigen
presenting cell.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.670
So what it does is, as soon as
it recognizes this, it's had

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.600
this interaction with an antigen
that just matches the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.710
variable portion of its membrane
bound antibody.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.880
It endocytosizes that.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.350
It brings that into itself.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.420
It's membrane facilitated so it
just kind of pulls it in,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.770
chunks it up, and then presents
a piece of that

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.920
antibody on an MHC
II molecule.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.240
We saw that in the last video.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.220
So it cuts that up and presents
a piece of it right

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.520
there and that's why we call it
an antigen presenting cell.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.310
Now in this video, we're going
to talk about why we even have

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.110
these MHC II molecules.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.000
What are we presenting
these antigens to?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.510
So we're going to start
talking about the cell

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.360
mediated-- and actually, even
more than the cell mediated,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.765
we're going to talk
about T cells.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.120
And I said in the first video,
they're called T cells because

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.440
they mature in the thymus.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.940
And there are two types of
T cells and it's all very

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.810
confusing because you have B
cells and T cells, but then

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.560
there are two types
of T cells.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.940
You have helper T cells-- and
most people just write T with

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.440
a lower-case or subscript
h there.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.370
And then you have cytotoxic T
cells-- or T cells that kill

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.620
other cells.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.560
Now just so that you have a big,
overarching impression of

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.080
what does what-- B cells.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.640
When they are activated, they
generate antibodies.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.410
At 30,000 feet, that's the
best summary of what an

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.620
activated B cell does.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.700
It actually generate
antibodies.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.180
Those antibodies attach to
viruses and bacteria and other

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.920
types of pathogens and disables
them-- either tags

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.310
them so that macrophages can go
and eat them up or just by

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.040
throwing all of those antibodies
on to the surface

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.510
of the pathogen in question.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.860
It might disable the pathogens
or essentially bundle them

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.850
altogether so that it'll be
easier for macrophages to pick

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.820
them up, but this is only
effective for things that are

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.400
floating around.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.710
Free floating antibodies are
only effective for things that

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.160
are floating around.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.480
Cytotoxic T cells, which I'll
cover in more detail in a

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.010
future video-- these actually
attack cells that have been

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.260
infiltrated.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:42.860
So this is attack, kill,
infiltrated cells-- and when I

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.330
say infiltrated, it could be a
cell that a virus has gone

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.530
into or some bacteria
has penetrated it.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.260
And when I say infiltrated, it
doesn't necessarily even mean

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.110
something from the outside.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.020
It could even be a cancerous
cell that shows itself to be

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.330
abnormal in some way and so the
cytotoxic T cells will at

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.260
least attempt to kill them.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.500
But what I want to focus on--
out of the three types of

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.626
lymphocytes-- remember,
everything we've been talking

00:06:06.626 --> 00:06:09.580
about was leukocytes, white
blood cells, but lymphocytes

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.650
are a subset of that and these
three are lymphocytes.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.880
And they're called that because
they began their

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.660
development in the
bone marrow.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.250
So this guy and this guy
actually do stuff.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.400
This guy generates antibodies
that attach to pathogens

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.540
floating around.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.090
This guy directly attacks
cells that are

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.010
broken in some way.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.700
They've either been infiltrated,
they're abnormal,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.730
they're cancerous--
who knows what.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.730
And I'll do a whole video on
that, but that leads us to a

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.770
very obvious question.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.420
What does this guy do?

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.650
What does the helper T cell
do if he doesn't directly

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.680
interface either with pathogens
or produce things

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.190
that interface with pathogens--
or if he himself

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.350
doesn't go and directly
kill cells?

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.520
And the answer is that the
helper T cell's kind of the

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.140
alarm of the immune system.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.630
And on some level, it's almost
the most important.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.230
So we talked already in the
last video about antigen

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.420
presenting cells-- that either
when a macrophage or a

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.290
dendritic cell takes things
in, it cuts them up and

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.760
presents it on its surface as
these MHC II proteins or in

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.230
complex with these MHC II
complexes or proteins.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.070
And so do B cells.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.940
B cells are more specific.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.010
Now, once something is
presented, now the helper T

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.990
cell can come into
the picture.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.990
So this is a-- let me do a
dendritic cell-- and I'm doing

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.710
dendritic cells actually on
purpose because dendritic

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.340
cells are actually
the best cells at

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.810
activating helper T cells.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.430
We're going to talk about in a
second what happens when a

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.540
helper T cell gets activated.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.090
So let's say I have this
dendritic cell.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.760
It's called dendritic so
it looks like it has

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.010
dendrites on it.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.360
So I have this dendritic
cell here.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.040
It's a phagocyte.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.180
Let's say it's already consumed
some type of bacteria

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.720
or virus and it's cut it up and
now it's presenting kind

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.275
of the body parts of that virus
on the MHC II complex.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.830
It's kind of its way of saying,
hey, I found this

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.090
shady thing floating around
in the body's tissues.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.179
Maybe someone ought
to raise an alarm.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.105
Maybe this is part of some type
of bigger thing going on

00:08:35.105 --> 00:08:37.669
and some type of alarm bell
has to be released.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.419
And that's what the helper
T cell does.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.080
So let's say this guy--
he's presented it.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.090
He says, I found this thing.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:43.610
I killed it.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:44.990
Here's a part of it.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.280
The helper T cell has a
T cell receptor on it.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.480
Let's say this is the helper
T cell right here.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.610
And it has a T cell receptor on
it and the T cell receptors

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.230
bond to-- and I'll be very
particular here.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.710
So this is the T
cell receptor.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.800
It's just like a protein, but
like the membrane bound

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.270
antibodies on B cells that every
B cell or almost every B

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.870
cell has a different version,
different variable chain,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:24.240
that's also true of helper T
cells-- that just like the B

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.660
cells, this has some variation
in where it binds.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.030
So this right here is going to
be variable from one helper T

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.810
cell to another.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.590
For example, I might have
another helper T cell here.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:41.370
That also has a T cell receptor,
but the variable

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:47.030
portion on that T cell receptor
is different than the

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.100
variable portion on this
T cell receptor.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:55.380
So this helper T cell will not
bind to this dendritic cell or

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.120
the MHC II complex of
this dendritic cell.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.500
Only this one would.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.600
And the mechanism of how you
get this variation is very

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.290
similar to the mechanism in how
you get the variation on

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.170
the antibodies and
the B cells.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:12.110
During these helper T cells'
development, at some point the

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.940
genes that code for this part of
this receptor get shuffled

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.800
around and they get shuffled
around intentionally so that

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.090
each T cell has a certain
specificity to a combination

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:28.180
of an MHC II complex and a
certain polypeptide, a certain

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.530
part of a virus.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.720
So only this guy's going to be
activated, not this guy.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.480
So this is why we call it the
specific immune system.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.670
Now we said, what does
that helper T

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.060
cell do at that point?

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.050
He said, hey, I happen to be the
one helper T cell that can

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.930
bond to this guy, this antigen
that's presented.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.450
It becomes activated.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.680
And I won't go into the details,
but in general,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.300
dendritic cells are the best
ones at activating it,

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.060
especially a naive T cell.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.590
In general, when we talk about
a naive B cell or a naive

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.370
helper T cell, these are cells
that are non-memory,

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.820
non-effector, that have never
been touched by-- they've

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.760
never been activated, in
the case of a B cell.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.420
They've never been activated by
something binding to their

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:23.040
membrane bound antibody-- or
a naive helper T cell is a

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.740
non-effector, non-memory helper
T cell that's never had

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.180
anything bound to it.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:33.690
So if this guy is naive and then
he finally has a reaction

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.470
with this antigen presenting
cell, he becomes non-naive.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.530
He becomes activated and when
activated, two things happen.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.870
Well, just like with B cells,
he proliferates many, many,

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.830
many copies of himself and some
subset of those copies

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.655
differentiate into
effector cells.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.170
And effector just means
it does something.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.140
It does something now instead
of saving the memory.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:08.380
And then some subset of them
become memory helper T cells

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.030
after getting activated.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.020
Now the memory T cells, just
like memory B cells-- now you

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.130
have more copies of this.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.960
So in 10 years in the future,
if something like this

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.620
happens, this interaction's
going to be

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.770
more likely to happen.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:25.125
These guys have the same T cell
receptor as their parent.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.270
It's just that the memory T
cells-- or actually even the

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.280
memory B cells-- they
last longer.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.230
They don't kill themselves.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.380
They'll last for years so that
if 10 years later, something

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.100
like this starts presenting
itself, you're going to have

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.560
more of these guys around to
bump into this guy so that you

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.700
can raise the alarm bells.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:56.910
This guy's also going to have
the same chain right there.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:57.630
So you're saying, fine.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:58.870
I have these memory cells.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.600
They're going to stick around
so that this reaction can

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.390
happen in the future, but I
still haven't answered the

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.800
question, what does the
effector T cell do?

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.035
What the effector T cell does
is it raises the alarm.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.450
So there's an effector T cell.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:19.700
It has been activated.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.750
Remember, this is
very particular.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.255
Only this version of T cells,
but once it got activated, it

00:13:27.255 --> 00:13:29.310
produced many copies of itself
because it says, hey, I'm

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.180
responding to a particular
type of pathogen.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.330
So that this is a
helper T cell.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.460
This is an effector.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.690
And what these do is they
start releasing these

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.240
molecules called cytokines.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.800
So they start releasing
cytokines.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.620
There are many, many different
types of cytokines and I'm not

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.160
going to go into detail on all
that, but what cytokines do is

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.030
that they really raise
the alarm.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:03.080
So if you have other activated
lymphatic cells or other

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.000
activated immunological cells--
when the cytokines

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.600
enter those cells-- remember,
cytokines

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.850
are really just proteins.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.610
When the cytokines enter-- or
polypeptides-- when they enter

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.370
those cells, it makes
them get in gear.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.870
It makes them multiply more
often or it makes them get

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.230
more active in their
immune response.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.740
So what this does-- these
cytokines you can view as

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:34.430
chemical alarm bells chemical
or peptide alarm bells alarm

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:38.030
bells it it tells everyone
to get in gear.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.310
So that's one role, and so you
can see this is actually a

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:45.045
very central role and it'll tell
both activated cytotoxic

00:14:45.045 --> 00:14:47.760
T cells to get in gear, which
we haven't talked about yet.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.560
And it'll also tell B cells
to keep proliferating.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.940
So when an activated B cell gets
some of-- so this is an

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.890
activated B cell.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.230
When it gets some of these
cytokines, that maybe come

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.800
from a local helper T cell,
it'll tell it, hey no, divide

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.420
more often.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.270
Divide more often.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.750
Only if you've been
activated already.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.640
And we'll talk more about why
it has to be that case,

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.380
because you don't want all the
B cells to be activated.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.220
And the other thing that the
effector T cell does-- in the

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:21.460
B cell discussion, I said, OK,
if I have a B cell, and it has

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.130
its membrane bound
antibody, has its

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.510
membrane bound antibody.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.370
And remember, this is a
particular version, it has its

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.830
particular variable
chain right here.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.650
And this guy binds
to a pathogen.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.300
So this binds to a pathogen.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.430
Maybe it's a virus
right there.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.680
Up to now, I've been saying
that this guy's activated.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.580
And he's going to-- well, when
he binds to the pathogen he'll

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:49.980
take this in and he'll take part
of the pathogen and cut

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.760
it up and place it on
an MHC II molecule.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.410
And we said, then he'll
be activated.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.230
He'll proliferate and he'll
differentiate into memory and

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.930
effector B cells-- but that's
not quite true.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.350
This first stage happens.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.600
This guy bonds.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.780
This B cell happened to be
specific to this virus.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.340
Cuts up the virus.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.830
Puts parts of the virus on its
surface and presents parts of

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:14.730
the antigen.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:19.630
But in most cases, this B cell
isn't yet activated.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.390
You can kind of view it as in
its resting state, ready to be

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.580
activated, but it hasn't started
proliferating and

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.610
differentiating into effector
and memory molecules yet.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:36.620
And in order for that to happen,
an activated helper T

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.580
cell that is also specific to
this very same virus-- so you

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:45.010
could imagine someplace else in
the cell-- this virus was

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.430
eaten by a dendritic cell.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.940
So this exact same virus, this
exact same species of virus,

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.490
is eaten by that dendritic cell
and so the dendritic cell

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:05.900
eats it up, it cuts it up, and
then it presents it-- it's

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.339
antigen presenting so it
presents it just like that.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.760
Then this will activate
a very specific T

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.569
cell, maybe that one.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:20.980
So a very specific T cell will
come and bump into it.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.000
Not just any T cell,
the one with the

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.290
right variable portion.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.829
So think about what's
happening.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:33.270
The variable portion for this
T cell, it connects to this

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:38.170
part of the virus plus the MHC
II, but it's really reacting

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.290
to the same virus.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.790
It might be a different part.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.760
This little part that was cut
off might be someplace inside

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.820
the virus while the epitope for
the B cell might be some

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.340
place on the outside of the
virus, but they're both

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.020
specific to the same virus.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.990
Now once this guy gets activated
and he starts

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.770
producing memory and effector
cells-- or they're descended

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.220
from him, one of those effector
cells specific to

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.570
this virus are needed to
come bind to this guy.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.350
So then this guy could then go
along and bump around and

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.410
eventually end up here.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.100
And he is also specific
to this virus.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.630
So this binding site right
here is the same as this

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.140
binding site.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.940
This combination of antigen
plus MHC II.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:29.430
And so when this guy binds--
and remember, this binding

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.860
site is the same as this and
it only binds to this

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.320
combination right here-- this
is what activates the B cell

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.880
in most cases.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.360
This is T-dependent
activation, which

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.740
is usually the case.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.310
Sometimes all you need is this
first thing, but in general

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.840
you need the first thing and
then you also need a T cell to

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.830
come and activate it, and only
then will the B cell get

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.540
activated and start
proliferating and dividing and

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.240
differentiating itself and
producing-- when its effector

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.240
cells will produce a
lot of antibodies.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.400
And so there's a natural
question.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.000
Why do biological systems--
or why do we

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.880
have this double system?

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.020
And at least my sense of it is,
it's a failsafe mechanism.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.630
If every time a virus came and
attached this, this guy just

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.940
started going crazy and
producing antibodies against

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.950
this thing, there's some
chance that maybe after

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:26.440
development, this chain right
here or his genes for

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.330
generating these chains become
specific, not for foreign

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:35.180
pathogens, but maybe they
become specific for self

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.180
molecules, molecules
that are naturally

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.360
produced within the body.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.990
It's just a random mutation, but
if he started going crazy

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.090
for that, his antibodies will
start attacking molecules that

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.290
are naturally in the body and
then that could really hurt.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.240
That what causes autoimmune
diseases, where your own

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.200
immune cells start activating
yourself.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.460
But if you have this double
handshake system where this

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.110
has to happen and this has to
happen, the likelihood of both

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:03.050
of these guys after they leave
their development stage

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:09.110
becoming specific to a self
protein or a self cell or a

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.010
self molecule is
very unlikely.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.380
So it kind of inhibits this guy
from going wild, even if

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.180
he has some type
of a mutation.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.350
Anyway, hopefully that explains
a little bit of what

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.520
helper T cells do.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.110
We'll talk a lot
more about it.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.970
I know it can be a little
bit confusing.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.365
In the next video, we'll talk
about cytotoxic T cells.
