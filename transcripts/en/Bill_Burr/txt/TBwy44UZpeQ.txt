Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Eh, what's going on? It's Bill Burr it's time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday. Monday morning podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:00:14       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:00:15       ah, just checking in on you. I got bogged down in the mud on that one. I didn't think I was going to pull myself up, but you know what? I reach down deep. Showed what? I had it on me in on me. She'll write head in me. Um, anyways. Yeah. You know what? It's nice to be here. It's nice to be back out here in sunny la after going back to New York. It was chilly fall Billy back there in the New York City getting soft out here. And you know what? I love it. I fucking love it. That's a big thing that east coast people always say when you go out west, hey dog, don't lose your edge brow dope. Don't be getting all Hollywood on me. It's like dope. Um, you basically telling me don't become happy. That's what you're saying, doped up and getting to happy. What are you going to go do it? You can walk around, you're going to get some sandals. Rarely you fucking toes hanging out or whatever. Do wearing some fucking clam diggers.

Speaker 3:          00:01:19       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       no, it's just nice to like, I went back there and I uh, you know, I'm one of these fucking La people now. I don't really have a winter coat coat. Yep. Pea Coat. Um, it was funny, this woman was breaking my balls. Tell me it wasn't a real one because I didn't get it at the army navy store. It's like those fucking things that's like wearing thick pajamas. Pico doesn't work the second it's below like, you know, 40 degrees. It's one of those meds that, you know what, it's got a mid range jumper that's, that's all that fucking coat has. You know what I mean? It can't run. The court doesn't play any fucking day. It's too fucking hot. You know, once you get to like 58 degrees, it's too fucking hot to wear that coat. Way Too hot. 55 write that code basically exists from about 39 degrees to maybe 51.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       You know what I mean? If you get a decent one, forget a decent one. Like I bought a TCO, actually Nia bought me a decent one, but she used my money to do it. So, you know what I mean? Technically I made, you know, chief fucking use my money, so I guess I bought it, you know, I guess I do have an assistant. It's my wife who has access to all my funds. You got to do that with your wife, you know what I mean? Just give her access to all your funds. It just gives you so much leverage in an argument.

Speaker 3:          00:02:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       Just use that next time, you know? But [inaudible] you were to a, you was snoring. Just honey, honey, you have access to all of my funds. You understand that you have access to all my funds. I go to an airport in leave, leave you with access to, I don't, I don't want, I don't even know what I'm going to come back to. Is there even going to be anything here now? What is the problem with the fucking glass that I didn't wash? I always make me out. Like she's a Nag. She really isn't. She really isn't, but it's just, um,

Speaker 2:          00:03:15       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       I guess it's just the fear of, of, you know, being with somebody that they can take you for everything. You've got prenup doesn't mean shit out here in California. You know what I mean? You don't have a prenup is in California. That's like when there's a blitz in the fullback, misses the assignment. That's, that's what the Prenup is. You'd think that fucker's going to pick up that, that fucking Lawrence Taylor want to be coming right around the outside. Ah, he missed he sitting there with happy feet. Where is he? He's bind you and then you get the old right there, Fred. Right. Well, you fucking Bacchae a helmet. It's the middle of your spine. As you head snaps back. That's what a fucking prenup is out here. So, um, anyways, I didn't want, I'm talking about here. Um, I just get back from New York City. I had such a fucking great time going back there doing the fifth annual Patrice O'Neal benefit right out of the gate. Thank you to everyone that came down to the show. The show was unbelievable. I mean, I wasn't there last year because of the snow I got snowed in. But of the four that I've seen that might've been the strongest show that we've had, we've always had strong shows. But there was something about that show is like the perfect level of, um, of his friends of new guys that were influenced by him and just the ball break. And that was going on during the fucking show. Uh, Jesus Christ, Rich Vos making fun of Keith Robinson fucking

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       what's his face? I think Norton of course, no one had the best line. He was talking about how funny Keith was. He goes, you should have had a stroke 15 years ago. He goes, I don't understand how Keith had a stroke. And he still talks. You still eat well, easier to understand than rich vos. Those are probably two of the best ones in a Voss. Had like this stupid fucking, they had like this Paisley shirt from like the early nineties like every drum instructional video that I bought from the early nineties where they didn't have those jazz guys who are such good musicians, you know, you get so good that your music sucks. After a while they were playing like that. I'm 94 seven the way, hey, that smooth jazz shit. You know, he had one of those shirts and then he had like a fucking Justin Timberlake does fucking bing Crosby, one of those fucking hipster hats that even hipster stop wearing those things like 10 years ago and it was blue on blue.

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       So we will backstage and you know, all of us fucking jaded people are going though rich. It looks good. No, you should wear it because he wasn't sure about it. And Pete Davidson, the kid, right? New kitties already on fucking SNL. That's how old I am. He's, he was actually telling rich going, you rich, you can't wear that. It looks terrible. And I was finally like, Pete, shut up the whole game is that we know it looks. Don't tell him that. And he just started laughing. Then he went along with it and I believe he took it off his head at the end, at the end of his set. We had such a great time and everybody fucking killed, um, right out of the gate we had Dan soda went up first after Voss and um, he went up there and absolutely just fucking murdered. It was like he'd, he'd been doing it theaters his whole life.

Speaker 1:          00:06:37       Keith Killed Pete Davidson destroyed, even though he did this whole bit about there's no excuse to go bald. That kind of bugged me. Um, in this day and age saying there was enough medicine out there as something like that, uh, that Jim Norton crushed. Then it was Dave Attell and then Leslie Jones and um, and then I had to mop up in the end after all those guys fucking killing man. It was awesome. And thank you. Of course, to Maureen Taren, who's the real force behind the whole thing. She puts the whole thing together. She gets all as add comics somehow to show up at the same place at the right time every year.

Speaker 3:          00:07:13       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       She deals with all the finances of, of renting out the place. She deals with the whole fucking thing. I'm so special thanks to her and let, once again everybody that that came out, everybody at the stand, you know, uh, Dave and Chris down at the stand for always hooking us up with the after party and all that shit. I'm just had a great fucking time and that's it. All right. Um, until we do it again next year.

Speaker 3:          00:07:40       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       It really is my, I gotta be honest. It's my favorite fucking Gig of the year. It's so much fucking fun cause I get none of these guys ever get to work with them now because they all headline now if I get to see him again, it's just such a fucking great time. Jim Florentine just came down to hang out. I'm trying to make sure I remember everybody, but it was, uh, it was great and I was in New York for a couple of days and um, had a great time. Like the first night, Monday night, I just went out and I started hitting all these clubs that I used to. Uh, you know, I used to work out in back in the day when I lived in New York. I went to Caroline's first

Speaker 3:          00:08:15       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       And uh, jumped on this show and um, you know, I was waiting to go on and as always, you know, he was always ended up seeing somebody funny comedian Carmen Lynch, who I've seen a bunch of times before, but I hadn't seen her in awhile. I'm not gonna tell you the bit, but she did some bit that was fucking hilarious. And I believe she's going to be on Stephen Colbert this Friday night and she told me she was going to be doing the bit, the bit's basically about, um, people that can sleep through anything. Um, so anyways, I went up and I have, I just go on stage and I do the shit that I'm working on and some older shit that I'm bringing back. Then I'm putting a new spin on and it was just wire to wire this perfect fucking, I was taping it. You know, I, I have a 0.2% chance that we'll actually go back and listen to it, but the fact that I'm recording it makes me feel good.

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       Right. And I was actually going to listen to it because I got these gigs coming up in Phoenix. Right. I gotta get my shit together and this set ads and for whatever fucking reason, I never touched the phone. It just shut off after like two minutes. I'm like, he gotta be fucking kidding me. So then I go up to the company. I still felt great, you know, and um, I was like, I'll remember, I'll remember this shit. So I got to the comic Strip, um, which was my home club when I first got to New York, way back in the day with Lucian, the, the late great Lucian hold. We would sit there and go sit there. You'd walk in and be like, Hey, ya'll Aleutian Elmo. But comedian, I just moved down from Boston and

Speaker 4:          00:09:50       yeah, I already have enough white guys.

Speaker 1:          00:09:54       He would literally say that

Speaker 4:          00:09:56       I already have enough white guys,

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       and I remember all these white guy comics would get so fucking mad. You'd be like, you see, you see, it's the same thing, just fucking reverse space. To me it's like, no, it isn't. It isn't. You know what the fuck he saying? He has a million of you. And if you're just going to be another fucking white guy that grew up in a fucking Culdesac, he already has it. It's like it's a grocery store. All right? And he's got, he's got fucking ears of corn stacked up to the fucking, you know, sealant and you come and you want to buy a Bushel. Now I don't, you gotta eat chickpeas. They're freckles. Right. So I knew what he meant when he said it. It's like, don't come in here and just be doing the, uh, what's the deal with shit. So I remember what he said that to me, I just was a little frustrated, but I just said to myself, I'll get in here.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       I'll get in here eventually. But, um, oh man, I remember there so many fucking white dude comics would get so mad at that. Um, you could never say that to another fucking group of people. It's like, yeah, but it's white on white so he can get away with it. You know what I mean? Like black people can say fucked up shit to each other. He can keep it in house. It's like your family. You can say whatever the fuck you want. You're still going to sit down for Thanksgiving together. You have to your family. You know what I mean? It's the same fucking thing. I remember exactly where I was. I just remember him smiling and nodding and he closed his eyes and I was like, oh my God, this guy is actually an open person. You know, I'd love to get a spot here and he's smiling, nodding. I'm like, here comes, maybe he's going to give me a phone number or something.

Speaker 4:          00:11:25       I already have an old white guys.

Speaker 1:          00:11:30       I was sitting there with my stupid backpack just walking away. We used to always use the reference of bill Bixby at the end of the hulk. You know, when he would just be walking down the road. That's sad. Piano music. That's how I left the club. But, um, I had my little positive fucking things that I would say to myself to, uh, to get me to, you know, to go over to the next club. Who the fuck was over at stand up New York back in the day. He was a good dude. And I remember he had a dead tooth, that's all I remember and I would, I would go in there

Speaker 3:          00:12:01       and um,

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       he didn't sugar coat it at all when I walked up to him. I remember telling him that I was a new comic and the, the look of fucking pain on his, he just sort of looked up like I was talking to the side of his head and he just looked up and he just made this, this face literally like he had a major operation than they were. This is the first time they were removing the bandages. That was the look on his face when I talked to them. I think I actually petered out through the sentence. I was like, Hey, uh, what is the name of hey, so and so, uh, my name is Bill Berber community, just moved down from New York and I just want it. Yup. And then I just fucking walked away.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       So all these years later to still be able to go back to New York and walking into these clubs and they still know who I am and they'll actually put me on stage. The thrill of that and the privilege of that is never fucking gone away. So anyway, so I go to, I go to, uh, the comic strip, you know, and now I'm feeling all cocky because I just had a great set. So I mean, all the years that I've done this, I never see the bomb coming after that, you know, I'm feeling all fucking good, but myself, I'm like, I'm going to go up, I'm going to do it. Just like I did it at Caroline's. It's going to come out perfectly. It's going to be fucking, you know, mint it into my brain and this is going to be a nice cornerstone to start this next fucking hour. Right. And of course I go in there, nobody's paying attention, small crowds, somebody ordering and, and, and I don't know what was going on.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       There was this giant group of people right in the front. And the, I think they just, I basically deduced that they all just had the ideal childhood and they couldn't relate to anything I was saying. And I basically had to start over after every single joke. And of course that was the, the show. One of my friends came out to see me and um, I didn't bomb, but it was like, I just, it was, you know, you know, those days were, and just nothing's going right. That's like what it was, except it was in a 15 minute set. You know, I tell a joke, it would work and then I try to build on that momentum and then someone would be ordering really loud and then I'd have to stop and then it start over. It was just a, it was just one thing after another. So I was like, Jesus Christ. So then I get in a cab, and this is a great thing about New York. You can do like a zillion spots jumped in a cab and I went down to the New New York comedy club.

Speaker 3:          00:14:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       You used to be run by Al Martin and they redid the whole fucking thing. And um, that was a place that I did not have any good memories of for the first fucking three years that I went there. Not Three years, but that, that place of all the places I went to, his hard as the Boston Comedy Club, the New York comedy club was the one that made me contemplate packing up my shit and going home. That fucking place was the land of the misfit toys fucking comedians. And that was one of those comedy clubs where you walked in and there was like a hundred head shots on the wall and none of not one picture was of anybody that made it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       I just remember thinking shit like that. The punchline in Atlanta used to be like the Jamie Bendel runs it, right? I used to say Jamie, for the love of fucking God, at least near when you walk on the stage, can you have some head shots here of people that actually were successful? They had like the head shot at every fucking comedian who ever tried to fucking make it and they left it up on the wall. I mean, some of them came turn out to be big time writers and producers, but you don't know that. You only know the performers. Um, to the New York Comedy Club was like that times like fucking 30. And I'm, Oh my God, that I have some brutal fucking sets in their brutal sets. That's the first place I saw Mike Machete. Um, and I, oh man, that that place. But anyway, so they did a whole face lift on that place.

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       And like, it was funny, like psychologically I went back to where I was when I first, um, was coming down in New York and I went in and I sort of recognize the place. It was still sort of the same floor plan and uh, it was a great club. They had, it was the lobby had happy, hopeful colors, painted on the walls and shit. And I went up and ended up having a great set there. Um, and then after that I went over to the stand and then after that I, I, I met up with [inaudible] and de Rosa and some other people. We hung out and uh, it was just, it was perfect. It was just like, I remember this, this is what fucking live in, in New York was aside from me being Chile, um, it was perfect. And then early in the day I found a place where I could play drums at some rehearsal spots.

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       So it was like, it was like the perfect fucking day. And then like an Asshole, I stayed out til like three, three 30 in the fucking morning drink and like an idiot, like a fucking idiot woke up the next day. I felt like shit I didn't eat for like the first 12 hours of the day. And then what do I have to start? I have a fucking burger and fries. I was trying to go my whole time, not getting a slice of pizza in New York cause I always do that because all the pits out here fucking sucks. Even the shit that's good sucks compared to a pizza on the east coast. And I finally gave in after the Patrice benefit and went to this place right next to the stand and I was like, I'm just going to get one slice. And then I walked in and I was like, oh that one looks good too. And then I got to burn the shit out of the fucking roof of my mouth. I remember sitting there just going to bill, just let them cool off. Just let them cool off. I'm like, well maybe I'll just, maybe I'll just take a little, you know when you try to go in like, you know you'd ever see like the runt of the litter trying to nurse off. The mom just Kinda Kinda Kinda go into, I was going in like that. I still burn the shit out of my mouth and kept fucking shoving it down my pile. So anyways, I could not have had a better fucking time. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       I gotta tell you man that, that Patrice benefit, like we definitely have our work cut out for us.

Speaker 3:          00:18:18       MMM. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       for next year. We already have a couple of people in mind that we're going to try to get to it, um, to get on the show next year. So there you go. So that's it. Can you tell him to type in my password? Cause the whole fuck, I just started talking like half a mile an hour and of course I didn't type it in right on. Sorry. The Mike sliding down my chest here. There we go. All right, let's move on here. Um, let me see here.

Speaker 3:          00:18:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:47       Oh, for God's sakes, I already lost. I was going to try to hide my youtube page. I mean know where the fucking link is anymore. Um, all right. Can I read a little bit of advertising here? Now that we're halfway through and after the advertising, I'm going to tell you, I called in a certain person's, um, radio. Should it today, radio show today or should a radio show today? I called him coach k and Dave syms basketball and beyond show that's going to be airing tonight.

Speaker 3:          00:19:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       February 23rd at 6:00 PM on a Sirius XM channel. 84, uh, the Sirius Xm college channel.

Speaker 3:          00:19:29       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       But you know what's funny, I can't even fucking listen to it because I was driving my Jaguar Jackie as I call it, drives my wife nuts. The Beautiful Jackie driving her down the street. I did a spot at the store. This is before I went to New York. It's been raining like crazy out here. And I was driving, turned down lassie and ago, and I'm cruising along. And then I just had, boom, out of nowhere it felt like I drove over something metal and immediately the dashboard lights up, check air pressure in the car and the front right tire and ended up pulling into the gas station down there. And I had a blown out the front fucking tire. I swear to got my Prius, could have taken that hit, you know, but now I got the fucking sexy tires on the fucking Jaguar and Oh my God. Adversity, right? Totally. Just fucking implodes.

Speaker 3:          00:20:20       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       So then I was like, all right, you know, I had the locking lugs on it and shit, and I'm like, off fuck did, did please tell me I got that thing in the glove box, which I did. I called AAA, you know, I got the spare out and everything and I was looking at the Jack and all that type of shit. And it's just, I was too afraid to, things I paid for AAA, so I'm going to have someone change the tire.

Speaker 3:          00:20:43       MMM [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:20:45       and then secondly, I was too afraid to, cause the car's low to the ground. I didn't want to stick it underneath the fucking car and God forbid if I fucking miss the a frame, you know, which I did a long time ago. Granted I was absolutely shit faced. I was with a friend of mine was the 80s, you know, we were drinking and driving and um, broad daylight. He gets a fucking flat and I went to Jack it up and I put the Jack underneath basically the floorboards and just put it right through. Um, so anyways, they ended up changing the tire and everything. So I had that awful spare tire and now my car is getting fixed. I took it over that cause I want to make sure I didn't fuck up this spit suspension cause I ran over the crater with my back right tire too.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       So, um, long story short, he came home that night. My wife fucking gave me the little emasculating shot. She's like, I can't believe you didn't do it yourself. And I was like, oh well, you know, I mean, I mean I could if I wanted to. I mean I have, you know, I got, I just, you know, I got AAA. So I mean, you know, back in the day I used to, uh, I used to change tires. You know, I, I, I'll never forget this. I started telling this story about I would change the tire on my fucking Ford Ranger on the driver's side, on the side of route one 28 at three in the morning and how I fucking jacked it up and I forgot to loosen the lug. So I had to bring it back down again to take it off. And, uh, and I realized the entire time I was telling her that it was because I was embarrassed that I felt like she questioned my man who had like, I was some pussy that I called Aaa.

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       But I do have to tell you this, I actually, um, even if I knew exactly what the fuck I was doing, all I had was that little right angle fucking, you know, thing to take the lugs off. And I just assumed that they had over torqued the fucking thing and then there was no way I was going to get that off unless I had another piece of pipe to get the leverage, which is what I learned back in the day with the old lady three Ford Range. Yeah. But the guy showed up, he goes, no, he goes, they tighten these by hand now, or at least to do with Jaguar. And he just took it off like butter. And I was just like, oh Jesus, maybe I could have done this. So now I'm obsessed with the fucking weird as Jack that's in the trunk of my car.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       I should probably know how to do that. You know, hey, you know what? Maybe my wife was right. Maybe I am a pussy. I Dunno.

You know about left, right?

Speaker 2:          00:25:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:14       It's the APP that gets you a ride in two minutes on demand 24 seven for less than the cost of a cab. Please include all of the following points during your read. Well, of course I'm going to you fucking put them here. Like is this saint don't skip any. Um, if you tried Lyft, you know what I mean? With Lyft, you can just download the APP request to driving and they show up in three and a half minutes on average. That's really fast. You just fucking said two minutes. They have to get you right. Oh, he said in minutes. Not two minutes. Sorry. My apologies to everybody who lived. Every Lyft driver is fully vetted through their 10 point safety standard, including criminal and DMV background checks. You'll know you'll get around quickly and safely, safely, unlike at that other one

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       that rhymes with boober. They don't give a shit as long as you have a face in a fucking car. Right. We need hands and feet basically, that if you have the basics of being a human being, they don't give a shit stand there with a bloody ax. He got a hatchback. All right? Lift drivers are rated after every ride. It's the only the best stick around. It's hilarious. I just picture people getting cut in August before the football season. I'm sorry man. I'm sure. I'm sure you'll catch up. You'll catch on over at Uber. Uh, you don't have to worry about getting into a filthy car with some creepy dude with Lyft. You can tip in the APP, which is obviously leads to drivers. I mean, nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating from the passengers. It's just a better all around experience. Plus there's a lot of people that are just too mean to not do that. You know what I mean? I think four is more legit than a five. You know what? I mean five is just like, hey, you know what I mean? You got me, they're good for you. I'll do your solid. Give you a five. You know what I mean? Five would you get a fucking hand job? Then he must've had the bucket seats, right?

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       It can reach back and give you a little fucking a little helper. What's with you tonight? You're so relaxed. I'll tell you I'm loving less. Um, bigger isn't always better. Lift isn't the biggest ride sharing app, but it's the fastest growing in highest rating. One, I'm talking quality over quantity. Thanks to lift. You got an easy way to avoid drunk driving. You never have to bum a ride. You never have to worry about parking. A lot of people are actually getting ride ARIDE getting rid of their car. Sorry. And relying on Lyft to get around. Are a lot of people doing that? What exactly is that number or percentage? That's a word I use in a fucking argument. Who said that? A lot of people, and you know what? I don't blame them. Evidentaly right now Lyft is offering our listeners a special deal. Get three free rides, up to $10 each.

Speaker 1:          00:28:06       That's up to a $30 value when you enter my Promo Code Bill Burr. Just download the free Lyft APP and enter Promo Code Bill Burr. In the payment section. You'll start with three free rides, up to $10 each sets up to a $30 value. If you can't do basic math, that's Promo Code Bill Burr. Enter Promo Code Bill Bar. By the way, you know, in the middle of that, I know I did suggest a man reaching back, giving another man a hand job. That's not a gay act when you're paying for a ride, okay? If that's just a friend who is, even if you're in the back seat, that would be a homosexual act, but it's, you know, look it up. If you look it up on a taxi drive back slash hand jobs, um, dot com you'll see that I'm actually telling the truth. All right? What do we get next to you?

Speaker 1:          00:34:57       And he would just stop halfway up the fucking stairs and he'd look over his shoulder like Bruce Lee and fucking, I mean, sorry Bruce Willis in die hard.

Speaker 5:          00:35:06       And he'd be, he'd be like, what did you say? I said, the, it's a fucking robot. But it's you. So you play both of them. So there's a chance you could win a fucking Oscar.

Speaker 1:          00:35:18       Alright, then he'd be right up fucking against the chain link fence, right his nose poking through one of the holes and you go to hand him the script and then he'd be like, I'm sorry you gotta go through the proper channels. It's just the way it works. Okay, so now you're on your way over to Scientology won't go and Cook Donk, Donk, Donk, donk, donk, donk, reg, you fucking polling a day, right?

Speaker 1:          00:36:01       Okay. I just, just take the fucking script, you know, with some big fucking place cause they got all that money. Be Echo and take the fucking scraps. Go. Great. You know, something like that. Look at that. I gave you a fucking idea for a movie. I told you who to sell it to. Oh, Shit. Calling into the podcast. Hey Paul Versey, you're on the Monday morning podcast. I got you on speaker. It's Thursday. Was it Thursday afternoon? Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. Monday morning podcast listeners. And yet, guess what Paula, just checking in on you. Oh Nice. Nice. How's it going out there? It's going great. Paul. I got to talk to coach k today.

Speaker 6:          00:36:40       I do. I felt fucking nuts, dude. Did you, did he say anything about that loss last night?

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       Uh, I asked him really quickly, I said, what's it like as a coach to, to lose a game on a last second bank in three point shot, like fucking 10 feet behind the arc. I go, does that kill you as a coach? And he said No. He said, no. You know what kills me is having six fast breaks in the first half and not, not getting any points on those. And it's classic. Afterwards I thought about it. It's just like, yeah, he doesn't sweat this stuff. He can't control, but it's the stuff that you can control that you should follow through on. So that they got people, there's a little teaser if you want to listen tonight on x, Sirius Xm channel 84 6:00 PM.

Speaker 6:          00:37:29       That's fucking awesome. Jelly. She didn't ask us something stupid. I would ask them something stupid. I would've been like, what was your like coaches acting like? The kids are bigger than him. I was like, you like coaching Christian later. Uh, that's so cool. Was He cool though? Like was he like talk?

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       He was totally cool. I am an idea of if I ever get him on the podcast, I know how I'm going to interview him, but that, that I'm not going to give away. I'm, I'll tell you afterwards, I got a great idea on how to interview him because I figured he's been asked the same thousand basketball questions a million times over and I, but my goal would be to do an interview and try to see, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:38:08       ask you I know it. Yeah, I know you're going to be like, so what do you think of cars start making no, right.

Speaker 1:          00:38:14       It'd be a little more involved in that. I wouldn't have a name. What do you think of cars? You'd be like, I don't know. I take one to the fucking venue. You idiot. I drive one. I drive one drive on all the time. Hey Dude, I gotta I gotta I gotta call you right back because I need to wrap this podcast up and then I got to go a be daddy daycare. All right. Hey Paul. That's exactly what I'm going to dope. Okay. It's a pleasure. It's always a pleasure, Paul, especially since we're across the country built know God bless you. God bless you and everything that is that you do. And Mr Bill, I'll see ya. Um, anyways, so there you go. Hey, look at that. The first fucking call and see I had the technology. Everybody tries to get these fucking DSL lines or whatever the fuck they are. Ups. Shit. All you do is you just put your iPhone on speaker. You hold it up to the mic. I think it gives it more of a quality sound.

Speaker 1:          00:39:04       You know, all these fucking shows. They try to make it sound like the person's in the room. They're not in the room. It calling me on his cell phone and God damn it, that's what it's going to sound like. Ball Ball, ball ball, golf. Um, all right, so there you go. Somebody fucking right. Then somebody write that movie and go make a bunch of, go make a bunch of money. Go loiter around an airport ceiling. You can fucking do that. Um, all right, I think that's it, right? Oh, so this is what I learned the second, third, third time I was on stage at the New York comedy club. I forgot to tell you. I'm fucking doing my set and now it's going great. I'm having a great set. By the way, I didn't have a good set at the comic strip and of course the recorded didn't shut off.

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       I'm having a great fucking set in New York and I looked down and Paul versus calling me, I'm like, oh, what the fuck? Then I go, wait a minute. I go, does the fucking recorder shut off? If somebody calls millennials, can you help me out? And they were all like, yes, it shuts off. And I go, does it come back on after the call? And somebody said, yes. Well, guess what? It doesn't, it shuts off. So all you comedians out there, if you tape in a set, if you fail in it, you know, you might want to reach over and fucking put it in airplane mode in case your mother calls, you know, then you've got to give a shit. You know? Thanks a lot. [inaudible] you ruined my new Dick joke. Um, all right, that's the podcast for this week,

Speaker 1:          00:40:29       not the podcast. Just me checking in on you. Enjoy the music. Now you've got another half hour. Has Shit coming your way. That's a, I dunno, it's, it's, it's some greatest hits stuff from a podcast from a, I don't know, time gone by. So when I say, and here's my youtube channel, by the way. Um, let's see here. It's youtube.com/user/monday morning podcast. And guess what? I'm going to start making fucking videos and I'm going to upload it. I finally, you know, I never videotaped the fucking podcast. I'm going to start making videos, putting in up there, starting when I go to Phoenix, I'm going to start doing the tours of the cities again. Um, I've got some other ideas of some shit that I can do,

Speaker 3:          00:41:13       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       To add to the channel and finally trying to build that stuff up. Um, so that's it. Once again, thank you to everybody who did the Patrice benefit, rich foss, Dan soder, Keith Robinson, Pete Davidson, Jim Norton, David, Tell Leslie Jones and Maureen Taren for putting the whole fucking thing together and, uh, thank you to everybody who came out. We will do it again next year and I think I already, who I'm gonna

Speaker 6:          00:41:34       reach out to to try to get on the show. That's it. Go fuck yourselves. That'd be great. And I'll talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 2:          00:42:31       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:42:31       hey, what's up man? It's built. It is the Monday morning podcast and I'm going to be multitasking this week. All right. And fucking heating up some pizza. And that's what I'm having for breakfast. And he's supposed to have it called like those douchebags on ESPN. Um, but I'm not gonna I'll for now I'm fucking hungry, so I'm going to have some pizza. Isn't that interesting? That website that you guys are all going on a fucking pity fuck.com. What's the name of that thing where you were, you, uh, celebrities go on there and they, uh, what the hell they do? You know, they type in a, you know, 1:48 PM just tied my left sneaker, isn't it? What the fuck is that? It begins with a t somebody sent me a, uh, an email the other day about that type of shit, you know, seeing it by wanting to join.

Speaker 6:          00:43:31       They're raw. They're their website about whatever that stuff is, you know, it would really help if I actually had the name of the website, which I don't, of course, which I don't. Um, but anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast. Does that make any sense? Does it ever make any sense? You know, I love about this podcast is it's fucking free, so you can never complain about it. Although people don't, people do bitch about the podcast and, uh, people take it seriously sometimes. It's amazing. I'll do like 50 minutes of shit say, and some of the most ignorant stuff you're probably gonna hear all day, if not the whole week. You know, if you hang out with really smart people and people, they send me emails, like really taking me. I got a lot of like condescending emails this week, uh, that were really just, I dunno, people aren't dumb.

Speaker 6:          00:44:22       I guess I'm really coming off like a moron, you know, which I openly admit that I am. And also that, you know, I'm just fucking joking around. Some people they day they, they take it real seriously. I'm really trying to fucking scroll down to this. I actually have, you know, which, uh, actually because of it has made me create a, a, a new part of the podcast. You know, at this point, if you're new to my podcast, what I do is I, uh, people send me questions every week. I try to answer them to the best of my ability. We have the overrated, underrated lists, people's lists of things in life. Either, I don't know, entertainers or a can, openers, whatever the fuck you want. Anything that you think is overrated, underrated, and a, I've got no movie reviews. That's something else. Somebody's got something else.

Speaker 6:          00:45:07       Here's the new thing. Douche bag of the week. All right. This guy sent me a, uh, an email last week. I was talking about nature out here and the seasons and the fires and all that type of shit. Just bullshitting, just trying to fill up 50 minutes, you know, trying to help somebody out, sitting in a cubicle or some fucking job that they don't want, that they're on their way out. And this fucking asshole decides to take me seriously, right? I says what? He writes, dear farmer bill, listening to you talk about nature soil in Los Angeles, Los Angeles is seasonal fires made me put your intelligence on the overrated list. Fires don't just happen. Are you banking your whole argument on the theory of spontaneous combustion? Some Douche flicks a lit cigarette out the window and there you go. Yeah, the trees and the foliage gets brown and dry out, but they don't just explode.

Speaker 6:          00:46:05       Do you actually think we should just let the fire burn? Can you believe this fucking guy? Like, I think trees just explode. Like I really think that they should just let the fucking hills burn and have people's houses burned down and that the, you know, they're rich people. So who gives a fuck? I mean, does the guy have any sort of concept that in comedy, if you just say something that's really fucking ridiculous and over the top of the shock of it, what the valley's bring a smile to somebody's face unless you take his fucking seriously. Jesus Christ. That's one of my favorite lines ever. Fires don't just happen. Really. I just thought they just happened. Trees don't just spontaneously combust. You know when it comes in and I'm saying, oh look at my piece has done. Oh that was fucking quick. You know what? I didn't stick it in the microwave.

Speaker 6:          00:47:00       I don't like the microwave because it's something Keith Richards said a fucking funny is that one time I read a quote where Keith Richards says, I don't use, I don't use cell phones cause you, you know, you might as well stick your head in a microphone, a microwave. And that kind of killed two pieces of technology for me, but I need my cell phone so I still use that. So I try not to use the fucking microwave. When you think about it, there's something just not right about it, you know? So I'm, I'm using the old thing. I use the fire in the stove that just happened, you know, it just so happened that when I put my pizza in there, that my stove, you know, spontaneously combusted Jesus fucking Christ people when you listen to these podcasts, no, that I don't read and know that when I really say something stupid that I'm just joking.

Speaker 6:          00:47:50       I'm just fucking around. You don't need to waste 10 minutes of your day trying to show me how fucking intelligent you are about how you understand how fires are started. I liked how he went with the hacky lit cigarette out the window or maybe he's just making fun of my intelligence there. No wait. He thought I thought things spontaneously combust. I don't fucking know. But he gets douche bag of the week. Okay. Alright. I don't mind when I do stand up on TV. If somebody, you know, sends me an email and says, you know, I just thought your comments about rescue dogs, but completely ridiculous. I wish abortion was retroactive. You know, this kind of shit up emails I've gotten. I understand that because those people are fans of mine. They don't know what it is that I do, but I figured if he listened to my podcast, you realize, did I say a lot of over the top stupid shit?

Speaker 6:          00:48:41       And I don't mean any of it. All right? So you don't really need to fucking send me emails. Just, you know, what I'm really trying to do is save your time. I'm actually thinking about you. Look at me being in the modern, Huh? Just like Mother Teresa was actually talking to this comedian yesterday, this Guy Doug Davidoff, who's fucking hilarious. If you ever get a chance to see him. Uh, he was talking some hell would keep came around and we talk about Mother Teresa and he said to me that evidently one of the times she was talking about poverty in the world and she said something to the effect of, uh, the worst poverty she's ever seen was I think in India. And the second worst was actually right here in America and was basically saying that, um, the poverty of the spirit in America is staggering. And you know, which really made me wish she was still alive so I could just slap that fucking none head right? Let non hat right off her fucking head.

Speaker 6:          00:49:44       I am so sick of fucking people trashing America, you know, acting like where they live is this fucking great place. Okay, now I haven't hit all the countries. All right, but I've been to Australia. I've been to Canada. This is pathetic. I've, I went to Ireland, did the same fucking people. They, they, they haven't figured out what life is all about. I went into fucking Ireland. It's a Wednesday night in the pub is packed with fucking people. Okay. Those, that's people's dads in there who should be at home tossing a machete lately or whatever the fuck they're supposed to do as a dad over there and they're fucking there. So if they really understood, you know, what makes you happy in life? Oh my God. Did my computer just fucking crash?

Speaker 6:          00:50:36       Oh fuck. This is the day that I've been dreading. This is the day that I, I kept putting off. I buy a laptop next month. I buy one next month. Don't do this to me baby. Come on. We've been through too much. Wow. Does anybody out there go to computers? My screen just went, it's sort of a blue black and all the typing is now in yellow. I can still read it. Oh, what do I do? I hold the power button down. We try to reboot it like fucking pizzas getting cold. This is just a cluster fuck whatever. I don't need the fucking questions. I'll just keep going. You know what I mean? Cause sometimes in life that's what you go home and get back to. Mother Theresa, you know what? I want to fucking cunt. You know what I mean? And I know that sacrilegious to say that shit, but you know, she did too much shit when everyone else was looking.

Speaker 6:          00:51:35       You know what I mean? That's why I never liked about her seven then don't they have that saying in the Bible? There's another book I never read. I tried to, it's just fucking, you know, it's like update the language already, you know? And these set it to thou. Alright. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I just, it's just really, I'm sick of fucking people acting like people in Canada are happier than people in America or people in England. Those miserable motherfuckers. They came to go to a soccer game without killing each other.

Speaker 6:          00:52:11       Fucking Mother Teresa. And she just, you know, did you sue big live spiritually Jesus Christ, just like take a fucking pie and throw it right in her face. I wish I was the one that interviewing her when she said that, you, you know what? Why don't you go fucking hang out with a leper so we can see how fucking great you are. Fucking what a downer. You mentioned she showed up at your party and just sitting there looking at everybody. Just judging everyone. How fucking holy she is. I went to where she ended up in the afterlife, you know, just holding herself out or what a great fucking person she was. I gotta tell you, man, I don't buy it.

Speaker 6:          00:52:57       I don't fucking buy it. Everybody's got something hanging out with lepers and I'm certain you can fucking trash America you and jump on that fucking bandwagon. Huh? What'd you go make somebody? Some cookies? Do what old women are supposed to be doing. All right. Took them making cookies with bill, with his grandma's hands playing in the background. Okay, and until then, shut in your face. This is what I like to do on my podcast. I like to trash dead saints. Is she a saint? She'll, she'll become a saint. That's what the fuck she was trying to do. You know what it really was? She was a psycho who couldn't fucking, she couldn't sustain a relationship. That's what it was. And she basically, you know, just being famous, which is what most Americans want, wasn't enough for her. She wanted to be fucking world famous. So she traveled all around the world.

Speaker 6:          00:53:52       Who Look at me, look at me. Oh, there's some kids stuck in a mud puddle. I'm pulling them out. I don't even care if my none gown gets dirty. That's how fucking holy I am. Wait, did you run out of tape? Did you run out of tape in the camera? Let me, let me pause and wait for you to film that. Put the kid back in the puddle spiritually fucking bankrupt. You know, for till I don't need you to fucking tell me that Mother Teresa. I know how fucked in the head I am. Okay. Sitting here acting like you're tapped into some sort of higher fucking power. He got a lot of fucking balls. A lot of fucking balls. All right. Now that I'm down to the crust on my pizza, let me see, um, see if I can reboot this fucking thing. You know what sucks? Is there so many fucking great eat questions this week. So many great fucking emails while this thing is not even responding. This is just flat lining.

Speaker 6:          00:54:49       You fucking cunt. Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me. Mayor comes, it's coming back up. I know there's a lot of religious people listening to this shit go while you just trashed mother Theresa. The fuck was that. Okay. Oh, here we go. See that now by the trees were so fucking holy. The way I just trashed her. My, my computer wouldn't rebooted or maybe she's just being the model again. She's up in heaven and she's going, no, it's okay. It's okay. Let us computer work. I don't need, I don't need you to fucking help Terry.

Speaker 6:          00:55:28       All right. I know I'm eating. This is fucking really rude, but you know, I have to carve up before I do. These podcasts are so fucking long at this point. Um, all right, whatever. Oh, here's one that someone actually sent me that I remember. You know, you know every week when I go on and on about how you should shop at mom and pop store, this girl brought this great fucking poem. She's like, you know what? I've tried to go into those mom and pop places and a lot of times I, you know, I can't, I can't even do this. I'm not going to paraphrase it because it's such a fucking great slam on what the hell. I said I don't want to ruin, I don't want to ruin it. All right? What can I talk to you guys about it? I wait for my fucking ancient computer to boot up.

Speaker 6:          00:56:11       Oh, here we go. Oh, this is getting exciting. Mac Os 10 that's my operating system. You're still using that man. I hit that and like the fourth grade. Yeah, you're still a loser. All right. What do you think about that? What do you fucking base your entire existence on your fucking operating system? You don't even have a camera on your computer now. I don't. Yeah, you jerk off on the Internet. Okay. And someone in the Pentagon watched it. So now you can never be president. What do you think about that? Because they have that clip and if you do become president, you got to do everything that they say, oh, we're going to take out a fucking video. Are you snapping at at 23 years of age? All right, come on. I really, you know, I don't how long I can sustain this false anger as I wait for this shit.

Speaker 6:          00:56:59       Have I seen any good movies? Oh, I was in Ogden, Utah, this, uh, this weekend and I want to thank everybody who came out to wise guys in Ogden, Utah. Um, I had a great time and it was one of the most beautiful, a beautiful cities I've ever been to in my life. Just unbelieve. I got up in the morning to go down and go do the radio and I'm literally driving down the highway on the entire left hand side as I guess the rocky mountains, but they're like, they're like right there and the sun is just coming up. It's on the other side of the mountain. So there's this orange glow outlining the top of the mountains, which have snow on them. And then below at the foot of the mountains is the city with the lights of the city. I look like a fucking postcard was unreal. Um, you know, see that. I appreciate it that Mother Teresa, how are you going to criticize that?

Speaker 6:          00:57:59       You shouldn't have been brought up in light of this city. The city is humans. It's dirty. It should've just talked about nature. Is that what she sounded like? Did she ever even talk or did you sit there looking sad and judging the fucking media who were filming her? She laid next to somebody with Lupus. Um, all right, here we go. Podcast questions. They can trashed Mother Teresa Long enough. I'm glad it did that. You know, I think it was long overdue. Okay. Um, all right. Eventually I'll get to that lady. I'll move. You know what? Why don't I just do the fucking questions here. All right. Oh, you know what? Here's one for you. I was fucking coming out at the airport in Ogden, Utah, which is brutal this time of year, by the way. Okay. And I want to show you guys that I, that I am not afraid of technology, which people start, I've really started to suggest because I'm so against those automated machines at the, uh, at the supermarkets.

Speaker 6:          00:58:55       But, um, I don't mind him at the airport. I'm not going to lie to you. I really don't. Especially when you're in ski season in Ogden fucking Utah and everybody in front of you is standing there with their fucking skis and an overnight bag. So, you know, when I saw him when I was there, as I take another bite of pizza rudely, hey, you know, why don't you go pay for a podcast? All right. Do you like about that? Go pay for a fucking podcast. I'm sure the host won't be eating. Don't get indignant with me. All right. I'm fucking hang up on you right now. I'll leave you alone in your cubicle then. What are you going to do? Huh? That's right. Back to the spreadsheet, isn't it? All right then you think about that anyways, sorry. Just had to give a shit as I finish that bite. Um, so I'm going through the airport in Ogden, Utah, big, long fucking line. All these ain't me personal. I cannot even begin to tell you how fucking white Utah is. It's, it's unreal. Like I was, you know, here like my black friends with, you know, telling Shit, you know, a couple times I've gone, you know, fuel them going back to APP. You know what? They've never said that. And I'm actually thinking of a Richard Pryor bit.

Speaker 6:          01:00:05       Anybody do that? Your dad was when a friend of mine, oh wait a minute with someone famous who said that Richard Pryor did that bit about like, you know, going back to Africa, how all of a sudden was all black people and it was beautiful and all this type of stuff. Like, you know, I was always going, I wonder what that thinks. Like, you know what? If you're white, go to Utah, you'll get that experience. It's fucking unbelievable. It's just, it's, it's awesome. It's just fucking wall the wall. Yet it just, you know, and you feel real safe. And then you realize half of them, her name, Luke and mark and John, all those biblical names, and then you're like, okay, I'm out of here. You don't. Then you guys give 10% of your income to the Mormon church. You don't ask those people like, who's the most famous Mormon?

Speaker 6:          01:00:43       Who's the most, you know, the top Mormon out there and somebody yells out to Steve Young, I thought that was fucking hilarious and entire relationship, relationship, entire religion. You know what I mean? You'd think that they would pick somebody who, I dunno, did some Mother Teresa Shit. And when they pick the fucking, uh, the stand in for Joe Montana got fucking annoys me. I don't like Steve Young eater. He went on and on about the Patriots fucking cheating. I love how they keep quiet. You know, people questioned the Patriots. Super Bowl victories because of that video tape thing, which I totally understand, but nobody's questioning the New York Yankees, they last two fucking world series victories. You know, when like three guys were on fucking roids remember Roger Clemens? How fucking roided up with that guy? He threw a ball through Mike Piazza is bat, the fucking bat end of it comes flying at him like 80 miles an hour.

Speaker 6:          01:01:36       He catches it bare handed and then throws it and he was like the hulk and people are these amped up for the game. He was wasted out of his fucking tree telling you one of these days I'm going to climb up on new Yankee stadium. I'm going to fucking erase those last two championships and then they'll only have 24. It'd be still 200 and ahead of the red sox. All right. Sorry, I'm just killing time here. All right. Uh Oh. Anyways, I'm going to the fucking airport. This is what they ended up. So there's this big long line of a bunch of Lawrence Welk looking white people. Everybody looks like they played like the trombone or some shit. Right? Um, and uh, so they got this thing on the side. If you want to bypass, this is the new thing that they have in airports. Okay. If you want to bypass the long lines and security, you know, if you're not flying first class, if you just some regular Joe who can't afford a first class fucking ticket and you don't want to stand in line, they got this great new piece of technology where all you gotta do is just get fingerprinted and have your retina scan and you can go right by everybody.

Speaker 6:          01:02:43       You know what I love about that and see this one lady in front of me is like, wow, is that how that's got? If that how I like that's great. That's great. You fucking idiot. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. And then everybody does it right? And then you stand in the fucking line again and what's it going to be? How it's going to be a little bit quicker and now they have your fucking finger prick your finger pointed like you've committed a felon, whatever. I, what are you gonna do are people people, they're just going to give into it and then I'll be the last guy not to give into it. And then you know what? I'll be standing in the old school line by myself. You know, then I'll be going quicker. Nah, that's not gonna work out. It's kind of like the easy pass. Everybody eventually got the fucking easy pass and then, and then like nine out of 10 lines and now all easy pass. And now I'm fucking sitting there with like nine guys and people don't get your fucking fingerprints taken to get on a Goddamn plane and get you fucking retina scan. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:03:41       Jesus fucking Christ. Well, if you're not doing anything wrong, I don't understand what the problem is. I'll see you in the FEMA camp. All right, question bill. Hey Bill. How difficult was it to tell people you wanted to become a comedian when you first started? Um, what were some of the reactions? For me it was like telling them you want it, you want it to be a superhero. Was it the same for you? I got to tell you something. I did not even a, I never told anybody anybody that I was going to be a comedian. Uh, I didn't tell anybody I was even doing it and I didn't let anybody even come and see me until I'd been doing it for well over a year. Like it's always amazed me, the people who have the fucking balls the first time they go on stage to do stand up setting yourself up for quite possibly one of the most humiliating things that could ever happen to you other than a fucking prison rape, which is basically to stand in front of a bunch of people and get booed off stage like their first time on stage. Like they, they would bring the entire office that the people that they work with to come down and see him. It's like how you, you, you, you can't see the possibilities. It's like dude, no, they didn't ever think like what if I fucking bomb and then I have to go back to work on Monday and look and no one's going to look me in the eye.

Speaker 6:          01:05:06       You actually gonna ruin all their weekends cause they're going to be sitting there worrying what the fuck they going to say to you on Monday when they come in. But to answer your question, um, yeah, it's, it's a very, uh, it's a very hard thing to do in a weird way. You know, it's sort of like a sort of like coming out telling the people you're gay I guess can be fucking sense. I'm just know you just kind of like, how am I going to tell my parents that, uh, you know, all that money was spent on college education and now I'm going to go on stage and talk about my Dick.

Speaker 6:          01:05:43       Um, yeah, it was very difficult, but I was, my parents were unbelievably supportive, thank God. And then maybe I think I in them within the first year, I told one of my close friends that I was doing it and I, but I did not, I didn't tell anybody else because I knew what they were. Were you going to come on the CEO? No, you're not doing that. You're not doing that because I bomb horrifically, you know, one out of every four times at this point and I, that's just too high a ratio. So yeah, I waited a good year. Um, and even then it was just a couple of people. So, oh, is that a good bite of pizza? This is really annoying. I'm sorry. I on with the quattro fromage mushy so I can have a, that'd be great. If I had a fucking heart attack right there in the middle of this podcast, would you guys even know who to call?

Speaker 6:          01:06:37       Would you help me out? You probably wouldn't. You'd probably save it and trying to put it on your website to be the first one comedian dies during free podcast. Wow. That'd be hilarious. And I die in the first person I see his mother Teresa. Just looking at me. I'm all right. Bill. Next question. Um, this is such a great question. Phil is my ex-girlfriend. The only that assumes a breakup is an opportunity to make a fucking pen pal. She writes once a month to let me know what's going on and ask how I'm doing. It's garbage. Who told this bitch that small talk via email starts when the fucking ends? The only note I wanted to see from this Twat is a suicide note.

Speaker 6:          01:07:26       Ah, God damn. At that fucking email me made me laugh when I read that. Read it late last night. You guys, I'm telling you everything, everybody stepping up their game here, the questions are getting better. You guys are learning how to write. It'll be out of a fucking job here. Um, oh dude, you, you don't have to answer the emails. Um, you sound like you're almost as angry as I am. So I'm going to try and go easy here and talk you off the ledge. Um, it's not a bad thing. I mean, that's kind of, seems like you had a good breakup. If she still wants to be friends with you and if you can kind of still be friends with them.

Speaker 6:          01:08:04       Um, and you always got to watch out with women. Now you've always got to watch out because you know, she might just be staying in contact with you so she can, you know, as she's asking how you're doing subtly, you know, push those buttons in your head that she still remembers the combination too. And you know, subtly let you know how good her life is going with the airline pilot that she's fucking now dating or something. You've got to watch out for that shit. But if she's just being cool, she sounds like a cool person who maybe every once in a while you could, uh, you know, maybe get a fucking hand job out of. All right, underrated. Um, van Halen is running with the devil. This is the same guy. Uh, he says underrated van Halen running with the devil. When I get my born again, brothers answering machine, I always screamed, Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 6:          01:08:52       Ansia goddamn phone. Then I sing running with the devil and laugh. Ah, Jesus. You know, there's not enough people like this guy in the world that's really fucking funny and I can't even read is overrated because he's trashing a comedian. I don't do that on here, but it was fucking hilarious. Um, see what I did there. I probably shouldn't even said that. Now you look and read it and I go fuck yourself. I'm not doing that. Might get involved in that biggie. Tupac Shit. All right. Uh, Bill, what's your best relationship? What, what was your best relationship? What was your worst? Jesus Christ. It was my best relationship. Um, probably the one I'm in now because we can have knock down, drag out fights and then the end will end up laughing occasionally. I would say that is the best one because when you're younger, you don't know how to be in a fucking relationship.

Speaker 6:          01:09:44       You know what I'm saying? You just sit there and yeah, yeah. You know, for me anyways, you let the other person walk all over you and in your head you're like, I don't want to fucking do that. But then you're like, oh, keep it happy or it won't fuck me. And then you just continue to lose ground. And um, I got mad. I had an argument the other day that it should have been recorded and transcribed and put into every men's magazine out. There was just one of those fucking arguments. You know, where your girlfriend is in a bad fucking mood and or whatever, thinks you did some shit and she's not thinking about the situation you're in. So she starts giving you shit. And you know, for the first few minutes I took it like, what do I do? [inaudible] typical moron guy before I finally flipped out.

Speaker 6:          01:10:32       I seem distant. Yeah, I'm in the middle of fucking nowhere. I mean you talk, perform for a fucking God damn rednecks out here. Okay. I got up at eight in the fucking morning driving along these fucking mountains. Yeah, I'm a little distance. Okay. Fuck is wrong with you. The fuck is wrong with you. Get leave me alone. Leave me alone. You're being a jerk. I'm watching the bill Maher show. Talk to you tomorrow and hung up on that was it and was it, um, you know what? I actually started to tell that argument and I just sort of fucking bailed on it cause that's still too personal. Um, all right Phil. I recently moved from Michigan to go to Grad school at Ucla. I like to see male, this is another fucking quiet one. Here we go. Um, so I recently moved from Michigan to go to Grad school at Ucla.

Speaker 6:          01:11:26       I haven't met one person that is worth my time in la. Everyone is so fucking fake. And thinks that I give a shit about how many calories they've eaten this week. I can't enjoy myself in the nice weather cause I carry these wonderful Midwestern man boobs around with me while even the people that work at Mcdonald's have their shirts off showing off their abs. Are there any cool places to go around La? This is such a great email because this is what it feels like when you first move out to la. Okay? You go with the usual criticism. Oh my god, everybody still plastic. Everybody's so fight. Everybody's so fake. But the reality is if you really read between the fucking lines, I didn't think you have to do with this email is when you move out here, you realize everybody is, you know, not everybody, but there's a lot of people who are in great fucking shape and you know you can be a fat fucking Michigan and not even realize it.

Speaker 6:          01:12:24       You know what I mean? Cause you just did the hurt. You're just a bunch of buffaloes walking across the plane. You don't know everybody's name, but then you get out there, you know, you get so fucking freaked when you first get there. You actually invent shit that didn't happen. You know, everyone thinks like give a shit about how many calories they've eaten this week. I love that line because obviously no one came up and said, do you know I've had only 1200 calories this week? It's just you start creating shit in your head. You know, and like the people in Mcdonald's are in such good shape that, you know, to make the point, you actually have to act like they took their shirts off, which I know obviously you're exaggerating for effect, unlike that Douche bag who sent me the fucking thing about the fires out here.

Speaker 6:          01:13:08       Um, relax dude. What's going to happen is you're going to join a gym. Okay? You're going to let go of that. You know, it's not minus 3000 degrees out. So, um, actually somehow not living a full life, relax. You join a gym, you get in better shape, you learn about nutrition and all of a sudden you start feeling better. And then one day it's January and it's fucking 70 degrees out and you, when your buddies calls from fucking back east and you dislike, you want to be like, dude, you know you don't have to live like that. You really don't. So there's plenty of cool places to go around Hollywood now if you want to, don't go. You know, if you're in Hollywood on fucking sunset, you might as well be in time square in New York City. So there's plenty of cool places to go to la in La, a lot of outdoor stuff.

Speaker 6:          01:13:56       You could literally take up surfing the fucking beaches. This shit, they got all these mountains around here where you can go hiking. You got all that outdoor stuff, we'll, we'll just melt away those man boobs. Not to mention they got a bunch of hot broads out here. Yeah, they're a little plastic fake down, but go down to like Hermosa beach. Then they're just gorgeous and they're not trying to be an actress and they got fucking tell me, just just go in and go down that. Okay. And you got out of the usual fucking Moron riff Raff. When you go down there on the beach. That's definitely the pitbull guys and the Douche bags with their motorcycles and stuff. But believe me, you know, I've seen Detroit so you really shouldn't be bitching. Um, I guess you wanted literally a list of cool places. Um, I don't know if you've noticed the way I dressed, I'm not exactly a trendsetter.

Speaker 6:          01:14:40       Um, and I know where there's some cool bars, but I'm not going to say them over my podcast because um, I don't need 11 of my 14 listeners showing up ruining me drowning my sorrows in my whiskey. Okay. All right, next one. Bill loved the podcast. Love you. Stand up. I decided to follow your lead in the self checkout crusade. I no longer use them anymore because you said because what you said makes sense to me. Jesus. Thank God I only got to some person. I'd like to offer you a deal though, since I've given up self checkout lanes that grocery stores, all I ask is that you look deeper into paying bills online. I've done it for years with no problems. I love it. I understand your concerns about it. So that's why I merely look, I say, merely look into what into it with your bank.

Speaker 6:          01:15:26       It's okay to be skeptical of technology, but don't be skeptical because it's technology. Have a great day. All right, well that was my point earlier. I'm not, you know, I'm not a hundred percent against technology. Obviously. I'm a big fan of penicillin loving the airplane. I'm not, I'm just like, my thing is I don't like technology where, you know, they're acting like it's making it easier and what they're really doing is getting a ridiculous amount of personal information on me that they can then use for God knows what, like fingerprinting me and scanning my retina at the fucking airport so I can get on a Goddamn plane, I think goes above and beyond. It goes above and beyond and I know it can easily be explained away by the fucking tour to emails. Then I'm going to get, you know, and they're all going to be of the same ilk of trusting the psychopaths at the top of the heap.

Speaker 6:          01:16:23       And I just don't, that's it. And as far as, uh, you know, paying your bills online. I mean, the only safety you have is that you, that a bunch of people do it and you're, you're stuck in you, you're in the middle of the herd, you know, but if you get to the outside of the hernia, that little fucking deer Olympian or that baby deer, okay, these, you know, I don't know. You can do it, do it if you want to do it. I'm just saying I don't fucking trust it. I'm not going to put my bank account numbers on. I was mainly talking about banking. I wasn't necessarily talking about paying bills, but even that shit, I just don't like doing it. You know? I don't like doing it. You can do it. Go for it. It's all for you. I don't know. I like the old school, you know, I take out my checkbook.

Speaker 6:          01:17:11       Nobody sees my account numbers. I put it in an envelope, some guy at the post office fucking when no one's looking and opens it up. Then he looks at it. Then he's got to do a whole bunch, you know? You know what? I'm saying I got to worry about, it's the people at the post office. I, you know something, I actually did a little research on this after buddy of mine who was a lawyer and I asked him, what is the number one way people get their identity stolen? And he said, uh, people stealing your mail. And uh, what did he move? Why did he put it Miss Miss, miss guided trust or something like that. Basically you try, you know, you're dating some chick and she fucking, you know, you know, you think that she's enjoying you as much as you're enjoying her and she's really just say, oh, whatever.

Speaker 6:          01:17:53       You know what I mean? Somebody at work, they leave your purse there or your Wallet Bill. We know what misguided trust means. You don't need to explain it. I'm sorry. So I, I, you know, I get worried about that type of stuff. And I also, you know, the thing about doing banking online is I realized that every account is insured up to 100 grand. And I've heard rumors that they're going to bump it up. Somebody sent me an email that they're going to push it up to two 50. But uh, I don't know about you guys, but the last five years looking at how insurance companies handle claims and bankers, those are like two of the most corrupt fucking people out there. Insurance companies and bankers. And I'm not putting my, uh, I'm not putting my faith in them, you know, I don't understand why people are still doing that.

Speaker 6:          01:18:36       Like I said before, I don't know. I'm a paranoid psychopaths and sometimes it hurts me in life, but a lot of times it helps me and I think this is going to help me. I'm not fucking banking online. You guys can do it. You want to pay your bills online, you can do it. I'm not doing that either. And I'm not getting my fucking, I'm not getting fingerprinted and my retina scan to get on a fucking airplane. I'm not doing that either. And I'm not going to the grocery store scan in my own fucking food and bag my own groceries under the guise that it's quicker and easier. It isn't. It's a lot easier for me to just stand there with my hands in my fucking pocket and have someone else do it for free.

Speaker 6:          01:19:14       All right. That's all I'm saying. So I'm sick of arguing this point. If you want to use the automated fucking grocery store thing, by all means go ahead and do it. If you want to back online, pay your bills, by all means, go ahead and do it. And if you want to get your fucking retina scan, it'd be fingerprinted. I'm not saying don't do this shit. I'm saying, I guess I do say don't do it, but I think I say, please don't, I, I don't know. Whatever you want to do it, go ahead and fucking do it. You know, just know that I'll be sitting there thinking that you're a moron. Okay? And if you can handle that, then that's a, that's a great, that's, you know, you'd be building yourself up spiritually. Why should you care what I think? All right. A long time ago I, uh, talked about what was the sweet spot in history?

Speaker 6:          01:19:56       You know what I mean? Like living in this country, like what was perfect, you know, I'm looking at, you know, some people who are really old, you know, if you're in your 80s or 90s, you still had to live the fucking depression, the dust bowl, all the wars. And I was trying to think what, what the sweet spot was. And I dunno, I was trying to think, you know, maybe if you just Miss World War II, so he had flat feet, you didn't have to go to Korea and then you were too old to Vietnam. I don't know. I look at a lot of it like, uh, like a cars and sports. So I want to be, I would want to be alive when sports weren't segregated, you know, so I could see the Lebrons and that type of shit. But I also want to live when the fucking cars with a shit.

Speaker 6:          01:20:45       And for me, that's the forties, 50s, and sixties. So, uh, I guess the, the first year I would have to sit through, you know, all white people playing all sports. But as long as I didn't know what black people look like playing sports, what I know that it sucked. You know what I mean? It's Kinda like when I first was a kid, I used to listen to Mitch Miller records. I didn't know any better. I didn't know led Zeppelin existed. And then I find out they stole their first two albums. Okay, we're going to get into that again. Built to shut the fuck up. All right, so this is, this person is basically weighing in what they think is the best period. Uh, the sweet spot where you could come up, come of age, live a good life, have a nice car, and not have to deal with these scary fucking times that we're living in right now.

Speaker 6:          01:21:29       Uh, hey bill, about six months ago you were talking about the sweet spot in America, blah, blah, blah, blah. I couldn't decide on when, um, or you couldn't, um, you said, well today I was watching dazed and confused. You know that movie there and I think it's, I think the sweet spot is a senior in high school in the 1970s when the meatball, Mike Lowell over the green monster sweet spot on the bat of American. Oh, I'm read that wrong of course, because I suck at reading. He said, I think, um, I think it's senior in the 1970s was the meatball Mike Lowell over the green monster sweet spot on the bat of American history. You're out of wars and all, all that, but all that bullshit. But it's before global warming, population crisis, crystal Meth, hyperinflation, steroids, and George Bush. Sure we don't, we wouldn't have toys like the Internet in the Ipod, but I'm 20 now and I'll gladly give up all the achievements to go back.

Speaker 6:          01:22:28       Uh, I just fucking lost where I was in this. I'm such a bad out loud reader. Uh, all the achievements to go back to the seventies rock and a mullet speeding around in a caprice, not giving a fuck unaware that fossil fuels are exhaustible smoking weed out of those Cheech and Chong Polak poorly rolled joints back when we'd wasn't laced with amphetamines and, and habit forming. Uh, well, I mean they did have a gas crisis in the early seventies, but uh, yeah, I know what you mean. That is a great fucking time. Yeah. Not wearing a condom. That's another great point. The morning after pills and penicillin have a nice day. [inaudible] guys, you guys, you guys are all making great points. This week is really well written. If I could just fucking read it. Um, I'd have to agree with that because then, you know what's else is great is if you came with New York in the 70s, if you were a senior in the 70s, you could also pick up a muscle car at that point, you know, be 10 years old.

Speaker 6:          01:23:24       You could probably get it for nothing. You know, because people didn't realize that fucking all these Goddamn nerds, we're gonna come around and ruin it. Bloody do restoration. Our original, it's got the original radio. Yeah. John, how you $70,000 and he, I say Hemi in there. You realize you haven't seen those fucking pillows. You know, I think those are bailing when to go for those as a bankrupt. Right. Doctor was some shit who can afford to fucking pay $150,000 for Goddamn Mustang. Well Megan, my guess anymore. Um, alright. Douche bag of the week. I already did this. Would you like to hear my snarky email back to him? Why? Yes. I actually do believe that trees just explode in fires. Only burned brown shit. I've never heard of this cigarette lit cigarette phenomenon that you speak of. Could you elaborate? That's what a, that was a tone I took with them.

Speaker 6:          01:24:19       God, I'm so stupid. Thank you for putting me in my place. It's amazing that you caught that. I recorded 50 minutes of ridiculous statements last week, none of which were meant to be taken seriously except for the part about the fires. I was by no means deliberately saying ignorant things in order to give someone a laugh. I truly believed every word of the fire state of the Union address. Thank God you let me know both the serious, serious, serious nature and the cause of fire. Fire's just don't happen. I've got to commit that to memory. I will make sure to detract my statements next week, which I didn't. I actually just created Douche bag or the week before. I know that person was just trying to be sarcastic back to me and I misread it. Maybe that's what it was. Um, all right and here's some information. Um, you know, I say a lot of shit that, you know, evidently I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I was just bitching about muscle cars being overpriced. I was talking about vintage guitars. You know, they have some fender strat with the Johnny Rotten snot on the fucking fretboard and it gets 50 grand now and this guy is saying your complained about the cost of ventures. Guitar guitars is largely unfounded. I'm going to stop right there sir, and let you know that most of my opinions are largely unfounded.

Speaker 6:          01:25:32       That should be the name of my next, next special, largely unfounded, especially specifically in the case of both uh, fender and Gibson, the two companies you cited in your rent, um, where the quality of the, their production line took a huge nosedive from the mid eighties up until the last two years or so. Switching to oversee workers for the bulk of their production using cheaper wood paint, electronics, overall craftsman, craftsman shifts, et Cetera, have all added to the embarrassingly low quality, most insured instruments on the market today. I'm definitely with you on muscle cars being overrated, but any Gibson and or fender model made before 1978 as well worth a decent chunk of change. Alright, great fucking points putting me in my place. Yeah, it's lot like it might, my thoughts on that away beyond largely unfounded. I really don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

Speaker 6:          01:26:27       The, I'm just equating it to like the housing market where if you bought a house 10 years ago, that was a great thing to do. But if you bought one fucking three years ago or an apartment like I did, you're a fucking moron. And when I'm saying right now is I think once everybody is aware that how much something is worth and that it's going to be, you know, worth a lot of money in the future, I really feel like nine times out of 10 once it's exposed like you want to be buying those guitars 2010 20 years ago when nobody realized no one really thought about how much they were going to be worth. Cause then you could get them for nothing. You know what I mean? But now you're paying top dollar. I mean you're paying 50 grand for offended fucking strat. I mean is it going to be what, 103 years?

Speaker 6:          01:27:17       I mean I don't, I don't know. I don't, I don't understand that. And it's kind of like houses, right? I bought mine, I bought an apartment at the peak of this shift. I bet it's not even worth two thirds of what the fuck I paid for it and now it's all coming down. That's all I'm saying. I think that's what I'm saying. Maybe I'm trying to wear him out of it because you told so totally fucking nailed me to the floor on that one. All right. You know what? I can't argue while you guys, at some point I have to admit, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm goddamn comedian. I just look at at a guitar and I'm like, yeah, it sounds good, but you know, it's fucking kind of scuffed up. You know, you'd think for fucking 50 grand it wouldn't be so scuffy it's all I'm saying.

Speaker 6:          01:28:01       I'm speaking of which, this is the last thing I'm going to say. And then I got to wrap up this podcast at 45 minutes is, uh, I went to a, I took a drive down the street the other day and I swear to God yesterday, Sunday out here in la, any three miles stretch, driving over to the highway, um, I saw 14 open houses. Um, I've never seen anything like this in my fucking life. And, uh, I don't know. And if for some reason you can also get, can somebody explain this to me? Why there's all these houses for sale. I understand why all the houses for sale, I get that. Okay. But what I don't understand is why you can also get a great deal on rent out here. I would think that all those people, obviously they're leaving their houses that would cause the rental, the amount of rental units to go down because people who are living in houses that they air quote owned would then be now looking to rent and then rents would be going up.

Speaker 6:          01:29:00       But it's the reverse out here. So the only thing I can guess is that people are leaving Los Angeles. They just saying fuck it. You know, I don't know. I don't fucking know. Is that, is it like that where you guys are at? Are there a bunch of open houses? I mean it did. So this guy told me, uh, yesterday was trying to say that they're out here. They're giving you first he fell, he found a place. They've given the first month for free. And you get in a fucking iPod. And I actually thought like, man, it's a great deal. I'm going to go do that. And I'm like, wait a minute, it's going to cost me twice that to fucking pack all my shit up and move. Why don't I just go buy an iPod and stay where I'm at? See that I'm not always a moron.

Speaker 6:          01:29:43       Right. All right. This was a really weird podcast. I understand that. But um, Oh, before I, before I a step away here from the phone and get on with my God damn day. Um, I want to let you guys know that the contest winners, the, uh, the birds are away. I send out the DVDs so I don't have to worry about being called at eight weeks. I've sent two out of three of them. One person, I'm still waiting for you to email me back and you know who you are. You're the guy who drove up to me when I was in Houston, Texas outside the bar freaked me out and handed your prostate exam manuscript. I still need your, uh, your address so I can send you a DVD. All right. And, uh, and that's basically it. And, uh, what am I going on this week, this week, uh, for all you people in Loc Hong delays. I am going to be doing a benefit down at the comedy store tomorrow night, Tuesday, February, uh, 24th, I think. I got the flyer right here on my desk and when I got here, wait, no, wait, it's on the 26th. See that? Almost typed the wrong date. I'm a fuck wait a minute then I canceled that. Another gig I could have done the other gig.

Speaker 6:          01:30:57       All right. February 26th, I'm going to be at the comedy store and it's a benefit for world hunger. It's going to be me, Kevin Nealon, Jeff Richards, and a bunch of other hilarious fucking people. They're like, I build myself first there, the EGOMANIAC than I am. But when I say Kevin Nealon first, he's actually famous in his own. That great, great. Show the weeds. I just fucking Bang my head on this. Goddamn, I got this room in my fucking apartment where you're supposed to have like, they have this, this, this goddamn iron chandelier. All right. That's hanging from the ceiling and I don't know what it is. I'm about five pen and this thing hits me right in the center of my forehead. So it's probably hanging about five foot eight. I, I'm supposed to have a table underneath it and I'm supposed to sit at either end of it, you know, I guess can you please pass the peas?

Speaker 6:          01:31:46       But I don't, I use this as a fucking room. I got my desk up against the wall. So now I have this fucking light fucking three days. I Bang my forehead on it and have a like super fly snooker. Alright. Um, that really hurt. And it's one of those ones where you hit your head so high, hard that like only one of you have your eyes starts tearing up your teeth. Fucking slammed together. Okay. Regrouping. Anyways, I want to thank everybody for coming out to my show out in Ogden, Utah. I know I called you a bunch of rednecks or whatever, but I had a great time out there and I will definitely be back cause it's an awesome club. Wise guys is a great club and the fans were great out there and it's only a fucking two hour flight. So that is just game set and match.

Speaker 6:          01:32:30       I will definitely be there and uh, for all you people who don't live in these areas, um, let's see, where the fuck am I going to be coming up?

Um, and I'm working on a couple of other things, possibly a San Francisco date, uh, one night or on a Monday night I'm working on doing something like that and uh, and that's the deal.
