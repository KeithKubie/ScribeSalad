00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.330
ANA: My parents are both from
a very small town in Mexico.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.350
My dad finished sixth grade, and
my mom only finished up to

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.020
fourth grade because she had to
help out with the family.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.110
We started out in the South
Side of Chicago.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.560
That's where my parents bought
their first home when they

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.810
first came to this country.


00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.460
Growing up, it wasn't
a good education.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.380
My dad decided that he had had
enough, and he didn't want us

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.800
being raised in that atmosphere
with the school

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.660
being so overpopulated.


00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.630
He felt that we could get a
better education, so he moved

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.040
us up to Skokie, where,
immediately, we were placed

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.960
into advanced math and
reading classes.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.690
And for my parents, it
was a good change.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.650
It was worth the sacrifices.


00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.260
We're the first ones in our
family to go college, so it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.540
was a new experience for us.


00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.490
My counselor would show up
during my lunch period and

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.930
tell me that she couldn't just
let me not apply to an Ivy

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.150
League school.


00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.680
I should really thank her for
encouraging me so much to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.570
apply here, because I truly have
had four wonderful years.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.420
CESAR: I was right
there when Anna got her email

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.850
from Princeton.


00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.050
I picked her up and


00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.400
I was like, congrats.


00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.850
It just means so much to have
her go here, just to go to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.800
college, but have her come
here was just a blessing.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.130
ANA: I remember just looking at
that page and just saying,

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.300
congratulations, you're in.


00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.970
And just like, not
believing it.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.420
CESAR: We had the same
counselor, and she also

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.160
played a big role.


00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.920
She came up to me, and she was
like, you saw what happened

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.060
with your sister.


00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.400
You have nothing to lose.


00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.430
Just go for it.


00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.330
I was just ecstatic to see the
two orange tigers at the top

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.950
of the page, saying,
congratulations, and then my

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.750
financial aid award at the
bottom was just mind-blowing.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.800
JOSE: At first, I
never would have thought of

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.830
Princeton, and then my sister
got in, and then it became

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.060
more of an option.


00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.530
And then my brother got
in, and it wasn't an

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.600
option for me anymore.


00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.230
It was more like
an expectation.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.570
I started to think about how
my brother and sister were

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.340
here, and how I'm so close
to them, and it'd be

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.170
great to come here.


00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.330
ANA: I hang out with Jose
a little bit more.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.650
I'm used to working with him.


00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.280
We go down to the Forbes
dining hall and work at

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.340
night-- do homework together.


00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.370
JOSE: I knew coming
into college that I was going

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.740
to do some sort of engineering,
but I was still

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.910
undecided between civil
and mechanical.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.500
ANA: So I looked into
engineering--

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.470
chemical engineering--


00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.050
and for me, it really seemed
like the right choice.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.110
CESAR: I was actually
better at math and science

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.040
than I was at reading, just
because of English being a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.010
second language.


00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.400
ANA: My second home here has
been the dining hall.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.130
It has really played a huge
impact on my life.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.240
I started out as a worker,
moved up to a captain, a

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.730
student manager, and I'm
currently a coordinator.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.370
I like being a positive
influence on their lives, and

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.440
knowing that they can reach out
to me, and they will if

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.290
they need anything.


00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.620
JOSE: There's no other
place I imagine myself

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.100
going, other than
with my brother

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.100
and sister at Princeton.


00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.630
ANA: We had some
rough moments.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.470
My dad had five brain surgeries
my sophomore year,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.700
which was really hard on us.


00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.520
But more than that, my mom was
diagnosed with breast cancer

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.770
last January.


00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.790
I've done
a lot of what

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.130
I've done for my parents.


00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.140
And I know they will be very
proud of me, and I'll be very

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.490
proud of them for just allowing
me to get here and

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.400
making sure I got
to this point.
