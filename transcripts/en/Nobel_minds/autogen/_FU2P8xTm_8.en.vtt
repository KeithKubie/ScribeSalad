as we heard today there is evidence

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970
as we heard today there is evidence
 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.550
as we heard today there is evidence
which comes to bear on decision making

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560
which comes to bear on decision making
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.500
which comes to bear on decision making
and everything we do as a scientist but

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510
and everything we do as a scientist but
 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.630
and everything we do as a scientist but
also evidence must come to bear on

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640
also evidence must come to bear on
 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.860

very important is politicians are

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290

consequences for implementation over a
 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.460
consequences for implementation over a
much longer time period so how do you

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470
much longer time period so how do you
 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.160
much longer time period so how do you
actually communicate the possibilities

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170
actually communicate the possibilities
 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.740
actually communicate the possibilities
the range of decision making which

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750
the range of decision making which
 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.699
the range of decision making which
allows our elected representatives to

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709
allows our elected representatives to
 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.699
allows our elected representatives to
take decisions which are seen as being

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709
take decisions which are seen as being
 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.580
take decisions which are seen as being
valuable in the short term from a

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.069
valuable in the short term from a
political social economic point of view

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079
political social economic point of view
 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.740
political social economic point of view
but also have value in the long term in

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750
but also have value in the long term in
 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.460
but also have value in the long term in
terms of benefit to society and there is

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470
terms of benefit to society and there is
 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.229
terms of benefit to society and there is
a range of possibilities and therefore

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239
a range of possibilities and therefore
 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.869
a range of possibilities and therefore
communication with those who are elected

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.150
communication with those who are elected
is very critical to convey that range of

is very critical to convey that range of
 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.280
is very critical to convey that range of
possibilities yes we're gonna come back

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290
possibilities yes we're gonna come back
 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.319
