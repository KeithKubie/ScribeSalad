00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.520
So what this NSBundle.mainBundle is doing is that

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.540
it's returning the path to the directory where our app is located.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.330
And the string pathForResource is getting for

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.320
us the path of the folder where our mp3 file is.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.930
All right, so we're about to use this file path to play sound.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.880
Although, there is this one thing that is bothering me here.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.570
Which is, what if there is a problem getting this file path?

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.555
For instance, what happens if we mis-type the name of the file, or

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:28.940
its extension.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.170
To avoid such cases, it's good to include this declaration in an if statement.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.000
There.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.870
Now if you're unable to obtain this file path for

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.320
whatever reason, we can print out a helpful error message.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.420
Okay, so it's time to do step two in our pseudo code,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.010
which is to create an instance of AVAudioPlayer.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.140
To do this, I will click on the Help menu and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.170
then go to Documentation, and here, I can search for AVAudioPlayer.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.790
Now, I went through this documentation, and in here,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.990
I found a constructor that can help us make an instance of AVAudioPlayer.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.000
It takes in two arguments, one of which is called URL, which is of type NSURL.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.940
I think this is the URL to our mp3 file.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.610
Although NSURL seems new.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.350
Now, at this point,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.460
I'm starting to wonder if the file path in my code is also of this type.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.230
So I'm going to go back to my code and check.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.670
And here, if I look in the documentation for path for

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.110
resource, I can see that it's returning a string.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.100
And not an NSURL.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.410
So it seems that I have to convert the string to the type NSURL.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.020
And this is where you can help me.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.810
Can you run a Google search to figure out how to convert a string to NSURL?

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.200
Here are the details you will need one more time.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.460
Our code currently returns a string,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.300
although we need a NSURL to create an instance of AVAudioPlayer.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.350
Can you convert a string to NSURL?
