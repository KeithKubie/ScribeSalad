00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.790
PROFESSOR: OK, OK.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.150
The weekend is over.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.400
One announcement.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.130
Last weekly test will be
tomorrow, and it'll be based

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.690
on homework 11, focused
on polymers.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.900
And then the following week
is the very last week of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.780
semester, and there's no
testing, no work required of

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.350
you, when the subject
has a final exam.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.860
And this one has a big final
exam, big celebration, so

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.620
there will be no weekly
test next Tuesday.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.890
So this is the last one,
so get out the Kleenex.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.220
All right.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.300
So today we want to continue the
treatment of biochemistry.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
Last day we started looking at
proteins, and the building

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.530
blocks of proteins
are amino acids.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.370
And so we looked at the basic
structure of amino acids,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.530
shown here, which is an sp3
hybridized central carbon,

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.800
which I've designated
alpha carbon.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.290
And three of the four
bonds are the same

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.440
in every amino acid.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.700
Every amino acid has,
off the central

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.250
carbon, an amino group.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.560
This is the nitrogen
with two hydrogens.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.290
It has a hydrogen, a lone
hydrogen, and it has a

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.620
carboxylic acid, which
is this COOH.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.560
Double bond here, I'm looking at
four sticks off the carbon.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.100
One, two, three, four.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.300
And this proton here is the one
that can fall off and go

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.320
over to the side.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.200
And when it does so, then
we end up with the acid.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.470
It's a proton donor.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.260
And then the fourth bond
is this designated R.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.790
R is the substituent, and
it could be anything.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.650
We could put a cyanide
up there, if we want.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.810
Anything that conforms to this
architecture with whatever

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.390
choice of R is still qualified
as amino acid.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.660
There are only twenty
choices of R that

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.620
are found in protein.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.040
We also studied chirality,
which is handedness.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.360
Some of these amino acid
molecules are chiral.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.720
That is to say, if you put this
carboxylic acid in the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.970
lower left, and the amino group
in the lower right, you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.110
have molecules that are
seemingly identical, but not

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.100
superimposable.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.520
We call them chiral.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.900
And the two forms are
called enantiomers.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.020
And only the L-enantiomer
is found in proteins.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.370
And we saw that the L is
determined on the basis of

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.270
polarization rotation
of light in an

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.040
aqueous solution of this.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.120
Except for lycene.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.280
In the case of lycene,
we have H up here.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.880
So we have an H above
and an H below.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.610
That molecule is not chiral.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.310
So nineteen of the twenty amino
acids that we find in

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.960
proteins exhibit chirality.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.500
And later in the lecture we
started looking at aqueous

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.380
solution behavior of
the amino acids.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.070
And what happens is, when they
dissolve in aqueous solution,

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.780
they form zwitterions.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.030
Zwitterions by proton
transfer.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.680
So the proton goes off the
carboxylic acid and joins the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.920
amino end, so you have a plus
end and a minus end.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.880
And then we looked at what
happens with the behavior in

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.760
aqueous solution, and
we came up with the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.430
Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.770
And here it is, plotted.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.470
This is the case for alanine.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.730
In the case of alanine, we have
the methyl group here.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.830
So the R is CH3.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:35.950
Everything else is the same.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.100
So you can see that here's the
neutral zwitterion, where the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.410
H off of the carboxylic acid,
has transferred over

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.710
to the amino end.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.230
We have charge neutrality.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.810
The molecule started off net
neutral, and now the plus is

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.850
over here, conferring a positive
charge to this end,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.070
and leaving this end less
a positive charge,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.130
and therefore minus.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.770
So it's globally neutral, but
locally positive and negative.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.330
Hence the term zwitterion,
because it's essentially dual

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.730
gender, both positive
and negative.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.050
And we looked at the aqueous
solution behavior of the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.590
zwitterion, and we saw that
zwitterion is responsive to

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.170
its environment.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.390
And we reasoned that this is
how you start to impart

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.180
animation to something.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.530
How do you get something
animated?

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.250
You get something animated by
having it respond to its

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.060
environment.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.060
A rock sits there.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.060
You can talk to the rock,
nothing happens to the rock.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.960
But animated objects, if they're
endowed with hearing,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.880
if you talk to them, sometimes
they respond.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.000
So what's going on there?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.090
It to do with the ability
to respond chemically.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.130
And so what we saw
here is, when we

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.560
went into low pH regime--

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.350
low pH means very, very high
proton concentration.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.800
The zwitterion responds by the
le Chatelier principle to try

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.190
to minimize that acidity.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.870
So it gobbles up protons.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.160
And over here we see that
it gobbles up protons by

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.060
attaching to this carboxylic
acid end.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.670
That's a proton attachment
site.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.490
And in the extreme, all of the
zwitterions have been capped

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.340
by protons.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.750
So over here we have complete
protonation, and that's what

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.810
we're showing in this graph
here, which is just basically

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.370
the one that's up on the
screen, but I'm using

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.720
different-- see, this
is taken from one

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.200
of the biology readings.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.080
They say equivalence
of hydroxyl.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.490
There's no hydroxyl here.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.210
I don't know how these--

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.280
you know, the language of some
of these branches of

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.700
science puzzle me.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.660
That's equivalence
of hydroxyl, but

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.900
we don't have hydroxyl!

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.660
It's all about protons.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.830
So here it is, in terms of the
equivalence of H plus.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.370
So here's the neutral
zwitterion.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.000
That's this thing here.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.810
And this H, if it falls off, it
can then become the neutral

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:47.410
zwitterion.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:53.740
And then what happens is, as
we go to very, very low pH,

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.420
what happens is that
the zwitterion

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.920
starts attaching protons.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.270
So this is a neutral zwitterion
to which we've

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.240
attached the H.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.040
So it's much--

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.680
to me this is transparent.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.230
What this reads--

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.710
I don't know.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.770
Equivalence of OH?

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.700
There's no OH.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.945
That's a way of saying it's
fully protonated.

00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:10.820
BUt to me that's sort
of a backwards way.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.940
Don't tell me what it isn't.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.130
Tell me what it is.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.480
So this is fully protonated
over here.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.240
And as the pH rises, the
zwitterion feels less

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.360
compelled to gobble up the
protons, so it sheds protons.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.670
And finally the pH gets to a
point that's high enough that

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.900
the zwitterion plays no role,
and it exists as the neutral

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.900
zwitterion.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.230
That's the isoelectric point.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.830
We have a 100% concentration
of zwitterion.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.540
Then we go to the
other extreme.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.110
The other extreme is
the high pH regime,

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.150
where it's proton deficient.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.220
And so zwitterion
responds by--

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.670
what?

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.030
Throwing out hydroxyls?

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.850
No!

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.750
In spite of what's written here,
there are no hydroxyls.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.160
What zwitterion does, is it
tries to shed protons to

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.650
compensate for the proton
deficiency.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.320
And so some of the HAs become
just A minus, because the H's

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.730
are being liberated.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.700
And over here at the extreme,
all of the zwitterion has lost

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.280
its H here.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.990
And so now you have something
that's net negative.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.900
Over here you have something
that's net positive.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.840
In the center it's
net neutral.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.990
So this is the high pH regime,
low pH regime, and this is the

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.210
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation,
which answers the

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.370
question, what is the ratio of
neutral zwitterion to either

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.990
the deprotonated form or
the protonated form as

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.830
a function of pH?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.030
You tell me the pH, and I'll
tell you what the ratio is.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.510
Last thing that's really cool
about this, and shows you the

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:47.690
power of this mechanism of
attachment or detachment, is

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.110
as follows.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.900
Look at here.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.490
This is not exactly to scale,
but it's reasonable.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.910
You see the pK?

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.020
This is pK1.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.770
This is for the protonating
reaction.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.970
So over here I have neutral
zwitterion, over here I have

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.650
no neutral zwitterion, all
the zwitterions are fully

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.530
protonated.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.260
And in between, I've got--

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.390
this is supposed to be sort
of halfway across here.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.300
So this is 50-50.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.200
But look at what happens.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:26.910
For very, very large changes
in ratio of zwitterion to

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.780
protonated zwitterion, the pH
doesn't change that much.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.620
The pH changes a lot here, and
it changes a lot here.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.970
But over a vast expanse of
protonation or deprotonation,

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.540
the pH kind of hovers
around pK1.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.800
So the zwitterion is really
doing its job.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.610
It's trying to hold that
solution from shifting pH

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.590
dramatically.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:55.840
We say that zwitterion, by doing
so, acts as a buffer.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:03.110
A buffer holds pH
near constant.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.420
And the near constant value
it's going to hold

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.910
it to is its pK.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:14.050
So in the acidic regime, in the
very low pH regime, over a

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.830
broad range of protonation
deprotonation, it's going to

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.210
be roughly a pK1.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.760
And the same thing happens
over here.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.340
You see?

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:26.810
Over a broad range of A minus
to HA, the pH kind of holds

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.860
around pK2.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.690
And then finally, over here, the
system gives up and then

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.700
it shoots up to the
100% deprotonated.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:40.310
So that's the story there, and
you see the isoelectric point

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.000
in the middle.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.800
Now, so far all we've done is
we've said what happens when

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:52.410
we have a simple amino acid that
has just the one proton

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.020
attachment point on the
carboxylic acid

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.100
and the amino acid.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.170
But it can get more
complicated.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.730
And there is an example in the
homework that you might want

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.700
to look at before
the final exam.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.150
And that's the case where the R
group itself has the ability

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.390
to protonate or deprotonate.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:16.630
Suppose this R group had
a COOH ending here.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.450
Can you see that it could
also participate?

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.570
And so then the isoelectric
point isn't simply going to be

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.600
the average of the
pK1 and the pK2.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.560
Because now there's a pK for
this thing, as well.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.480
So this is the example
of the tritratable--

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.070
that's the term they use.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.950
If I could just spell it, I
could convey the information.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.930
Titratable R group.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.380
That's what they're
talking about.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.960
Otherwise, if the R group is a

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.420
neutral, it's just a spectator.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.510
Doesn't doesn't participate
any more than this.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.990
See, here's a hydrogen.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.450
Look at this one, people.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.650
You see this hydrogen?

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:55.860
It doesn't participate at all.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.060
Please don't tell me at some
point that the zwitterion

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.200
says, I'm out of hydrogens
from here, I'm out of

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.070
hydrogens for here, I'm going
to start shedding this.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.560
This is a really strong
covalent bond.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.495
It's not going anywhere.

00:11:06.495 --> 00:11:09.120
If you want titration, you've
got to put the titratable R

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.560
group up here.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.440
OK?

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.200
This is so cool.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.380
So now, I'm going to show you
an application of this stuff

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.540
that's used in biology.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.790
And I know, because one year
they gave a crash course for

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.820
engineering faculty in biology,
and we did we

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.100
actually did this experiment
in the lab.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.670
So I'm going to show you how
you can use the fact that

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.910
zwitterion changes in response
to its environment in the

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:36.490
laboratory.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.950
So what we're going to
do is I'm going to

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.820
make a column here.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:50.460
This is a column, and it's an
aqueous solution, a column of

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:56.120
varying pH.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.590
So it starts at the top, and
just for argument's sake, I'm

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.090
going to put high pH here at
the top, and low pH here.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.370
So it's an aqueous solution.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.160
You can say, wait a minute.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.170
He just taught us fixed laws.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.650
This is proton deficient
this is proton rich.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.780
Aren't the protons going to go
north and the hydroxyls are

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.830
going to go south?

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:14.600
Yes.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.740
So what are we going to do?

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.650
We are going to slow
down diffusion.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.110
We're going to change the
diffusion coefficient, and

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.340
what we're going to do is, we're
going to fill this with

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:30.590
a solid suspension and
turn it into a gel.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.190
So what's the function
of the gel?

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.570
Don't say that Professor
Sadoway said

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.000
that he stopped diffusion.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.420
Diffusion goes on, but it
goes on at a slow rate.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.730
So over the time duration of
the experiment, for all

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:48.100
intents and purposes, the pH
changes imperceptibly in

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.260
comparison to everything
else that's going on.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.530
It's all about time scales.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.010
You realize, we are all aging.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.590
We've been aging ever since
I started this lecture.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.440
But for all intents and
purposes, we can view

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.770
ourselves as being the
age we were when we

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.200
walked in the room.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.435
And even over the semester,
chances are.

00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:05.290
All right?

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.300
Now if we meet back here in ten
years' time, expect to see

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.910
some changes.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.460
Right?

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.590
But over the time scale of the
experiment, we can say we take

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:14.720
diffusion out.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.770
So that means the high pH is
here, the low pH is here.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.790
Now what I want to do, what is
it I'm trying to accomplish?

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:27.405
I want to separate an
amino acid mix.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.900
And just for grins and chuckles,
we're going to have

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.260
A1, A2, and A3.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.570
Three different amino acids.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.200
Which means just three of
these things, but three

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.570
different R values.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.470
I'm going to pour
them the top.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.090
I've got this aqueous
solution, got

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.790
all three amino acids.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.850
So what happens when
they fall in here?

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.310
When they fall in here, they
start diffusing, too.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.840
Right?

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.150
Well, first of all, they hit a
very, very high pH regime.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.500
So what what's the immediate
response to those amino acids

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.090
in a high pH regime?

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.230
They're all amino acids.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.960
They're all those rescuers.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.420
And they say, Hi, pH.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.450
It's proton deficient?

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:13.050
I can help!

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.410
And they all start
shedding protons.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.430
And so within moments,
all of those amino

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.040
acids have been totally--

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.070
as they say in California--

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.810
totally deprotonated.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.140
And here it is.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.210
So they're all sitting there,
in net negative.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.280
They're all sitting there in net
negative, right up here.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.280
But I just told you, I shut off
diffusion, slowed it down.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.460
But I want to get out of
here before dinner.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.450
So I don't want the protons
moving, but I do want the

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.870
amino acids to get moving.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.650
So what do I do?

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.340
I put on my elecrochemist's
hat, because as you know,

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.480
electrochemistry is the highest
form of chemistry, the

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.510
most noble form of chemistry.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.800
It happens to be the
area that work in.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:56.560
And so what we do is we
electrify the ends.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.550
And we'll polarize
the top negative

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.790
and the bottom positive.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.230
Well, I just poured in a bunch
of amino acids that became net

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.490
negative, and now they're next
to the negative electrode.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.650
So what happens?

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.660
Now they're in an electric
field, and they start moving.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.950
They start moving in the
electric field, and they're

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.370
all net negative.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.240
But what happens, is they
move down here.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.290
So this is medium pH.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:21.760
Can you see?

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.620
I've established the
pH gradient.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.650
And as they move from high pH
to medium pH, the proton

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.040
deficiency isn't as intense.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.220
So they're responding to
their environments.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.080
They're saying, you know, back
there I had to get rid of all

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.890
my protons.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:41.670
But now, it doesn't feel so
proton deficient, so I can

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.520
start taking protons on.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.040
They respond to their
environments.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.710
So here, they're
all A minuses.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.270
And if they ever get down here,

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.570
they'll all be HAA pluses.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.390
And so what are they in here?

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.850
They're sort of on their
way to becoming HAs.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.900
Because the pH is continuously
variable.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.050
So as they become less negative,
what happens to the

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.820
driving force by the
negative electrode?

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.880
It's weaker.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.800
So the protons were, first
of all, they're anions.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.650
They're net anions.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.420
They go, whoa!

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:15.775
Negative!

00:16:15.775 --> 00:16:18.370
And they start moving, and then
they get less and less

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.900
negative, and the field gets
weaker and weaker.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.340
And eventually, they take on
enough protons that they

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.330
become neutral zwitterions.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.030
And what is the response
of a neutral ion

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.400
in an electric field?

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.070
Nothing.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.060
It stops.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:48.520
And so let's say, this happens
to be the isoelectric point of

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.280
amino acid number 1.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.470
So it gets to the isoelectric
point, and it

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.370
doesn't move anymore.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.040
And number 2 and number 3 keep
going, and this might be the

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.580
PI of have number 2, and this
might be the PI of number 3.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.150
And now I want only amino acid
number 1 from this mix, I can

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.640
now go in-- this is a gel.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.630
It's put down on the
glass plate, or you

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.750
can put it in a column.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.070
Now you where they are.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.030
You come in--

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.980
because you've got a pH meter,
you know where this is.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:16.890
You know the PI.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.270
Bingo.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.480
That's where they are.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.440
And if I want number 2,
they're right here.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.360
And number 3, they're
right here.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.734
So this process is called
gel electrophoresis.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.460
This is the term.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.570
It tells you nothing
about the process.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.960
It tells you how
to conduct it.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.180
You make a gel, and you
polarize the ends.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.150
Electrophoresis is simply
particles moving in an

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.800
electric field.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.470
You can paint a car this way.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.900
Obviously the car, when the
car is made of metal.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.080
If you have a fiberglass body,
you can't use electrophoresis.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.840
The car is made of metal, you
polarize the car, and the

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.910
paint, the paint has
got dipoles.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.030
And so the paint sticks
to the car.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.010
And then you lift it out, let it
drip, and then just get the

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.610
right amount of paint
proportional to the charge you

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.470
put on the car by
electrophoresis.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.320
What's that got to
do with this?

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.900
It doesn't talk about
the focusing here.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:20.860
So the mechanism here is called
isoelectric focusing.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.880
So isoelectric focusing is the
principle by which we can

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.670
separate the amino acids
from one another.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:32.160
The gel electrophoresis column
is a device in which we do so.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.110
And let's be modern, so we'll
give it a three-letter

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.100
initialization.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.250
IEF, isoelectric focusing.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.950
Isn't that cool?

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.410
Yeah.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.210
I thought so.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.020
Anyway.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.090
OK.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:50.360
Everybody's still zoned out
from turkey or something.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.910
No response.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:53.660
This is brilliant.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.380
It's beautiful, and it
integrates all of this

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.540
material, and deadpan.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.110
All of this withholding love.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.310
You've been with your families,
I can tell.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.800
All of the old family
dynamic, see?

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.200
It's here.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.440
You brought it with you.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.090
Leave it!

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:08.250
Leave it at the airport.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.020
OK.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:09.600
Now.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.530
So we've been talking about
the amino acids.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.960
We said we're going
to use these as

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.870
building blocks for proteins.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.900
Let's build some proteins now.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.150
So protein synthesis.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.020
So we're going to make
macromolecule.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:28.950
What are we making?

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.160
We're making a macromolecule.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.410
Protein is a macromolecule.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.240
You notice I didn't say polymer,
because a polymer

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.150
going to have--

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.550
every element along
the backbone is

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.300
going to be the same.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.620
But I'm telling you that we can
change the choice of R at

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.270
every station.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.630
So it's a macromolecule,
but it's not

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.650
necessarily a polymer.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.570
But we do know, if we're going
back a macromolecule, we've

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:50.540
got two choices.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.050
Addition or condensation
polymerization.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.940
So I look at the basic
structure--

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.000
let's put it back the way we
found it, so that people don't

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.190
leave thinking that we have
two carboxylic acids.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:07.480
So the most the most general
form doesn't have a titratable

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.700
R group, but it does
have an R up here.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.820
So I want to take one of these
and link it to another one.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.730
So how do I do it?

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.410
Well, right off the
bat, addition

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:18.660
polymerization is no good.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:24.040
Because even if I had enough
energy in my body to form a

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.880
radical, what could
I do with this?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.440
There are no double
bonds here!

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.580
There are no double
bonds here.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.060
I can't break a double bond and
then allow this to bond to

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.920
its neighbor.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.650
So axiomatically, I have
to go with condensation

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.050
polymerization.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:38.910
OK?

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:47.130
Macromolecule formation by
condensation reaction.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.500
I don't even want to say the
word polymerization.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.830
By condensation reaction.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.980
OK.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.290
So let's look at an
example here.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.110
An example will be this.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:02.400
I'm going to write,
here is the COO R.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.060
So I'm going to show this,
and then over here--

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.120
well, maybe I'd better show
some fine structure.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.640
I'll give you a little
more fine structure.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:17.090
So we'll put the double
bond up here, O minus.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:21.350
And then over here, I'm
going to put H3N plus.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.440
So here's the neutral
zwitterion, agreed?

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.780
And I've got some kind of
an R group up here.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.840
And I'm going to put next to
it a second one of these.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.270
So here's the alpha carbon,
and we'll go COO.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.610
And then over here, I'm going
to unpack this nitrogen.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.870
It's got one, two,
three hydrogens,

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:43.980
and it's net positive.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.060
So there's the neutral
zwitterion.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:52.170
So now by condensation reaction,
what we'll do is

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:56.320
we'll take this oxygen off of
the left amino acid, and we'll

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:02.920
take two of the hydrogens off
of this amino acid, and we

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.450
will eject a water molecule.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.330
We'll eject the water
molecule.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.590
And that's safe.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.880
It's compatible with the body.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.980
And now what's left?

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.830
This carbon is naked.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.040
One, two, three.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.700
There's a bond sitting here that
used to go to the oxygen.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.720
And this nitrogen, it's
sitting naked too.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.120
And so now we can do, is we can
make a link between this

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.170
carbon and this nitrogen.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:37.210
And this bond is called
the peptide bond.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.570
This is the peptide bond.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.750
OK?

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:45.910
And we see that the atomic mass
of the dipeptide is less

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.990
than the sum of the masses of
the individual components,

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.753
because we've lost the water.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.980
So I think I've got
some slides here.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.880
What's here?

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.060
Oh.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.160
This is just the various,
pK1 and pK2.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.970
And then this side chain here,
this is the value of the pK

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:11.900
should you have a titratable
R group.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.940
That's why there's the
third column here.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.980
So when you see this--

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.490
you see, they're all roughly
around two for the highly

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:24.520
acidic regime, and all around
high nines, low tens for the

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.330
alkaline regime.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.290
Roughly the same.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:29.800
All right.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.650
Now connotation polymerization.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.910
This is the formation
of nylons.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:38.940
You see how you bond this
mer to the adjacent mer?

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.460
Look at this.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.160
The nitrogen, that hydrogen
is sticking up.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.120
There's the nitrogen bonding
to the carbon.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.830
There's a long pair, and
nitrogen-carbon.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.630
Amide bond, peptide
bond, same thing.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:56.000
The same bond in the backbone
of nylon is the same bond in

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.640
the backbone of protein.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.330
Only, the biologists call this
the peptide bond, the polymer

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.250
scientists call this
the amide bond.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.990
Think about that when, you know,
the holidays are coming,

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.120
you think you're really special,
and you know, the

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.880
proteins in your body are really
bound the same way that

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.390
nylon is, you know?

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.720
All right.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.720
So now let's consider--

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.270
and here's some examples.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.830
Here's a peptide.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.020
So it's a long chain here.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.710
So it starts, here's the
amino group, H3N.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.290
It's got glycene, and then
leucine, and valine,

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.400
glutamine, et cetera.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.440
So there it goes, all the way
around, around, around,

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:36.750
around, around.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:37.910
And here's another one.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.810
There's the amino group, and
then, boom, boom, boom.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:40.940
What's happening here?

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.390
All of these click stops
along here are this.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.640
H2NCHCOOH.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.600
And the only thing that's
changing is the R group.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.910
If this were nylon, it
would be the same

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.340
thing, all the way down.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.600
That's how this differentiates
itself.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.090
All polymers are
macromolecules.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.100
All macromolecules
are not polymers.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.330
These are not polymers, but
they are macromolecules.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.180
And what else do you see here?

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.830
Look at this.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.750
Cysteine happens to have
a double bond.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.140
A residual double bond
in its R group.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.810
Well, where you see a double
bond, you go, I can break the

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.850
double bond, and then I can
make a another bond.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:20.710
And that's what happens.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.520
So we break the double bond with
the sulfur, and now we

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.240
make a disulfide linkage.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.120
What do you think the mechanical
properties of this

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.360
protein are?

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.880
Mechanically, what do you
think this one's like?

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.890
It's rubbery.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:38.200
This is an elastomer, because
you can move the top chain

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.250
vis-a-vis the bottom chain until
these disulfide linkages

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:42.690
are flattened.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:45.890
And then if you let it
go, it springs back.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.070
It's the mechanical properties
of, in this

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.320
case, this is insulin.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:58.540
Now I want to give you a sense
of the variety here.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.520
How much information--

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.210
because ultimately, it's all
about reproduction, right?

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.120
That's the number one function
of any living

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.940
organism, is to reproduce.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.280
That's what makes it life.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:11.720
Right?

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.650
So it needs an instruction
set.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.650
And the instruction set doesn't
come in the box.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.270
It comes inside the organism.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.490
And this is the language.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:20.950
This is all we have
to work with.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.710
So here's a simple example.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:27.320
This is, how many combinations
do you have of dipeptides?

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.050
So when you start with
two amino acids.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:34.070
So this is phenylalanine
and aspartic acid.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.830
So if I told you, you have
A and B, and how many AB

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.260
mixtures can you come up with?

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.670
You'd say, well, you've
got AA, you've got BB,

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:42.660
and you've got AB.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.300
You know, it's sort of
like calculus, right?

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.790
If you square A plus B,
you'd get A squared,

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.930
plus 2AB, plus B squared.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:56.060
But because of chirality, AB
is distinguishable from BA.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.240
This is cool.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.510
This is, again, math
serving us, instead

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.470
of we serving math.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:03.190
All right?

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.610
So A plus B squared
is A squared

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.710
plus 2AB plus B squared.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.270
But no, no, not in biology.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:16.340
Because AB is chiral,
and therefore

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.770
distinguishable from BA.

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.410
Now you understand chirality.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.730
So here's--

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.490
you get four.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:30.135
Because see, in this case,
phenylalanine peptide to

00:27:30.135 --> 00:27:33.490
aspartic acid is distinguishable
from the one

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.370
on the right.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.420
They're distinguishable.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.570
They're different.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.540
OK, so that let's
roll with that.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:51.500
Let's say, so if I start with
two amino acids, and I want to

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:59.540
make dipeptides, well,
that's trivial.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.590
That's 2 squared, is 4.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.830
So I got four different
dipeptides, starting with two

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:05.660
amino acids.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:12.330
Now, suppose I said, how many
different dipeptides can we

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.350
make, period?

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:16.960
Well, I know I've got a library
of 20 amino acids that

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.330
are found in proteins.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:23.290
So that means the number of
dipeptides would be then 20

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.380
squared, which is 400.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:31.880
But that's hardly
a macromolecule.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.570
So let's get into the
macromolecule business.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:39.060
So suppose I took a library of
twenty amino acids, and I

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:44.750
said, how many kilopeptides
could I make?

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.000
What's a kilopeptide?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.120
A kilopeptide is something
that's got 1000

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.670
peptide bonds in it.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:29:02.680
So that's going to be 20 to the
power of 1000, which is 10

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.590
to the power of 1300.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.480
And this is small.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.820
n equals 1000.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.790
I'm not stretching the point
by pulling something

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.100
exceptional out.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.980
A polymer, if it were polymer,
1000 units long, you'd say,

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.260
that's sort of fair to
middling length.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.050
I'm not pulling out the longest
polymer ever known.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.870
I didn't go to the Guinness
Book of Records for this.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:31.120
This is just plain vanilla
mer length.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.410
So look.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:35.270
How much information
can be contained?

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.910
That's in a single element.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:38.260
OK.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.410
So later on we're going to
return to this, and appreciate

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.560
how we can get to such
information density.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.990
And this I think I alluded
to on Wednesday.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:51.160
These are the three-letter
initializations, and I'll post

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.040
this at the website.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.530
So these are the airports that
correspond to the three-letter

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:55.960
initialization.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.850
Then I showed you the one-letter
abbreviation for

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.260
each of the peptides.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.160
You know, it's kind of strange,
because the amino

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.420
acids are what they are.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.070
And most airports, they're
not like the main ones.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.420
It's not like Boston
or New York.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.560
It's weird places like Australia
and Texas and stuff.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:14.820
You know?

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.070
So--

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.300
hey, you've got to have
a sense of humor!

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.910
Come on.

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:21.180
All right.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.700
And there's glutamic acid.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:28.270
There's no airport that has
GLU as its three-letter--

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.220
OK.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.300
So here we are.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.780
So now we want to do
is want to talk

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.030
about protein structure.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.030
And so we're going to look at
this as material scientists.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.610
We're not going to look at it
the way chemists, capital

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:41.340
C-chemists, do.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.590
And I think by looking at it
from a structure perspective,

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.200
you get some insights
into what we can

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.200
do with these things.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.450
So protein structure.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.660
And I'm going to use the
terminology that the

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.530
biologists use.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.600
So first of all, they have
something they call the

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.090
primary structure
of the protein.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.990
And it speaks to composition,
the composition.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.220
Well, what's the composition?

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.320
We know that every protein is
made of amino acids, and every

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.720
amino acid is virtually
identical,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.410
except for the R group.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.080
So when you say the composition,
you're really

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.660
saying, what is the
R sequence?

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:24.900
It's the amino acid sequence
down the backbone.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.350
Because you've polymerized
this thing, or

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.140
macromolecularized it.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:33.646
Amino acid sequence, which
along the backbone.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:43.370
Which is really the R groups.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.360
The sequence of R groups,
which is going to be the

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.930
sequence, OK?

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:47.310
All right.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.440
So here you can see.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.900
There's an amino
acid sequence.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.470
Number two is the--

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:54.490
these are really--

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.820
you know, like the polymer
people had conformality.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.050
You know, they had nice,
powerful words.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.100
The first order is the primary,
and then the second

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.110
one is the secondary.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:08.050
I'm trying to make fun of the
biologists, and you're sitting

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.900
there, you know, with that
same Thanksgiving

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.790
dinner table stoicism.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:14.050
OK.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.400
So what's the secondary?

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.560
The secondary structure of
proteins speaks to packing.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.930
And what's the gambit here?

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.780
Why do they pack in
different ways?

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.280
Well, just as we saw,
you can have a long

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.680
chain, straight chain.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.930
Sometimes things full
back on themselves.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.380
It's still a straight chain, but
there's a curve, a bend in

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.470
it, and so on.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:44.460
What proteins are going to do in
order to pack, is to try to

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.480
maximize hydrogen bonding.

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:53.070
And this is not even
between proteins.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:56.190
This is a protein forming
on itself.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.780
And you could argue, why do you
maximize hydrogen bonding?

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.640
Because when you make more bonds
per unit volume, you

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.160
decrease the energy
of a system.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.600
You've been taught that
over and over again.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.720
So these are long chain
molecules, but they still can

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.400
loop back on one another.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:16.360
And if you've got a choice of
forming a dipole-dipole

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.280
interaction, a induced
dipole-induced dipole

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.580
interaction, or a hydrogen bond,
which is going to give

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:27.510
you the most decrease
per unit bond?

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:28.460
It's hydrogen.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.680
So if you can form hydrogen
bonds, that gives you the most

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.380
impact per bond.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.210
If you don't have hydrogen
bonding capability, then you

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.160
go for dipole-dipole.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.290
And if you don't have
dipole-dipole, then it's just

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:43.640
the weak van der Waals, or
the London dispersion.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.280
So that's why this thing goes
for hydrogen bonding.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.930
Because it wants to.

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.410
It wants to decrease
the energy.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:52.230
So I have to show you
a few cartoons here.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.530
All right.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.520
So here's a sketch taken from
one of the readings.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.920
So there's alpha carbon.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.960
This is the carboxylic
acid, right here.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.860
And this is the peptide bond
between one carbon and a

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:08.880
nitrogen in an adjacent unit.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.460
All right?

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.050
So there's the peptide bond.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.690
The interesting thing is that
even though this is sp3

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:19.000
hybridized, data show that all
six atoms lie in a plane.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.930
So what happened last
time when we came

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:22.220
up with this conundrum?

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.630
sp3 hybridized, but the data
showed it all lies in a plane.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:27.030
That was benzene, remember?

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:30.040
And how do we skate with
the puck on benzene?

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.050
Resonance.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:35.370
We said it resonates between two
structures, and sometimes

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.480
the nitrogen lies
in the plane.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.540
Sometimes the alpha carbon
lies in the plane.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.860
But thanks to resonance,
all six of these

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.450
can lie in the plane.

00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:43.800
OK.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.960
So now how do we get to
hydrogen bonding?

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.558
So there's the resonance.

00:34:49.558 --> 00:34:49.976
All right.

00:34:49.976 --> 00:34:51.650
Good.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:54.030
So you see, this is free
to rotate, right?

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.300
Once we accept that these six
atoms line in a plane, and

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.680
these six atoms line in a plane,
and 109 degree angle is

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.020
fixed, but there's that degree
of rotation, which is what

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.400
gave us the original C17H36
folding back on itself, only

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.530
we're going to fold back on
ourselves in groups of six.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:13.850
So we've got a deck
of cards here.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:16.420
I've got six here, six
here, six here.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.510
So what am I going to do?

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:23.050
I'm going to try to make this
blue plane lie relative to the

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:27.910
yellow plane in such a way as to
maximize hydrogen bonding.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:31.720
Speaking of energy deficit,
we need battery.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.650
All right, here we go.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:33.870
So now we're going
to maximize.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:34.130
Look.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:38.780
You see, if I rotate this blue
plane in just the right way, I

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.440
can set up to have a hydrogen
bond form between this

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:47.550
hydrogen and this oxygen, and on
the orange plane, an oxygen

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:48.850
and a hydrogen.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.680
So now it becomes a matter
of figuring out,

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.890
what are these angles?

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:54.790
You see, there's a phi
and a psi here.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:58.350
What are the angles phi and
psi to give the maximum

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:05.320
hydrogen bonding between these
two six-packs of atoms?

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.720
And from that, you get
secondary structure.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.100
It's all about maximizing
hydrogen bonding.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.750
After that, if you understand
what I just

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.940
said, the rest is trivia.

00:36:16.755 --> 00:36:18.350
So here's what happens.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:19.860
Here's one structure.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:26.230
And this was first discovered,
if you like, revealed, by

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.890
Linus Pauling, 1951.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:33.070
Linus Pauling and Corey, 1951,
came with the realization that

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:39.620
if the protein spirals in a
helix, it will line up the

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.120
maximum number of
hydrogen-oxygen hydrogen

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.830
bonding opportunities, as
opposed to going straight.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:50.860
So it doesn't go perfectly
straight, it coils.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.030
And this is two different
cartoons trying to show.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:57.000
So you can see peptide bonds,
and then every so often you

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.070
get a hydrogen-oxyge bond.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:01.600
Because it spins around, and
the idea is, as the helix

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.020
forms, you can think of it as--
have you ever gone up a

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.390
spiral staircase?

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:09.400
And you think of each subsequent
turn of the spiral

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.060
as a new gallery.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.270
And what you've got is hydrogen

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.060
bonds between the galleries.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.385
So you're going up, and there's
a hydrogen bond here,

00:37:16.385 --> 00:37:18.480
and you keep turning, and
there's a hydrogen bond here,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.070
and there's a hydrogen
bond here.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.160
That's the way to get maximum
hydrogen bonding.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.700
There it is.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.100
There's another example.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.200
Maybe this is a nicer one.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.800
And there's 3.6 residues
per turn.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:36.850
That means, per turn is 3.6 R
groups, which, it's called

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:39.500
residues because historically,
when people did the chemical

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.740
analysis, the residue contained
the substituent.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.410
That's how they determined
what the identity of the

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:45.440
protein is.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.930
They can't just look at it.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.060
And you can't use
spectroscopy.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.890
Maybe now you can, but
in the old days--

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.290
I mean, these are all, look.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:52.880
Low mass.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.790
Hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.050
They're not distinguishable.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.810
They're all low-Z elements.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.630
So they had to do wet chemistry,
and they would

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.710
actually peel off the
R groups, which

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.690
were called the residuals.

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.270
And so 3.6 residuals
per turn give you

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.400
this alpha helix structure.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.590
there's a second structure
that works.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:15.020
The second structure is
between two chains.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.560
So in this case, instead of
going coiling by yourself, and

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.370
forming the galleries, what you
do is you take two chains

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:25.190
side by side, and you pace them
so that you get maximum

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.400
amount of hydrogen bonding.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.400
I showed you this with nylon,
how two strands

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.840
of nylon bond together.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.730
They can form hydrogen bonds.

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:34.920
Same thing here.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:41.200
And now, since these are jerking
in a motion of six in

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.570
a plane, six in a plane, six
in a plane, six in a plane,

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.730
what you end up with
is this pleating.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:48.520
It's hard to see here.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.980
Maybe if your eye can follow
along the top here.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.370
Here's sort of a cream-colored
one, orangey-cream, and it's

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.830
moving sort of southwest to
northeast. And here's one

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:01.020
that's sort of a grayish, and
it's moving from northwest to

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.350
southeast. And then
up, and then down.

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:05.570
And zig and then zag.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.340
And this is called the
pleated sheet.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.660
This is the beta form.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.985
The alpha form is the helix,
and the beta form is the

00:39:11.985 --> 00:39:12.860
pleated sheet.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.970
Same thing up here in a
different kind of model.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.930
Which I look at that and I go,
I don't get any information

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:20.310
from this thing at all.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.340
But they put it in the books.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:21.950
Who cares.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:24.010
This is where you learn
something, right here.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:27.400
Once you appreciate that those
six atoms have to be in a

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.000
plane, and how to maximize
hydrogen bonding.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.310
So let's put that down.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:34.560
This is all Linus Pauling.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.410
So secondary.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:44.090
So you know that six
atoms in plane,

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.690
which leads to resonance.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:51.310
And now, from there, you just
needs the genius of Linus

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.600
Pauling, and then you conclude
that to maximize hydrogen

00:39:54.600 --> 00:40:01.310
bonding, you form the alpha
helix with hydrogen bonding

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:02.560
between galleries.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:08.360
All right?

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.290
And then the second one is the
pleated sheet, or people just

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:13.145
call it the sheet.

00:40:13.145 --> 00:40:15.310
But to me, the sheet
means nothing!

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:17.470
It's the fact that
it's pleated.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:21.190
So I'm going to ignore
what the books say.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:25.700
Pleated, pleated sheet.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.010
OK.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:29.710
So this is hydrogen
bonds between

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:35.370
galleries of the same protein.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:41.230
Whereas this is hydrogen
bonding between

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.480
macromolecules.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.560
So if they're both pleated,
it's going to work.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:53.790
Or of course, that could be
folding back on itself.

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:55.690
Remember how I showed you the
first day the chain, how the

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.640
chain wanted to zig-zag,
to crystallize?

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.680
Do you think protein
is liable to fold?

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.250
You've heard of protein
folding?

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.480
Why does it fold?

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.430
Because it wants to maximize
hydrogen bonding!

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.040
And when it folds, it's not
going to maximize hydrogen

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.060
bonding unless it is in
the beta pleated sheet

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:12.680
arrangement.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.250
Otherwise, what's the
point of folding?

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:15.560
Because you can't
make the link.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.110
Because I'm the oxygen, the
hydrogen's way over there.

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:20.040
If that hydrogen were
right over here, we

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.290
could form the bond.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:25.530
And then the third
one is random.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.180
So let's take a look.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:34.160
I think I've got some
images here.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.870
Oh, here's another one,
showing the-- yeah.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.070
I'm trying to, I'm really
working hard.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.112
Here's six, here's six,
here's six, and

00:41:42.112 --> 00:41:44.060
there's the common carbon.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:44.720
OK?

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.990
And now you can see
the hydrogen

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:47.120
bonds forming between.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.080
So this could be one protein,
this could be another protein,

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.450
or this could be the same
protein that's folding back on

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:56.285
itself in a
pseudo-crystallization ploy.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.950
Yeah.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:01.240
All right.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.260
So if you look in the biology
literature, you'll see

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.120
drawings like this.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.340
You've seen these, huh?

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.310
You look at them and go, what
are they talking about?

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:09.310
Now you know!

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:11.630
This is the secondary
structure.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.510
Let's start over here
at the amino end.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.760
So you're moving along, and it's
just sort of random, and

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.510
now, all of a sudden, look.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:19.960
Round and round and round.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.240
What are you looking at?

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:26.090
For this run of length, it's
in the alpha helix form!

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.320
And then it kind of goes random
for a little bit, and

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.560
then it goes green.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.730
And this green area
is pleated sheet.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:35.720
So if the pleated sheet goes
this way, and then it goes

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.710
random, and then the pleated
sheet goes this way, what's

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.870
going to happen? there's going
to be hydrogen bonding here,

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.520
hydrogen bonding here, hydrogen
bonding here.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:46.100
And you know, how is it that
this thing decides, oh,

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.410
somewhere around
here, I think.

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:51.190
I think I'll just go into an
alpha helix arrangement.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:54.110
Why is it alpha helix here,
and not alpha helix here?

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.430
Because of the instant
choice of R groups!

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:06.190
The instant choice of R groups
will dictate whether it can

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.440
turn around.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.240
Because if you've got glycene
with its dinky little hydrogen

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.730
on one side, you're compact
and you can move around.

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.800
But some of these other pendant
groups are big, and

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.460
you can't just shove them
one into the other.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.530
They'll repel.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:23.820
They won't fit.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.490
So this dictates--

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:30.730
so in essence, the secondary
structure is set, the table is

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:32.690
set by the primary structure,
isn't it?

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:39.410
This is so cool.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:44.010
Then there's the tertiary
structure.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:47.340
Because random isn't, as they
say in California, it's not

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:48.800
totally random.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.800
There's some order to it.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.780
So let's look at the
order that comes.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.240
See this?

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.100
Look over here.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.200
You see up here?

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.450
This is supposed to
be random coil.

00:43:57.450 --> 00:43:59.290
But look at it.

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:01.230
It's kind of dentate
there, isn't it.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.530
See, it's sort of tooth-like.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:04.800
Do you think that the artist
just did that?

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.160
Why is it like that?

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.750
Because of the molecular
forces!

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:11.240
So let's think on it.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.600
Oh!

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.760
This is a little piece
from Guys and Dolls.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.940
1951.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.120
The same your Pauling
enunciated this.

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.010
I bet you think that when
people talk about the

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:27.300
chemistry between folks, that
it's a '60s phenomenon.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.230
You know, the hippies,
drug culture.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.665
No.

00:44:29.665 --> 00:44:30.850
It goes way back.

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:31.680
Goes to the '50s.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.900
Listen to this.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:38.460
This Sky Masterson, and he's
going to tell Sarah-- she's

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.440
the one that's the,
she plays the--

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.640
what do you call it--

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.550
she works at the Salvation
Army mission.

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.605
And he's a gambler, which in
those days was really, you

00:44:47.605 --> 00:44:48.370
know, like low-life.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:50.040
And he's flirting with her,
and she, of course, has

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.450
nothing to do with him,
and eventually, they

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:52.280
fall in love, of course.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:56.350
But anyway, so she's told him
how she's going to meet the

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:57.360
man of her life.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.210
And she's very linear.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:00.020
He's got all of these
characteristics, and

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:00.780
so on and so forth.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:01.920
Real linear.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.790
And this guy's a gambler, so
he's going to tell her how

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.685
he's going to find the
love of his life.

00:45:06.685 --> 00:45:07.130
[BEGIN FILM PLAYBACK]

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:09.310
Do you want to hear how a
gambler feels about the big

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:09.760
heart drop?

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.880
No!

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.550
Well, I'll tell you.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:16.050
Mine will come as a
surprise to me.

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:20.421
Mine, I leave to chance
and chemistry?

00:45:20.421 --> 00:45:21.420
Chemistry?

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.590
Yeah, chemistry.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:29.044
Suddenly I'll know when
my love comes along.

00:45:29.044 --> 00:45:29.536
I'll know--

00:45:29.536 --> 00:45:30.030
[END FILM PLAYBACK]

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.530
So there you have it.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:31.630
From 1951.

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:34.590
Chemistry, again, chemistry!

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.540
Chemistry is the central thing.

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:36.790
OK.

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:38.060
Now let's go forward.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:38.310
All right.

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:40.680
So now let's figure out why--

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.140
and now I want to answer the
question, why is this forming

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:45.670
a tooth-like structure?

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:46.680
Why?

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.880
There's a reason
for everything.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.300
All right.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.900
So here we are, moving along
a length of random coils.

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.570
So we're in zone three
here, random.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.520
But it's not completely
random.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.540
So this is the tertiary
structure, and it has to do

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:04.910
with interactions between
the R groups.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:07.760
So let's look at number
one, zone one here.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.270
We've got two cysteines,
and cysteine both

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:13.220
have sulfur in them.

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:17.750
It turns out that the sulfurs
can form a covalent bond here.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:20.410
This is between two
R groups along a

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.570
certain length of chain.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.840
And once that covalent bond
forms, this chain now can't

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.100
just go flopping any which
way, because it's

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.480
being held in place.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.350
It's like you put
a prop there.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:33.690
Over here, what do we
have in zone two?

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:39.760
We have one R group that's
got a hydroxyl.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.950
Another one's got an oxygen.

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:44.360
There's a hydrogen bond forming
between side groups.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.020
And in order to form that
hydrogen bond, can you see

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.310
that this coil is
actually bent?

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.040
You see, there's a kink here.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.340
This coil should be
much longer, if it

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.450
were straight, distended.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:59.050
But it's actually compressed
a little bit in order to

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:01.480
facilitate the formation
of this hydrogen bond.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.780
Which means now, this coil
will stay in this

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.290
configuration.

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:07.960
And then over here,
what do we have?

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.430
Here we have a substituent group
that's net positive,

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:12.750
here we have a substituent group
that's net negative, and

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.260
we have an electrostatic
force.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.130
This is coulombic.

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:18.340
This is plus attracts minus.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.970
And they form.

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.700
And over here, this is
very interesting.

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:24.490
What do we have here?

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:27.500
We have a whole bunch of R
groups that are all non-polar.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.110
And this thing's sitting
in an aqueous solution.

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:33.500
And what do you know about
non-polar groups in water?

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.230
They're hydrophobic!

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:37.830
So I've got this one
hydrophobic group

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:39.000
sticking out over here.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.140
It's just going to
have to take it.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.120
Because it's bound
to the backbone.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.360
But I've got another
one over here, and

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.700
the backbone is flexible.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.930
And I've got another
one over here.

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:53.220
Can you see that if the backbone
folds around, I can

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:58.100
collect all the hydrophobic
entities, and present to the

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:02.300
water the hydrophilic opposite
side of the backbone.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.300
Because if the R group here is
hydrophobic, look what's on

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.740
the other side.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:07.800
These guys.

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.610
So if I can take all of these
and cluster them, then I sort

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:12.960
of minimize the energy.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:16.380
Because that there is a
repulsive energy term, right?

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.700
The water doesn't like the
non-polar R group.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.390
So let's minimize their
contact, you know?

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:24.320
If you've got two siblings that
are fighting, you put

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.660
them at the other end
of the table.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.450
You don't sit them next
to one another.

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.390
So here's what you do.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.490
You cluster all of this
stuff, and that

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:34.780
causes big hairpin turn.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.555
So this is called hydrophobic
interactions.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:43.000
And that's the tertiary
structure.

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.150
So you see all of those.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:49.860
That's great.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.080
OK.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.560
I see we're getting close
to the witching hour.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.760
So maybe I'll teach you how to
do your laundry and send you

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.650
on your way.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:03.020
So this interaction I'm just
showing you right here is the

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:06.860
same thing that's happening
when you do your laundry.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:07.760
Now, what's a detergent?

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:12.490
A detergent is this long
molecule that's got-- you see

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:13.560
this zig-zag here?

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:14.720
That's the aliphatic.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.130
That's the hydrocarbons chain.

00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:18.380
And it is hydrophobic.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.710
The soil on your clothing is
usually some dirt, but it's

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.750
covered by some grease
and oil.

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:28.750
So if you just soak it in water,
the water can't get at

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.820
the grease and oil.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.280
So what you do, is you put these
molecules in that are

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:39.915
very long, and then they've got
this COO ending, right?

00:49:39.915 --> 00:49:41.350
And now what happens?

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:44.710
This can form hydrogen bonds
to the water, whereas these

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:50.100
long hydrophobic tails can bond
to the grease and oil.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.970
And then you put this in the
washing machine, and what's

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:53.620
the washing machine do?

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:55.610
Mechanically agitate.

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:58.540
So you've got these tails,
hydrophobic tails, stabbing

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:02.600
the grease and oil, bonded to
the water, shake the living

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.710
daylights out of this, and
release the grease and oil,

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:09.030
which then will release the
soil, rinse the whole thing,

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.330
and you've got clean clothing.

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.510
So it's the bonding here.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.020
What you've got is an
amphipathic molecule with a

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:21.360
hydrophobic tail and a
hydrophilic head that allows

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.870
you to do your laundry.

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:23.130
All right.

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:23.700
Get out of here.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.390
We'll see you on Wednesday.
