Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Do Do, do, do Cho motherfucking d a sub brother on the drive up here. I was thinking about all the busted ass holes that are in the hospital today from the Gay Pride Parade. Can you imagine how many guys went down there just to say I ended up getting fucked in the ass by the same time, Bro. Let me tell you something. That was one of the biggest turnouts my friend went and he said he had a fucking blast. One of my guerrilla buddies said he had a blast. Blast gay people. Great. And fucking New York all over. Everywhere. Everywhere they're celebrating, they can be free. But anybody who's got a problem with them, it's crazy. But on the dark side, let's talk about the facts here. A couple of confused little young white dudes went down there yesterday. Sure. I'll go have a drink. Oh yeah. Some guys who just wanted to be an ally.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       Ally to the gay folks. I just want you to know I'm not gay, but uh, I am your ally. Next thing you know, Chad's millionaire. What's up brother? That's what guys have to remember. Gay dudes are dudes. They're all same rules apply all same rules of scumbag Uri that apply to men apply to gay men. Yeah. There's like three types of gay is this gay guys that aren't interested? Yeah, there's gay guys or the semi interested and the gay guys that live the converge. It hurts my feelings as a 51 year old man that that's still a big deal that anyone cares at all. It really does. It does. It hurts my feelings because I thought that by the time I was at fucking middle aged 51 year old father that we'd be done with that people wouldn't care for the people who are gay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       Like I've all this shit to worry about of all the shit in the world to worry about you worrying about guys who like guys like what do you give a fuck? And they always go biblical. They always go biblical. Like it's always a, if God wanted the be in the Bible, all that is. That shit drives me crazy. Where I lived in my old house in North Hollywood, there was a gay couple across the street, two dudes. One was the pilot for a major airline and he was in the process and the other guy got fired from target for being a transgender. This goes back to 2010 and they had cats, you know, made dog. I talked to the guys about cats. There was an old guy down the block that would come home and talk to him. Like you can't talk them old white dudes like you can't talk to them.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       Can't encourage that in that neighborhood. I don't want to do more of those fucking assholes moving in. And I go, they're out here feeding fucking homeless cats. What's the plan? Right? So this day whenever I go to my old neighborhood and I see him outside of that pull over, I talked to him, say hello. It just too sweet. People trying to be fucking just being who they are. Trying to be. Who the fuck they are. I don't. We make jokes, hey, I make jokes and the whole thing. But at the end of the day, I learned the hard way. And I talked about on stage here at night, you were there when I said that my daughter invited me to a party, that she went to school with a kid and his parents should train agenda and I kind of weird. And

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       I went and on the way out, I looked at the kid, I seen 60 transgender people that could come from a community. And I saw this little kid smiling. I'm like, Oh, I'm adopted that kids are adopted. Look what they're doing for that kid that they're making them a life like, and I closed the door and I went in and like I said in the joke, I hugged the lead tranny just and now we're fucking tight. That's it. I eat the food. Yes. Yeah. It doesn't matter. It does matter. The only time it matters with me is with sports. Just stop with that. Just stop with that. And we're going to be fine with this. I look, there's some statistic, see if this is true, um, that someone sent me that out of the 14 states that allow, uh, high school kids to compete as the gender that they, they identify with rather than their biological gender.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       In those 14 states, transgender students are just dominating transgender male to female. They're just dominating, just winning everything. It's crazy. I know you have problems with the box. I have a problem between the sports, all of it. When, when it comes to like power sports, like I'm not sure they've done the work here. I don't like this idea that every trend, like they use the excuse of outliers and the outliers are there some like super athletes, right? Like you can get a regular girl who weighs 145 pounds or you can get, you know, a Ronda Rousey weighs 145 pounds. You know, there's like, there's extreme athletes that are people that are different, right? Like Serena Williams is clearly a different level of athlete than a regular person. Right. If regular girl who's like her weight, she's just superior. And I think that that is what you see with some of these transgender athletes that come over to become women.

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       They say, well they're no different than a, like an an Wolfe who was like a superior athlete. Female boxer. You ever see in Wolf knock girls out? No Dude Dude, she haymakers is chick with a right hand and say one of the most brutal one punch knock outs you've ever seen. Men or women, perfect technique. Boom. She has way lays this girl Tim Bell, she falls out cold and there's not a whole lot of women other than maybe Amanda noon has been. Amanda Nunez is doing it with them. Little gloves on. I wonder if she would be able to do it like that with those big gloves. I think she probably could cause she hits that God damn hard. But you know, you gotta judge each sport by, you know the, the like we see Pauline Manoj, she goes over to bare knuckle boxing. He doesn't do that well in comparison to say like if somebody's like, you know, like a really good high level striker with knockout power with the big gloves on.

Speaker 2:          00:05:48       Would you put like, if you put Deontay wilder and little gloves, I w I don't imagine anybody being able to take that. He's fucking people up at like a heavyweight with those big gloves. So it's a different thing, you know? So who the fuck knows? But the idea is the outlier, the outlier, like the, the, if you get one superior athlete and then you have them sort of commensurate with a transgender athlete, a good guy who was an athlete who became a woman that you know, in his thirties and they identify as it goes through the surgery. But how much benefit does he take of having testosterone flow through his body for 30 plus years? We really don't know. It doesn't mean you hate transgender people. It doesn't mean you don't love everyone. It doesn't mean you don't want everyone to live their life and be whoever they want to be with total freedom.

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       I don't think we have, we have males compete against males for a reason cause we feel like it's more fair. Even though it's not like it's not more fair if I'm playing basketball against Michael Jordan, that's not fair. He's better, he's better athlete. There's just people that are going to be way better than you no matter what you do. Like if I had trained all my life to be a better basketball player than Michael Jordan, it's not even physically possible. Right? So there's outliers in males, but when the outliers, when there's so many, you have to, when you see so many transgender athletes that are dominating and sports and then when you add combat sports, which is how I got involved in this, when a woman was doing that, who was a transgender woman, just not telling anybody and saying it was a medical issue. Like that's fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       We all, we know, we want to pretend that everyone's equal. You know, we want inclusiveness and we want peace. We want everyone to get along. We want in quality one gender equality. Okay, I get it. I see where you're going. But we also have to look at reality. The reality is there's this fucking giant physical differences. These transgender athletes are dominating against women who are born a woman. They have to be a woman their whole life. They never have 30 years of testosterone through the throne flowing through their veins. It's like doing steroids for 30 years and then stopping. It's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:08:01       That's what I think. You freaking me out. You know, I just smoked some reef. Me Too, man. How did you get me on this subject? I don't even know how the Fuck Oh, transgender people, but as human beings, I love them all. I love everybody. Dude. I, Eddie Izzard is one of my favorite guests of all time. He's so interesting. He's been transgender since 85 I believe. He said, um, prefers women likes women is not, not a gay fellow, just likes dressing up as a woman and a extremely intelligent, very interest. I fuck event special on me. There you go. 15 years ago was mind bock. Yeah. Say what you want to say. It was my, it was up there with the great specials because it had more of a one man show tone to it. Yeah, you didn't qualify that as a special, but when you look at it as a whole, it was a great fucking performance. He's a special person and a,

Speaker 3:          00:08:54       um,

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       you just happens to be transgender. That it kind of makes him even more interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:09:00       Big Mouse special people. I got to apologize to you for sound for me because I've always had this discrepancy. Last night I went out for a little while. I got home, I had a couple of numbers in me. I grabbed the fucking apple. I sat on a constant unwind and I put the TV on and in front of me was the blues brothers. Ooh. When was the last time I watched the blues brothers? I don't know. So the scene that opens up is them at the restaurant when he's trying to talk the Maitre d and the join the band and there's a family next to him, a husband or wife and three daughters. And the guy's telling them, I'm not going to join the band. So he goes, really, you're not going to join the band. He takes a bottle of champagne and he goes over to the table and he goes, so how much was that little goes,

Speaker 4:          00:09:50       I wasn't ready for that. I just lost it. Right? He's like, I said, [inaudible] goes, and the guy's like, what? And he goes, for the women, I want to pay you for the women. And the guys like, you know Sara, sir, he turns around, the guy comes over, breaks his balls again, he fucking turns over to the guy again. He goes so much further. Wife, wife, I remember this day, this is Claire. This is crazy. This is craziness. This would never have mouth full of food. And Dan Akroyd continues eating in that background. And Dan, we got to talk about Dannatt quick, cause he's been like a hemorrhoid. He's the silent, he don't make a bull and make guy's phenomenal. He's still around. And if you don't believe me, watch a movie named my girl and then watch this and then watch him. The fucking Liberace movie. He's outlasted everybody.

Speaker 4:          00:10:44       You know, he's a serious believer in you. LFOs well, what are you going to do with everything's got problems right here. Right here. When he threatens him right here. How much for the wife? Okay, look at the guy. Just joking. Just shit like it. Them Champagne and then watch fucking then Akroyd watch what he does. He goes, if you don't fucking, if you don't join the band, we will be in here every day for breakfast, lunch, and fucking dinner and watch it. Dan Akroyd does at this fancy restaurant, but Joe, it doesn't stop that. They get in the car. They drive off. Look at him, look at him. That's craziness. This is the last of real comedic. If you're going to get into comedy or you want to be, this is comedy one oh one they walk out, they get into a car. That black fucking car, this is nonstop.

Speaker 4:          00:11:35       Joe Rogan. There's not like a hug, like there's no swath. They get into a car, they get into traffic. The cop comes up to him, he goes, there's Nazis, the having parade, and he goes, the blue. She goes, Illinois and Nazis. I hate them more than anything. He looks at Ackroyd, they fucking pull over and they take the car and go right for the Nazis. The Nazis have to jump off the bridge. White people are clapping and shit that they knocked them off. Then they pull into a black neighborhood. Who's playing the fucking guitar? Your boy, John Lee Hooker down the middle of the street. Don't quit. Don't quit. Don't quit. Just playing the fucking guitar. Then after he sang the song, brothers fucking everywhere doing that business. John Lee Hooker, Belushi and Aykroyd, they just stare at them down. Then from there, they walk into a diner to get the fucking guitar play and it's a reap the Franklin and Aretha Franklin to get at the fucking ambush.

Speaker 4:          00:12:31       That led to midnight. I got to go to bed. I gotta get up at six 15 with the baby. I don't give a fuck. I'm watching this. Aretha Franklin goes off. They do a dance. The black dude leaves with a white guitar player. Then what the fuck would I go? A pawn shop with the fucking black piano player, Ray Charles. He's the pawn shop owner. He opens up the day. He's blind. He owns a punch shop. Look at him. He owns a points yet this doesn't stop. Wow. I had a fucking finally got to bed and then I felt bad about going to bed. They will never make a movie like this ever, ever again. Then they start dancing like it's Greece. This little dance. Let it go. Jail. This got dancing. I'm like, look at this like it is fucking Greece. Look at this. This will never happen again. Joe Rogan layer black people flipping in the air. This one, Calgary, I'm the cut. This will never happen again. These were these old shit. This the WHO direct. Isn't this part liberal? Look at these two. You take. Belushi gave a fuck. Wow. Look how free people were in movies. There was no superhero more later.

Speaker 5:          00:13:45       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:13:45       It costs millions to make this movie. Look at me. Look at, they're dancing it out that you know I forgot. Oh, goddamn fun. This movie, this movie is fun. And then the chick that died on the airplane. Oh, what's the chick that died on the airplane? That was a star wars chick that died on the airplane that was at Star Wars. The chick last year might be the best description of anybody ever. The reefer I had that killed the, what's that chicken down on the plane? She has sleep apnea. She was doing pills on the plane. Who? She played the actress and Star Wars. Carrie Fisher. Carrie Fisher is chasing him throughout the whole movie because he dumped her. Oh, that's right. Throwing missiles and grenades. Right. And then they go into the bar and they tell the fucking dude that they, the good old boys. Oh my God, this is don't stop.

Speaker 4:          00:14:29       Oh my God. Whoever wrote this directed this shot this. So this whole movie, they have the Nazis. A looking from John Candy is looking from with the state police. Wow. That's all Chicago. This is wild man. It's just what the folks who are just listening, she says the blues brothers, 1980 shake tail feather, seen four of nine on movie clips. How does that work with like a year? Are they allowed to show these? Yeah. They made a deal with them because this links also to the, if you want to watch it, you can pay right here to rent it and all that stuff. Oh, look at this stuff. It just means you fully support buying this movie. You're looking at me going, Joey, it's a Cami. Why they dead? Look at the, it just took a brilliance. They look at you, they're having a good time.

Speaker 4:          00:15:19       All of that. If they're not snorting blow, they're not doing anything. Okay. Now what's is this movie where he would walk off the set and just knock on people's door? One of those movies, Bro. This fucking nuts. When they would say, cut, you got, you know, 18 go sit down. Belushi was so fucked up in the night before. He would just wander off into a neighborhood. I'm not consuming these dong go you mind if I crash on your couch? Yeah, Bro. They had to go looking for them in neighborhoods and shit. He would just find people and ask to sleep on that couch. What duel could you knock on? Look, the blues brothers may have, John Belushi fell asleep in a stranger's house. Dan Akroyd proposed to Carrie's faces crazy like this was this caddy shack. You know when they shot caddy shack, they shot it in Florida. I hit one.

Speaker 4:          00:16:07       Paramount went down there and they fucking went nuts. They were like dog. They found everybody snorting coke. Rodney was throwing a party. They couldn't, you know, this is a different type of movie. These people having fun. That's a different stab and fun on that set. That's probably alcohol. The director's drinking, you know, he's keeping her bill. How many extras? We're dancing fucking hundreds. They're all in tune. And it was like everybody loved that movement. That's one of the rare movies with a musical scene that fucking everybody loved the Blues Brothers Right now the blues brothers started. I'm saying that live like that was a sketch, I guess. So Yak right. Wrote it. John Landis directed it. They covered it together. Ackroyd's crazy in the you LFOs he's like one of the main celebrities they pull up when people start talking about, uh, like UFO real believers. He's done like little clips where he narrates things, UFO shows and shit.

Speaker 4:          00:17:02       He fucking believes what didn't. They just released that. There's even more belief now about foes. I, yeah, it's fun. I don't know if it's real but a, it's fun. That's how I feel. Doug, I did a podcast with Jim Florentine and I explained to Jim Florentine that what people don't know is that Hudson county, New Jersey, northern New Jersey is the number one place in the country where they have the most UFO sightings. Really? Northern New Jersey. Look it up, Jeremy, if you've got a minute please. Not to be rude, but isn't that like near a couple of airports? No, it's closer to like you don't like when you live in New York City and then you look at the Hudson River, they say that people go on their balconies to drinking coffee, they talk on the phone and they'll see a little flying social go by. And I know for a fact that in 1976 little one, whatever the fuck they are, I know for a fact that in 1975 and 1976 you could check me out on this.

Speaker 4:          00:18:00       Are you a full Landon in Hudson County Park? I was a kid and the next day the feds locked off the park. That yellow tape. They had samples. Go look it up dog. They say you at fault. There's a, that's, you see that? That, that, that, that's called the north burglars where I'm from, that's called, I forget what it's called, but it was, so there was, it's a circular building. So they did so much coke in there in the 80s they called it the grind. That's the thing called it cause it was shaped like the stone edge. Stonehedge. I have a couple of friends that lived there. People that lived in that building have seen UFO for fucking years and if you go to youtube, there's an actual north Hudson Park UFO. They dug up, they even, they came out the Mar, there's a liquor store and the liquor store guy says, you seen the lights, you heard like the organ music that they play.

Speaker 4:          00:18:49       They landed, a couple of Martians got out and took samples and got back in the thing and took off. There's a youtube thing is a history channel special about it and I still remember being a young kid. Did you find anything Jeremy? Not Given that that was what's pop pop popping up, all that stuff about that building and oh yeah, no, no, no. It's anything that says a UFO landed that, that's the story I'm reading right now is what he's saying and witnesses, you know, it's not just one guy that says, oh no UFO. It's people who got knocked in the door and said, do you see anything, anything at 1110 at night? And I said, you know what? There were lights flashing outside. They contacted police departments to see if there was any, they went full to and the FBI came in, circled the park closed.

Speaker 4:          00:19:33       It was by the little league field and Hudson county, but it's, you know, like you'd think it was area 51 you think it was close with northern Las Vegas. The number one place to see you in foes is northern New Jersey. They even made a reference to it. The Sopranos when he said something and he goes, what are you talking about? Last week you said you were saying that you were following Hackensack because that's where they're at. Hackensack Monache throw those, you'll go to Monaca in New Jersey. A lot of ugly apples. A lot of people were big heads. The only good thing in New Jersey is fucking Segovia Spanish restaurant. It's been, this is 19 fucking [inaudible]. I Dunno, but that's the only good thing about Murdoch. I think those people in Munafiki had been abducted. They stuff and they put them back as big Heather motherfuckers. I did a Gig there a couple times.

Speaker 4:          00:20:22       Oh yeah. They used to be like a bar. There's a bar that did something. Pop Gonzo Gig. Yes. Outside the C club was it? Yeah, it's outside. No, no, no. I think Bob is more down the shore and stuff, but, well he had gigs all, he had gigs all over. Bob, how I met Bob was, he did a Gig in Romanos Italian restaurant in my hometown and my buddy's like, hey, aren't you a comedian? Let's take you up there. And we went up there and Bob was like, I don't know, you know, he said I'm known

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       and next to him Bob came up and I was like, no gotta put you out. Cause my friends threatened me. So Bob put me up and we become a friends ever since. That's awesome. I think I follow him on Facebook. We have a chat from time to time on Facebook, but yeah, for you UFO motherfuckers look into northern New Jersey. That's the fucking mother load of them. That's interesting. I had read that before but I kind of let you go. 51 51 UFO sightings in 2018 I as a, you get biased because the, the, the story is always some person in the woods and they get abducted. They say UFO and some strange town in the middle of nowhere. The aliens land of duck people. You always think about it being a rural thing, but if I was an alien, of course I'd go to New York City.

Speaker 2:          00:21:33       Of course I go to New Jersey. What the fuck? Why wouldn't you? You want to go see the craziest thing we have. You got like 7 million people stuffed together on a fucking tiny island and in comparison to the rest of the planet, if stuff's stacked on top of each other, awesome, amazing buildings in all these lights at times square. Look at all these people mulling around, traveling over these bridges to get to this one hub is one hive of humanity. Of course, if I was an alien, I would check that out. Why would I look at a barn? You know what I mean? They used to have a joke that w w the United States is the Tijuana. If outer spray by the space like that, like where are we doing this weekend? We're going to fucking, they'd come down when they're fucked up and they want to see a show that was the whole bed.

Speaker 2:          00:22:18       Is that, I think aliens come here when they're high. I did. They just get fucked up. They're like, come on, let's go. Let's go check out the monkeys. This go dude. Come on. What's up? Duck Duck. A couple of them have a good time. Let's go see those monkey people. I never saw a fucking UFO or I want to, I never have though. I want to see it Atlanta and I want to see one of those green dudes get out. Sorry. I thought I saw some shit when I was a kid, but as I got older I thought that was like a fighter jet or something. That's what that was like. There was something that of, it's a real sketchy memory. It's one of those memories that's like barely active, but I remember thinking for like a day or two when I was a little kid.

Speaker 2:          00:22:57       Maybe I saw UFL, but I think I was trying to convince myself of it. You know, I was bored, but I think it was a jet. I think it was something something fast and unusual. Have you ever seen one of those stealth bombers that looks like a fucking UFO? You're seeing one of those things in the sky? No. Yes. It looks like a star wars. When you go to like a, a blue angel fucking thing. Those plants know that those are like, I think those are f a teens. That's what I think it is. I think that's what that is. I flew in one of those. I had a bit about that too. Yeah. You gotta do you hold onto the hand. You gotta do it. You Hook. Either you either hold on to your handle. If you're steering the plane or you hold onto your straps.

Speaker 2:          00:23:38       If you're a pastor. I was a strong, I was in the pastor seats. I grabbed ahold of my straps and you have to go like go to school and you have to force blood in your brain. Stay awake. That's how much g force you're going through. It's insane for blood and your brain to stay awake. See that's, that's one of those stealth bombers. I saw one of those in the air over. Uh, I guess it's Edwards Air Force Base. Is that what the one it is? That's Edwards, the one that's out near Palmdale. I think that's it. Cause we used to film fear factor in Palmdale and we saw that they fly overhead like that. Look at that thing. Tell me that doesn't look like it's from another planet. When you're on the ground and you see that fly overhead, you're like, what the fuck is that?

Speaker 2:          00:24:22       So I think that's responsible for a bunch of the things that people saw. I think it's military craft. Can I should question that article. You pulled up to 51 sightings. What type of sightings do you look at? This fucking thing. What is consider this side? Well the thing is like you just see shit, but how do you know? What are you doing? You know, these are the sidings. Okay. But go back to that video, look at that thing. I mean come on. If you're just sitting on the ground, you saw that you're like their combat aliens are coming that does not look like it's from this world. That thing is madness, especially with those two guys next to him. God, it's fucking beautiful though. It's like what a amazing design. That thing flying through. It looks like something on a keyboard. You know? It looks like a symbol on a keyboard and it's just flying perfectly through the air.

Speaker 2:          00:25:12       That looks like the future. I mean that really does look like it's from another world. I would imagine like little blue dudes have black eyes talking to each other in that thing, but going through fucking wormholes and shit. I mean, that's what that thing looks like. And what's the, what's the thing that they're going to have a hundred years from now? Just imagine that. Just want to know what the, what the logistics is for it to be consumed. Oh, agenda. Eligible sighting. Legitimate siding should have been said. It just means that someone saw it. You know why you don't like if you're a lawyer, okay, and you see something and then you convince yourself that what you saw was something extraordinary and you need to have the feeling that you're looking at something from another world. But if it's just some drone or some military vehicle and then you look at it and then you convince yourself, then it becomes a bigger and bigger deal in your head.

Speaker 2:          00:26:06       That's a problem with people. It doesn't mean that everybody that sees something and seeing that, but people are kind of full of shit. Well, let's say you see, let's say there's a one 800 call Martian, right? I see a fucking thing. I call that one 800 call mark. Call. I'm washing. Okay. Whatever the fuck. Okay, 1-800-MARTIAN though the phone won't stop ringing. Okay. The phone won't stop ringing. It will never stop ringing. It'd be people talking to Martians. My concern is when do they consider it a credible? What does it take for it to be credible? For me for it to be credible, I got to see the motherfucker land get out. My a, my take usually military guys. Um, when, when you have a military fighter pilots, that's an extraordinary human. Those that's a, you know, if you can be one of those guys that flies one of those [inaudible] to, for them to trust you with that billion dollar fucking spaceship dude, you gotta be, uh, an exceptional human.

Speaker 2:          00:27:02       There's no room for someone who's full of Shit. You're going to be a top flight fighter pilot. You're going to fly around with gunfights in the sky because that's what they do. They have gun fights in the fucking sky. Those guys are exceptional human beings. So when they see something, that's when I listen for sure everybody else, I'm not that. Not that I wouldn't listen, but I don't know. You know, you might be crazy, but if someone then you might be crazy. Even if you're in the military, you might be crazy. If you're a fighter pilot, it's 100% possible fighter pilots and all those air force pilots that do test runs or whatever they, they see, they say that they see things, there's a bunch of signings. None of them. They a bunch of sightings is a bunch of sightings from these really credible guys.

Speaker 2:          00:27:44       What does it say? Fleet of UFOs followed us. Aircraft Navy pilot says May 29th call about these guys that are talking about these things. These aren't uh, guys with histories of embellishing things. There's a, I mean they have this whatever that is that radar, what are they looking at? Is that infrared? Like what, what is the, that screen that they're looking for? Does it say what kind of image it is? Cause it's like a weird look. It's not like a photograph, right? It's like a weird computer image because it's, um, it's, it's detecting it right with some piece of equipment. Right? Isn't it like tracking it on radar or something like that? I know what you're saying cause I feel like I've heard that description of it too. But this, this article just says it's a video of two aerial encounters, but that video doesn't look very clear.

Speaker 2:          00:28:32       Why isn't it clear? My phone does a better job in that shit and I'm very good cameras on those cameras. They have good candidates. I mean, they don't have good ones, but like in order to catch movement at that high speed up there, Yada, Yada, all that stuff. Oh, so it would require some exceptional gear, I think. And it could've also been at night. I don't know what time of day. It was so convenient, so convenient that they never have a clear picture that drives me fucking crazy. It drives me fucking crazy because if it is real, I am. I love, I want it to be real. Honestly. I really do. But when I look at it like, Oh God damn. So many people are so crazy and told me the people were so full of shit. You personally believe in soda. Why don't done, there's other galaxies out there. There has to be. Well, it definitely the galaxies, other civilizations, civilizations. Yeah. Some form somewhere. I live nine planets. It's gotta be, Dude, there was a song thing, but I don't know what I didn't, I'm not going to sit here and tell you what that called or whatever, but there has to be something at this point. You have to believe that the universe too big. It's just too big to discount and say nope or doubt it. Like that's so crazy to say this is because we haven't seen it yet. It's so big.

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       Okay. It's 40th caught. And what he said that though, tracking equipment radar and infrared cameras on his aircraft detected ufs both times. He was unable to capture them on his helmet camera. Okay, so maybe you couldn't look at it. Hmm. Get it in good vision or whatever or that's a good, excellent reason why I would imagine as fast as those goddamn things are going, it must be really hard to get a candidate to be able to constantly focus in and out. And that's interesting. He says that Luke Tyler and Ryan Grimes put heaves, graves', whatever, a squadron of UFO Fall, his navy strike group up and down the eastern coast of the U S for months. That's, I'm telling you that little fucking, I read something about the Hudson River that all those people that live across the Hudson River, whether on the Weehawken Edgewater side or the west side of Manhattan, those are where the people on their balconies see all that shit. Look at this shit. We did have issues with them and we went to the Middle East. Lieutenant Graves said, Ooh, imagine them following the war. Imagine if you were there were aliens and they came down to follow the war. So they see the war going on and they were how crazy. Afghanistan come down and they're checking it out.

Speaker 6:          00:30:58       Just to did go on the cynical side of this, they're not necessarily saying they are an alien ship, they're saying it's a UFO, so it's something they're not sure of. What if it's some sort of awesome drone that some Middle Eastern company has an they can just follow shit or fast or something?

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       Sure. That would be the more likely explanation. Right? Terrestrial would be more likely that someone has advanced shit. We know they have advanced shit. I mean we know they have incredible drones. You know what I mean? The stuff that they can do, they got a drone that green berets, the seals, you put razor blades on them and they slit your fucking throat when you're driving. Whoa. That's how good the technology is on those drones. Jesus Christ. I wouldn't be shocked if they can do all kinds of things. We can be standing there and they could take the drone to just come down fucking they put razor blades on them or some shit. Well you could totally see someone having a small drone, like a small thing, like the size of a cheeseburger that has poison in it and you just slamming into somebody. You could see, I could see that this though, what you're seeing when you're seeing stuff that's flying around the sky, most likely it's made by a person because people make stuff and people know how to make stuff that flies around in the sky.

Speaker 2:          00:32:18       But then when you get this shit like defies physics, like some of the things he's fighter pilots say that's when you got to go wait a minute. He, you see these extraordinary feats of traversing distances. Like they can get from one place to another place so fast. It looks like they disappear. This is something they all talk about. They all talk about insane speed at which these things can go. They can just change angles. They can just go and then take a tarred right angle turn and they can do stuff that nothing that we know how to make can do. That's where it gets to be like, whoa. Like nothing sounded like it's like, oh, that's like a fighter jet, but like really fast. You know what I'm saying? It's like an alien car. Oh, it's like a car, but it's way faster. Like you know it's an alien car, but this is not like anything that we make these fucking things.

Speaker 2:          00:33:08       They fly this way. They say flat like a, like a plate hovering over the ground or, but when they go to fly, when they go to take off, they flip up sideways and they have like the bottom of the spaceship is pointing towards where it wants to go and it does something to space and time. Make some sort of fucking magnetic gravity connection. Insert big spooky words, whatever, then no, they don't know how the fuck it does it. Right. This thing can go like insane distances and insanely small amounts of time. Then when they all report the same kind of behavior of these things, so many of these reports are like that. They're talking about this thing that goes insanely fast turns on its side. It looked like a tick tack. It looks like a saucer. It looks like they're trying to figure out what the fuck the shape is because it's moving so goddamn fast, but it's doing stuff that nothing we know how to make and do.

Speaker 2:          00:33:58       I thought, I don't know if it's from another planet, it might be from here, but it's exciting. It's exciting shit. I want it to be from another planet. That's what I want. Like unbiased. Like what my honest, what I would, I would love it. Just be completely honest. I would love it if it was aliens, but it was people. I'd be even more scared because, hey god damn, people can do that. People can do that and no one knew. Like some kid. If you can imagine a person who can make a spaceship that defies all of the rules that we know about travel, about air travel, they can make something that defies all that shit and somehow now they're keep the whole development and production of it a secret and then have this thing and take it off and no one knows how the fuck they did it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:47       That's almost more impressive than aliens because that's what these things are doing is so if these pilots are accurately reading what's happening and they're telling the truth, the thing that's remarkable is their stories are very consistent. There's a lot of very similar stories from different people that they're make a living flying super fast warships, you know, they see things, they know what the fuck they're looking at. They see something they don't know. They're like, what in the fuck is that? When they see something like that, that freaks me out. That's when it gets me, because when some fucking kids riding his bike to school and he looks up and he sees a UFO, okay, maybe it did happen. Maybe it did happen. Maybe the kids being a hundred percent honest or maybe he was bored. Maybe he was bored and decided to make up a store and, and stuck with

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       it. And then after a while telling it, maybe he believed in himself. That happens to people see things, they don't know what they're seeing and they decide that it's a different thing. I've said this before, but it's a true story. When I was in, in Alberta, there's wolves there and I thought I saw a wolf for like a whole second. It was a squirrel fucking squirrel, but I saw grey for movement. Wolf Squirrel. Like if you're dumb or if you're compromised or if you're, you get a little drunk, maybe a little tired, you know, maybe just saw something that looked really weird because of, you know, whatever weather conditions that are affecting some part of the world you live in, there's things called ball. Lightning, flies through the air, you know, it's a, it looks like a UFO. You ever see that shit? It's like a real natural phenomenon.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       Somebody might see something like that and then add a bunch of other shit to it. And that's where you get a lot of these stories yet like natural phenomenon and then people adding a bunch of shit to things, but then on top of that you have credible stories and you can't throw out any of them like you gotta you. It's when you look at all these things, you can't decide just cause there's a bunch of crackpot stories about UFOs that the ones by legitimate fighter pilots that those aren't real. Can't look at it that way. It's crazy to look at it that way because it's more likely there's something out there. Then there isn't something out there. It's way more likely. When I was a kid that happened to Hudson county park, I wrote it off. I didn't pay attention. I remember riding my bike up there, seeing the Fed tape and seeing people with those, a orange protective suits, huh?

Speaker 1:          00:37:16       Yeah. I was like, these people are fucking out of my mind. Then one night I got high five or six years ago and I saw it if somebody had posted on Facebook or youtube, and I read more and more into it and I discounted it until I read the accounts of the 28 people, you know, in that building, the liquor store, there was a guy who had just got dropped off a bus from New York because buses drop you off there from New York. The bus driver said there was a flash. He couldn't, you know, there were just so many people with stories that, you know, they didn't see a fucking guy get out. Only three people saw people get out [inaudible]. Everybody else discounted the lights and the noise and the other bullshit that went with it. I would've shipped my fucking pants. If I live in that building, it's all three little Martians get out or it could just be fucking hold. Hold on. Who knows who gives a fuck? Yeah, man. You just want me to tell you that that's where he can get freaked out and they can, you know, they can think all kinds of things. That didn't really happen. They, one night I was on acid, I thought it wasn't fucking, I put the FBI was out there with dogs and I, the next day it was fucking a fire. All right. I dumped the ounce of coke down the toilet. Oh my God. Because I hallucinated

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       because when you doing the coke more than fucking 10 hours, you start hallucinating. I started hallucinating. It was fucking dogs and it was a fire hydrant. You know how stupid I felt the next day. Pretty fucking stupid. Ugh. Pretty fucking stupid. I sat there and I went over and pet it. Dihydrate you fuck you. Fuck. This is a problem with any story. Like all these fucking UFO stories is people's memory. Memory's not that good. It's just not that good. It's too hard to figure out what it actually looked like after you saw it. Like you see something crazy like a year ago and then you try to describe it. It's too hard to describe. Like you barely remember it. You're your version of it is a rehashed version that you keep repeating to yourself. You know, if you saw something like say if you're hiking and you saw a wolf, right?

Speaker 2:          00:39:30       If you saw that wolf, when you try to describe that that moment, you saw that Wolff years later, like what? What are you actually seeing when you go in into your memory? How much do you help? Accurate as it were always lying about how accurate our memory is. It's not that good. Like if you, if you did see a wolf, I think, which is an extraordinary moment, right? You're in the fucking forest. It's a fucking wall. It's off, and you see a real wolf looking down on you, a wild motherfucker in the woods of Canada. Just looking at you, staring at you on a trail. That's an extraordinary moment. But if you try to recount that in your mind 10 years later, what do you actually see? How much do you actually see? You see this blurry, weird fucking misty version and you got some words that fall into place that can describe it, but how accurate is your fucking memory?

Speaker 2:          00:40:22       It's terrible. How accurate is your memory? It's good with statistics. Like I can tell you about fights. I can, I can tell you what year someone fought. I can tell you how this guy won and how he beat, you know, this many guys or the triangle and I remember things. But if I actually have to remember that what it actually looked like in my head, I can't really pull that up. I barely can pull it up by seeing, I'll recognize it again. You know, I just show me Joe Schilling knocking out Melvin Manhoef and Bella Tor aside. I said, watch that chaos so many times. The wild, crazy slugfest and if I see it, I'll, I'm watching it happen in a video. I remember it. Yep. This is how it goes. Here it goes. Boom. He kaos him. But if I had to just pull that out of my brain right now, it's not good. You know what I'm saying? Like if I had it, like if I have to like close my eyes and pretend I saw Mike Tyson knockout Michael Spanx, I kind of can see blue flashes. I can kinda remember weird little parts of it, you know, I remember the final right hand, boom, we just sends him flying through the ropes. It was chaos. It was just like he's the best ever. But if I had to like play it back in my head, it wouldn't be nearly as good as a video of it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:37       How has the memory in your life, how have the memories of your life, do you remember being three, your being five? Like I was fucking suffering, not suffering, but I was like trying to think of my dad. My Dad died when I was three and I have two memories with him. I have two memories that I can look you in the eye. I don't remember what he was wearing or what shoes he was worrying, but I still remember driving from the Lincoln Tunnel from New York to Jersey and then put me on my lap, no seatbelt, and me holding onto the steering wheel while, and I still remember him and my mom having a discussion and taking me with him. That's it. I don't remember nothing else. Wow. You know, you try to go back on your memory, then you start to write a little bit, your memory gets better.

Speaker 2:          00:42:29       Hello Devon. Even when your memory gets better. The problem is with my memory, I'm always wondering how much of this is accurate? You know, how much of what am I mean? How much of it was I really paying attention during the moment and really be in a like do it. Like if you have a bias perspective of something that's happening and then you have a memory of it. How much does your memory of the bias perspective, how much does your memory and the bias perspective shape what you think happened? You could actually kind of twist the past in your head if you're not careful. And you start thinking about things that didn't really necessarily happen the way they like. If you got a get fucked over at work, you know, I had gum in my fucking pension all of a sudden, and then you, you look at it from that way.

Speaker 2:          00:43:13       Wow, this guy worked for an evil company that fucked him over. Or you go to the employers and some of the other people that you work with go, no, no, no, no, no. That guy was a fucking asshole. He made life at work. Hell, nobody wanted him around. He didn't get fucked over. He was so negative. Nobody wanted to be with him in the office. We had to get rid of them. Like you, you'd have to look at it from their point too. You don't know. So the actual memory of it for that guy might be that he got fucked over by this evil company, but the memory of the other people is a completely different experience. The memory of the other people is, this guy was annoying to work with. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       and they're both, you know, it's both. I mean, who the fuck knows who's who's right, but my memory is good at some places and completely bad in others. Like right now, my memory of 30 years ago, just spot on. I could take conversations we had last night where we did a year ago. Like I'll sit here and go, what did I do last for the July? I have no fucking idea. But I went home when I went home for three weeks, I went to dinner with a friend of mine and then the way back I had him in tears telling them about the night his arm got broken. You know, he looked me legitimately in the face and he goes, Joey, I forgot I broke my arm. It's amazing. Remember how the, do you remember

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       that go? That was just one of the best nights of my life. I never laughed so hard. My friend, he drove his car up. My friend, you know how people go on a coming and they drive at? Yes. He didn't stop in time and he tapped my friend. My friend went down. It was hilarious as it is. He got up, he went to take a swing at this guy and the guy put his arm up and when he hit it, he broke his arm with the punch, the punch, and he had to wear a cast. And we torture them when my friend kept threatening to sue him and it was just a he and he, when I was telling him this, his face was red. He had to take his napkin down and he was banging the table. He goes, cokes, I just remembered the broken fucking arm, you know, he's my age.

Speaker 4:          00:45:16       He goes, I forgot all about my fucking arm. You know, before you came in, Jamie and I were talking about Achilles tendons. And I remember the time ripping, pulling a hamstring, like having to go to the hospital when I was 15 and having the fucking doctor do or something and it was bruised. Blood was running from my ass to the top of my leg. It was fucking horrible. I just ripped the hamstring. We were talking about, uh, uh, you know, like just that you know, and then this, there's a theory that there's times like you'll go back to Newark like you, I don't know if there's a fire. You're going to Newark that fight. No, I'm not going to, I'm not working that one. But let's pretend you went back to Newark and you went to see where your grandpa lived and you saw a corner store that was still there.

Speaker 4:          00:46:00       This is interesting and you go into that corner store and maybe you get a bag of wise potato chips. Maybe you get a bun that you went there and got, they say by tasting that button and it takes you back and opens up all those fucking memories. Why, why eating something from the area, something something. It's like sometimes a song will trigger something fucking songs. Really true for sure. That's why it's important. Sometimes when you watch a movie or a TV shut the habit soundtrack because we have a soundtrack. We all have a soundtrack of our lives. I had a couple of years ago, I was on a podcast and we were talking about something Bon Jovi and you're like, aw, I remember giving some chicken stab and listening to [inaudible], something like that. You know what I'm saying? Like you'll see, you won't even say I fucked Mary Lou Smith in the ass. Listen to the songs. You know, it just brings you back. It just brings you back. But they say that examples to bring it back. Yeah, it was me and my best friends were by the lake. Nope, banging some. That's what you got, man. Listen, most guys, most guys will hear a song, they'll be by themselves, they'll be by your wife and your kids. You know, you'll hear never say goodbye to Bon Jovi and you're thinking of night that drunk midget chicken, the decline in church and you never told nobody. It just comes back.

Speaker 4:          00:47:23       It comes back to haunt you for a minute. You know like shit like that always call. That was the song I sit in some prison to like whatever. I don't fucking know. Like when I got locked up, the big album was appetite for destruction. The Big [inaudible], the big, when I got locked up, the big albums for the regular people, appetite for destruction for the brothers. It was don't be cruel by Bobby Brown. That album, he made solo when he slipped from new edition. So every time I hear don't be cruel. The other one, every time I hear it, especially that fucking Mr Brownstone, every time I hit Mr Brownstone I want to crash the car because all the bike is the shoot heroin to that. So you know what I'm saying? Like it's time for Mr. Brown style. That's all they would talk about. So every time I hear those two albums, I fucking think about being locked up and what's on them. Ever since guns and roses went on tour. That's all you hear on the radio now. But the radio on for five minutes everyday you're in November. Rain walking through the jungle. Cause that's it. That's it. Right. Every time I hear those jams, I think about that stupidity. That's fun.

Speaker 4:          00:48:31       Welcome to the jungle was mine. But there's a lot of people who will say to you like, Oh, you know, I make love. I used to make love to my girlfriend, listen to that album, you know, whatever. But there's some people animals and say, you know the truth. I used to get my dick sided. Listen for that when I was 14 yeah, music more than anything. It's like an imprint of the time of the, of your life when you saw it. Like if you go back and think about, like for me it was stripes with Bill Marine, I think I was, I had to be a teenager. What year did stripes come out?

Speaker 7:          00:49:09       What year was that?

Speaker 4:          00:49:11       81 perfect. So I was 14 years old that that was, I was a in ninth grade, I was a freshman in high school. So that when I think about that movie, like that was the, the epic movie of our time when I was a kid. It was like, that was, I think about that time of the year or that time of my life. You think about who you were, you know what you, it brings you back to a weird place like it's, it helps. It enhances the memory. Fucking tremendous. That was a great movie, man. When he was such a funny movie. Think about the Lyme. He asked the fat dude why he joined the service and the guy goes, I want to lose a couple pounds. Look at him. Candy was amazing. Amazing in this. It's a fucking great movie, man. It was just so good at the time.

Speaker 4:          00:49:59       You know, it's just, you had a smile on your face through the whole movie. Like even the moment moments of the movie that weren't like hilarious when they're setting things up. You just, it was so well done. You just smiled. All you guys looking at this cast, you got the guy from Beverly Hills cop, you got Zito from Miami Vice. You got fucking Harold Ramis who was a blessing in my life. He legitimize me when I did this movie. The movie was terrible, but he was phenomenal comedy wise. That's awesome. I don't know what this brother went on to do, but you know, this is fucking great calm. But look at Bill Murray. This is dumb now man. This is the height of Bill Mary. Now you guys gotta remember we were just talking about another great movie a couple of minutes ago. Then these both come out the same year. Did they? Yeah. Any one 80 this is the shit we were going through.

Speaker 4:          00:50:52       This is why we talk about movies and music. It's not that we're old men fucking being nostalgic. I'm telling you the truth. They were making great movies at this time. There was a few great movies, a few. There was a few. Yeah, I mean, I mean quite a few, I should say. This planes, trains and on them bills that come out in 83 82 84 you know, you gotta the comedy lessons we were getting those years 87 well let's think of this like just cinematically. Look. What Year did the godfather come out? 73 73 72 exorcist. 73 the mechanic 73 it was just too much. Just those three movies right there, the Godfather, the mechanic and the exorcist.

Speaker 4:          00:51:44       And if you look at who was up for an academy award in 73 you'll fucking die. You'll die. You'll go out. Fuck fucking, they pick a winner there. It's also, imagine the stark contrast between that in 53 1952 the movies were kind of Corny. You know, even if they were good, they were kind of corny. You know, if you go any earlier than that, like y'all try to watch them. Kong ever watch, I watched it with my kids and a wife wasn't home and they were scared. They were like, I don't want to watch a scary movie. I'm, I go, we're going, we're going to, we'll laugh at a silly scary movie. And they're like, really? I go, you got to trust me. This movie was from so long ago that what they thought, it's scary. You're going to think it's silly. And they're like, are you serious?

Speaker 4:          00:52:28       Cause they, they go, okay, but if we get too scared, just shut it off, right. I go, definitely shut it off. They were like, I think seven and five at the time fucking movie. It's so fake looking when the gorilla comes out, they thought it was hilarious. And then because we talked about it being fun and then they were just laughing hysterically and cracking all these jokes about what that thing luck looked like, that it looked like my youngest daughter said it looked like someone was moving poop around that it looked like just like it was made out of poop. Cause it's all clay. It looks so dumb. But you know, back then that was as good as it got. Won't look at the new Godzilla. The new Godzilla has got off of people leaving with a fucking headache. Are they yet? Look at the old Godzilla. It's a comedy. It is. Oh my God. You see those poor little Japanese people. Look at this though. Yeah, I'll take this looks. But it just always been huge back at these guys like, yeah buddy, you're not in a plane. It's

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       like so fake looking. You know like these guys flying around and look how bad the gorilla looks. It's so crazy. But at the time this was unbelievable. This was amazing. So if you go from this to like apocalypse now, the jump in terms of like how impactful it is and how much they nailed it. Like this is, it's a fun movie, man. Don't get me wrong. I have a King Kong poster on my wall at my house. I love the moon. I love the smoke. I live movie poster from the nightclub. I'd much rather see the old gods Zos Godzilla vs Mortara [inaudible] versus the smog in lunch. The Godzillas are fun just to see what Japanese people doing. Yeah, they had the string on them. They would zoom wide shot. So they would show the Chinese people running and then they would just have a single shot and Godzilla moving through the air.

Speaker 2:          00:54:21       You see, look at the Japanese. I'm Japanese. Look out dopey looks like even when it's lit up. That is fucking fun, man. That's fun. Look, he's gone through. They fucking electric. Godzilla doesn't give a fuck. They're shooting. I'm fuck you. Yeah. See No, they can't show you a behind shot of the Japanese shooting Godzilla cause there's really no gun. They just shoot into a wall. It's completely separate. This is like a, a real claim model. If you look at it, he's really not 60 feet. It's maybe fucking eight inches or something. No, this is not a model. These are men in suits. This is the difference between King Kong and no shit. Yes, these are men in suits. And it was really complicated and these guys had to be really strong because they're carrying around this gigantic rubber suit and it's heavy. It's fucking hot as fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:55:08       So the reason why it moves so fluid with the Japanese did that was brilliant, was they had men and they put men in these monster suits. The fucking stuff up his mouth. Yeah, go in a Google. The men who wore the Godzilla suit, it's actually a pretty fucking cool. It's not easy to do. These guys had a walk around and have these fight scenes and shit and these big giant suits. There was an animation. That's a dude in there. Isn't that crazy? And that's a, that's what it really looked like in terms of a height wise. It was like the size of the person seat. That guy go back a bit. You see that guy getting out of it? That right there. That's what the dude looked like. He was inside of it. He was wearing them [inaudible] it was like a claim model. No, King Kong is clay model.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       King Kong was a claymation from Ray Harry Usan. That's how um, I got onto the subject with them. I was telling them about um, they love that monsters inc show and Hara Hughes in is one of the characters or something about Harry. He was in his, in the movie. I said, Huh, I go, do you guys know that is and they go, no. I said, that is the guy who of course they didn't know who this fuck am I talking about? I said, that's the guy who was one of the original monster animators for, for movies like King Kong. He did all that claymation stuff and back then, I mean that was the state of the art. You got to think 19 fucking 30 something and I was like King Kong was what, 33 yeah, Godzilla. That was later. That was post World War II. Yeah. So you got 54 54 post post World War Two was Godzilla.

Speaker 2:          00:56:44       Godzilla was after we, we, I shouldn't say we, somebody from the United States drop bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki when they use nuclear weapons. The idea was that, and all the nuclear tests that they had done in the water, there was no real understanding of what the fuck was going to happen. And so the science fiction version of that would be that all that radiation would create some super monster. Okay, brilliant. Yeah, the man, the Japanese give it to them. They were dealing with radiation poisoning and death on unbelievable, on an unbelievable scale. I mean hundreds of thousands of people wiped out instantly from atomic bombs. I mean, and so the, just the sheer force of the power of those things, you couldn't even imagine that there could be anything that could do that. It's one thing that falls out of an airplane that can do that. Well, what else can it do?

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       You know what, what happens if it gets in the water? What does, how does this chicken affect fish? How's it going to affect, you know, who knows? So the, the science fiction version was always awesome. It would be like a Godzilla would come. That's what the new ones about to write. The new one is the same kind of thing. Like a dinosaur got zapped and now the, I believe the new one was all the other dinosaurs came back and they had to reawaken God until it, uh, cause he was the only thing that can fight him. Oh God. Oh God. So it's a superhero monster movie. He's a superhero superhero then bring him back. He's a good guy. And this one, oh no, he's not a good guy. At the end of the last and everyone complaining cause there's like this weird winky scene where like Godzilla and the main guy like looked at each other in the eye or like same team grow, you know, the real Godzillas man.

Speaker 2:          00:58:17       The Real Godzilla is services are not Searcy. That what the fuck's her name? The Dragon Mother of dragons, dragon in the game of Thrones. That fucked up that city at the end. Like that's, that's what a like a real, that's a real horrific idea of a fire-breathing lizard. Godzilla was always adorable. Didn't really go after people. Even the early, even the early Superman's the first like six episodes. You could see the strain. Really check it out. That's liberal. Black and white. This is violet. Maybe the pilot my first three episodes. So they figured out how he could do it. You could see us train.

Speaker 2:          00:58:58       It's a weird, the Godzilla story is a weird story, right? Cause it's not like God's will, it goes on a killing spree. It just goes through Tokyo and just starts lighting every building on fire. He doesn't do that. He's like, almost like he has almost like a good guy lizard. And in the new movie it's more accentuated then. So he has to help help us. And Mold cloud was the fucking bird. Martha was a moth. Multiple moth. Yeah. And what was the smog monster like? I wrote Dan, I wrote, Dan wrote, Dan was, that was awesome. Dan looked like, I'm trying to remember like wings and Shit, right? Didn't Rodin have wings.

Speaker 2:          00:59:37       You gotta get out of watch. At least got to get still. Dad looks like this is crazy. This shit. Oh, that's right. Look, Rodin could fly. Look at that one. The Blue Sky below on three. Oh, this is a three headed one. Yeah, but this is new monsters, right? These are the new ones. What the fuck out of here with this new shit? Give me the blue sky right there with that. Yeah. Right there. That's kind of TV show wish was the smuggling loves to had laser beams coming out of his fucking eyes like Medusa. Yes, he did. Yes he did. One of them had fucking laser beam. Did he really? I was like, oh my God. The three headed things. What was that called again? I forgot about that three minute thing. Get door. I don't want to say that. Oh, Guidara Rodin. It was Gita rough.

Speaker 2:          01:00:31       Yeah. Just pull up a video of a Godzilla vs Guidara it was so silly, but man, when we were a little kids in this shit Saturday morning. Yeah. Lose your mind. I used to love dishes the best. When you found out Godzilla was going to be on TV, you were so pumped from the actual new movie. Oh, there's a new movie with Kitura once out. Not this movies out right now. It is God's looking at the monsters. Yeah, that's fine. Brought all three of these are, let me see these bitches. Whoa. Special Effects Today. Oh God. Holy Shit. This is amazing. Oh my God, Dude. The special effects they can do today are insane. So we're looking at, it says king g, H I d o r a h king. Guidara. Oh my God. To ood. The fucking special effects are insane.

Speaker 2:          01:01:35       There's Mothra. Wow. Is this supposed to be a good movie though? The things with these movies is, and I really hate to say this, how come they can't do both? How come they can't have an amazing, amazing special 40% on rotten tomatoes? How can they can't have amazing special effects and a fucking killer story. No, I can't. They do that. That's one of the last of the great 1009 is 10 years ago. Yeah. Which one was that one? Avatar. Avatar was a great story with great special effects like it was at the end of it. People are Gootz Pocahontas in space. Get over it. Okay. Yeah, it is. It's a classic story. Like James Campbell always talks about classic

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       structure of these heroes journeys. There's a lot of that in there. It's very similar to a lot of the stories. It's still great. Don't let that get in the way of the fact that it's great. That movie was fucking awesome. That movie was awesome just to special effects and the way it all went together and yeah, that fucking the bad military guy was cartoonish. Yeah, of course he was. So what, why let that get in the way with your fun? Think of it as like when a movie like that I think of it is like, it's like a lot of the hyper violent Tarantino movies. Like you know what you're signing up for, you know, you know what it is. It's not supposed to be some detailed analysis of the human psyche. You know where a guy takes his strange slow transformation over the course of two hours?

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       No, it's a fucking bad guy. This is the bad guy. Here's a good guy. Good guy. Can't use his legs. Wouldn't it be awesome if you could be one of those blue things? Papao I live in a solid fucking fucking movies. Great. I never saw it. I remember one of the saying that they put too much money into it to my, but you make a movie. If I give you $600 million, it's not anybody. Any of you can make a movie. If I give you 600 Mil. Joey's James Canton. James Camera's a monster. I love James Snakes. So many amazing movies, mates, great movies. It's like building an ego. It was like fucking building a team to put a movie together, which I understand, but 600 million, you know Casca nominated, but I love him. They shunned them. They shunned them that, Oh, Shanda at the Oscars. He walked in and he thought he was bad to the bone.

Speaker 1:          01:04:00       He was sitting there with his little new girlfriend and his ex wife directed her locker. Whoa. So they both got the same thing. Oh. And he's sitting there looking at Spielberg like winking at him and went, got all the other white people like what's happening and all of a sudden they go to announce the winner of the best movie and they showed up with Robert Craig Fan. Oh, once you pay her feed, you know. And her number is just to walk out of the house. What's the number? Big. Big, big [inaudible] when she does the theaters, like tickets are more expensive than the fucking Laker ticket. When she did the staple center, cheapest ticket to rebills by the refrigerator thousand to just sit on the floor. Barbara Streisand don't fuck around somewhere. They call. It's cause she's lightened somebody's asshole lot. Even James Cameron knew what he saw. He put his head up, look at the tape, he knew what he was done and she came out and gave it to him.

Speaker 1:          01:05:00       He lost that to his wife. Hurt locker though, was that was a like a culturally significant movie at the time of a war. That was super well done. There was no bullshit in that movie like that was a, that is a good fucking movie. Her locker is one. Those moves at the end of it. You go, Jesus speak of a hurt locker. Did you see what happened in New Jersey yesterday? What happened? Ice went to New Jersey to go into some Jewish place and Jews got together and held hands and 36 of them got arrested. I've always said those Jersey Jews don't fuck around thug, those Jews, all of them calling New York, Brooklyn. They held hands and went up against eyes. Good for that little young kids. They don't fuck around those jurors. I was telling Lee last night, the lady, you know, they sell more like braces in Jersey and they do it across the country because there's a lot of Jews in Jersey.

Speaker 1:          01:05:51       It just wear neck braces. Did you know that? Why? Because then they're on the lawsuit. Oh, well I grew up, I grew up here and all this. Every time I go to the Meadowlands that be eight guys with neck braces on at the metal lands and I asked around and what goes on you, you don't know what that is down the, they have somebody on the paper, like they have a court case going, oh that's so fun. So they got to wear fucking neck braces. So they call them the Jewish gold chains. You didn't know that. They call a Jewish gold chain. When you go get a fucking neck brace, you got the back order them in Jersey. Like they fucking Jewish folks are interesting in that it's a religion and a race. It's a religion and a both kind of cause. A lot like Jewish, ours, Jewish.

Speaker 1:          01:06:38       But ours is not religious anymore at all. No. He went over and did the whole fucking buddies. Jewish. He's Jewish. Yeah, it's a different animal. There's a lot of Jewish atheist, you know like how, how the fuck, how can you do that? How does that work? They just do it. They identify with that tribe. They'll, it's part of a tribe. It's like a tribe, right? Like a tribe and a religion. And a race. It's like three things dog. When I was a kid, I knew what Jersey Jew in attorney's name was. Coach this motherfucker, the smile. Wow. People going to them because they call them guaranteed 30. If I can get you 30,000 for anything, like people would cut that thumb and just go down there, get already Jersey 30 gs and then you take an advance from, you get hurt and you're taking an advanced coach.

Speaker 1:          01:07:21       Let me get 10 g's. When we been Brooklyn last time when we were going to um, uh, Peter Luger's and so we drove through these Hasidic neighborhoods and these were the ones like Ra, there's orthodox Jews, there's a big comedian, Orthodox kids, but in, in New New York and Brooklyn particularly, and the Ra was explaining how they don't leave this community. This is where they stay. These are all their people. They don't give a fuck about what's happening in the outside world. I'm like, wow. They just, you just see this interesting subculture that it's one of the more cool things about New York as he get to be in that car. That's how it like a genuine man. Even though they're isolated, they have their own neighborhood. It's a genuine melting pot in that regard. Like you could go to a Chinatown, like a real Chinatown. You've got to Chinatown New York City.

Speaker 1:          01:08:09       That's a different animal man. I mean do you might as well be in some part of Asia fucking blow hot matrix in this. It's what? What's the name of it? Whoa hop. Where's that? It's in Mont Street and it's open 24 hours. [inaudible] real 24 Jason, New York. Just put the fucking menu up per Mohab. When I was in New York shooting that movie, the one that I was starving, I got stoned and at one 30 I go, I can't do it. I called wall up. I go, what time do you open though? They go home, we will open. I hung up the phone. I went on Uber, it was a $10 cab ride and I go, I'm going to go to wall hub and I chickened out. Joe Rogan haunted attack. He goes to low hop at two in the morning. You're getting a heart attack. All that sodium fucking killed me and doing them.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       I'll be up to fucking, I'll be up for two days. We often went to Chinatown after playing pool cause it was like the best thing you know back in my early standup days when I didn't have obligations, we'd stay up playing pool until two three in the morning and go and you have a real meal, like a really good meal. I think I'd have odd attack that. Yeah. They get us meal at night with egg rolls and steak on a stick and fucking just a pork fried rice along. Set you off. What's there? Even diet coke back then when did diet coke get invented now? There's always been, we always had, yeah, we always had foster kids. My mother had a Trashcan Tab. I drank tad. My mother had tab. People got Super Sad on taboo in a way. I remember like a people would be all bummed out like wow, can I ain't love tat battalion girl's drink tab.

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       That was a grocery. Yeah, tab. FRESCA FRESCA was more of a girls drink, but Todd was a girl's drink because he had a pink can, wasn't, didn't tab of like a pink gas. Yes. 1982, that's when tab went away. Coke. Oh Wow. I thought it was older than that. Hm. Me Too. Yeah. I still remember in 85 when they changed the recipe, that was 85 and motherfuckers went nuts. Crazy. And they really, they went crazy. New Coke like what? You're on coke. Why would you fuck with the taste of the best soda of all time? Coca-Cola was the best tasting soda of all time. And this other stuff that's really good. Like root beer is really good. It's interesting, but there's a reason why that shit sold a billion fucking trillion gallons over the past. So tap had Sacramento and led to bladder cancer and found that out.

Speaker 1:          01:10:32       And then the popularity declined. Exactly. One Diet coke came out 1982. Oh, they got set up. Put on your pink or your uh, yeah. Your pink tinfoil. Um, let me see a picture of it with a tab can look like, was it pink? I'm trying to remember it. See Again, memories. Okay. Like I was talking about, I know that registers with me. Okay. I know that that makes sense. Yeah. That's what tab looked like. That makes sense. But that looks like going to call the company also so I think Coca-Cola discontinued tab put more fucking cancer in it. Sold in this diet coke. What I was going to say is I can't, I could never draw that. Like if you asked me to draw what a tab can looks like, okay look I wouldn't be able to do it. Who was in that realm of that red but it wasn't Coca Cola red.

Speaker 1:          01:11:20       That's what I'm talking about with memory. You know memories is a weird thing. It's very weird because my memory with numbers is pretty good. I remember a lot of important dates and times and things and statistics. I can remember a lot of statistics and I remember a lot of fights pretty pretty much tell you what the outcome was, but how much do I remember of seeing it? How much can I pull up and watch again? How accurate is that? I don't know. Like I was more of a sporting guy when I was growing up and yesterday I was on a plane and they had the direct TV on there and they was showing the best time I was looking at the iPad. Anyway, I was watching something on the iPad, but the screen was on and it was showing the best 10 football players and they showed a Joe Montana claw to Dwight Clark in 81 and away my memories like wait a second, I want 800 on that game.

Speaker 1:          01:12:17       Cause I had the ova and I had San Francisco getting the point man, fucking Dallas and into San Francisco. Give it a point in those days, Jeez, my clock that slowly Joey was throwing him. That's what snowy Joey was up this coat throwing the fucking touchdowns up there. Joe Montana, I have all like high school. Who fucked? Look at Jesus Christ. Although there was a cat's at some giant made with one hand. I Dunno what the fuck. Oh my God, they showed the best 10 catches. I was sitting there and I just was looking at them, but the actual just one catch. I don't know what the, I think this is the kid they traded. He just reaches up the defendant. He fucking pulls it in. All My, I don't know if it's old delt back on him. I thought it was all go back. It's like a special is doing those catches.

Speaker 1:          01:13:04       Did you see Francis and got him knockout junior dos Santos? Yeah. I didn't even think it was a real knockout. He just blushed him. Look up. He hit him and he went down and helped his head. Let them fight it out with, listen, that fight was over. You got to listen to me. That fight was over cause he hit them now. It doesn't matter. The scary thing is he just clipped him. He clipped him, he clipped him, rocked him, put him down, pounded on his head and jr just couldn't even move. He just laid there and take it and they stopped it quick. That was a hundred percent legitimate hundred percent legitimate. Between you and I that this would go a little long. I thought that he was a seasoned veteran. I thought that he would go at least take it into the third round and try to nullify his power by the third round.

Speaker 1:          01:13:45       You can't keep throwing those fucking ain't makers. I told he was with the wrestling a little bit. It was not what I anticipated. It was not the game plan. I thought I got off stage and it was starting because I got, as I walked into the green room fucking they were gone and I was so fucking happy. I'm like, let me watch this. I go here. I think Judy has a shot at him fucking as I thought that he was already on the floor holding his fucking boy. Junior had a good start where was kicking the leg,

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       especially the lower part of the leg. You could really fuck someone up, knocked him off balance and that can really fuck you up man. Like really mess up your movement. And, uh, if that was the case, if we was able to mess up his moving and get them to miss a little bit, you know, make get him so that he was having a hard time moving correctly and keep chewing on that leg, then maybe there would be openings for him to, to jump in with some punches. The problem is when their balls on the outside, Frances is bigger and the consequences are way more grave. If Francis clips you, it's 99. I don't care who you are. He's so confident in it too. He moves forward and he's going to throw everything full speed. The first round with him is extremely dangerous because he's just trying to take you the fuck out.

Speaker 2:          01:15:00       It takes a guy like Steve Bay. Steve [inaudible] saw what he was doing and what he did was just ride with it. Just moved away from it, kept his hands up when Francis was coming after me. Use good defense and he kept moving and kept pitch picking away at him, picking away at him, picking away at him, taking his shots when they were there and then started wearing Frances down, taking him down, beating him up, and then just dominated him. Clear cut, unanimous decision for five rounds. It takes a guy like that, a guy like Steve a that has the mental fortitude to stick to a game plan, not panic in the firefight cause that's what happens with in Ghana. You're like, Jesus Christ, I'm going to see lights any second. Now I'm going to see a big flash and I'm going to be out cold any second.

Speaker 2:          01:15:44       Now it's calming and you see the reaction they have to them. It's they fight different. They fight different with him than they do with anybody else because the consequences are so great. If you watch the way he knocked out Allister over him, the consequences are so grave, so everyone's scared. No matter it's normal. Everyone's scared to fight, you know, there's at least there's going to be some anxiety or fear or you're going to, your heart rate's going to get checked, your adrenaline's going to be pumping, but it's even more so if the consequences are more grave, right? Like if you're going to fucking take a skateboard down a small hill, you're not freaking out, right? But if you take it a skateboard down like four Mile Canyon, what does that four mile in boulder, what does that w one of those crazy roads that goes sunshine canyon, right?

Speaker 2:          01:16:27       If you're taking a skateboard down that go on 50 miles an hour, you're going to shit your fucking pants. You're going to try to land this thing, right? Try to figure out how not to die here because the consequences are so much graver you're going to be more jacked. And that's what happens to these guys. And they fight Frances. The consequences are so grave. They make mistakes. And then with junior, he reached for uh, an overhand right. He just really, really extended himself. You can't do that with Francis. You just go there. The scary thing is true with cro courses. Everybody has a game plan and they get punched in the face. That's my Tyson, Mike Tyson offense. It's some guy all that. Once you get that first part, the fight, I only saw two fights. The funniest one was the first one against the kid from Dallas. Props to him. He went

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       up against like a lieutenant, the KKK. The guy drew blue on his face at the way in and they almost got into a little scuffle in the way and then he had no fucking love in his face. He didn't smile. One time he was definitely a member of the KKK and there's a little black dude from Dallas came in and he threw the spinning back kick and that dude, it was all over. He hit first fight on the column, the main card, which fucking defeated from, he's not from the miss this plan. This series. Yeah. I didn't see that fight. First fight on the card. He's eight. No, now out of Dallas. Strong guy. Really good. He still has to, he's just got to grow a little bit. He's going to get knocked out once before. He really makes that big jump, but once he gets it, the guy kept doing spinning back kicks on him and the second one, he was writing his back.

Speaker 1:          01:17:58       This guy just hates black people. Who's the guy that's right. No, that's Paul Craig. Yeah. Yeah. That guy that Paul Craig is great now. He's probably great. It's a fucking joke. Joke roll. But then he went in with a tough phase, you know, like fucking the guy from a, he went in there like fucking Wa Braveheart. He's a tough guy called Craig. He's a good boy. You see the fucking fight. I'll see it. No, he was great. He just, the guy waited for the second one and when the foot land that he was right behind them, not be new, new time. Click oof. I turned around and he hit him with a fucking dropping right hand. You could see his feet just go like, you know when you come at your feet, just pointing. Same thing. It looked like he came. He just went, Jamie's got it. Oh Geez.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       Jesus. It was [inaudible]. Well that's the first one. So he said right away he timed it, but the doc bopping got bought by. That's it. Look at a man. The last, the last one he did while the guy would amend this, look it up for, he was saying boom, boom. There you go. Boom, boom. There you go. He's probably right now reading fucking Malcolm x's biography. Freezers. Yeah, that was ferocious. I'm glad people wonder why people want to spend that much. You know those like that. I hate all that shit. Spinning punches. Why are you giving your back to a killer? I never understood it. Well that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying if you're not that good at it, he doesn't have like a really fast, we didn't commit to it. Barboza okay. Edson Barboza wheel kicks people and puts them on Pluto. He spin back, kicks you to the body.

Speaker 1:          01:19:33       He mean he's a, his kicks, his spinning kicks are fucking insane. But these guys are not that good. Like what I'm saying is like Paul Craig, that's not his specialty. He's more of a grappler. I mean he can strike, obviously he's a good striker, but I wouldn't think that he would want to throw a spin kicks. He's not like a taekwondo guy. I don't if you don't do taekwondo for 10 years, why you spending kicking in the UFC against? I laugh. Full Attic Guy, you know all those things. I hate when they even that reverse punch when the guy keeps doing it and doing it. I'm like, you know what, Yo come bust him in the fucking ear. See when you're talking about like Edson Barboza though, like [inaudible] on the Dan Hangman kept fucking kicking his body though. Spinning back. Kick. Just fucking in gotta commit to that spitting back and getting my commitment.

Speaker 1:          01:20:15       Oh, I'm Max Holloway spilling a little fucking cow bottle and then they got the guitar played. Did it? Yeah. What's his name? John did so did Max Holloway invented it. I don't know how I just saw it on. Is he the first person I saw it? Yeah. Like that's amazing. That's amazing. Max Holloway's. He's such a fucking cool guy. I love that guy. One place. He's a champion. He'll go, he'll come back like, who the fuck comes as better than him? The way he draws to Dustin Poirier excuses all above all happiness. He's amazing with Jason Stadium. What's he doing? What's going on? No, let me see it. Oh, he's a real karate guy. Jason. Stay them. Has real striking skills. Like, well look, look, you can tell even the way he's standing here, like the way he's moving. No, no, no. He's going to spin it. But you see, even the way he's doing it, like this guy's got real skill. Look at that.

Speaker 5:          01:21:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:21:12       Kapow he um, he achieved a very high level of a skill in karate. I don't know exactly what it was, but from people that, um, I know that have done martial arts with him and trained with him and said, that guy's a bad motherfucker. Like a legit bad-ass, like really knows martial arts. I believe it. Right? You see him like, I believe it. Seaman, like snatch one of those movies. Like, yeah, he fucked people up. Hey, did the mechanic, oh, I know. Bothers you. But Hey, it's a good, I don't want to look at your fucking face and it tastes good.

Speaker 1:          01:21:52       It's hard to shame them, but you really should just say to them, hey, let's not do that. Let's just write a movie that's similar and homage to it. I know they didn't even do it on March. That's what really pissed me off. There was no respect at any level for Charles Brunch. Not even a fucking out. Why? Why did he say that? What do you mean if the, if you watch the mechanic and study the mechanic, it just wasn't a white guy shooting people. He was very calculated. There was no very calculated. Everything was made to look like it was an accident. A very much accent. One of the best beginnings in it. The only movie that starts better than the mechanic, it's scarf. Like no, there's something that has a better opening. I forget. There's no fucking dialogue for 11 minutes, 12 minutes. It's him setting up a guy to make it look like the fucking heater blew up. Like those type of guys. Like I had a friend that he used to say is the best way to kill somebody who's breaking their house. Take the fucking pipe, the gas thing out of the stove, pointed down and light a camera on the refrigerator and then leave. Well give it 1520 minutes and it's late night. Irene, what does this, Jamie, this is the of the whole movie actually.

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       It's on you. This is the beginning of the mechanics. This is the beginning of the original one. Original? Yeah. Okay. When you know Jan Michael Vinson, his father in the movie, Charles Bronson kills. He gets a contract to kill him. That's how Jim Michael drips to him. When he killed him and made him look like he had a heart attack, he wanted his medical file and he saw he had a weak heart and he went to meet them and then he shot at the road and he goes, run, run. So was the guy who was running, he had on a tie, Jason straight them and whoever the fuck made the movie make it look like he was just shooting my child. But you're saying to me, joy, what did it take so much offense? Because it's, you know, it's the fucking mechanic. It was that good of a God damn movie.

Speaker 4:          01:23:50       You know that we did death wish. No, no, no. You know, you can't Redo death wish. One of the most disturbing movies you'll ever say. Bruce Willis. Yeah. He should be shot and then shot again. Okay. I mean, he did fucking listen. You know what? That's the wish has, and nobody remembers what I saw when I was 10. This is why I don't play that shit as one of the most disturbing rape scenes you'll ever see. And Jeff Goldbloom Senate members, they knocked this daughter right, raped us, spray painted, harass. I left that movie being 11, like fearing for my mom. Now, like I left that and I became tied with my mom at the bar. I tried to get a stick, a knife like that could happen to women. Like that happens to women. Like guys just ripped their pants off. I didn't know. I didn't know what that shit was.

Speaker 4:          01:24:40       So I watched the uh, whatever the fuck is this. That's the way it's a different world for women. Yeah. I couldn't even believe it when I watched that. Doesn't that ever talk about how disturbing that scene? Is that something that most men never have to think about unless you're in jail? Most men, most men don't have to think about that with women have to say no. What happened, right? He goes to Arizona, they sell him tires on it to build the building and it becomes run to the redneck and the redness like, man, that can't happen to you. He goes, I put a little something in your bag. Either take back up to those big city folks with Charles Bronson got back to his house, was a fucking white canon from Texas Walk Kurzy he was an architect. He gave him a fucking cannon. So Charles Bronson said, let me go on and have some fun and see what happens.

Speaker 4:          01:25:32       First night, first night, some guy's like, hey, old time to give me 20 bucks. And you could see the panic in his face. He was an old man. He stole it. He stole it. He didn't take it out and say, fuck you. No. He was panicked. He shot the guy in the subway scene. You could see he scared. You. Remember when that fucking looking at him looking at him. Oh, this is great. That's right. Right here. Look, he's just an old man dog. 53 years old. Fucking killing it in America. Giving men like you and me hope he was giving the men hope. This fucking

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       guy, right? Yeah. I think he was at least 50 years old when he was lunch. Wow. Look what kind of skinny is by out by pain. Got Right that you Bob, look at him. He's just get better suit on shooting these guys. Yeah. This is cute. Brilliant film. They'll never do that again because they won't take these little fucking details. He was petrified. I took crazy in hard times. I think he was 50 years old by then. I remember when he played the, that boxer a mechanic. He was 51 I think. Hard tie. Yeah, Bro. He was, I think he was 51 and there was no TRT back then son. That dude was doing things. He was going to fall Moesha I forgot what was Formosa that for most of the cafe, that little bar down there, that's where he would go like to eat or some shit.

Speaker 1:          01:26:55       I heard he lived down there. I don't know what the deal, where does he live? Well, when he came down like that's where he took the name Bronson from. Was that street in Hollywood? Really? What was his real name? He's a Polak Radensky something. Just that they'd told him like, you can ski. Yeah, you can't, but it have that name. So he probably looked around Hollywood. Perfect. I said Bronson, you fucking believe that when you hear that shit like wait, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. You were walking down the street and it's like when you had Jamie Fox on it, he made his name Jamie Fox because people would think he was a hot chick. That is the most bullying thing I've ever heard in my life. Jamie Fox was a bad mother. Brilliant man. Brilliant man. Brilliant. That's the fact that he figured that out. Yeah. Chicken Shit. Pick your name on the lineup.

Speaker 1:          01:27:44       They see that Jamie Fox, you get a chance to get up there. So smart. You're re, you know like if a guy sees that fox, whatever, Jamie with an especially with an eye. You supposed to j I. M. I does. He doesn't he James basic, my regular Jamie. That makes you think it's a broad right off the fucking back is Jamie j. A. Y. M. I. E. I would say it's girl. Yeah. You said the I before the M is a girl spelling us a lot of those weird words like Shawn, but there's a lot of hot Shawn's that are girls. Right? What else? What are the ones, it's a guarantee. They used to be like Stacey, like these didn't name dude. Stacey like Stacy Keach. They said, you know there's a lot of dudes, they're like in their sixties they to name guys. Stacey, there's something, there's a name that a friend of mine had.

Speaker 1:          01:28:34       There was a guy that can't remember it now, wasn't there? One of the weird guys in airplane. Leslie, Leslie, Leslie. These name guys. Leslie. How weird. That's a weird one. What's his name? Linsley the hilarious dude. Listen hilarious. The guy was hilarious. Wasn't he in creep show too? Was he one of the people in creep show that got killed? I feel like he was one of those people that got buried on the beach or some shit like that. Yeah. Yeah. He's a husband. Yeah, he, he uh, did something to some, some rich guy. It got buried him up to his head. I forget those fucking scary horror movies like creep show, fun horror movies. They don't make enough of those anymore either. Those are my favorite moves. Anything else? Scream wasn't bad. Right? It wasn't bad at all. And what year was that? 87 97 six yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:29:30       Those are the six 97 fun ass movie. I think the Latin, that's the last one I watch. But the last movie, the scare, the living fuck out of me was the first nightmare on elm street with the tongue coming out of the fall. Before that, you know the people I go, you don't watch walking dead. You know why? Again, I'm loyal to fucking, when I was a kid, those dawn of the dead movies, what was the guy that wrote those? George Romero. George Romero. I'm loyal to him. My loyalty is with him. I took acid and went to George Romero, that one dorm, the dead. When the helicopter chops, a black guy's head off when he doesn't even know the helicopter lands. And he says, I'm B. Yeah. And I think he chops his head off. I remember tripping on the ass. I almost had a fucking heart attack.

Speaker 1:          01:30:12       Walking dead was awesome for the first few episodes. They just lost. They just each can't keep something like that up forever. It just becomes too, too hard to keep the story going. And it's just a good story. Got Too weird. But the best hard movie, Zombie horror movie of all time. It's 28 days later. That's the best one. That's that British movie. So, uh, it, we didn't get until like way after it came out in this, in the theater over there. Most people have seen it. They've seen it. They've seen it on cable or DVD. Right. People. That's what it was 28 days later. Even in the theaters out here. Was it the depth, the depth, the one after that was a big deal, but it was a British movie. Right. Goddamn that movies good. I remember I bought a version of it on VHS, on the number of European VHS was a different format. He was like, yeah, I have a different player. Or you had to have a player that was a universal player that could play both. I had one of those just so I could get some cool documentaries and shit that you'd get from Europe. Just just to remind them. Want to give props to American Airlines for returning my luggage. Oh, after the whole weekend. And they missed that fucking half ounce of weed in my boxing glove.

Speaker 1:          01:31:22       So you're the delivery driver. You are dumb. Fuck. That was, they lost my movie tie bag. They did. I was going to Columbus to go to the short movie thigh and I brought in the, uh, you know, my little fucking Shin pads and my gloves. This man raps. He'd been doing that a lot lately. Huh? More done. Of it. That's great. Right? I go twice a week. Well, I've had a, I'm 56 the targets that thing, and I take the class with everybody else. I do everything else I die. They're like, well, we don't want the boxing because Tuesday and Wednesday, Tuesday and Thursdays boxing. Then when you do the class, do they have you spar? I'm 56 I light no headgear. None of that shit. Chopping pop. Yeah, working in a combination. Shit like that. Saturday, Sundays I go in, there's an open mat. If I'm home, I go in and there's a chick that's like an ice cop, an ice cop.

Speaker 1:          01:32:11       Oh No, she's, she's a tough chick. Yeah. Yeah. She trains for Brett and the whole thing, so I go down and just let her beat me up to death. Let me ask you this. As someone who is born in another country, how do you think that they should handle the immigrations that are here? Because this is the big question. A lot of people know people that are, I mean probably a lot of people listening know someone who they love that's illegal. Whether they're illegal from Canada or they're illegal from Europe or they're illegal from Mexico. Where the fuck there's a lot of people that get over here and stay over here that aren't supposed to be. Some of them turn out turned out to be amazing people. So how do you decide, how do you decide who gets to say and to someone coming over here trying to make their life better?

Speaker 1:          01:32:53       A better thing, but just doing it illegally. Does that automatically discount them from staying here? That seems crazy. What if their great? There's a lot of people come over here because they were super unfortunate and where they were born and they, they grew up in a shitty place and they wanted to make it better, but they didn't know how to do it. So they came over to America by Hook or by Crook. They figured out how to get here. They got here and now they're kicking ass. Why? Why would you want to get rid of them? As long as they're not criminals, as long as I'm not hurting anybody, why would you want to get rid of them? Well, start is, let's do this. Let's what's going on right now. Just points the finger at a certain realm of, Oh, you're pointing the finger south of the border.

Speaker 1:          01:33:34       Yeah, it's Canadian. A lot of Canadian. Which, and I'm not saying nothing bad about anybody. This is the United States of America. People come here to fucking have a dream and whatever happens, bro, sometimes the dream goes, could put, you know, when I went to New York, I spent three weeks in New York and I ubered and I did a little thing in my mind, you know, I took 20 Ubers. In fact, I became Uber planning because I was doing, you know, all these rides. Not One white person picked me up. Not one time, one time. And guess what? I asked questions. I asked everybody questions. And the most inspiring person I met was one, not at work though. I rapped at six 30 in the morning. There was no way I was getting in the van to go home. But I just called Uber. I was in Ridgewood, Brooklyn and this Indian girl picked me up.

Speaker 1:          01:34:23       Very cute, you know, six in the fucking morning. It's still kind of dark out, you know, five 30 whatever it was. And this little girl that weighed 90 pounds picked me up, got in the car, hello. We have charger in the back if you want to charge your car and this little caramels in the front, you know? And I said, where are you from? And she told me India and I go, how long have you been a year and a half spoke perfect English. Wow. I go, why do you, why did you become an Uber driver? She goes, I became Uber driver because I was a waitress in an Indian restaurant and the guy abused

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       me and he would only pay me eight bucks an hour and take half my tips. So me and my cousins got together, we put away money and we rent the car. We leased a car, my s she drives in the daytime and I drive with at night. Wow. And I drag on, why are you, aren't you scared to go out at night? She's like, no. She's like, I love it because there's no traffic in it. I go, what do you walk with? I just asked her creepy questions. Not Sad, you know? I just watched her and it was, I went, I gave her an extra tip like, can you be illegal and do that? I don't know what the status was with her. I didn't ask her. I didn't know [inaudible] but what do you think? Do you think that you could do that? Do you think like if you came from another country, you came from Guatemala illegally, you were came over here though and became an Uber driver. Could you do that? Me? No. Can anybody do that or do they check your citizenship? What do you think Jamie?

Speaker 6:          01:35:58       There's yes they can do that. So someone definitely can come over here and start working for Uber or or another or a similar, I'm not saying that I'm doing that necessarily like through the proper ways that you can get, if you have a legal friend you can use their license to be that like the Uber thing and they don't know who's behind the car. So it happens all the time. When I'm ordering food, you definitely have to have a valid driver's license. Right? So you get a valid driver's license if you're illegal. Oh that's the part like so I'm saying so like, no, but that doesn't stop someone from getting behind a car if you don't have a license any day. That's sort of where I'm going,

Speaker 4:          01:36:31       want to get in trouble right now is on we on the shit list because we agreed and somebody else to give illegals licenses. That's why I was asking does there was a thought that popped a memory popped in my head about some story like that, that they were going to give a illegal aliens the a right to drive.

Speaker 6:          01:36:49       I'm sort of saying like it does happen, but not above the board basically

Speaker 4:          01:36:53       because it's, yeah. But are you sure? Could you see if they're, they're trying to give illegal aliens driver's licenses because I remember a story like this too as well. People are super upset about it. It's a weird thing. Mash 13 states that allow it. There you go baby. Where do you have to move one of those states

Speaker 6:          01:37:13       in d c uh, California was the first one as of 2013. Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, everywhere. There's suite, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, New York. Just everywhere. Their sweet Hawaiian doesn't necessarily have wheat. Vermont medicals is very close.

Speaker 4:          01:37:33       Well, what business standpoint, they work for cheaper and work harder than, you know, I mean, there's so many benefits to as a business owner in different, I mean, when was the last time you saw a white laborer? You see them, you go in the kitchen and at any restaurant it's all, you know, I mean, and so now you, now you questioning what rights you have as an American. You come here, you get a job, you're working hard, you stay out of trouble, you stay out of trouble. Your mind, your business, you know, I mean I grew up, you and I grew up in the east coast where you'd go to a Chinese restaurant and you'd see them though the husband and wife working and the kids would be doing homework at the back table and if you came in the daytime, it was a different couple, which is telling me that two couples got together, they buy a home and they opened a business together and they work together.

Speaker 4:          01:38:28       That's what those immigrant in groups do. And then from there they bring a cousin and they open the open and next thing you know they got three houses on the block and now he just had a fucking immigrant family move into your neighborhood. Not necessarily good or bad. You know what I'm saying? That that Nice. We all had them in our neighborhoods. Sure. I remember 70 years ago, this was your grandparents, so you have to think about your grandparents. How would you want them to treat it? I'm sure your grandpa father got a job, lame Rick way before he got his immigration papers. I don't know how they did it right. I think they got it pretty quick. You get through Ellis island and they pushed it. Boy, shoot drew. I mean the illegal situation, it was a different world back then. You could immigrate pretty easily.

Speaker 4:          01:39:11       Like my grandparents did. Weren't rocket scientists when they came over here. No, they were kids. Their, their, their parents weren't geniuses. You know what's going on? Farmers. Do you know what's going on in South America right now? Nicaragua and Doris, all those places. Pure hell, pure. Hell. You know, I can't be mad at you for wanting to get the fuck out of that, but this other places on earth right now will this Po fucking hell going on? Yeah, there's trying to come over to, let's point everybody out. Let's lock all the fucking borders. Don't make it seem like it's just Mexico. That's the fucking problem. You know, we're getting bombarded from everywhere. We're getting new people in here every day from everywhere. I ain't mad at it. That come in here to make better lives, but don't just keep pointing the fucking water that you know offers coming through that Mexican border that nobody's talked about.

Speaker 4:          01:40:05       Jamie, when you get a minute, if you'd love to check it, just to verify me. You know how many Cubans and getting sent back to Cuba on a daily basis from Mexico? Real getting back to get a shot. But Cubans want to come to Miami Doma, why they're not coming through. They're closed, all that type of shit. So right now you can't come through my, it's easier to come go from Cuba to Mexico and just join the walk and walk up. But once slides here in America, we give them asylum. Right? Right. The tag. But then it's still going. I think robot Emma removed it. Did he really? Yes. Trump made it so we can't go over there. You go pack Mexican shelters. Hope the Mexican people are going through Mexico. And that's crazy. So I think I, the number of couple of weeks ago, I think 900 Cubans getting sent back

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       weekly to get shot. Does you think that more people, more people are make it towards the border since Trump was like, build that wall, build that wall. Do you think more people are headed towards the border now because it's just like it's a popular thing to do. It's a part of our culture. Like a part of the conversation is the border wall, right? Like do you want a border wall or do you not want to go build that wall and make it a fucking million feet high, bring it right to that top of the earth. Or are you one of those people that thinks anybody should be able to come over here and have a better life? You know, and this, that those two ideas of fucking clashing left and right. Some people think that people should be able to try to do better, try to better themselves.

Speaker 1:          01:41:32       They should have the opportunity and then some people think, fuck them. You're born somewhere else. You don't ever get a chance to come over here, go in through proper channels, which is almost impossible. Do something that's very valuable to us over here. See, that's the thing. Like, if you are a person who has some extraordinary skill, you know, you could probably get American citizenship easier. You know, unusual. If you're contributing to the physics department at Harvard or something like that and your, you know, you were born in Germany or wherever, you probably get citizenship a little bit quicker than you have. Just a guy who like lives in Guatemalan, wants to come to America because he thinks he can advance his life. You think he can get better words where he lives? There's no, you can't go anywhere. You're stuck. The, the poverty is extreme.

Speaker 1:          01:42:15       The is extreme and he wants none of that. He wants to do better. So he makes it over here. I'm like [inaudible] when you talk about immigration, you going to get good and bad from every shelter. You know, Castro with 79 opened up this prisons in the Mario and you got 100,000 Cubans and I'm like a thousand fucking spoiled rotten savages from Cuban prisons where they would no clothes in this. They have to shit in a hole in the middle of the floor. This averages, they're animals. They got no problem taking your life from a piece of toilet paper, but the same one's true from other countries. You get the good and the bad from other country, you know, let's not beat around the bush before Russians come here. They going to course they go to a school and to take a 12 week course and to come here and get money right off the bat.

Speaker 1:          01:43:04       How to go to the social security. Check that out, Jamie. That's a very weird one. They get taught how to come here and scam the system. Whether you want to call, scan, I'm not putting nobody down. I have a tons of Russian friends. I love him. I'm not saying them bad, but I've heard that's a fact. I've heard them from them. I have a friend who was married and she told me one day that before they come here, they take a course to prep them on how to get money. As soon as they land, three days after they get them, they land. They get caching and Dola paperwork. What to say. They coach. That's hilarious. This is like a service that they offer. Some type of class, the system works. But if you want to, some of the systems still tell you how to do that. How many Armenians

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       come over, come over and get citizenship? Guess what they do? They get social security and they moved back to our meeting and they get the check sent back to Armenia. They have a system on how to do that. They got a thousand loopholes now brother. And if you learn those loopholes, you get caved the fucking system.

Speaker 2:          01:44:10       There's nothing wrong with having a group of people that all agree on certain rules, right? Which is what the United States should be. But the problem with having a group of people is you, you don't get to pick like who's in that group. So you just deciding instead of being admitted by your merit or how how good a neighbor you are or how nice of a person you are. Now you just whether or not you were born on the dirt like that, we born on this dirt or that dirt cause you're born on that dirt. You can't stay. But if you're born on this dirt, even if you're a shit human being, you get to hang out, you get to ruin other people's lives while you're here. As long as you don't do enough that we need to put you in a cage. And then if we do, we keep you for a couple years and let you out and you do more. I mean, this is, we have no problem with that.

Speaker 4:          01:44:53       I Dunno what the fuck, what the percentage is. What the fuck was I going to tell you? I don't know what it was. Thought it was what you said.

Speaker 2:          01:45:05       People versus bad people that come in across the border. The thing is, every time there's a bad one that comes across the border, it's highlighted as an example of why we've got gotta keep the border closed and they have a point. They all have a point. Absolutely. When you see someone who was talking about illegal gang members, they're sneaking across the border and murdering people. It absolutely has happened. It's 100% of a real thing. This is not, not fiction questions. How much does it happen? And, uh, how much better is it for those people's lives that make it across? Is there a way to screen better to make sure that the bad people don't come in and all of these questions are legitimate? You know, you don't want a bunch of fucking evil vicious people from another country in your neighborhood. That's how everybody feels.

Speaker 2:          01:45:43       You don't want your children in your family to be in danger because someone's snuck across the border and they have a long history of working for the cartel, murdering people. That's a real thing. It's a real possibility. So all the people that are vigilant, all the people that are scared, you know, they're probably smart to be scared. Look at fucking human history. People are capable of doing some awful shit. No one's saying like, I'm not, I don't think there should be no, no wall at all. Nothing stopping people from coming across. You definitely don't want pieces of shit coming over here. Well,

Speaker 4:          01:46:12       let me ask you, this was how they find out. Did you ever notice that maybe we're full. Yeah, we're probably, maybe we're full. Did you notice that when you go on, there's homeless people on Ventura fucking boulevard on Lankershim Boulevard under bridges everywhere. Has that ever come to your mind that anywhere way you go, there's cars everywhere and the between Uber and Lyft in cabs now there's trafficking. Every major fucking city. There's that lock or whatever. Did you ever notice that? Maybe it's not that I hate Cubans and Mexicans or Puerto Ricans or blacks with Germans, Irish maybe that will fucking fall. Have you ever come to that conclusion that we're just full, right? Yeah. We have to take five years off. Like I would accept that. I would accept that. I would accept special circumstances. Like why are you have family or so, but at this point right now we're fucking full bro.

Speaker 4:          01:47:02       Yeah. Yeah. We'll fall. We don't have nowhere else to put anymore. We really don't look at no eddies unless we pack them all to Iowa and send them all, you know, send them all into my, where's the highest population of Mexicans in the country? I would probably say southern California. Wrong. Indiana. Chicago. Chicago. Yeah. Hi. They farm a ton of shit up in Chicago. I'm going to make sense. Illinois, you know, where's the highest population of Puerto Ricans? The Bronx. You're wrong. Cleveland Clinic, because in the 50s they shipped, they all the dealers were with, uh, taking Puerto Rican is putting them into the Cleveland, Ohio area to work in the fucking Ford plants and all those type of plants. And after all those places, sat down, all those people sitting there holding on to that Dick. When you go to certain parts of Ohio, there's a suburb outside of Cleveland.

Speaker 4:          01:47:57       12 fucking Puerto Rican. Wow. You know, interesting. But it's, I don't think of it as we hate Russians or Germans or anything. I look at it from a different sprint back to the times and maybe will fall. You know, it's for me to send my daughter to the date cam cost rebills a week. I'm not complaining. That's a great day. Kids a science camp, they make potions than learn about light bulbs and electricity. My point is, I did the same thing for free when I was a kid. All I do is walk to my park. There's no funds left. There's nothing left for these kids. You know? I don't know. When I walk into a dodger game or an event, I go, I always think of the family of four in America today that both parents have to work and everybody has to work. If you go by my office with a podcast in the middle of the, say 24 hours a day camp, and we tell him to leave my office at midnight, I see parents picking up their kids, you know, carrying them out over their shoulders into that car.

Speaker 4:          01:48:58       You know, it costs a lot to control the American family. There's not a lot of jobs. Wait, you see everybody's driving Uber. If you take all this, Uber's is interesting. I'm thinking of doing a documentary. I'm just going Uber's and talking to these people and ask them why they Woburn. Yesterday I had an engineer engineer lost his job. 58 years old, got to work Asian fellow. Very nice. I tipped him extra. He offered me to plug the phone. I mean, you know, you have to look at that and go, wow, there's a lot of people in this country without work. There's a lot of fucking homeless people and we're running out of money to take care of what we got here. It's true. Like there's, La has an epidemic of homeless people right now where there's so many tents on the street and at the fucking dammit,

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       they're everywhere. I mean it's definitely, it's fucking Lankershim. Yeah. You know what they're, when they're in Sherman oaks. Yeah. The streets on Heidi on the underpasses on their passes are stuffed with them now. Something else. I mean, we have to, what are you going to do with, you can't walk through those underwear. You know what the answer is? You know what they usually do with them? Wow. They give them 100 bucks and they give them a bus pass to Vegas and now Vegas has stuck with them. We talked about that on the pocket tools. Every city's done that. Every city keeps doing you just kidding around like shit. It's time to get fucking some apart and put a 10 city and make him be resourceful. We'll give them more than 110,000 empty rental units in Los Angeles. Filling those spaces won't solve the housing or the homeless horizon.

Speaker 1:          01:50:32       Yeah, but the problem is if these fucking things are for rent and you have these homeless people that are drug addicts and probably mentally insane and you let them stay in those rental apartment, they're going to destroy your rental place. Well, let's be honest, there's 110,000 on. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Because all depends on what kind of homeless person you're talking about. You're talking about a person who's down on his luck. Are you talking about a mental illness, mental illness, drug addiction that stuck violently. When I see 60 when I see a hundred when I see 10,000 homeless people and I'm like, I got to assume 4,000 of them are people are down that look at me. The slip, they got four flat tires and it just get, you know this time people go through shit for periods of time. It could be a year. It could be.

Speaker 1:          01:51:17       It's like these fucking icos. Every fucking three days. A hike against lost. Okay. Yeah. These hikers gets lost and they stroll off when they get saved, they're all happy. You see on my witness news happy. Wait till they get the bill. They get hit with a bill. Oh yeah. Every time. Most went through those helicopters calls. So they, there's talks and teach groups that's volunteer. If every fucking Hika got paid for, for a fucking taxpayer, we'd be broke. So like in Colorado, so if you're one of those hikers that goes and snaps her ankle and you're on on a ridge somewhere, they come and get you. That costs somebody money. You gotta pay somebody. There's no fucking tax funds. Just that cost. Well, it's going to cost a lot of money. You get hip listening. If you like lady who got stuck in Hawaii for a week, wherever the fuck she was a month ago, those helicopters caught something.

Speaker 1:          01:52:10       She got stuck in Hawaii. Oh, I lady, the lady teacher, you know they found her, right? Yeah. They found them. I assume. I'm just saying this story just because what happens if something like that happened to see it and you get hit? You ever get involved in a lawsuit? Okay, and the lawsuit I rear end Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan's neck and the, God forbid his neck and his back hurt. You can't do God's right. You file a claim against me while you're going to the doctor, right? All those months. What is the doctor usually Rick Bell, yet everything's payable 30 days. That dirty is it? [inaudible]. When you start getting those 1100 a dollar bills from when they look in your knee and then your neck, when you get 10 of those, how are you going to pay him? Because you can't pay it. You get the settlement from the fucking attorney.

Speaker 1:          01:53:02       A lot of times people go broke by the time they get the money. The ship has sailed. It takes seven years to get that money. You've been going to the doctor for three days waiting to concurrence covers all this one insurance. We'll tell everybody with the net collars, is this more complicated? What's that? Tell everybody with the neck collars. Oh yeah. It's more complicated. Yeah. So all those bills add up. You get hit with a bunch of bills. Joe, you're homeless, you're homeless, it's you and your wife, whatever. It's homeless. Unless you have parents and you know you're homeless and you're in there. So when I look at the homeless situation, when you hit me with a 50,000 number, which is a lie, if you go around that way, it's a lie. I land at the airport and hooked that fucking thing onto the four or five north and look under that.

Speaker 1:          01:53:46       There's a hundred people just under that. So whatever number they tell you, what do you think they'd tell you as far as like homeless population in la? I don't know. I know God said he was under fire. Like I know that fuck. Yeah, like the people are pissed because they gave $2 million. They gave $2 million. They gave him money and they didn't do Dick. Oh really? Yeah, they gave me some type of money. You got to put up some shelters. I saw that up in North Hollywood studio is a church that on Thursdays they go and take showers there. You know, there was a place in Maine that was a offering. They were offering young couples. They wanted young people and young families to move up there because uh, it's tough to get people to live and some of those parts of Maine, so they offered incentives for young people to move up there and a lot of African folks started moving up there.

Speaker 1:          01:54:36       You know, they found out that that was a good place to be. And so they like filled up a lot of their shelters up there. There was a, an article about that. See if you could find that interesting. It's like, hey, they'll, they're like, look, I know it's cold as fuck, but we'll take a chance there from a war war torn part of the world. And if they could just be cold in Maine and be at peace, they beggars can't be choosers. That's why Marcus Davis lived up there. I asked him, remember UFC fighter? I asked him like, why do you, why do you like it in Maine? He's like, there's no fucking crime. He goes, it's none. He's like, there's none. He goes, everybody's nice. It's cold as fuck. But everybody's nice. There was a comedy club up there. Where was it? Comedy Club was on a wharf and it floated. No, where's, where's that came from man of a month. A Marley, Bob Marley's from Maine. It was a man came up to the club. Ones that more asylum seekers arrive in Portland, Maine from southern border is city debates assistance. Portland's human resources director criticizes comments by Mayor Ethan Strimling welcoming the arrival of more immigrants.

Speaker 6:          01:55:45       It say that they're all from Africa, isn't to say specifically Africa, but they're buying them bus tickets to go from like San Antonio and tech other parts in Texas. Oh, I think this is a different one. This is a different thing. Yeah. Um, just, just Google it from Africa. Did digital main African shelter. Damn. And this shit popped up. This gym, this one, this, that's just one person. A new migrant surge from the board of this one from Central Africa. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:56:13       Interesting. Uh, but you know, for other people in other parts of the world going, I'll take it. I get it. Maine is, it is cold as fuck for a good stretch of the winter, but you know, they just stay in doors and keep the fucking heat on. Whoa. La Population, La county homeless population jumps. So from 2011 it was 39,414 and in 2019, it's 58,936. So it jumped up a fucking ton to almost 20,000. And that's a just over a period of eight years. That's crazy. That's a lot of people cause a couple of dudes by my house I take care of, there's a couple of dudes that live in shopping cards. I always drop a little food. There's one dude that was like, he's like a soldier with PTSD and he lives in the park. He's gotta be six, four, two 80 big black. What do you want to do?

Speaker 1:          01:57:08       Every time I see him, I pull over. I give him a 20 I introduced him to my wife and my daughter. I go, you see anything used to just attack, he's just attack. You rip them apart. When my daughter started going to Grandpa's school, I saw them when they walk walking by the grandmas who I pulled right up, I go that you see that grandma's go right there. Go. My daughter goes to school. You shouldn't be suspicious. White people, you just rip them apart or whatever. Lay there. He has a Rambo knife, Rambo, bigger than ramble. I love him. I love him. Took that. You could see where the PTSD and mental health, he won't take showers, but he's got a heart of gold. Whenever he sees me, he smiles. It gives me a thumbs up. I never said I believed that neighborhood tag he is.

Speaker 1:          01:57:52       I seen him in that park. Maybe six. Never violent behavior. He doesn't drink alcohol, so I know he's not just a fucking drunk. He just can't get a job. He just mental health. No, it's a mental health issue. It's, he's a veteran. I asked him, how you doing? What's going on? They told me his whole like a little story as much as he could without being embarrassed. So I just do every time I seen him I just put money in his pan and he's as happy as a pig in shit, but he's a fucking stone killer. They ain't going to be no bleed, no shootings at that kid's schools cause I got them checking it out three times a day. You think I'm kidding. I don't think you think I'm kidding you. I love him. I love him. Did that. My wife waves at them. We beat by them mercy waves at them. Everybody's happy with it just so there's no misunderstandings. I got a little piece of mind. Is there ever

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       going to be a time when there's no bad neighborhoods? Is that possible? Is it possible to have a place where there's no crime at all? What do you think? Does that ever really going to be possible? I mean, it's definitely better now than it ever has been before. And you could think that if, if things move in the same general direction, there'd be less crime 100 years from now than a hundred years ago. But do you ever think there's going to be a time where everywhere is safe? You know, the Internet gives you a lot of education on what cities that have no hard time. They don't tell you, but they don't really feel yet. You know, every weekend you see the murder camp in Chicago. It's crazy. Every weekend the murder con Chicago, these fucking countries ain't no safer. Dominican Republican, Puerto Rico a couple of years, but think about a year ago that is many shootings in Puerto Rico. One weekend as they do in fucking Chicago on the weekend. You know, look at the shit that happens in La. We don't hear everything. What's happening? Dominican Republic, all these people are dying. I die. I don't know what does that to many bar. It's this. It's that. What do you think Jane? What's it? What do you think Jamie?

Speaker 6:          01:59:43       Speculation. I heard that there's lots of deals that get made from like front, like if you had a friend that was like maybe refill in mini bars, your other friend would then refill the little bottles with not actual liquor or something like that and like they just kind of refill those. I've seen videos online, it's not actually happened in the Dominican Republic, but where all inclusive resorts, so that's what the video said. They're just refilling bottles of Kabocha and Hennessy and all sorts of, just like with Brown water, I don't know what the fuck they're even doing. It's like a whole system. They have this like 15 people. The little factor in the back of the shed on the beach just filling up empty bottles of shit. So just ripping people off. I don't know if that's what's happening in the Dr, but that's what I've read. Speculation online says that there's this sort of something going on online. Not any, it's again a speculation. It's nowhere legit. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:00:30       There's, see that seems to make sense, right? If someone had a scam and those little mini bar bottles or kind of expense on a bad batch and just like you get bad batches of drugs, they've got to find out they got some homemade fentanyl or whatever. Yeah, yeah. Maybe they got some bullshit homemade booze that's poison that got spread around. Yeah. Yeah. But the whole thing is suspicious that they're doing kinky shit at the hospital. Kinky Shit. Yeah. What kind of Kinky Shit? No answering no answer. No, I blow. We don't know. Oh Blah, blah, blah. You know what it is? They probably overwhelmed. Imagine if we're sitting over here talking about it, how many people have been calling them? How many people are furious because they lost their loved one over there. They don't know what the fuck is going on. And then someone said that it's not necessarily really an uptick that does not necessarily really an uptick of deaths.

Speaker 2:          02:01:21       It's just that they're highlighting every time someone dies and that the reality is people die all the time. I don't know if that makes sense. You know, like, I mean how many people, if you were just looking at Los Angeles, they come here and they visit when I'm having a heart attack and die. It might be a lot, you know, we don't know. I mean, how many people come over here from another country every day and wind up dying while they're here? Is that a normal thing that people do? Cause people do. I mean, if people are dying of heart attacks and all sorts of strokes and all sorts of other shit, is that because someone's doing something to them or is it because 100,000 people a day come over here and one of them a day dies? I don't know what those numbers are. I don't know if it's legit. What'd he show them? People that died. It's number grant numbers. I guess this looks like only maybe 12 to 15 people since March. March. That's a lot. But is it, I don't know. I don't know if that's it. Or here in California, all these people are older than no people. 50 or older. Yeah, fit you right. Which can happen in any point in time, especially if you're on vacation doing Viagara, drinking straight Jack Daniels, fucking up a storm,

Speaker 4:          02:02:30       other than

Speaker 2:          02:02:32       you could have a heart attack, bro. But all jokes aside, no disrespect is that, can you a Google? How many people is this an uptick or are really, is it, what's the best way to say this? Die Per year. Yeah. Yeah. What's the annual tourist rate towards death rate and is it any different from what we're experiencing now? Because it would be weird if we just found out that no, this is just what happens and they're just making a big deal out of this for a story with this that you know, 55 year old drunk guys die every year.

Speaker 4:          02:03:03       Dominican Republic and Cuba and in Puerto Rico and people get hammered on vacation. Brows don't like it. You know what I heard about Dominican Republic pulled back on that. I have no reason to go there. Why they saw cocaine on the beach. I do not like that idea at all. When I heard that they sold cocaine on the beach at a, what's the big Mexican resort? Where the people go for spring break. Oh, I said one, but oh yeah. Tell them no, no. I told them they can't go and can't come. They sell coke on the beach. All those times when you sell coke on the beach, I don't want to be on that beach and I was at trinity. You know what I'm saying? I just have this weird feeling about that they sell coke on the beach. They do that in um, Costa Rica too. I had somebody offered me some below. No. Yeah, yeah. I feel sexy. Stab a funny joke about that.

Speaker 2:          02:03:59       But walking down the street and someone's trying to say, I see coke, coke. You've got coke. We've got, we'd got coke. The guy would see me. Heroin. I think it find heroin, I think goes the fuck. Why'd you think I wanted heroin? Man, I can afford coke. Very funny one. About 2.7 American Americans visited Dominican Republic last year, which publicly releases data on only about natural deaths such as car crashes and drowns does not release information about deaths by natural causes such as heart attacks or strokes. Even though it compiles reports on Americans who die on all Americans who die abroad. It's a matter of statistics that certain number of travelers

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       will, will suffer serious illnesses, accidents, and even death while traveling internationally. The death rate in the Dominican Republic is not any higher than the death rate in the states official said. That's what I'm talking about. When people visit other countries, don't expect them to stay alive because you don't expect them to stay alive here. They die all the time. But when you're talking about what did they say, what was the hundreds of thousands? How many hundred thousand people visit the Dominican Republic every year? 2.7 million visited last year. Americans visited last year. Oh my God. Really? 2.7 million. Yeah. Wow. The fucking 10 people died. 1112 people have died. I guess. Why did I think it was hundreds of thousands? It's way more last year. 11 people died last year. No, this year. This year. A couple months last, but 12 people. That's a lot of fucking people going over there. Man. People die. But meanwhile, everybody's scared to go to the Dominican Republic. So it's like probably killing their business and okay.

Speaker 1:          02:05:31       It was fine until we track out the mini bar. Come on man. Are you sure? You know some? Some people I'm sure are getting the, the scary one was the lady who got attacked. There was a lady who got attacked. They beat her half to death. She has no idea what happened. She saw a guy with an outfit on from the resort, let go an employee's outfit and he fucking clubbed her and beat the shit out of her and she doesn't remember anything. [inaudible] he left her for dead and when they found her they thought she was dead. You know, bro. Shit, for the last 10, 20 years, there ain't nowhere I really want to go. Hawaii's awesome. I'm scared of all that shit. Go to Hawaii. It's the United States. We will, I'm the nicest fucking people in the world. Yeah, go ahead Joey. Or you know, my wife and I said, Donald, we're like all the places you want to go.

Speaker 1:          02:06:21       It's a six hour fucking flight. It's true. You know, go while doing what we do. We got some of the best coach in the world here. If you stopped down by San Diego, mix it up a little bit. One of the beaches go up north to Santa Barbara. Go even up a little north, you know, so we're going to do that a little bit. I mean, Santa Barbara is beautiful. Santa Barbara is beautiful. Be On vacation, you know, and you're an hour away. We take too many fucking planes to be on six hours to go to fucking Miami or New York. I told about taking it to the Jersey shore. I thought about doing a lot of shit like that. This so what you can do too. You could do a couple day trip, like go to Santa Barbara for a day to Santa Barbara. Go up past the San Luis Obispo. That's real nice. I don't know if you know this like fucking eight hour days there.

Speaker 1:          02:07:09       I hate holidays cause it's softened such this look like guys like you and me. We worked through everything but this mother fuckers, the two weeks before Christmas, they shut down on my ass. They start singing jingle bells or shit, you know, a week before mother's Day, a week before Memorial Day. It fucking kills me. Like this memorial date killed me. You got to figure, I was in New York for three weeks, you know, walking around. I was like, come home in the first day. I come back the Memorial Day weekend. Nobody's having a party. Nobody's doing shit. Finally Monday I told my wife, I go, fuck it. I got tickets for the dodger game. Let's go to the dodger game and what are you doing for the fourth? I'm going to the beach. Nice. I'm leaving fucking Wednesday morning. When did we have a barbecue over my house for the fourth when you brought your daughter, when was the last time?

Speaker 1:          02:07:55       That was like three years ago. Years ago? Yeah. She was two or three. She was so, you know, she's six. She's so cute, man. She pointed to me and went, Yuck. I asked her the other day. I go, you don't say yuck no more. Then she goes, Nah, I grew that. I came close to where you were holding her. I came closer to say hi. I'm like, how are you? Which is like Yuck. And now if she sees you, she goes, I know him. Yeah, that's what she still remembers you. She's got, you know, that's the door. The kids memories are horrible. And I remember being a kid and going to my mom's bar and there were certain people that would walk in and my Mama Go, before you say anything, I don't want you to know that he remembers everything. He doesn't react to you.

Speaker 1:          02:08:40       He'll tell me at two in the morning, I would think my mom, shit like that dude came in, he had a gun, he had something on his nose and my Mama Go, Jesus fucking Christ. So my mom would, and that's what's crazy about kids. You a little people, they in another room having a conversation with your wife. Three days later she'll tell me what that conversation was and I'll just look at it. I don't smoke in the house no more. She's busted me once, but she never said nothing to nobody. This is, I can tell she's a Da. She keeps her mouth shut. I walked out, she was right there and I said, I was talking to, her smoke was coming out of my mouth. She didn't say one word to me and she hates smokers. Like she fucking eight smokers. Not because it's bad for them because they ruined the environment.

Speaker 1:          02:09:25       That's hilarious. She's nothing about health. She's like, they know good people. Smokers are no good because they're running the environment daddy. So I'm like, okay, what are you going to do? No, I'm thinking about the Hawaiian thing. I want you to hook me up from a to z. Let me know. I know it's a certain [inaudible] to go playing. What time would he is? Cause I don't know what time of the year ago. Okay. That's all bullshit. Fuck yeah. For Hawaii. Okay. I'd go to Hawaii any day. The air so that you don't go from like December to February cause it ain't no season or nothing like that. We went in June before that we went, last time we had gone was in January or December. Yeah. It's um, it's beautiful. The people are so nice, man. It's just, it's last time. I shouldn't say this, they'll probably get getting mad. You're going to make more people come over there. It's fucking, it's an amazing place to live, man. They live in paradise. They live there. They're on an island that's created by a volcano in the middle of the ocean and it's fucking gorgeous. It's so pretty. What was just crazy? They show in the water. Uh, we saw a lot of, um,

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       a lot of dolphins, man, [inaudible] spinner spinner dolphins, I guess they call them. I guess that's what kind of dolphins they were. I don't remember what kind of dolphins. Um, but back in December we saw whales. That was awesome. That's amazing man. You see fucking whales breach the surface of water. Like whoa, Wild Ben just out there in boats and he look for his splashes in the distance and then we saw them that big schools a dolphins, they swim under your boat. It's wild shit man. You know, cause they're just these crazy sea mammals that are super intelligent, live in the water right off. Went off the coast. I mean, that said it's such a paradise because what Hawaii has it? No, the place does is it's fully surrounded by the most beautiful, pristine water. There's no shit beaches on Hawaii. It's all gorgeous water and then scuba G. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:11:28       No, he snorkeled. Okay, so when you went to no, no. That's kids the fuck out of me though. I Wa that scares the fuck out of me. Shock. Scare the fuck out.

Speaker 4:          02:12:03       Yeah. Yeah. Where you, you were at, you go out and you're on your waist. Yeah. I mean you were playing. Yeah. We look at our parents and they're two miles away. It's very dangerous. I sold the fucking life guards. I had to be five, maybe five, maybe four. I was my first experience in Coney island. Second experience in Coney Island. They all, my cousins were jumping up and down. I'll never forget it, how to be hot, like those hot days. We ran in, you know, with swimming around and all of a sudden we look up and there was the biggest piece of shit. It was 1314 inches spinning around the beach, just floating past us, walking out and telling my mom, I'm never going back. That was the last time I went to Coney island and then I went to Jersey and I went to the beach and I loved it.

Speaker 4:          02:12:47       Everything was Hunky Dory and it started here about 2003 I went down to the beach and when we got there that got in, the lifeguard walks over, you know after you smoke a fucking joint, you got the SPF on you. The guy comes over and he goes to the beach. Isn't closed officially, but there's been a couple shark sightings this morning. So if you go into the wall, I just want you to know, let me know and wave over at me. This is when you come up here and you make the right turn down. Uh, you know, I don't know. Anyways, it's the other way of going down to the beach after four or five way to sunset and you get off. It's the other way. What Canyon did you go down? Topanga. Topanga. Canyon. Do It on that? Yeah, that time we got right there. As soon as we landed, had to be 2003, 2002 the guys set up, it's not close, but they'd been seeing the couple spots are tiny.

Speaker 4:          02:13:43       I always try to go in the ocean. I'm Cuban. My mother loved the beach. We always went. Every time I go to the beach, I go, what the fuck is wrong with me? And I buckle up. I take four steps, I dip in, and then I walk out a little bit. And once I start bouncing, I go on. Then I take a couple of strokes. Joe, I feel great. And as soon as one of those fucking things touch my foot. You never see a fat motherfucker run as quick as you see. I just run out straight and that's it. I put my SPF on and I don't go back on the water. I go in just to refresh myself. Did you see the fucking great wines they saw sold the coast, the jersey, the one that bit the guides and stuff, fish when he's bringing, did you see that unbelief?

Speaker 4:          02:14:28       That's not normal brother. I grew up in Jersey. There's always been sharks, but not great whites like that. Great whites started. The first time I ever saw a shark was in Montauk. Montauk is next to amity where they really shot. George. Charles is supposed to be hammering on one of those. If you look, I don't know what correctly it is when they shot George, it's supposed to be the coast of fucking Long Island, but if anybody knew when I was a kid, I used to go to Montauk all the time. That beach was no boy, no dog. You'd be on the beach and a fucking crab would walk up to you. They walked back with business cheese. This is unheard of guys. Come on. That's just biting their bully. Is that what that is? Is that a sack of meat? They're chumming it other chumming. Why is it biting that thing then? Is that definitely what's going on? What is the on that rope back there? Oh, it sort of ripped it apart. Oh yeah. Look there's salmon filets 2000 pounds or a fish. Fish. Filets they think

Speaker 2:          02:15:35       the shark was 2000 pounds. Sorry to stop. Stop doing this. Cause it's hard for me to tell what's going on. Okay. They dangled, so what is it biting? What is that yellow thing? It's like that. Oh, buoy or something? Yeah, it looks like it. But why would it bite a buoy? It's a fucking animal. But you see how they have that piece of fish? They were dangling in the water. It seemed to me like they were trying to earn that, but that would, that fish, it was already filleted so it's like the body, the head and the tail. It seemed to me like they're putting that in the water to attract sharks. I bet they know a spot where sharks see, see what I'm talking about? See, that's the part of the fish that you can't, you know? It's like he's got it opened up like a filet and they're dragging it through the water, I think to try to attract them.

Speaker 4:          02:16:20       Maybe they saw it and they're like, let's see if we can get a close on. Yeah, maybe. Right? Yeah. Fuck Shit. Nevermind. Get it away. Throw it. Yeah. See they're throwing that in the water. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       Definitely try to bring them closer to the boat. I don't give a fuck them. They put a leg in the water, looked at the size of that fucking thing off the coast of Jersey. That's what makes you want to scratch your fucking head. That a week later our seal attack, the girl in the California beach, a seal. I saw one where a seal grabbed a girl's leg and pulled her into the water off a dock. That was a different one. This is another, this is another one, and they're blaming it on a chemical in the ocean. Hello knocks or something like that that wants to seals. Uh, get that in. Look at this girl. How she got dragged in. Cause look at this. Look at this. My brother.

Speaker 3:          02:17:11       Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          02:17:13       Oh my God. Yeah. Don't fuck that. Why something's going on. Shit. Holy Shit Bro. I think the climate change is everywhere. It's all over. And the flag is that every toll that thing car like wow, that's crazy that they got it on video too. It just jumps up and bites her fucking leg. Maybe to pay back to this week. The dogs trying to get the dog. Yeah. I don't know what's going on here now. It's a big giant shark. Oh Gee. And then the rest of the dogs come in to help its buddy and it sort of stays for a second. I thought maybe it had one and they're trying to get it to release it. Did it. I don't believe so. Looking at Jesus Christ, that's a really crazy fucking video. But the dogs are huge also. There are no other bitch ass dogs like yes. Be too sharp.

Speaker 2:          02:18:06       Savages like that. That's a fucking shark, bro. No dog. You gotta be very careful. You gotta be very careful. Now something's going on and you have to do think the world's coming to an end. Not at all. What do you think? How many Bravo fuck the world. We got whistling and Dick until something happens. But we'll make all these shark attacks, especially on the east coast the last three weeks. Well, here's one thing, especially on the east coast, one thing could be lack of food, right? I mean, they overfish the fuck out of the ocean. People know for a fact that that's a real problem. That's a real problem over fishing's a giant problem. They're worried that the ocean fish in some parts of the world will literally be extinct. There'll be nothing left and 50 60 a hundred years. Who knows if they don't clean up their act, but you'll see the way they do with commercial nets.

Speaker 2:          02:18:53       Just, just throw those fucking things in and just insane. Wide Nets just scooping up everything and then they, they get all these fish and they dump them in the huddle of the boat and it's, it's crazy how much fish they kill. It's crazy how much, what a desire for fish we all have. But if sharks run out of shit to eat and then the seals run out of shit to eat, the sharks start running out of seals when they start going after people. What do seals eat? That's a good question. I don't imagine they eat fish.

Speaker 3:          02:19:24       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:19:26       right. Here's goal. Yeah. Seals up in San Francisco. We're getting killed by sharks. We have such a eye level at such a high level that I guy was on a surfboard and I couldn't imagine why the shark bit them. And then they looked into it and they said from underneath the shark just sees they see us. I'll see you. Yeah. Yeah. Was a crazy video of a shark taking a seal out out on this one right here. Right in front of all these people on the, on the Marina, the Alcatraz, Alcatraz. Okay. Watch this. Back it up a little bit. What's the splatter? The shark just jacks his fucking seal right in front of everybody. They're all looking out. Watch this. Boom. Look at all that blood. And everybody's like, what the fuck? So oil slick a blood. The shark comes out of the water with the seal.

Speaker 2:          02:20:18       I mean, look at that blood that is madness. Bright Red Blotch and a fucking huge shark destroying a seal in front of everybody just to let you know, that's their world. There is monsters right there. It's just they can't get out of the water. I mean, imagine if that was like right next to the woods and you know that if he didn't go into the woods, you'd be okay. But if you did go into the woods, there's a giant gray thing that moves 30 miles an hour that just bite the legs and arms off of everything it runs into. Is that what the village was? They scared them from going into the woods because something's going to kill them if they, yeah, they, they'll, they put on a, a costume. The village was about a bunch of people that didn't know that it was like 2000 and [inaudible] they're going to die by something.

Speaker 2:          02:21:05       Yeah, they scared them with some costume or some shit. Right. Giant Shark. But that's what it's like when you're sitting on the dock. They're looking out at that shark fucking up, that seal in the water. It's right there. I mean you could just jump in. I mean it is sort of like being at the edge of the woods, watching some mythical monster tear apart. A creature in front of you. We spoke when you went Hawaiian. That's the first thing I said to you though. I'm looking out for the sharks dog. I'm worried about nothing happened were fun and they got hammerheads down there. Well there's a lot of tiger sharks, tiger sharks bite people. Bull sharks are apparently the most dangerous and they are the weird ones because they go to freshwater, they'll go like they found bull sharks way up near Illinois, like near Chicago on rivers, bull sharks getting fresh water and swim all the way up the river.

Speaker 2:          02:21:55       In fact, Johns was actually inspired by bull sharks that bit people over like a successive couple of days in New Jersey, in a river in New Jersey. That's the actual original story. That inspired jaws came from shark attacks and like, I want to say like maybe the 50s or some shit like that that were near a river in New Jersey. Freshwater river, speaking on the New Jersey. Something I want to show you, see if he could find that story. Jamie. I know there's been sharks sippy river. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly the same. Same kind of story. Yeah, exactly. They can go way up. They can survive in fresh water. The bull sharks are a, they're a weird animal. I think that monster guy that, that television show river monsters, that dude, that cool guy. I think that guy, uh, caught one somewhere, if I remember correctly, that guy that used to hang out with wildboys Steve-o and Chris Pontius Manny, he got into that water in the bay at San Francisco with like 200 bull sharks. The footage of it is fucking crazy. Oh my God. He's like, you seem so insane. There's no cage and nothing, nothing. Mama CBOE. How about when Steven was on that fucking tree and the lions jumped up in the tree to be with them? Like what the fuck's on there? T they took his hat from him, took his hat off his head and like

Speaker 1:          02:23:11       what? What, what, what? Like he was inches from death. One of your fans sent me an article for you about six months ago. Really interesting. I got it somewhere. My phone to gets on toilet. So Rocky Balboa, rocky mountain more so. Vesta alone was a young guy and he went into a gym in Bayonne because he wanted Chuck Wepner owners trainer to train him. But Chuck Wepner, his Tryna told him to fuck off because so investors, that alone had done porn social vessel salon the way out stole chuck weapon's notebook that he wrote in and that's, we took the idea for rocky is a true attribute here. This, I never heard that there's isn't,

Speaker 2:          02:24:03       maybe it's true despite the fact that still Sloan was sued by Wepner in 2003 for using his story for rocky. He ultimately settled for an undisclosed amount of money in 2006 according to Forbes, seems to be in good spirit about whitners tale being told on the big screen and an interview with deadline chuck producer Mike toll and said this Stallone was supportive of everyone involved reading the script and even showing up on set. He and live had positive dialogue during shooting. Totally about check about it,

Speaker 1:          02:24:32       chuck. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          02:24:35       Um, that's weird that he's used his story for rocky. So the idea was that he uses story when Chuck Wepner fought Muhammad Ali based on, nobody kind of makes sense that that would be based on, cause Carl weathers was Kinda like a Muhammad Ali character and rocky Balbo was Kinda like chuck Webster. But if I remember that fight correctly, I mean, I remember Muhammad Ali beating the shit out of Chuck Wepner. I don't remember it being like a close fight like they made, didn't they make that fight or draw wasn't rocky. He would draw the Muhammad Ali knocked him out. Chuck weapon low down. He beat him. He beat him up. They beat him up. He didn't knock him out. But I think he went, I think he went 12 round men. That might've been 15 rounds my thing back when they were doing 15 rounds, matter of fact, I think it did. I think if I remember

Speaker 3:          02:25:23       correctly, it went to distance. But again, my boxing knowledge is not like my MMA knowledge. It's like B level. What year was that? 1975 it was built as the give the white guy a break [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:25:42       oh my God, that's hilarious. They should've done that in rocky. He's knocked out in the 15th round. Okay. 15th row. So that's what I'm saying. It wasn't like rocky, rocky. The story of rocky is this guy who actually was a good fighter, but you just never focused himself, decides to focus himself for this preposterous opportunity to fight for the title and actually hurts them actually hurts him. And that's a draw at the end of the fight. It's a crazy fucking war and turns out to be a draw. That was not chuck Wepner story. I mean, unless they use part of Chuck Wepner his life. Yeah. He might have been, might have his may be some truth to that fucking story maybe. And stolen. There's always been known to have a sticky fingers. He stuck. You're filling the expendables. That was Eddie students. Yup. And that used to take them back.

Speaker 2:          02:26:31       There was in those days, that's what they did right. For people. But people don't know is, there's a couple people who do that. They meet with a guy, Jamie, I hate doing James. I got an idea. But like I moved back to Columbus also. The Lady Jamie turns the TV on and there's this story on TV. Jamie takes him to court and wins even has the notes. The appointment that his agent made for him to meet Stallone Austin Long has to shell him now is for the amount of the script. He doesn't have to give him proceeds of what he made. Yeah. So it's a tremendous scam if you do it and get away with it. I've listened. I'm not bad mountain alone. Let me tell you some, every time those Rockies come on, I watch those fucking things and I am more and more baffled that they kind of still hold up.

Speaker 2:          02:27:17       And what's really baffling about the Rockies is they keep on coming. I mean, you know, they're writing another one, creed crazy. Now they've got Michael B. Jordan. Yeah. You know, did you see the video of Michael B. Jordan going through that? A tactical course? It's fucking bad ass, man. I don't know what movie he's preparing for. Please prepare for some fucking crazy crazy shooting up movie. I guess. You know, I did the heron tactical. I did this thing with our boy and I didn't know like my boy was John Brenton was telling me that after movies he does, you got to go there at six months before the Joe Rogan. He's going through one of these courses like John Wick style. You've got to go through six months of this. It says it's a with for Black Panther. So this was when he was in that movie Black Panther. So he's preparing for it. She's a bunch of guns in that movie though. So, I don't know. Make sense? Yeah. He did shoot a lot of guns in that movie. Yeah, he was mercenary. Don't you remember Michael B? Jordan was a killer and that movie remember the hand to hand fight. So I guess, yeah, well there was that too, but I'm sure there was

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       some gunfights and just to be able to handle it and look and look like this, look like, I mean, I don't know enough about shooting to know if this looks good. It looks good to me though. You know what I'm saying? Or if you watch like Tom Cruise and collateral [inaudible] when he goes into the Japanese bond in Korea town or whatever it is, he's using tactical shooting. Right? Like it's real tactical. Yeah. I always knew that time cruisers and the ultimate professional, he, that's why he gets 20 80 million a movie, the whole deal. But when I talked to her boy, he was telling me, Nah, that all these movies now you go over there five, six months before the movie starts and it's, you know, eight hours of training. I mean you got to give it up for your boy John Wick. Oh yeah, he's 56 he's doing five hours a day Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          02:29:10       He's doing Jujitsu and he, there's a bunch of scenes of him doing that, so he did it with the Henry rifle, one of those Henry old school western rifle, sh bang. What are those called? You know those little load them up ones where you, I don't let her rest down to reload memory. When we were kids, we had those in the middle. You pumped them to strongly BB, your shot, your grandmother, you pumped it like 80 times. If you hate it, the mother Fucker, you start pumping that bitch at like six in the morning. You get all full. That was the ultimate dangerous. Who happened to give to a kid a fucking beat. We had everything. We had one of the, remember the risks rockets, rockets, was that what I call those tubes? Surgical tube. Oh my God. I had a friend that lived on the second floor and he would just peg off kids as they were walking home from school, Ritchie vantage checking God.

Speaker 1:          02:30:00       He was in school too. So he would run home from school, go on his fucking on his second third floor attic, lay on the floor like a mercenary and just shoot kids. They couldn't invest in him. My God. How funny was he? He would put nails, he would put downs and like tables like these school. So when people put their books down, they get caught by the nail. He was just a fucking nut. Now he's somewhere installing elevators in Pennsylvania somewhere. Who the fuck knows risks? Rockets are so dangerous. We used to use marbles. Let's take risks. Rockets buy a bag of marbles and get a wrist rocket. Oh yeah. Cause marbles. They fly consistently. You can get used to where the trajectory is gonna go. If you have a rock, you know the fuck knows how much that rock ways you know this rocks everything that rock. It's hard to figure out where the fuck things are going. But when you get good with a marble, you understand they're like right here. I kind of can judge the arc of that marble. You can start nailing things. You can start nailing things. And when you got your first marksman repeatedly, you would get the marks from repeat it. I never had one of those marks. Repeat Pallets, B B's and guards.

Speaker 1:          02:31:08       I had one of those and I was about eight my mother caught me, gave me a beat and I had the fucking double o seven knife. That's a knife from the 70s they either sold them in Newark or in Harlan. I remember several oh sevens that a wouldn't handle, wouldn't handle big. I used to get the paint, the jeans. Do you know when I was like by this third grade, you know, I used to shake him down on the way out and then the way. And do you know that? Because they were worried about, yeah. Oh, in the first, second grade before my mother put me in Catholic school, it was called shake down, take socks off. Wow. Socks. How much money you went out with. Does this count? No, no, that's a marginal repeat. Oh look at it. It was BBC pallets and that's where you put the dots up on top.

Speaker 1:          02:31:58       You had a lot of fun kids got shot by the cops. And holding that thing? None. What are you talking about? None. None. None. That's the seventies Nah. [inaudible] talk to you first before they shot you in the head. When did they start to shoot and they shoot you in the fucking leg? Back then they were normal people because they would neighborhood kids. They knows days. The cops in your neighborhood, 60% were from that neighborhood, so they understood the person. They understood the kid. They knew he had mental health. Now they'll get somebody from Culver city and put them in San Diego. They don't know the area. When we were growing up, especially when you were staying with your Grandpa, newer called those cops grew up in Newark, the road and stuff. Fucking crazy. Don't worry about them. It's when you go out over the Rogan's, you take your gun out.

Speaker 1:          02:32:45       You don't point it out, right. Joel, put the gun down when you see what I'm saying. Like the cops were members of the community, so they knew, so they knew they weren't going into everything cold. They weren't going into everything called I think the people that have to worry, the monster cops that pulled people over because you just fucking never know. You see what happened yesterday? The cop, the black dude in North Carolina or wherever he was, I don't know where he wasn't, sorry if it's North Carolina, he was smoking a blunt. The cop pulled him over. He fucking dragged the cop. Whoa. Grabbed him by the elbow, Jamie. I know you saw it on the news. Dragged them twice. Not once, but twice. The cop will try to pull the gun. Then the cop shot him in the leg. Oh Jesus. And he still dropped the cop off and he got away. Wow. What's out there? The hole in his leg? Yeah. No, they finally caught him. He went into the ambulance. You know, I won't get look at this. So he's just smoking the blot. Looking at him right in front of the cop. The cop said he smoked marijuana. So while he's driving off, is he holding onto them? Yeah. Oh, the side. So the guy tried to drive off and he hung on. It looks like he hung onto the car. Am I correct there? I don't know. I don't know. I can get the audio. That's um, when you, uh, seeds reaching for his gun, now look at what now look at that. Those bullets. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:34:17       I mean, just driving off with them in the car. He just dumped from the edge. I Rogo Shit. What? He just doesn't there and that got fell over on the dirt. He probably fucked himself. He fucked himself up. That poor guy. So was he holding on? So it's like when the car takes off, like what is he doing? It looks like he's holding on, said escalate Joe Rogan. I can't tell. So it usually has like it. Yes. So they usually have that panel. Who along the side where you put your leg up if you see standing on it. That's what I think is going on. But he's holding onto the window too. It looks like he's trying to hold it. Let's say he's got his arm in by this time he's got his lies. He's holding onto a seatbelt put up there. Right there. He's holding onto his seatbelt.

Speaker 2:          02:35:01       Yeah. No it is. Look at him. Look at his seatbelt. That is what he has in his hand. Oh, that is what he said. Oh yeah, that's it. That's what he has. So he's holding the seatbelt, man. She got his fucking gun out and shoots the guy. Not yet. Then he goes to grab for his gun. It's that when he shoots him, cause the dude does look like he at one point in time, man, leave me the fuck alone. Look at his grill. I'm just trying to smoke my motherfucking blunt. What is going on with his teeth? Is that like some kind of iced out grill? I don't know. Now that's when he starts out. Boom. He shoots him. Wow. But Ellie, he at least he shot him in the leg and not in the no. Right, right, right. But the whole thing seems rather crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:35:41       He's hanging on with just a gun by Dash Cam shows Florida man driving of course from Florida. Draft it off for the deputy dragging from his car after a traffic stop. The man is now facing an attempted murder charge. But okay. Was he dragging the car or was the guy hanging on? He was the guy hanging on while he's trying to drive off. Was that the same I guess? Yeah, but I mean, I don't know if he told you to stop, you can't go. So like he can't just drive away and just drive away. Once the car starts moving and he's hanging onto the door, you are dragging him? Yeah, so he's hanging onto the seatbelt and they're dragging him. What should matter? You got a hundred fucking stitches. Whether the guys walked around with a bandage slate. The dude who got pulled over though, he's hilarious. Play that again. His reaction, he just keeps puffing on the blunt, put them back. I look at him, he goes, I smelled marijuana man. What are you talking about? What? Look at him. He's hilarious. He's right out of a movie like he's just so sparkly. Are they? Is He have a grill on? Can you tell? It looks like he's got some kind of ice step grill. Am I imagining that again? Tell Joe Rogan what his name is. Rocco rakochy. He's got a wild name too. That is hilarious. The whole thing is so funny.

Speaker 5:          02:37:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:37:11       I hope the cops, okay. Rocky money. That's his name. His name is rocky money. I told you it off.

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       Yeah. Rocky money booed off. Damn. Cops done lit up. Rocky morning money. Rudolph Julia to boot. Oh, that's hilarious. The best name I've seen in 14 years on the job. Yeah, that's about as good as the name. Rocky money. Rudolph. That poor cow went to work yesterday with a positive attitude and it gets fucking drag.

Speaker 6:          02:37:44       They say smoking a black and mild in the cops. Like I smell weed news. I don't have weed. I don't have marijuana. So was it just the cigar? That's what he says. He said it's just a black and mild. It's a very distinct smell between a black and mild and marijuana. Well maybe if you're some goofy cop and busy and low. No, but I think it's marijuana. Pull them out of there. What do you think it smells? What does, what does a black and mild smell like? Is that what it's called? Black and mild. What does it smell actually wrong compared to smoking, but yeah, it's a very strange, the distinct smell. You can tell it between any cigar and a black and mind. You can pick it out. See, I don't know that. What if I had become a cop and I smelled that? Would I have to know what a black and mild smells like? He might've thought it was drugs. I was like, weed. What does it smell like? Thick cigarettes. Tobacco. A smoke? Yeah. It doesn't smell anything. Like weed smells. Great

Speaker 1:          02:38:33       pipes. I got a nice, it's close. Yeah. Isn't it interesting that like the smell of tobacco from cigarettes? It's Kinda gross smell from a cigar. Not that bad smell from a pipe. A lot of people like that smell like a lot of people like, like kids, like the smell of pipes smells like some tobacco burning in a pipe actually smells good. Weird. I like the smell of weed. Fuck all this shit. That pipe that bag in it. Yeah. Those, the older guys used to that smoke around them much. I know. If it was nothing may not makes a real, but what I'm saying [inaudible] drug. When I was younger, when I was in my teens, it felt like people were smoking more pipes at all the schools. A t there was a teacher in my grandma's schools smoked a pipe. I still remember a teacher from my high school vividly smoking a pipe.

Speaker 1:          02:39:28       I haven't seen anybody smoke with pipe. And Steven Crowder gave me one that's right here. I smoked him when he was on the show. Yeah, but he gave it to you for refill for brought tobacco and everything. It's not bad. It's kind of a pain in the ass. You got to keep it lit. You know, it's not something that just stays lit like a joint, you know, you gotta Kinda keep, it wouldn't make you feel like it's like tobacco, you don't, it gives you that little high. It's a nice little buzz like cigars. I think of the best version of that cause the cigar stays lip and you're getting it from the leaf to like cause like your tobacco, your saliva or rather as breaking down the tobacco. Obviously I'm not a scientist, but your saliva is doing something to the tobacco of the leaf and it may, okay. These little kids smoke

Speaker 6:          02:40:10       cigarettes. He's got a pipe. This little kid's got a pipe. Is that a, yeah, I was just

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       looking for kids. There's the one on the left. Have a cigarette. Yeah, he's got a cigarette. That's, this one's probably fake, but I know it's got a pipe that in the 50s and forties look at that kid smoking cigarettes in the lower right hand corner. Yeah. Kids are smoking shit. Yeah. Wow. Look at that. All the kids selling newspapers, they were all fucking addicted to cigarettes. Wow. Hey, do me a favor. Send me that picture. I want to try to get that picture. Printing it for the studio. That's like little rascals and shit. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Save. Save that picture. See if we can buy a copy of that. That was a kid and when they were growing up, north Bergen is named is Olson Family Olson that it'd be like telling them like Jimmy Olsen live next to a body shop by 13 he had already been smoking like fucking eight years.

Speaker 1:          02:41:04       I swear to God he had cavities, so he would just put the cigarette in the tooth gap and just leave it there. I'll talk to you with the cigarette in the cavity. His teeth are green. He's on Facebook now and say, I thought, Ooh, from time to time and shit that way by them, but that's how bad in the 70s and sixties I think the 50s kids were fucking smoking. Look at that Ad. Give your throat to vacation, smoke a fresh cigarette, camels, Shit. It's a doctor, a doctors telling you to give your throat a vacation. Chesterfield cigarettes are just as pure as the water you drink. Wow. People were evil back then. They just lied down on that one. The more doctors smoke camels when it say than any other cigarette. Well, of course I smoked camels. I like to relax as much as anyone.

Speaker 1:          02:41:58       Your t zone will tell you t for tastes t for throat brought out from the inside. We the first time you smoked a cigarette? Probably 14 or 15 what happened to you? I thought it was disgusting. I thought I was about like nine. I thought it was a fucking horrible. I got dizzy and other than turn the cigarette out, I almost put the bathroom on fire. My mother found that no good. The next time I smoked one again was many years later. Um, Adam Ferrara used to smoke and he gave me some of his cigarettes cause we were, we were doing some sketch, I don't remember exactly what it was about, but I was supposed to be smoking a cigarette and the sketch, I was supposed to be like some annoying poet smoking a cigarette. So I kept smoking a cigarette while we're practicing this thing and I'm just blasted out of my mind.

Speaker 1:          02:42:45       Three or four cigarettes in, we just smoke back to back to back and you don't smoke. Oh my God, the nicotine. I was like this is crazy. This is what you're doing all the time. I was like, you getting high all the time like this. A fact science advances new data that may completely change your idea of cigarettes. The experiences of camel smokers confirmed camels can literally relieve fatigue and irritability. That doesn't naturally too. It says it's all good. Does it naturally? Yeah, man. People just get sick. Crazy. Millions and millions of people got sick from smoking. Just taken it a big drag of chemicals mixed with tobacco. I didn't, they probably didn't mix the chemicals with them back then. Back then it was probably just actual tobacco. These, all of these ads are really good smoke after you strenuous exercise. Smoke after strenuous exercise. That's hilarious.

Speaker 1:          02:43:43       Asthmatic cigarettes. Imagine you've got asthma. Someone gives you a pack of cools here. This'll help you. Hey, what you need, what you need is camel. No filters. How about a lucky strike? Hilarious. How crazy is this? How crazy would it be if you took one of these ads? Like if you knew your grandfather died of cancer and you took one of these eyes and fucking took it to the cigarette companies. Got some bad ass attorneys. I said, you know what, man, look at what you guys were putting out in the fifties and sixties doctors favorite cigarette is Campbell cigarettes. Are you fucking crazy? If I think about the ad, think about how outrageous with what we know today that added outrageous. It's fucking outrageous ranges. So evil, my doctor's favorite cigarette. Cause they're telling you doctors and not saying like, no, they did not say like my accountant's favorite cigarette.

Speaker 1:          02:44:41       They're not saying my my police officer's favorite cigarettes. They're saying doctors to let you know it's going to be okay because they know it's not going to be okay and you know it's not going to be okay. You don't know. You don't know. You really don't know. I know you really don't know. You went to the movies, you tote, you're 10 years old, your father gave you a nickel, you went to the movies and Marlon Brando was smoking a cigarette in the wild one and all of a sudden you go home and you're like, and you tell your friend, wow, that looks so cool and your friend goes, smoking is bad for you. And you're like, no, I just saw an article. Four out of five doctors surveyed smoked camel fucking cigarettes and they look today. The actually, it's not bad for you. It can literally remove irritability, nose, throat, and accessory organs not adversely affected by smoking.

Speaker 1:          02:45:29       Chesterfields they did a six month study and they said nothing was first such report ever published about any cigarette. Oh, so it's chesterfields you just get them and you're okay. Imagine if there was one cigarette. I just had it nailed dog. I used to date a girl that worked at a crazy house. Like when people go on that crazy [inaudible] that she used to print it out. I was a broke comic. She used to bring me home cigarettes. I would smoke those cigarettes and go off the reservation. Oh. Like they will like low end cigarettes. You guys see this shit they put in there. I mean, I could tell a visible difference from what I smoked. A camel or a Marlboro light. Did you ever smoke sherm? What's charm? Sherm. You don't chairman's? No. Sharon was a, something they were doing where certain cigarettes they would dip in. Formaldehyde. I smoked weed with formaldehyde. What's that like? Tremendous. Just fucking traumatic. But I was into that shit at that time that Sherman supposedly turns people into a Zombie. You take the joint, you'd dip pad the formaldehyde or coat it. My friend would coat it, let it dry with it, get hard. So crazy. You smoke that shit and it be it. It'd be 10 hours.

Speaker 6:          02:46:47       Jamie, this says that it was, if it, when people were doing it, they would say it was embalming fluid because it would make you turn into a Zombie, but it was really just PCP.

Speaker 1:          02:46:58       Whew.

Speaker 6:          02:46:58       Really? They would call it embalming fluid. That's what the like urban dictionary and some things, and I'm looking up now calling like what? What it actually was, but did you look up sherm? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's fine. That's what it says. So it's a, it's a hoax. I don't know that it's up. I'm sure some idiots probably did find some formaldehyde or and bombing Flynn dip it in. But well, after all the bad press that PCP got,

Speaker 1:          02:47:17       I could imagine that people would eventually be like, all right, listen the, we've got to stop smoking PCP. So they had to sneak it in things he had a good PCP experience and other things. I had 50 good ones, good PCP experiences. But guys, to be honest, you, I didn't know I was doing PCP. Oh, they called it THC crystal THC crystals. That's what it was called. THC Crystal. How do you know it was PCP? Because years later I found that the crystal didn't fucking exist. Well, THC crystals is like the crystals off of weeks. So what they tell you at that time, you asked the dealer like where'd you get this from? Word on the street was you took stems, you threw them in an in a pot with boiling water. And when it comes to a head, the stuff that stays to the edge, you scrape that off and you put it into a powder form and that's what you snot, that was the word on the street.

Speaker 1:          02:48:13       But what it really was was PC fucking pee. It was animal tranquilizer. Oh, so they were just saying that so they could sell it so they could sell it. And then when you go into New York City in the 80s, when you went to the weed spots, yeah, they sold two types of weed, but they all felt called a thing. So the thing called trays, trays, trays, that's a $3 bag. So when you paid, they would sell you an uh, a $10 bag. A sense to me. You got five joints or something, then they would have like a special $20 from Buddha, Tai, and you would get three joints, two and a half joints, tight joints. And then for the tray you get a tight joint in is white powder that look like a line of coke when you put it on the table. So what you did was you rolled your joint and you took that white line. You sprinkled in the joint. You smoked it. Bye Bye Irene. Bye Bye Irene. And they always gave it a weird name, like

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       a Jim Jones. Oh Gee. The time after he drunk. You know what I'm saying? After kill those people. So they would give it, we had weird names. Jim Jones. How crazy was that? Suicide. They would give it to all these weird names. Jimmy Jones named the town Jonestown cause he know that's when the cops moving. When you name a town after yourself, like what are you doing? I'm just running Vernon Ville and not just the town but in Ghana. Yeah. And made people sell everything and move that. That's just a horrific fucking, you know, he's been the guy and a bunch of times, Steve Rinella. You know who he is? That guy from that? Yeah, he's been on my podcast to from the show mediator. Yeah. He's a recorded a bunch of episodes in Guyana, living with the people that live in the jungle. Fascinating Shit. Fascinating. Watching all those people live and he's interacting with them and hanging out with them, both fishing with them and shit.

Speaker 2:          02:49:59       Just wild man. They found pictographs on a rock that's on a river. They have no idea who made them knowing that how old they are just sitting there just probably a thousand years old. They don't know what they mean to some people from an ancient time ago in Ghana, I wrote the Shit on a rock and you can still see it today. I want to see what that fucking place looks like that Jim Jones had. Now they just did a whatever, but no, it's just a jungle that at just grew up. Just rolled over. They went back and they read, dug up the old stage. He had a landing strip too, right? Yeah. That's where he shot that dog. I still remember being a little kid and I'm showing, uh, the guy getting shot. The federal agent at camera falling? No. The governor or the senator they showed, they always showed this shot of the camera going down there.

Speaker 2:          02:50:46       The reporters are about to get on the plane and then a truck pulled up and guys just opened fire on them. I think I found with the camera rolling. Wow. The lady still alive. The senator, the woman did. She got shot, woman got shot. The congressman, whoever the congressman, the son of the love of God, he died but her assistant lived and somebody else left and they just got interviewed. It was either the anniversary or some shit. I hate all that shit. I can't see the people he took down there. He just, I don't know, culture dangerous. It's very dangerous when one person wants to be the only one to talk and tell you what to do and make the rules and be special. When you got that one person that gathers a group of people and has all those people listened to him without question and tries to say that he has the answers for whatever reason that's appealing to people. It's very weird, but people fall into that trap over and over and over again. When you have a strong confident man who is telling you what you know and then you see them giving into the power and for whatever reason, it makes it even more attractive to a certain segment of the population. When you see someone reveling in the power of being a cult leader, like a, I guarantee you, when that guy in Waco, what the fuck was his name, correct,

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       correct. David Koresh. I guarantee you when, when he was on the news and talking about how they'll never give up. I kid girls, we're probably beaten down his door trying to get in that cult. The crazier and the nuttier and the, the more more apocalyptic your message, the more people that want to join. It's weird and they, they, they, they're just, they just don't have the ability to discern, oh, this is not a good idea. This guy really doesn't have his head on straight. This guy might be fucking completely crazy. They've always realized those things. That fuck fest anyway. Oh, I got a 10 that guy slinging deck. He's arrested that crushed bang everybody's wife. Yeah. You got it. Yeah. Yup. The friend. I had a friend who grew up in a coat and the stories real, oh yeah, horrific. I know the friend. I know what you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          02:52:49       Yeah. Horrific. You know, so you look at this shit and you're like, I don't fucking dangerous. And anytime someone is running any kind of thing where they got to separate you from everybody else come to us, we're going to get you away from all those people. It never goes well. It fucking never goes well. It never goes well. They want control, they want control and control of you. And the best way to do that is get you away from all these other pesky people with all their questions. They don't know. But we know, we know what's really going on. We know what this is really all about. Next thing you know you're going to call it, how many cults are going on right now that we don't know about is like a gang of them that are just like bubbling under the surface. That one they found out about last year.

Speaker 1:          02:53:36       Right, and I was a Sexual York. That's a real, they throw them motherfuckers in jail over that one. Yeah. That next one, one is a weird one, right? Because I was like, motherfucker, actors and actors and actresses, which does a sex caught, right? They're all sex calls. Then she stopped saying sex calls. Right. Is there a no sex cult? No sex calls. It just, it's like Buddhist, like they go, okay, you got six, whatever you got. Just think about that. A Guy who tells you he's God, go blah blah, blah. Okay. Wife, crazy girl away in the middle of night as she comes back the next day smelling like cocking God knows what else and you have to store, respect the guy and call him God. Yeah, they do. Yeah. They such a sick, sick, fucking mind. It sick and you have to be in such a weak state as a human being.

Speaker 1:          02:54:27       They're really buying into that. You can't call them, you know, you can't call him. They just fucked up. We had state, maybe they had avoided them live somewhere. This is the way by filling it and just, I don't see it. I can never join a Co. Well there's a bunch of different things could have gone with the leader and you got to give me your money. You got to do all, you got to sell your house. All those people that went to Jonestown and sell their home whenever they add and give them money to, hey, did you see why? Wild country, wild, wild country. Now, what is it? It's a Netflix documentary about the Pacific Northwest Colts

Speaker 2:          02:55:05       rock niche guy. The guy that eventually went on to um, he found this, this crazy cult. They went on to buy this town up there. I heard about it. It's fucking amazing. I did listen. We live around so much stupidity. Why watching one sit down. Watch it on TV. It's really good though. The documentary is incredible. It's so well done. And this Sheila lady who is running things, she's poisoning people and shit. It's crazy. They, they poison people. She did all kinds of crazy stuff. It was a, it's wild. They shipped homeless people in to vote so they could take over the town. They just brought homeless people in from everywhere. You just picked him up, come in the homeless people like Yay. We found a home and some of them were like really into it and then they're like, all right, we're done with you. Get the fuck Outta here. Kicked him out after he took over the home. Everyone in the town that lived there before them was fucking hated them. They, they, they, they had their own police force armed guards. I mean guys armed to the Dick. Okay. Just carrying machine guns and shit.

Speaker 1:          02:56:07       Fuck. How the fuck is a tool clock? Cause we uh, that's what always happens with us. [inaudible] how the fuck I told it was like one o'clock and that'd be 1230 till we, we have fun. I've known this is crazy. I'm dealing you for, I've known you for 23 years, man. Maybe more 22.
