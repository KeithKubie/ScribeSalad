KAI HALEY: Using design
sprints to increase

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.310
cross-functional collaboration.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.460
I'm Kai Haley.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.970
I'm an interaction designer
leading the design relations

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.960
team.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.430
And I'm also one of the leads
of our Sprint Master Academy.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.050
And I'm joined today by a very
amazing group of Sprint Masters

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.980
from across a number of
product areas at Google.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.840
And I'd like to
start off by having

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.130
them each introduce themselves.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.010
So let's start off
here at the end.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.926
JENNY GOVE: All right.

00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:40.250
Hi, everyone I'm
Jenny Gove, and I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.520
lead a team at Google that
works on the search [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.550
I'm also part of the
Sprint Master Academy.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.230
RATNA DESAI: Hi, my
name is Ratna Desai,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.680
and I'm a UX lead on the
search and assist team.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.030
And I'm also part
of the Academy.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.990
JOSH LOVEJOY: Yeah.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.980
I'm Josh Lovejoy.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.670
I'm a designer.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.160
I work in the Research
and Mission Intelligence

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.660
part of the organization.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.459
BURGAN SHEALY: Hi,
I'm Burgan Shealy.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.040
I'm a designer as well
in Corporate Engineering,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.756
which is the part of Google
that designs apps for googlers.

00:01:10.756 --> 00:01:13.760
SUMIER PHALAKE: Hi, I'm
Sumier I'm a designer as well,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.356
and I'm in a team called
Next Billion Users.

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:18.230
KAI HALEY: Wonderful.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.640
Thank you all for joining us.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.810
Today I wanted to start off
by giving a little background

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.550
on design sprints.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.680
We started designs
sprints a while back

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.860
when some googlers got together,
and they wanted to experiment

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.530
with ways to increase
collaboration and innovation

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.980
for their teams.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.340
And they did this
by taking methods

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.260
from design thinking, user
research, business strategy,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.490
among others.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.210
And putting them
into different orders

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.370
based on their challenge
and the deliverables

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.320
that they were looking for.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.100
And they tested this and
prototyped it over time

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.710
to come up with a
core set of methods

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.120
that really yielded the best
results for their teams.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.240
And in 2013, the
Sprint Master Academy

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.890
was founded to train googlers
in facilitating design sprints

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.730
using this core methodology.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.630
We found it to be
really, really effective,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.800
and so we have
basically adopted it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.010
as a way of working
across Google.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.250
People use the term sprints in
different ways in the industry.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.670
I'm sure you guys have all
heard it used in different ways.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.860
At Google, we define
a design sprint

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.480
as a tool for answering a
critical business question.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.790
And we do this in five phases.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.620
They're understand,
sketch, decide, validate,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.540
and prototype.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.710
And these phases have
been ordered together

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.710
to support divergent
and convergent thinking.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.830
And this allows us to generate
a broad range of solutions

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.740
to our business
challenge, and allows

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.200
us to prototype the
solutions that we

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.420
think will be most
valuable for our users

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.710
and test them with users.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.620
And we do this in
less than five days.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.470
So this is a really fast
and intensive process.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.020
Very excited to
get started here,

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.790
and I wanted to
dive in by talking

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.710
about the different
types of sprints

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.150
that people are running.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.000
So tell us about the
different types of sprints

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.500
you're running for
your product area

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.460
and how you're structuring your
challenge and deliverables.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.130
RATNA DESAI: So I've run
a variety of sprints,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.160
and today I want to
talk about a couple.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.470
Some are the
near-term sprints that

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.700
really focus on product
features and are

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.120
very much so for launching
a product immediately.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.070
And then longer term sprints
that focus on visioning.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.250
So for short-term
sprints, we generally

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.340
focus on things like if you're
at a strategic crossroads.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.910
So for example,
for Google Express,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.580
the team was deciding how to
expand the business nationally.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.570
And we were looking at ways
to get more user retention

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.899
and focus in on retail
categories and verticals which

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.700
we hadn't in the past.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.970
So in looking at the
kind of marketplace,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.700
we wanted to place our
bets in the right vertical,

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.830
whether it be home furnishings,
grocery, or even apparel.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.150
And so at that point, we had
run a variety of business models

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.620
and really modeled out the
solution from that perspective.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.220
What we needed to complement
that decision making process

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.460
was a design sprint.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.460
And at that point, when
we were at that juncture

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.209
and that inflection
point in the business,

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:49.840
it was a lovely time to
get everyone in the room

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.970
and really focus in on the
options that we could take.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.510
And what that actually looked
like in terms of deliverables

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.850
was mocks, prototypes.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.420
And we were able to kind
of line those up and decide

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.940
more consciously and
thoughtfully where

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.580
we wanted to place
our bets, and then

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.650
outline a roadmap
that would allow

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.460
us to get there within a year.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.400
So we had some constraints.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.990
But we worked within
those and were

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.200
able to ideate in a very
focused iterative manner

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.530
before we decided to really
commit to a strategy.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.030
JENNY GOVE: I can
follow up on that.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.160
So I run a number of
different types of sprints.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.800
These range from visions
sprint, so vision,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.880
about where we see a
product area, perhaps.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.480
Also, I think what's very
common is product features.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.050
We often run sprints to get
to new product features.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.320
But also we have run sprints
to define new policy and also

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.180
new processes.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.840
We've even done sprints to come
out with different principles.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.530
And also to look at those
real moonshot ideas.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.690
And you talked about
sprint challenge

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.980
and how we've structured that.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.190
So a sprint challenge
is really this statement

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.690
you draw up at
the beginning when

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.520
you're planning the sprint.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.350
And the challenge really has the
distinct defined aspects to it.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.646
You need to know what
it is you're doing.

00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:18.520
And that's the part that
I just talked about,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.840
the vision or the process,
or the policy sprint

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.670
that you're planning towards.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.000
And then you define kind
of who is the audience.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.870
Who are you doing this for or
who's the participants for.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.790
And the scope of that,
how far out you're

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.710
thinking, how long you're
going to take that.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.230
And you talked about
structuring it.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.190
I think communicating
it is really

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.830
important across the team of
people you're working with.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.210
And then you get
different deliverables

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.750
assigned to those
different types of sprints.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.500
So product features, obviously
that's really common as I said.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.870
And there's a lot of
prototyping, different tools

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.010
used for prototyping.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.290
And that's a very standard way.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.260
But we also do some fun
things with vision sprints,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.240
where we've done roleplays,
creating videos, what else?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.530
So policy will be sort of
the first step of making

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.390
that text for the policy.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.540
Process might be a diagram,
how you kind of set

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.700
up, say, a process for
checking on privacy

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.640
or checking on security.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.420
And moonshot ideas often comes
down to roleplays and videos

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.550
again.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.050
JOSH LOVEJOY: Yeah,
it's interesting

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.106
building off the point about
deliverables and scope.

00:07:34.106 --> 00:07:35.980
The thing across all
the sprints that I found

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.130
is it's just as important,
if not more sometimes,

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.150
to define what's out of scope.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.540
So knowing the things that
are going to be sort of out of

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.900
reach.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.650
And there's a couple
important pieces why.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.260
One is helping to define those
out-of-scope points gives you

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:55.100
a bit of license to
refine the conversation,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.910
to focus the conversation.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.630
People can go all over the place
over the course of three, four,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.872
or five day design sprint.

00:08:01.872 --> 00:08:03.330
And you want to
capture those ideas

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.913
and have them live
somewhere, but also

00:08:04.913 --> 00:08:06.960
know that they're
going to always lean

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.970
towards the actionable
and the tangible,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.060
the real world, not
too pie in the sky.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.906
I worked on a
design sprint to try

00:08:14.906 --> 00:08:17.280
to figure out the out-of-boxing
experience for a hardware

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.327
product.

00:08:18.327 --> 00:08:20.160
And you can imagine
with a hardware product,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.065
you can go any
number of directions.

00:08:22.065 --> 00:08:24.810
It could be like from
how it gets manufactured,

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.320
to how the packaging
ends up at your doorstep,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.560
to the delivery mechanism,
to opening the box itself,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.240
all the way to
the hundredth use.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.400
We really wanted to focus
into that first time use,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.710
just that one experience
of having opened the box

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.870
and seeing what's inside.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.480
And in doing that, it actually
gave a lot more confidence

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.880
from stakeholders to know
that we were actually

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.880
building towards something
testable and verifiable.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.100
We weren't going to try to just
traverse this giant landscape

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.330
and cover it all, which
would have been impossible

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.836
in four days.

00:08:55.836 --> 00:08:56.710
KAI HALEY: Thank you.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.700
Yeah, that's a very
interesting example.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.800
What would you say is
the most important thing

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.634
to do in preparing for a sprint?

00:09:05.634 --> 00:09:07.770
JENNY GOVE: Should I
take this one again?

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.340
OK, so sprint preparation.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.260
So facilitators have a role all
the way through the process,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.160
right from the beginning,
right through past

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.930
the end of the sprint,
and making sure

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.100
that deliverables
come to fruition.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.100
In the planning
process, that's a lot

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.239
of the time at the
sprint facilitator.

00:09:28.239 --> 00:09:30.530
And during that time, they're
setting up the challenge,

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.840
like I talked about already.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.220
And a large part
of that, though,

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.600
is making sure the right people
are going to be in the room

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.840
and building towards that
first stage in the sprint

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.750
that Kai talked about, which
is the understand phase.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.300
Really, really critical
part of the understand phase

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.430
is delivering lightning talks.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.301
And lightning talks are really
important because during that

00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:54.800
time--

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.770
I'm sure many of you have been
engaged in design thinking

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:02.150
and used Post-it Notes to
write out your how might wes,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.180
which is really opening
up opportunities.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.000
So it's that lightning
talks that really

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.700
generate all those ideas.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.450
So if you haven't done
really, really good

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.390
planning on your lightning talks
and who should be in the room

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.580
and who should be
talking to those,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.280
so it might be
business development,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.250
or it could be
somebody from legal,

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.010
or salespeople who have got
great deal of experience

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.240
with clients.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.090
Setting that up really,
really well to make sure

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.900
you've got all that, what
I call food for thought,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.420
to generate many,
many opportunities,

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.640
is a really key part
of the planning phase.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.060
RATNA DESAI: So I
think I can build on

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.840
that because it's, in terms
of the most important thing,

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.270
I think it's definitely
planning, planning,

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.230
and then more planning.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.680
And I want to emphasize
the fact that there

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.780
are unknowns during
a sprint, so you

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.400
have to even plan for those.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.890
And what that looks
like is the agenda,

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.220
how you want to pace
the activities, who

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.400
do you want in the room.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.400
And I would say that
after the planning,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.160
it's really about the people.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.590
And in terms of
which disciplines

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.650
you want in the room,
which personalities.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.740
Because as a Sprint
Master, a facilitator,

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.980
you're essentially the
mediator to make sure

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.120
that the best ideas are
generated with this group.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.360
And so it's kind of this active
facilitation that will happen,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.670
and you need to plan
for it from the get go.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.250
So it's seeding
the design sprint

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.980
early on with the right
people and the right plan

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.580
to make sure that you ensure
a platform where people

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.370
can really dream
and that people feel

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.850
very optimistic with each
other and safe to build

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:44.870
on each other's ideas.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.090
And that was touched
on in the how

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:51.740
might we activity, which you can
read about on our Design Sprint

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.030
Kit website.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.660
But it's really the concept of
optimism, right, in a Post-it

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.930
Note, which is while you're
listening to someone,

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.310
it's active listening.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.890
And when that person is
talking, you yourself

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.870
are starting to
co-create with them

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.520
by writing down
the possibilities

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.560
and then doing a
share out at the end.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.100
So just it's a really
lovely sacred space

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.709
for people to dream big.

00:12:15.709 --> 00:12:17.750
BURGAN SHEALY: I also
think it's really important

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.090
to set expectations
so that everyone

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.840
knows what to expect on
the week of the sprint,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.500
as well as to align everyone
on the deliverables that'll

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.600
come out of those
sprint, what the fidelity

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.210
of those deliverables
will look like.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.550
And then how are you going
to follow up on the sprint?

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.580
What is the planning and the
resources for after the sprint,

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.970
so that everyone understands
and has the same expectations

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.420
for the sprint.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.920
KAI HALEY: So it
sounds like there's

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.570
a lot of work that
goes into this,

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.660
and you have to start planning
pretty far in advance.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.720
Is there a particularly good
time to sprint, or a time

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.090
when you absolutely
don't want to sprint?

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.540
SUMIER PHALAKE: Yeah, so there's
a couple of really good moments

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.600
in the product life
cycle when it's actually

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.950
really good to run a sprint.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.530
So one of them is when
the product is really

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.780
in its early stages.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.610
And it's just like
a kernel of an idea.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.590
You don't know
what it looks like.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.300
No one's really formed it
really well yet in their brain.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.960
So that's a great time
to bring a lot of people

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.060
together
cross-functionally and get

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.740
a lot of experts in the room.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.960
And then just kind of spend
a few days hashing it out

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.520
and coming out
with a good product

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.907
strategy, a good vision,
maybe a couple of hypotheses

00:13:29.907 --> 00:13:30.990
that you want to test out.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.640
So I think that's a great
time to jump on a sprint.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.140
The other time is
actually later on,

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.610
when your product is actually
launched, and you have data,

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.560
and some of it is
working really well.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.040
And then maybe
parts of it are not.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.970
So for example, it's a shopping
site, and the check out flow

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.200
is not working well.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.530
You're losing users.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.720
So how do we fix this one
experience or this one journey?

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.290
And that's actually a really
nice tactical contained problem

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.090
to solve with a group of people.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.060
You can expect to have a
really nice solution by the end

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.137
of four or five days.

00:14:04.137 --> 00:14:05.970
And you can actually
think laterally, right?

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.670
Like as a group, you can
think of four or five

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.490
different solutions,
and then diverge,

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.300
and then converge on to the
ones that make the most sense.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.560
So it really speeds
up the process

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.260
instead of doing this
regular waterfall model where

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.877
you design something,
you test it out,

00:14:20.877 --> 00:14:22.460
then you go back to
the drawing board.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.509
You actually do it
in parallel, and then

00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:25.800
you explore a bunch of options.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.330
And then at the end
of the week, you

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.600
have a really good solution.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.010
When not do sprint actually
is really interesting.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.160
So don't sprint when
you don't have time.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.590
And so if you've seen
the iceberg example, what

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.500
you see on the day of the
sprint is actually just the tip

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.130
of the iceberg, right?

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.330
All the planning that
happens to make the sprint

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.080
a success, which is the majority
of the iceberg you can't see.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.967
So it takes a while
to plan this thing

00:14:54.967 --> 00:14:56.050
and set it up for success.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.130
And if you don't have
the time to do it,

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.921
if someone says I want
to sprint next week,

00:14:58.921 --> 00:15:02.540
just say no, it's
not going to happen.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.410
And then also don't do it when
your team doesn't have time.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.420
You're in the final
stages of launch,

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.360
everyone's head's down, trying
to get something out the door.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.760
That is absolutely the wrong
time to try to run a sprint,

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.920
because no one's in
the right mindset

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.530
to go back to the drawing board.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.150
You'll get a lot of resistance.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.820
Make sure you get a
cross-functional team.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.520
You can do a sprint
with designers,

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.730
but what's the point?

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.240
Because a lot of
it is about getting

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.340
cross-functional
consensus and buy-in.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.930
You want people to
co-create and feel

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.030
like they have
ownership in the design.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.680
And if you can't
do that, then you

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.020
lose something really valuable
from the sprint process.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.920
And then lastly, I don't know if
you guys have experienced this,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.711
but sometimes you'll
have a stakeholder who

00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:45.550
has a solution in their brain.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.620
And they're like, I
want to run a sprint,

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.430
because I want to validate that
what I have in mind is true.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.250
And that's also not a
good time to run a sprint,

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.560
because sprints are
very, very bottom up,

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.690
and you have to allow
the space for people

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.080
to come up with their own ideas.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.996
And sometimes they're
going to completely defy

00:16:01.996 --> 00:16:04.012
your expectations,
and that's OK.

00:16:04.012 --> 00:16:06.220
And if your stakeholders
are not all right with that,

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.254
then you shouldn't run a sprint.

00:16:09.254 --> 00:16:11.420
RATNA DESAI: I think the
best time to run a sprint--

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.250
and this is coming
from the perspective

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.070
of working at Google,
which is a very, very

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.580
large organization with multiple
organizations within it--

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.800
is really when we
start annual planning.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.490
So our OKR process
is quite rigorous,

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.920
and it's a good time to start
at the beginning of the year,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.410
or I would even say at
the end of last year,

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.650
the previous year, so
that you can really

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:38.930
get runway on these ideas,
and then refine them quarter

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.080
by quarter.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.200
And so what this
allows is it allows

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.650
that kind of
cross-pollination of ideas

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.980
very early on in the planning
stage of the business strategy.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.160
And so it's key to
get there early.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.280
The other point to make
about the best time

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.280
is that it's really when the
right people are in the room

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.350
and are craving alignment.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:04.160
If there's no shared vision,
for example, for a product,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.550
and people are just kind of
stumbling and misinterpreting

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.150
the goals, those things
are good symptoms

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.720
to pay attention to
in any organization,

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.290
and to really then address it
with this wonderful methodology

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.839
that can stem anywhere from
a couple hours of getting

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:24.450
together and gaining that
alignment, or several days.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.079
And so this investment and
this customization can happen,

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.170
and that's what's really
lovely about this sprint method

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.280
that we have.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.500
And the wrong time is
when you really don't

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.480
have the right
people in the room,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.770
because it's ultimately going
to lead to a product idea that

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.990
isn't fully fleshed
out or doesn't

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.570
have the right stakeholder
investment upfront.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.620
So that kind of
upfront investment

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.460
is so valuable down the road
when you're launching product.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.890
And it really saves teams
so much time in the end.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.640
JOSH LOVEJOY: Yeah,
you bring up the point

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.390
about when teams are sort of
stuck in a product lifecycle.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:08.170
I've seen sprints unstick
teams so many times.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.600
The test I like to
run is if someone

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.640
writes a doc about a
feature or a product,

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.150
and then the email thread
that spawns out of that doc

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.460
is longer than the
doc itself, it's

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.950
probably a pretty good time
to get some people in a room

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.584
and talk.

00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:25.250
You're frequently
dealing with this kind

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.590
of cognitive dissonance
of like, well,

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.410
taking a bunch of people offline
and putting them in a room,

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.070
and having them just talk to
each other for multiple days.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.820
That's like a ton of
investment, and we're

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.680
going to lose all
sorts of productivity.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.990
And the secret is
actually you gain

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.150
like months of productivity.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.330
If you get people from
different disciplines who

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.790
have different perspectives
and different backgrounds who

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:51.020
can come together and align, you
save so many different cycles

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.266
of churn and back and forth.

00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:55.010
I even recently
we had a situation

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.050
where a product I
was involved with

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:58.760
had some research
findings come back

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.160
that were pretty surprising
and pretty at odds with some

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.110
of our core belief systems.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.560
And we rallied together
a diverse set of folks

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.920
for like three hours
and came up with--

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.690
just presented the
research, talked

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.840
through a bunch of common
themes we were seeing,

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.550
and by the end of
that session, we

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.070
had product tenets that now
have taken us into a point where

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.460
we're ready to launch.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.500
And that's just crazy
amounts of efficiency gain.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.610
KAI HALEY: You all mentioned
a cross-functional team

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.750
and getting the right
people there in the room.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.990
Can you talk a little bit about
the most successful composition

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.060
of roles for a sprint?

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.992
Sounds like that's
really important.

00:19:40.992 --> 00:19:41.700
RATNA DESAI: Yes.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.550
And I think it was touched
on earlier, is that I call it

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.960
kind of the trifecta, right?

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.200
You need your
product manager, you

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.890
need your [INAUDIBLE] partner,
and you need your UX person

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:53.670
in the room.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.280
Now that said, it's really
dependent on the challenge.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.880
Oftentimes, if we're solving
for a health care business

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.269
challenge, I want a physician.

00:20:01.269 --> 00:20:03.060
And if I can't get a
physician in the room,

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.510
I certainly want an interview
with a subject matter expert.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.520
So there are these
ways in which we

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.190
can augment the
core working team

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.990
with stakeholder interviews,
subject matter, expertise.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.290
And it really goes a long way,
because you're essentially

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.900
creating this real
microcosm of what

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.920
we call a sprint team, which is
essentially practicing what it

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.180
means to be a growth org,
right, a constantly learning

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.340
and evolving organization.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.340
And we do these in these
little sprint pods,

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.760
but essentially it can be
applied to the entire company.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.920
Our technology is moving fast.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.420
We're all kind of moving a
million miles an hour in terms

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.850
of what we're going to produce
and put out in the market.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.850
So it's really
our responsibility

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.520
to get that trifecta and
the right people in the room

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.330
because the audiences and the
global audiences we relate to

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:02.370
with our end user is so diverse,
that really the onus is on each

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.180
of us to make sure
that the seeds planted

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.660
and the DNA of this idea
that will eventually become

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.940
a product living
in someone's life

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.610
is a reflection of
society at large.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.220
And so you want those
kinds of cultural nuances,

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.690
you want the diverse
perspectives.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.740
And I can't emphasize
this enough.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.190
It's so important to have that
filter when you start a design

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.190
sprint, because it really
shapes the end deliverable.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:33.330
I've seen teams where
that kind of team synergy

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.410
and that diversity has
led to true innovation,

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.080
and I think authentic team
spirit, which really matters.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.160
Because we want people returning
to these sprints and to do them

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.250
as their active product
development practice.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.810
So it's really important that
we make their time worthwhile

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:55.080
and that they feel that
they get a lot from it.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.240
JENNY GOVE: I'll
just add that I've

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.360
had experience bringing in
different sorts of people

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.910
in different roles at Google
into different sprints.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:06.480
So some success
stories I can remember

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.262
were running a sprint for games,
around games, and around apps

00:22:10.262 --> 00:22:12.345
for games, when I brought
in business development,

00:22:12.345 --> 00:22:14.610
and they had such a different
perspective than we'd

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.880
heard before, that we
hadn't involved before that.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.160
I've run sprints on
privacy and security.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.600
We definitely brought in legal.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.190
We brought in policy.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.760
We also at that time brought
in external academics

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.560
into our sprint teams.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.720
So sometimes thinking
even wider than the people

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.020
in your company, where you can
do that is really important.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.440
And like I said
before, teams that

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.890
have the client perspective
often a lot better than we do.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.760
Definitely bringing in user
research, but also sales,

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.940
developer relations,
different roles

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:57.032
like that such a good
connection to the end users.

00:22:57.032 --> 00:22:57.740
KAI HALEY: Great.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.950
So have any of you
guys had any sprints

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:05.330
that you considered to be
maybe a little bit of a failure

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.470
or went off the rails?

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.299
And what did you
do to save them?

00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:09.590
SUMIER PHALAKE: I've had a few.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.660
So I ran a sprint recently.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:18.140
So I work in a group that makes
products for emerging markets,

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.790
and I was working
with a team that

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:23.870
really wanted to be in this
one particular emerging market.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.660
And I planned the
sprint perfectly,

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.340
and everything was
going really well.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.310
And there were a bunch of
really great lightning talks

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:34.100
based on really strong
foundational research,

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.060
and what we found out was none
of that research was actually

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.320
presenting a strong user
need or a user problem.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.600
And so what ended
up happening was

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.810
over the course of
that sprint, everyone

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.640
had a lot of great
ideas, but no one really

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.210
knew what a good idea was
because they didn't know

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.280
what they were solving for.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.440
And so I've been
very guilty of this.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.450
Before the sprints runs,
I was just like, hey,

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.610
throw your lightning
talks into the slide deck.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.260
As long as the lightning
talks are done, I'm happy.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.009
And I'd rarely actually
go through them

00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:07.800
and try to synthesize
and try to understand

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.640
if the inputs
actually make sense.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.090
And so my learning was if
your inputs aren't great,

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.830
your outputs aren't
going to be great.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.370
So you have to make sure that
you use your inputs in a way

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:24.960
to guide the team to come
to really good solutions.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.150
The other situation I've
faced is just personalities.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.894
Sometimes you will have a really
loud, strong voice in the room.

00:24:31.894 --> 00:24:33.560
You've all been in
sprints where there's

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.620
been a super senior executive
or someone super senior who

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.290
is very opinionated, and
everyone else kind of

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.580
feels scared to oppose them or
come up with their own ideas.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.040
And this is where your
skills as a Sprint Master

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.240
really come into play.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:53.826
You have to point to other
people and ask them to speak.

00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:55.200
You have to keep
reminding people

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.960
that sprints are
very democratic.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.880
And if voting is not
working for you--

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.460
because sometimes someone
will vote for an idea and then

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.790
everyone else will vote
for that same idea--

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.920
you should try doing the note
and vote method where people

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.590
can write down their votes on a
piece of paper with no one else

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.672
seeing, and then you
tally them up after.

00:25:12.672 --> 00:25:14.630
I've always had, there's
always this one person

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:17.150
in the sprint who is
convinced that their idea is

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:20.180
the right one, and
everyone else is wrong.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.810
And for that, what I've
found is really successful

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.430
is you just give them the stage.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:26.950
Because if you don't
let them speak,

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.780
it's just going to keep
bubbling up for days.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.300
So just give them the
stage; let them speak.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.000
Again, remind everyone
that this is a democracy.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.310
And then after
they've had their say,

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.056
if still no one agrees,
then it's really

00:25:40.056 --> 00:25:41.930
like there's nothing
else they can do, right?

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.910
So that's been really
effective for me.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.910
BURGAN SHEALY: I like to
say there are no failed

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:51.260
sprints, because you always
learn something from a sprint.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.330
That being said,
there's always a chance

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.490
for your sprint to go
in a different direction

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.750
than you planned.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.340
Sometimes that can
be a good thing,

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.990
and sometimes it's
really important

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:04.100
to bring the sprint team back to
the original sprint challenge.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.440
Occasionally I've
had teams that get

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.950
really excited and gravitate
towards solutions that

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.740
are cool or shiny, but don't
really address the user

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.700
problem in the best way.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.210
So that's when having a
pre-defined sprint challenge

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.420
is really important, and
having your success metrics

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.530
and your design
principles defined,

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.130
so that you can
refer back to them

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.010
and make sure that you're really
addressing the problem that you

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.080
set out to address.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.110
Another challenge I've
faced is keeping everyone

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.980
engaged for the full sprint.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.860
It's a big chunk of time.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.080
I was in one sprint where
we had a key participant--

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.080
someone who was really
important to the sprint--

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.320
leave after only
two hours, after he

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.810
discovered that we were pretty
serious about our laptops

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:48.582
down policy.

00:26:48.582 --> 00:26:50.540
He said he could only
participate in the sprint

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.390
if he could be on his
laptop the whole time.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.540
So we actually decided to
do daily checkins with him,

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.600
half hour checkins at the end
of each day, to get his feedback

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.300
and make sure that he knew
where the sprint was going,

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.320
but that would not interrupt the
flow of all the other sprinters

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.460
with that distraction.

00:27:10.052 --> 00:27:11.510
JOSH LOVEJOY: Yeah,
I had one early

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:15.800
on when I was learning
the ropes of design sprint

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.510
facilitation, where I bit
off way more than I could

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.690
chew, a little bit unknowingly.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.730
I signed up to
facilitate a sprint

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:26.270
to redesign the
hiring at Google.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.720
Super, super easy.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.680
And it was like 20 people
from all over the company

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.090
with very different parts
of the company represented.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:41.570
It was like the second
sprint I facilitated.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.280
And it had all of the things.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.550
It had all of the earmarks
that I should have--

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:51.500
I now know to be on the lookout
for-- of a lot of baggage

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.340
between different parts
of the organization.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.360
A lot of people with very
specific ideas to the points

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.810
that both of you have made.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.420
Also when I started getting
involved in the project,

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.220
there were zero UX people.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.070
And so I sought
desperately to find

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.260
a couple of people that
could just bring some design

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.020
thinking to the process.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.260
So then we started, and
then things were terrible.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.980
And it was like
time was slipping,

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.110
there were so many
competing ideas.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:23.090
There was this one
person who just

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.590
couldn't get over
their own ideas

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.359
and kept bringing it
back to themselves.

00:28:27.359 --> 00:28:29.150
And just with the sheer
size of that group,

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.150
it's almost impossible to track
down and sort of pay attention

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.980
to everyone's thoughts.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.560
So I had these little moments
where I'd like, OK, break time.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.330
And then I'd go almost
cry in a corner.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:43.250
And so around the middle of
the second day, I was like,

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.890
I'm pretty sure I've failed the
company and everyone's going

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.150
to hate me.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.500
And so I did the only
thing I thought I could do,

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.340
which is just trust the
planning that I'd put into it.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:58.610
And I came back, and I was a
little bit more firm with time,

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:03.140
and I called time, and I focused
people around the objectives.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.140
I also paid a lot more attention
to some of those unspoken

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:11.210
signals of democratic thinking
to direct attention to the ways

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:15.170
that people were aligning,
even as this one person was

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.330
disrupting and derailing.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:21.830
And in some instances, I needed
to even take that person aside

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.330
and have some hard
conversations.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.704
And I was just like, listen,
this is either going to work

00:29:25.704 --> 00:29:27.240
or it's not.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.470
And somehow, near the end of
that day, we sort of found it.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.254
And there was enough visibility
into people's shared vision

00:29:34.254 --> 00:29:36.170
of what was going to be
built that we ended up

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.590
with a pretty amazingly
successful process that right

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.390
now is being experimented
with across the company, which

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.044
was pretty cool.

00:29:44.044 --> 00:29:44.710
KAI HALEY: Cool.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:49.340
It Sounds like you really
have to expect the unexpected

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.510
as a Sprint Master
and be ready to pivot

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:57.920
and trust the process is
what I hear you guys saying.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.910
Outside of the standard
product development process,

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:06.170
what are other use cases
that you've applied

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.750
the sprint methodology to?

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:13.710
So I've done quite a few
sprints for nonprofits.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.052
And I know Burgan has, too.

00:30:16.052 --> 00:30:17.510
I've been very
passionately working

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.926
with nonprofits
for several years.

00:30:18.926 --> 00:30:20.593
And I used to do UX
workshops with them.

00:30:20.593 --> 00:30:22.592
And then after I learned
the sprint methodology,

00:30:22.592 --> 00:30:23.900
I started doing sprints.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.150
And that's actually
been really effective

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:30.971
because nonprofits actually
have interesting challenges.

00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:32.720
Unfortunately, they
don't often have a lot

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.810
of budget for UX resources.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.380
And so things like
design thinking and stuff

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.130
like that, they just
don't have the luxury

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.170
to actually have the
right people to help

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.970
them think through that.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.250
But having said that,
they are actually

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.280
super excited to
work with designers.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.340
They face some of the same
organizational challenges

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.601
that we face, like getting
stakeholder, buy-in, changing

00:30:55.601 --> 00:30:57.350
things that they've
done the same way that

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.090
have tried and trusted
for many, many years.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.240
A lot of times, they're
stuck using legacy systems

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.950
that they want to break out of.

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:07.670
So it's been actually really
great working with them

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:11.420
to kind of get a consensus
to change product direction.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.324
Having said that,
I think if you're

00:31:14.324 --> 00:31:15.740
running a sprint
with a nonprofit,

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.281
I think it's really,
really important

00:31:17.281 --> 00:31:20.510
to staff them with even more
UX designers as participants

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:23.250
than you would otherwise.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.370
And that's because
in my experience,

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.340
there's not a lot of knowledge
about things like user journeys

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.500
or sketching or
flows or just some

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.681
of that terminology we
take for granted now.

00:31:33.681 --> 00:31:35.430
There isn't a lot of
experience with that.

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.469
So it kind of need
more of a helping hand.

00:31:37.469 --> 00:31:39.260
And every time I've
actually had more UXers

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.590
on the team, if you split
the team into groups,

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.000
each group should have a UXer.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.460
It's worked out
really, really well.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.310
The other sprint I
recently ran was--

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.670
I don't know if anyone's
read Jake Knapp's medium

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.934
article about a brand sprint--

00:31:54.934 --> 00:31:56.600
the product that I'm
b working on Google

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.850
is really ready
for a rebranding.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:03.020
And so I spent three hours
with key stakeholders

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.140
just defining the
personality of our product,

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.900
our vision for 20 years, who
we are, what our values are.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.360
And that was a super
great for just getting

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.730
everyone aligned, getting
all these abstract notions

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.230
of what our brand
is into something

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.940
that was really concrete.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:21.780
So then we actually start
deploying that brand as a logo

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.640
or in marketing,
we have something

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.640
to point to and keep
ourselves honest

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.060
and make sure we're
not off-brand.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.090
so that was actually
really great.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.310
BURGAN SHEALY: Yeah, I've
run a number of sprints

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:35.040
with nonprofits as well.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.060
Several for google.org, which
is Google's philanthropic arm

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.670
as well.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.580
And I think one of
the key differences

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.090
that I've enacted with
nonprofits, for instance,

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.830
is having users in
the entire sprint.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:52.260
So in one, the nonprofit
Project Concern International

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.600
was using satellite data to
give and show pastoralists

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.810
in sub-Saharan Africa
current vegetation

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:04.170
so that they could understand
where good grazing land was.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.510
This was becoming a problem
due to climate change,

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.280
and their grazing
lands were changing.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.400
So the program that
they had was hugely

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.790
successful with a 50%
reduction in herd mortality

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:18.690
and 80% adoption by
local populations.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:22.110
However, the delivery system
was really ineffective.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:26.130
They were printing out
maps, paper maps, and then

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.280
hand delivering those
to the local population.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.970
So our challenge was to provide
these maps on a smartphone.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:37.020
So we had Google UXers,
we had PCI staff,

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.440
we had a mapping specialist,
we had local developers.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.560
And then we had a number of
users in the sprint with us.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.650
And having the users in
the sprint was critical.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.800
They were able to work
with the developers

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.320
to really help the
developers understand

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.630
the user needs from the
very outset of the project.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:58.020
The UXers were able to
understand the technology

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.700
challenges and opportunities.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:05.420
And just having the users as
code designers in the process

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:10.199
was really important so
that they owned the solution

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:15.403
and actively worked with the
team to develop the solution.

00:34:15.403 --> 00:34:17.567
