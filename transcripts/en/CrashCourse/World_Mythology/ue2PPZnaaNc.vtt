Hey there. I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Mythology and hey,  Thoth, can we talk man-to-man?

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.989
Man-to-God? Man-to-Ibis-and-sometimes-Baboon because today's episode is about

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.630
Mythological men and what unites them among different cultures. We've been talking about gods for months

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.799
But now we're going to look at them more theoretically and divide them into groups based on their

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.310
archetypal functions in myth. Grab your Papyrus, Thoth, so you can take notes. I promise it won't be rote.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.470
We examined female divinity archetypes in the last two episodes and

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:48.000
mythologists have categorized male divinities into a similar set of archetypes. Across countless myths when male gods appear

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.809
It's usually in one of six

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.158
forms. Fathers and/or sons, kings and judges, saviors and sages, Shamans, Tricksters, and the lords of

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.509
destruction and just if you got excited about finally figuring out the name of your new death metal band,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.010
I've got some bad news,

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.239
it's already taken so. So let's begin at the beginning with fathers and sons. We've talked about creation myths and divine families,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.820
so you already know that in a lot of cases a son

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.729
overthrows his father to usurp his spot.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.220
This can get pretty bloody and, as is the case with Uranus and Cronus and Zeus, can even involve

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.909
castration. One reason god-sons might be eager to topple their divine fathers is that these fathers are often

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.940
aloof

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.809
Especially in creation myths, it's common for all-Powerful father figures to live in the sky being all unapproachable

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.110
for their children. According to Scott Leonard and Michael McClure in patrifocal myths, all seek the father's love

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.759
and approval; all long for even a glimpse of his face;

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.729
and all live in terror of his wrath. You can just picture Apollo asking Zeus

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.328
if he'll come outside to like kick the soccer ball around - "Come on dad, please?"

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.709
Meanwhile Zeus is just lightning-bolting things - he's busy working. In other myths, sons become symbols of their fathers attributes or

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.140
conduits for their father's knowledge and abilities. Take Odin and his sons Tyr and Balder;

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.160
they epitomize their father's bravery and wisdom respectively and Thor is a distillation of Odin's military and

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.049
reproductive power. We see something similar in a Korean myth about the heavenly ruler Hwaning.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.119
Before any people exist on Earth, Hwaning teaches his son Hwanung the secrets of the heavenly kingdom and allows him to descend to Earth

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.899
to create a new society. The advice allows Hwanung to rule more effectively over the earth, and later

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.539
he passes the same wisdom on to the first man, Dangun, so that he can recreate the heavenly order

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.269
himself. Gods hate weeding,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.280
but they love order. in Hwanung's transition from archetypal son to father,

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.239
marked by passing on knowledge to humans, he also embodies another male archetype: God as king or judge.

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.399
There's no clear reason why pantheons of gods would need to be organized like terrestrial governments

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.450
but there are countless myths where gods are in human leadership roles. For instance, sky gods like Zeus are often described as

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.009
reigning like Kings and also partying like kings, if you ask Leticia,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.720
Roman goddess of festivity. Historically, myths featuring gods as kings have helped justify monarchical  power on Earth. They create an

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.379
equivalence between the

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:28.048
terrestrial kings' ability to provide security and the gods' ability to do the same. In some traditions male divinities also act as judges; often

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.129
judges of human souls. In Egyptian myths, Osiris and

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.690
42 other gods test the souls of the dead to see if they were Maat Kheru, or true of voice. At times

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:47.099
Osiris and Anubis are pictured weighing a soul in the form of a heart against a feather and Thoth would record the results.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.009
Nice work, pal. No matter how well a human has learned from their father figure, sometimes things get out of hand.

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.869
Mythology is brimming with stories of bailouts in the form of a savior god.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.870
This salvation can be a

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.839
sacrifice like the Aztec myth of Nanahuatl who throws himself onto a fire to become the sun that will nourish

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.048
humanity - more on that in our episode about dying gods.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:17.699
More often though gods act as saviors by providing knowledge and guidance that humans need to thrive spiritually and

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.840
survive actually.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.000
Usually these saviors don't die, but instead impart some important, often sacred, knowledge that if followed leads to salvation.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.120
We can make a case for

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.929
Prometheus, who gives people fire, as a kind of sage and maybe we can read the biblical story of Jesus as a

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.539
combination of savior and sage; just two great tastes that taste great together.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.039
According to William Doty,

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:47.069
the Shaman is a figure who can enter the world of spirits easily because of the powers granted to her or him

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.809
by such beings. Often a Shaman will travel to spiritual realms,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.140
journeying on a road that puts him in contact with supernatural

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.489
forces that most people cannot see. It can be tricky to see shamans as gods rather than human heroes because

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:06.569
human Shamans exists in many cultures, both historically and

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:12.839
currently. It may be more helpful to think of some gods as having the skills or attributes of Shamans,

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:14.529
specifically the use of

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.879
supernatural power to provide or find the answers to

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:25.259
pressing questions. For example, the Celtic deity the Dagda has a magic cauldron from which he draws special items;

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:30.178
messenger gods like Hermes sprint between the Earth, the Heavens and the Underworld.

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:32.689
Hermes himself was the God of alchemists and

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:40.229
magicians and, functionally similar to Hermes, is our good friend Thoth. Thoth was also a heavenly messenger, often credited with special if not

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:42.898
mystical knowledge about things like

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:50.849
mathematics, astronomy, the alphabet and writing: that's why Thoth here is the patron god of Crash Course; not because his name is fun to say,

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.278
but because he's awesome. High five, pal.

00:05:53.829 --> 00:06:00.419
Another important archetypal role for male gods is the trickster. This one is so fun that we're going to be devoting a few episodes to

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.788
it in the future. We've already seen tricksters like Eshu,

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.479
who you may remember from our episode on Orishas, and of course our old friend

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.758
Loki, who you may remember from him being the worst.

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:14.729
Trickster gods remind us that life's can be chaotic, and not just the creation from the void kind of chaotic.

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.818
There's plenty of mischief that we're going to talk about; you're going to have to wait. Our last

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.959
archetype of male divinity is the Lord of Destruction, or Lord of the Underworld.

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:28.169
We've met this type before: Hades, Osiris looking at y'all's. Often they have dogs or dog-headed

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:34.438
gods as helpers, like Cerberus and Anubis, and sometimes lords of the underworld are connected with greed:

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:42.208
Pluto gives us the word plutocrat: someone who derives their power from their wealth; possibly because kings of the underworld never give up a soul

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:47.009
once they get one. Another possible explanation for the strange connection between death and abundance

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.818
is that some of these gods are linked with seasonal renewal and thus

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:57.238
fertility, and it's not surprising that many gods of battle are archetypically male. A good example of a battle

00:06:57.239 --> 00:07:04.828
god who combines many masculine divine attributes is Perune, the chief Slavic deity. He sometimes pictured as a huge man with a

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:11.609
silver face, a golden moustache and who wields an enormous club, a battle ax, a bow and arrow and

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.959
thunderbolts; basically, you name it, he is going to stab someone with it. And then there's Balor,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.269
the celtic war god of the Fomorians.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.530
His single eye has a lid so heavy that it required

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.269
servants to hoist it open which is probably a good thing because anyone who fell under

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.500
Balor of the stout blow's gaze was crushed in an instant.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:37.949
Talk about a death stare. So as you've probably figured out, there's a lot of overlap among these archetypes. A male

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:41.878
god can be a king and a sage and a father and a warrior all at the same time

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:47.459
or he can fulfill different roles in different stories. A great example of this is the god Krishna in the

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:53.400
Bhagavad-Gita. The Bhagavad-Gita is the sixth book in the Indian epic poem the Mahabharata; in the West,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.229
it's probably the most well known section of the poem. It tells the story of the Prince Arjuna and his

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.689
charioteer, who happens to be Krishna, deciding what to do on the battlefield of Kuruksetra.

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:10.919
Thought bubble's is going to help us out. In the middle of battle, Prince Arjuna is torn between his duty as a warrior and

00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:17.098
family loyalty. He has family on the opposite side, so he might harm them if he fulfilled his warrior Dharma.

00:08:17.099 --> 00:08:23.819
He's deciding whether to be a warrior or renounce his role as a Kshatriya: a member of the Hindu military caste.

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:25.259
He says to Krishna, "Krishna,

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:30.509
I see my kinsmen gathered here, wanting war. My limbs sink, my mouth is parched,

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:37.288
my body trembles, the hair bristles on my flesh, the magic bow slips from my hand, my skin burns,

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:42.839
I cannot stand still, my mind reels. I see omens of chaos, Krishna;

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.219
I see no good in killing my kinsmen in battle." Krishna acts as a sage;

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.850
he answers Arjuna's question then gives him the secret to living a good life,

00:08:51.459 --> 00:08:54.569
achieving immortality, and even becoming a sage himself.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.649
He says, "You must learn to endure fleeting things - they come and go!

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:03.089
When these cannot torment a man, when suffering and joy are equal for him

00:09:03.089 --> 00:09:10.109
and he has courage, he is fit for immortality." Then Arjuna asks to see Krishna in his true form. He is

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:11.290
duly

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:18.750
terrified and amazed. He says, "You are the gods of wind, death, fire and water; the moon; the lord of life; the great

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:25.919
ancestor... You are father of the world of animate and inanimate things, its venerable teacher, most worthy of worship...

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.019
I bow to you." Arjuna realizes

00:09:28.209 --> 00:09:31.799
he must fulfill his destiny to be a warrior.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:38.159
Krishna, by embodying various archetypes, helps Arjuna to become the best and most destructive

00:09:38.709 --> 00:09:40.290
version of himself. Thanks

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:46.620
Thought bubble. So it's interesting that even while Krishna is ultimately encouraging Arjuna to rejoin the battle,

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.409
he's also offering a way to achieve peace and salvation within the religious tradition of Hinduism.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.969
Krishna even provides more than one path, inspiring Arjuna to follow his dharma,

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:04.199
practice the disciplines of Yoga and worship Krishna himself, a devotion called Bhakti. When Krishna reveals himself to Arjuna,

00:10:04.199 --> 00:10:09.389
he is both creator and lord of destruction, glorious and terrible to behold.

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:12.599
He represents the multiplicity and complexity of

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.690
divinity, common in Indian religious texts and

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:16.690
myths.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:17.440
He is

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.459
lord and father,

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:25.018
but also provides comfort like a friend or a lover, and he's a sage too when he provides a path to salvation.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:31.709
So really Krishna's pretty much the full God package. The fact that Krishna occupies almost every archetype

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:33.189
we've talked about helps illustrate

00:10:33.189 --> 00:10:34.600
what's useful about

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.319
identifying

00:10:35.319 --> 00:10:42.929
archetypes in the first place. Knowing about these categories allows us to see patterns in stories and even whole traditions. Realizing that father

00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:49.720
figures take different forms in different cultures or often take the same form helps us ground the connections between myth,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:57.540
culture and our beliefs about everyday life and what it means to be a dude. Thanks for watching we'll see you next week.
