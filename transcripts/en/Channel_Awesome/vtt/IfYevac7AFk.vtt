(Critic screaming)

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.380
(Abruptly stops screaming)
Ok, first question. Uh, yeah?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.840
Oh, yeah, no, that's a lot of fun, yeah.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.820
...and that's the first time I ever did it with a melon.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.800
So, I just wanted to say, everybody, thank you so much.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.280
(Applause)

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.000
(Critic screaming)

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.100
Nostalgia Critic?

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.380
SciFi Guy.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.720
What are you doing h...(muffled)

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.940
It's him.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.840
(Muffled) Who?

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.580
Linkara.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.380
Linkara?!

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.940
Lower your voice, SciFi Guy!

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.520
He can smell geek.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.840
My God.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.400
Linkara.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.820
Why, in Star Trek circles, he's known simply as:

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.300
Linkara.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.620
Yes. The ultimate Star Trek nerd.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.260
He has heard about my Star Trek Month.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.100
He wants to do a crossover review with me on Star Trek: Insurrection.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.840
But I won't let him. No no no.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.040
All his stupid little nitpickiness that nobody 
cares about is not going to spoil my review,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.840
and I have found a perfect hiding spot.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.420
He will never look for me here.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:35.020
(Laughing)

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.120
(Slows to chuckling, then stops)

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.700
(Awkward, ain't it?)

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.880
Funny, I kinda thought something would happen while we were laughing, there.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.800
Uh, yeah, like we'd be interrupted, or...

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.900
Yeah like someone would interrupt our laughing, yeah.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.080
So, you want some coffee?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.360
That'd be lovely, thank you.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.040
Might as well see what's on the television.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.520

["Ironside" intro theme]
Hello, Critic. Start the review.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.700
(Crying)

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.800
Last time, in the good Star Trek movie...(Sobbing)

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.660
Picard goes through a Borg Identity!

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.820
Obsessed with stopping his old arch-rivals -

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.320
even though he's never really been that obsessed
before -

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.780
he follows the Borg back in time to stop man's first contact with the Vulcans!

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.520
After ripping off Moby Dick, because,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.820
that's what Star Trek likes to do,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.100
Picard defeats the Borg queen,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.620
Data goes through his "I wanna be human" bullshit again,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.600
and first contact is still made by the farmer from Babe.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.660
Will Star Trek continue to score big with audiences?

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.900
I don't care, I get paid either way!

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:23.180
[Kirk screams "Khan!" over and over to the opening theme of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.040
And now, we come to the final film in Star Trek Month, Star Trek: Insurrection,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.940
with special guest star, Linkara.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.940
Hello, adoring fans.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.560
I've come all the way here on my spaceship to talk to you about the most hated of all Star Trek films.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.340
Wait a minute. This one's the most hated?

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.820
I thought it was either, like, the first one or five that was the most despised.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.660
That may be the case with other fans, but me personally,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.980
this is my least favorite in the entire franchise.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.740
So you need me here, or else you'll screw this review up like you've done so many times before.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.960
What?! When have I ever screwed something up ?

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.800
(Oh, boy)

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.680
In your Battlefield Earth review, you said the Psychlos NEVER have explosions on their planet,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.560
when that's not what they said in the movie!

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.340
It was that the air they breathed reacted violently to radiation!

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.200
My God, you're defending Battlefield Earth?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.800
No, I'm pointing out the fact that you never get details right.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.440
So we're gonna do this TOGETHER, so it gets done CORRECTLY.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.060
So, let's not waste any time.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.800
Let's dive right into...
(SciFi Guy clears throat)

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.220
Am I in this?

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.120
Well it's...kinda just a duo thing.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.400
But it's...my room.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.900
Yeah...

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.200
Ok, I...guess I'll just go...stand silently in the corner.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.000
Star Trek: Insurrection.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.680
So we open on the Shire as we see a peaceful alien people called the Ba'ku, taking care of their planet.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.240
LINKARA: Funny how these people who don't believe in machines have an irrigation system set up for their crops.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.020
It's almost as if machines are helpful or something.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.300
And, on top of that, the original s eries got away with people who looked exactly like Humans

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.660
because it was a low-budget 60's TV series.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.580
This is a multimillion-dollar movie.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.840
Buy some damn forehead bumps or something!

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.260
CRITIC: But we see there's Starfleet personnel in invisible suits keeping track of the people in the city.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.640
VOICE OVER INTERCOM:
The android! He's out of control!

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.300
My God, it's Jambi!

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.040
(as Data) Meka-leka die, meka die you ho!

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.680
LINKARA: He takes a phaser and reveals the Federation's base,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.400
which is remarkably close, isn't it?

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.880
Wouldn't it make more sense to monitor them in space so that nobody bumps into it?

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.840
CRITIC: And what, did they do the construction in invisible suits?

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.660
They never heard the invisible bulldozers put it together?

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.860
LINKARA: But, heck with that, we have this subplot that goes nowhere.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.440
RIKER: Our guests have arrived. They're eating the floral arrangements on the banquet tables.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.520
CRUSHER: I guess they don't believe in cocktails before dinner.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.420
TROI: Are they vegetarian? That's not in there!

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.440
PICARD: Perhaps we should have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.680
something that goes well with chrysanthemums.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.480
Wow, that was four lines in a row dedicated to plants.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.720
Gives you some idea of the thrill ride we're in for with this movie.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.560
TROI: Remember, they have a significantly less advanced technology than ours.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.900
They only achieved warp drive last year.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.020
CRUSHER: And the Federation Council decided to make them a protectorate so quickly?

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.540
PICARD: In view of our losses to the Borg and the Dominion, the Council feels we need all the allies we can get these days.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.280
Remember this, I'll have a tangent on it later.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.280
What, did he say the word "Dominion" wrong or something?

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.700
Yes, but that's beside the point, we'll get to it later.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.620
WORF: Captain.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.500
PICARD: Mr. Worf.
WORF: Doctor.
CRUSHER: Worf!

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.000
PICARD: What the hell are you doing here?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.440
WORF: I was at the Manzar Colony...
RIKER: He's a little late, Geordi, can it wait?

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.260
LA FORGE: I don't think so...

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.840
CRITIC (as Picard): It doesn't matter, you're here, we'll cast you.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.500
PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.180
CUZAR: Captain Picard, may I welcome you in the time-honored tradition of my people.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.200
LINKARA: So he meets up with the Oompa Loompa queen,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.980
and she partakes in the tradition of making bald men look like Dorothy from "The Wizard of Oz."

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.900
PICARD: But Data should've been back by now.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.540
They were only scheduled to observe
 the Ba'ku village for one week.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.020
CRITIC: But Picard-ahontas...

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.140
LINKARA: I would've gone with Jean-Lucagawea.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.300
CRITIC: Ok, that's pretty good.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.260
...is told about Data and has to go figure out what's wrong.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.720
PICARD: Geordi, would you set up a secure comlink with the admiral in the anteroom?

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.260
LA FORGE: Aye, sir.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.920
ADISLO: Uh, captain? Hars Adislo, we met at the 
Nel Bato conference last year.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.640
Did you ever have a chance to read my paper
 on thermionic transconductance?

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.920
PICARD: Would you excuse me?

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.020
Who was that guy?!

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.660
I don't know.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.720
Well you've seen all the shows, has he ever popped up?

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.960
Not that I'm aware of.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.880
Well, maybe he'll explain it in his next scene.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.020
He doesn't HAVE a next scene.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.600
You mean...he just completely...

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.020
...vanishes.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.240
Who are you, blue man?

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.520
DOUGHERTY: Commander Data attacked us in the mission scoutship yesterday.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.980
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc,

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.980
but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.080
PICARD: If our first attempt to capture Data fails,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.760
I will terminate him.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.180
CRITIC: At least give us one more movie before we kill him.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.120
DOUGHERTY: All right.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.080
PICARD (singing): Come out, come out, wherever you are...

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.220
WORF: Sir?

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.860
That's something that my m...

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.860
LINKARA: Well, that was a thrilling backstory.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.860
CRITIC: Yeah, I wonder what other character insights we're gonna glance over.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.620
You know, this reminds me of when
 I was a little girl in Alaska...

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.000
Oh! What was that?!

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.840
PICARD: We've seen how he reponds to threats, I wonder how he would respond...

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.380
CRITIC: So in a maneuver I don't really understand,

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.780
they figure out singing to him will somehow break his programming.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.300
PICARD: (Singing) A British tar is a soaring soul/
His nose should pant/

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.980
DATA (singing): And his lip should curl/

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.280
PICARD: His cheeks should flame/

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.260
DATA: And his brow should furl/

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.100
PICARD, DATA, AND WORF:
His nose should pant/And his lip should curl/

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.100
Ok, has Star Trek just become a musical?

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.200
Between "Row, Row, Row Your Boat," "Life Forms," and this,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.400
I've heard less singing in Sesame Street!

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.560
I mean, what Star Trek fan would actually enjoy this...

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:43.480
(Singing) His eyes should flash with an inborn fire/
His brow with scorn be rung/

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.320
DATA (singing): He never should bow down to a domineering frown/

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.500
DATA (singing): He never should bow down to a domineering frown/
LINKARA: I love the classics.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.000
PICARD (singing): Or the...

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.560
CRITIC: So the singing surprisingly does work,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.120
as the team beams down, where they see the Ba'ku playing a friendly game of CG-ball.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.760
PICARD: We were under the impression they were
 being held against their will.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.380
SOJEF: The artificial life form 
would not allow them to leave.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.460
PICARD: Apparently he was taken ill.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.560
TOURNEL: There was a phase variance in his positronic matrix which we were unable to repair.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.540
ANIJ: I think the captain finds it hard to believe that we'd have any skills repairing a positronic device.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.980
Well, yeah, since you clearly explained that you don't use technology.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:22.660
SOJEF: Our technological abilities are not apparent because we have chosen not to employ them in our daily lives.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.780
We believe that when you create a machine to do the work of a man, you take something away from the man.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.120
Then how can you know the latest technology?!

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.100
Don't get me wrong, I understand studying technology, but,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.400
how can you keep up with the latest technology on a planet forbidding technology

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.100
without any goddamn technology?!

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.380
-Magic.
-Shut up!

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.060
ANIJ: But, at one time, we explored the galaxy, just as you do.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.020
PICARD: You have warp capability?

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.520
Capability, yes.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.140
But where can warp drive take us, except away from here?

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.480
CRITIC: Yeah, I guess if Star Trek has taught us anything, it's that space IS pretty boring.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.640
LINKARA: I'm sorry, but I'm not behind this, at least not in the way these pompous jerks are flaunting it.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.200
First of all, you HAVE machines.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.260
We saw your irrigation line, you idiots.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.320
And those clothes look pretty 
damn well tailored for people

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.060
who don't have the ability to manufacture them properly.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.860
Second, this movie builds this place up as paradise, as Eden or perfection.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.640
However, their philosophy is the complete opposite
 of what Star Trek stands for!

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.620
Star Trek, in the end, is about how advanced technology has done us so much good,

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.660
allows us to do so many great things,

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.160
and that the future is a bright one, partially because we want for nothing.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.860
This movie, however, tells us we need to get back to nature

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:46.060
and be smug hippie jackasses who reject technology and machines

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:52.300
in favor of being so inbred that we don't believe in any other colors for our clothes except brown!

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.520
Yikes, Linkara.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.940
I'm sorry, but I really hate these people! They piss me off!

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.340
What, do you hate Amish people, too?

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.520
No, they hate me.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.540
But at least the Amish have religious reasons for rejecting technology.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.380
These guys are just dumb.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.700
We see them using tools,

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.780
and in the end, what is technology but just advanced tools?

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.320
Well, on the bright side, it's not like we have to deal with them that often...

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.820
They're the focus of the movie.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.400
Fuck!

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:23.220
CRITIC: But the atmosphere of the planet starts playing with the crew's molecular structure, which makes everybody get all,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.680
for lack of a better word,

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.740
pubert-ish.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.040
Worf grows a pimple,

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.540
Picard gets all energetic,

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.240
and half the crew starts acting like horny kids.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.860
TROI: Yuck!

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.780
RIKER: Yuck?

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.600
I never kissed you with a beard before.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.600
Ahem.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:42.900
What was that?

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.560
That was a clip from the show.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.260
Oh God, don't tell me...

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.780
Yes, I have every episode of Star Trek in my ship's data banks.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:54.080
I intend to use them throughout this review whenever the continuity seems off.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.780
Come to think of it, we could probably have used that a few scenes ago. Mind if we go back?

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.580
(Screams)

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.920
I'll take that as a "no."

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.980
LA FORGE: All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.560
Then his fail-safe system was activated.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.360
PICARD: Fail-safe?

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.660
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.820
But you're saying that he still knew the difference between right and wrong.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.120
In a sense, that's ALL he knew.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.840
CRITIC: Yes, because the ethical battles of right and wrong are now easily-programmable facts in the future.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.020
Hey Data, which of these is ethically sound?

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.140
Abortion, stem cell research, death penalty...

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.100
That's what I thought.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:32.660
LINKARA: But they get Data back to normal and he takes them to the last place he remembers before his programming went wacky.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.660
DATA: I believe I know what is causing the neutrino emissions!

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:44.140
LINKARA: Yup, no machines, except for this giant machine-looking thing here to drain the lake.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.740
But that's as common as a garden hoe, isn't it?

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.300
Oh, and did I mention they have a dam, too?

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.680
That's right, a dam, as in, "these are some damn big hypocrites!"

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.440
CRITIC: They discover an invisible ship with a holodeck replica of their town in it -

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.280
LINKARA: Another thing that they could've just worked on in space.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.740
CRITIC: but some bad guys see them and start to attack.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.280
You know, for as exciting as this all is,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.160
I honestly just keep thinking back to whatever happened to that blue guy.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.740
What WERE his theories of thermionic transconductance?

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.540
LINKARA: Much more thought-provoking questions than the rest of this movie is asking.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.440
ANIJ: Help! I can't swim!

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.220
(Critic groans)
-What?!
Are you kidding me?

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.160
Is water technology now? Are you resisting the shackles of H2O?

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.100
And on top of that, it turns out she's had PLENTY of time to learn how to swim.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.520
We discover that several of the adults there are over 300 years old.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.400
That's what the metaphasic radiation of the planet does.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.540
LINKARA: Yeah, what the hell's her excuse?!

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.920
PICARD: In 300 years, you never learned to swim?

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.100
ANIJ: I just haven't got around to it yet.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.900
You are stupid!

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:07.460
CRITIC: So, basically, the Federation wants to use the planet as a means to find cures and other medical miracles.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.560
Sounds good. So, what, have they talked to these
 people about working together, or--

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.940
LINKARA: Nope, they just plan to beam them off the planet when they're asleep.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.240
CRITIC: Odd. Well, I'm sure now that they know the Ba'ku

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.680
are willing to help others
 by letting them study the planet...

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:26.000
LINKARA: Nope! They see it as their home. They hate technology, we have technology, therefore, they hate us.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.080
CRITIC: Ok, well, I guess that's legit seeing how it's their planet...

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.860
LINKARA: It's not.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.300
The fuck you talking about?!

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.440
LINKARA: Yeah, technically the planet is under Federation control,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.100
and they say that they came there 300 years ago from their own home planet,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.860
so they don't own squat.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.720
Well then, why the hell don't they just kick these 
greedy cure for death holders out, then?

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.160
So Picard can make speeches like this:

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.620
PICARD: Some of the darkest chapters in the history of my world

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.500
involve the forced relocation of a small group of people.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:02.600
Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.580
Oh really?!

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.480
Is that why you participated in
 at least TWO forced relocations?!

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.200
And guess what? One of them was a group of Indians,

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:20.360
AND he was going to do the 
EXACT SAME PLAN as they're doing here!

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.020
WAKASA: Do you know how long we have searched for a home?

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.740
PICARD: I believe that I can help you to find a new home.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:30.760
LINKARA: But hey, these are white people and not Native Americans, so it's totally different, I guess.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.680
CRITIC: Yeah, that's true.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.620
There's a group of stretchy-faced people that are looking to harness the planet's power because they're dying,

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.760
yet these selfish jerks are like, "you use an electric razor? You deserve to croak."

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.440
DOUGHERTY: We're only moving 600 people.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.900
PICARD: How many people does it take, admiral, before it becomes wrong?

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.340
Six hundred and one, obviously.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:56.200
DOUGHERTY: We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help BILLIONS.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.100
And I'm sorry, but I gotta reference my clips again.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.860
(Screams)

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.280
LINKARA: This is what I was referring to before:

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.360
at the same time this movie came out,

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.620
the series Deep Space Nine was on,

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:13.140
(Critic continues screaming)
and during that series, the Federation was at war with a powerful enemy called the Dominion,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.640
and the Federation was losing.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.320
Badly.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.000
And according to their projections, if the Federation loses,

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:26.380
800 billion people will die!

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:31.460
And I'm sorry, but ah, doesn't Star Trek have a particular clip for this kind of thing?

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.900
SPOCK: The needs of the many...

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.560
outweigh...

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.980
KIRK: The needs of the few.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.740
I'm sorry, but, I'm completely on the side of the bad guys here.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.980
Critic?

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.620
(Groans)

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.920
(Groans)

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.620
Huh? Huh? What?!

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.500
I'm done.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.340
The movie's over?

00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:58.960
No.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.100
Screw you then.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.740
CRITIC: All right, so Picard decides to go down alone.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.440
LINKARA: If he's going down alone,
 why does he have all those guns?

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.660
He can't carry them all, and the Ba'ku 
already said that they won't use weapons.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:14.560
CRITIC: Well, because he knows his crew is gonna throw the same bullshit that every Star Trek crew throws.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.720
(as Picard) I don't want you to come.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.240
(as La Forge) We're coming.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.000
(as Picard) Ok.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.020
(Normal voice) Oh, and don't forget the totally-out-of-nowhere trailer line from Data.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.480
DATA: Saddle up.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.600
Lock and load.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.380
ASH: Yeeeeeah, baby!

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.160
CRITIC: So they're leading the people 
away from the town...

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.160
wait, isn't that what the bad guys wanted, anyway?

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.980
kind of doing them a favor, aren't you?

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.740
LINKARA: I'm just wondering where the sun is in this solar system.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.940
We never saw it in any of the space shots.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.920
CRITIC: But then the villains come in to hit them with darts and force them to get beamed out.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.500
But, why don't you just beam them out regularly?

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.440
ARTIM: Father!

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.640
LINKARA: But they get away -

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.880
I'm guessing, they just sort of cut off screen and then they're somewhere else -

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.520
as Data tries to comfort the boy who just lost his father.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.040
ARTIM: Do machines ever play?

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.220
DATA: Yes. I play the violin.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.160
Look, if you want to know what it's like to be a child, you need to learn to play.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.820
CRITIC: Oh yeah, he sounds traumatized.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.080
LINKARA: Hey no, everybody treats grief differently.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.320
Some choose to accept it, by...

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.520
not realizing they have it at all.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.480
CRITIC: We also see Picard, and...

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.380
boring woman who won't be in any future movies so it doesn't matter,

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.560
start to hit it off.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.320
PICARD: I should warn you, I've always been attracted to older women.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.160
How are you doing this?

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.400
ANIJ: No more questions.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.860
LINKARA: Uh, yeah questions! Lots of questions!

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:58.420
CRITIC: Yeah, this is science fiction. At least SOME questions have to be answered!

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.820
Nothing? Nothing at all?

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.000
Ok, she's a wizard.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.960
Anyway, we see more Mega Man robots catch up with them, and they try hiding in a cave.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.440
(as a Ba'ku) Thanks for saving us with your technology; by the way, we hate technology.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.940
LINKARA: While that's going on, the bad guys are attacking the Enterprise, while Riker tries to escape them.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.020
CRITIC: You ever notice a pattern in these movies?

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.440
Picard leaves the ship, and Riker always destroys it.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.940
RIKER: Computer! Access manual steering column!

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.240
Transfer helm controls to manual.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.160
LINKARA: A joystick. Riker is piloting the ship with a joystick.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.580
This has just become a half-assed Wing Commander game, folks!

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.680
CRITIC: Now, let's be fair, a real video game version of this film would be far worse.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:48.180
(Critic voiceover)

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.060
(Critic voiceover)

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.760
You are, of course, wrong.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.940
(Critic voiceover)

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.800
But they then get stuck in a cave, and a bunch of rocks fall on top of that boring lady.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.660
LINKARA: Picard then says dialogue that even Rick Astley wouldn't put in one of his love songs.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.420
PICARD: Stay with me.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.460
Help me find the power to keep you in this moment.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.580
Stay with me.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.220
Don't let go of this moment.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.840
["Never Gonna Give You Up" in the background]
(Singing) Stay with me/Don't let go of this moment/

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.140
LINKARA: But then, something remarkable happens, I guess.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.000
She slows down the moment so that the others can arrive in time.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.120
CRITIC: Oh, I thought she was gonna have an emotion.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.120
LINKARA: Hey, I said remarkable, not a miracle.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.220
CRUSHER: She's stabilizing.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.340
CRITIC (as Anij): Oh, thanks for saving me with your medical technology; by the way, I hate technology.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.760
(Normal voice) I'm sorry, I'm still wondering what happened to that blue guy.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.360
Were they important theories? Would they change the dynamics of anything?

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.180
LINKARA: So in a twist - or at least I think that's what they're calling it -

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:06.940
it turns out that the dying race called the Son'a are the exact same race as the Ba'ku.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:11.540
They just left the planet so they didn't have the healing powers that the Ba'ku had.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:16.020
CRITIC: So, as you can see, the ethical standpoint of this movie is SO WEAK

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.340
that they HAD to make up other reasons to hate the bad guys.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.920
LINKARA: But you can also tell he's the villain by the fact that he looks like Salieri's skin melting.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.880
CRITIC: Oh yeah, I forgot, that's F. Murray Abraham, isn't it?

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.380
LINKARA: It's ok, I think even he forgot he was F. Murray Abraham in this picture.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.480
GALLATIN: Moving them is one thing. Killing them all?

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.120
RU'AFO: No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.520
CRITIC: So it's a little confusing,

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.320
but pretty much everyone keeps ship hopping,

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.780
and they fool the Son'a by beaming them onto a holodeck,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.840
which is programmed to look like the bridge of their ship.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.300
LINKARA: They just happened to have that program in there?

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.920
CRITIC (as Anij): No more questions, Linkara.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.580
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Injector assembly one has been deactivated.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.920
RU'AFO: No!!

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.180
LINKARA: He screams like a baby elephant, and then goes over to the collector device for the rings,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.380
and then Picard beams over there and they have a really crappy action scene,

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.160
blah blah blah.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.920
PICARD: You're really going to risk igniting the exhaust?

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.820
All right. I will!

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.740
RU'AFO: No!

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.560
CRITIC: Most useless. Villain. Ever.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.620
RU'AFO: No!

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.760
LINKARA: So Picard is beamed up, the ship is destroyed, and we get our one funny line in the movie:

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.440
WORF: The Son'a crew would like to negotiate a ceasefire.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.080
It may have something to do with the fact that we have three minutes of air left.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.460
I'm so bored by the rest of this, I can't even bring myself to laugh at that.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.800
LINKARA: We also see that Data has discovered playing!

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:52.460
Seven years of character development on a TV show and three movies and it all comes down to PLAYING.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.280
ARTIM: Don't forget:

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.000
you have to have a little fun, every day.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.560
LINKARA: Start by not watching this movie.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.400
Linkara, I'm not gonna lie.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.420
I do think that's the worst one.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.460
You see?

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.720
CRITIC: Even if you took out the ethical discussions,

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.800
the film as a whole is just a bore.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.380
The action is dull, the effects are dull,

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.140
it's paced more like a really lame episode than it is a feature film.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.880
It just feels like nothing was accomplished,

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.840
and even the worst Star Trek movies left me with, something,

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.620
at least one or two interesting moments.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.840
But this is totally forgettable and has nothing backing it.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:52.340
And in a way, for a Star Trek movie, you could argue that is the worst crime you could ever commit.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.840
Oh wait wait wait, we still have all the problems of Nemesis to go through,

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.720
and I'm not just talking continuity errors here...

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.420
Oh God, Linkara, have you no heart?
SCIFI GUY: Hey.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.060
Why don't you turn off the TV?

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:03.880
Oh, yeah.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.680
I've got plenty of...what the fu-?!

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.440
All right, SciFi Guy, you've been there long enough, I think you've learned your lession.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.640
What lesson? I didn't do anything.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.480
-Wanna go back in the corner?
-No.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:20.160
Well, thanks everybody for joining me for Star Trek Month, I hope you enjoyed it, and...

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.220
(Boos)

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.100
All right, all right, I'll quickly go over Star Trek: Nemesis.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.220
This is the film that everyone says is the other bad Trek film,

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.880
but, to be fair, I don't think it's that bad.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.460
It's got some annoying scenes and way too much action, but,

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:44.160
the whole idea of nature literally vs. nurture I thought was kind of fascinating.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.620
I liked the idea that Picard had to battle his younger self,

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.700
and that, in a different environment, maybe he could've been something entirely different.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.980
And the relationship between the two, I think in many respects, is actually kind of heartbreaking.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.480
To me, that's the glue that held the movie together.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.500
Is it good? Technically, on a storytelling level, probably not.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.920
But, I have to admit, I enjoyed watching it, for the most part,

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.940
but, yeah, I'll admit, as an ending for the Next Generation franchise,

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.300
it probably wasn't all that it could be.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.540
I mean, it could have been a hell of a lot worse. It could be Star Trek: Insurrection!

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.520
-Well, I think...
-Go to the corner!

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:48.520
[Star Trek II theme]

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.400
ANIJ: No more questions.
