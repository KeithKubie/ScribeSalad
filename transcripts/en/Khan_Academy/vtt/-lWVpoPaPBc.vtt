00:00:00.642 --> 00:00:02.586
- [Instructor] Let's say
that we've got the equation

00:00:02.586 --> 00:00:03.836
two X minus one

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:06.209
times X plus four

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:09.042
is equal to zero.

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.623
Pause this video and see
if you can figure out

00:00:12.623 --> 00:00:15.416
the X values that would
satisfy this equation,

00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:18.787
essentially our solutions
to this equation.

00:00:18.787 --> 00:00:21.730
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.009
So at first, you might be tempted

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.331
to multiply these things out,

00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:27.391
or there's multiple ways

00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:29.120
that you might have tried to approach it,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.742
but the key realization here

00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:33.185
is that you have two
things being multiplied,

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:35.291
and it's being equal to zero.

00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:37.603
So you have the first
thing being multiplied

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:39.762
is two X minus one.

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:42.793
This is expression is being multiplied

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:44.043
by X plus four,

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:47.326
and to get it to be equal to zero,

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:49.538
one or both of these expressions

00:00:49.538 --> 00:00:51.705
needs to be equal to zero.

00:00:52.687 --> 00:00:55.482
Let me really reinforce that idea.

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:57.568
If I had two variables,

00:00:57.568 --> 00:00:59.068
let's say A and B,

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:02.046
and I told you A times B

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.418
is equal to zero.

00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:09.654
Well, can you get the
product of two numbers

00:01:09.654 --> 00:01:11.418
to equal zero

00:01:11.418 --> 00:01:12.957
without at least one of them

00:01:12.957 --> 00:01:14.970
being equal to zero?

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.479
And the simple answer is no.

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.566
If A is seven,

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.843
the only way that you would get zero

00:01:18.843 --> 00:01:20.393
is if B is zero,

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:22.012
or if B was five,

00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:23.348
the only way to get zero

00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:25.087
is if A is zero.

00:01:25.087 --> 00:01:26.796
So you see from this example,

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:29.077
either, let me write this down,

00:01:29.077 --> 00:01:29.910
either A

00:01:32.374 --> 00:01:33.457
or B or both,

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.173
'cause zero times zero is zero,

00:01:37.173 --> 00:01:38.923
or both must be zero.

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:44.370
The only way that you get the
product of two quantities,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.608
and you get zero,

00:01:45.608 --> 00:01:49.329
is if one or both of
them is equal to zero.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.045
I really wanna reinforce this idea.

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:54.233
I'm gonna put a red box around it

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:56.480
so that it really gets
stuck in your brain,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.138
and I want you to think about why that is.

00:01:58.138 --> 00:01:59.325
Try to come up with two numbers.

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:01.821
Try to multiply them so that you get zero,

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.748
and you're gonna see
that one of those numbers

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:06.081
is going to need to be zero.

00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:11.885
So we're gonna use this
idea right over here.

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:13.608
Now this might look a
little bit different,

00:02:13.608 --> 00:02:17.480
but you could view two
X minus one as our A,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.963
and you could view X plus four as our B.

00:02:20.963 --> 00:02:25.110
So either two X minus one
needs to be equal to zero,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.583
or X plus four needs to be equal to zero,

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:31.275
or both of them needs to be equal to zero.

00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:34.608
So I could write that as two X minus one

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:37.899
needs to be equal to zero,

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.149
or X plus four,

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.941
or X, let me do that orange.

00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:46.266
Actually, let me do the two X minus one

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.810
in that yellow color.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.393
So either two X minus
one is equal to zero,

00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:55.591
or X plus four is equal to zero.

00:02:57.342 --> 00:02:59.759
X plus four is equal to zero,

00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:03.640
and so let's solve each of these.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.066
If two X minus one could be equal to zero,

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:08.922
well, let's see, you could
add one to both sides,

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.672
and we get two X is equal to one.

00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:15.738
Divide both sides by two,

00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:17.241
and this just straightforward

00:03:17.241 --> 00:03:18.516
solving a linear equation.

00:03:18.516 --> 00:03:20.034
If this looks unfamiliar,

00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:21.311
I encourage you to watch videos

00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:23.836
on solving linear
equations on Khan Academy,

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:27.307
but you'll get X is equal
to 1/2 as one solution.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:28.140
This is interesting

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.110
'cause we're gonna have
two solutions here,

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.083
or over here, if we wanna solve for X,

00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:34.621
we can subtract four from both sides,

00:03:34.621 --> 00:03:38.830
and we would get X is
equal to negative four.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.758
So it's neat.

00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:41.390
In an equation like this,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.991
you can actually have two solutions.

00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.068
X could be equal to 1/2,

00:03:46.068 --> 00:03:49.039
or X could be equal to negative four.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.196
I think it's pretty interesting

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:53.174
to substitute either one of these in.

00:03:53.174 --> 00:03:54.933
If X is equal to 1/2,

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:56.504
what is going to happen?

00:03:56.504 --> 00:04:00.723
Well, this is going to be
two times 1/2 minus one,

00:04:00.723 --> 00:04:04.033
two times 1/2 minus one.

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:06.715
That's going to be our first expression,

00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:11.598
and then our second expression
is going to be 1/2 plus four.

00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:13.699
And so what's this going to be equal to?

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.852
Well, two times 1/2 is one.

00:04:15.852 --> 00:04:18.261
One minus one is zero,

00:04:18.261 --> 00:04:19.806
so I don't care what you have over here.

00:04:19.806 --> 00:04:24.512
Zero times anything is
going to be equal to zero.

00:04:24.512 --> 00:04:26.115
So when X equals 1/2,

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:27.677
the first thing becomes zero,

00:04:27.677 --> 00:04:31.014
making everything, making
the product equal zero.

00:04:31.014 --> 00:04:33.210
And likewise, if X equals negative four,

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.075
it's pretty clear that
this second expression

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:36.368
is going to be zero,

00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:37.931
and even though this first expression

00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:39.493
isn't going to be zero in that case,

00:04:39.493 --> 00:04:42.826
anything times zero is going to be zero.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.453
Let's do one more example here.

00:04:48.776 --> 00:04:49.609
So let me

00:04:50.776 --> 00:04:53.711
delete out everything
that I just wrote here,

00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:56.927
and so I'm gonna involve a function.

00:04:56.927 --> 00:04:59.059
So let's say someone told you

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:00.726
that F of X is equal

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.193
to X minus five, times five X, plus two,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.642
and someone said, "Find
the zeros of F of X."

00:05:12.642 --> 00:05:14.889
Well, the zeros are, what are the X values

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.962
that make F of X equal to zero?

00:05:16.962 --> 00:05:19.707
When does F of X equal zero?

00:05:19.707 --> 00:05:21.124
For what X values

00:05:25.623 --> 00:05:26.540
does F of X

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:30.046
equal zero?

00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:31.223
That's what people are really asking

00:05:31.223 --> 00:05:34.723
when they say, "Find the zeros of F of X."

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.177
So to do that, well, when
does F of X equal zero?

00:05:38.177 --> 00:05:39.392
Well, F of X is equal to zero

00:05:39.392 --> 00:05:41.474
when this expression right over here

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:42.800
is equal to zero,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.741
and so it sets up just like
the equation we just saw.

00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:46.741
X minus five

00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:50.118
times five X plus two,

00:05:51.223 --> 00:05:53.214
when does that equal zero?

00:05:53.214 --> 00:05:55.025
And like we saw before,

00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:56.999
well, this is just like
what we saw before,

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:58.257
and I encourage you to pause the video,

00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:01.051
and try to work it out on your own.

00:06:01.051 --> 00:06:03.616
So there's two situations

00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:05.205
where this could happen,

00:06:05.205 --> 00:06:09.294
where either the first
expression equals zero,

00:06:09.294 --> 00:06:10.342
or the second expression,

00:06:10.342 --> 00:06:11.476
or maybe in some cases,

00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:14.692
you'll have a situation where
both expressions equal zero.

00:06:14.692 --> 00:06:18.872
So we could say either X
minus five is equal to zero,

00:06:18.872 --> 00:06:21.872
or five X plus two is equal to zero.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.860
I'll write an, or, right over here.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.948
Now if we solve for X,

00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:28.409
you add five to both
sides of this equation.

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.399
You get X is equal to five.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:31.422
Here, let's see.

00:06:31.422 --> 00:06:32.255
To solve for X,

00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:33.900
you could subtract two from both sides.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.123
You get five X is equal to negative two,

00:06:37.123 --> 00:06:40.014
and you could divide both sides by five

00:06:40.014 --> 00:06:41.471
to solve for X,

00:06:41.471 --> 00:06:45.139
and you get X is equal to negative 2/5.

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.612
So here are two zeros.

00:06:47.612 --> 00:06:50.149
You input either one of these into F of X.

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:51.412
If you input X equals five,

00:06:51.412 --> 00:06:53.321
if you take F of five,

00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:54.692
if you try to evaluate F of five,

00:06:54.692 --> 00:06:56.844
then this first
expression's gonna be zero,

00:06:56.844 --> 00:06:59.476
and so a product of
zero and something else,

00:06:59.476 --> 00:07:01.327
it doesn't matter that
this is gonna be 27.

00:07:01.327 --> 00:07:03.690
Zero times 27 is zero,

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.981
and if you take F of negative 2/5,

00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:09.925
it doesn't matter what
this first expression is.

00:07:09.925 --> 00:07:11.132
The second expression right over here

00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:11.965
is gonna be zero.

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:14.298
Zero times anything is zero.
