00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.230
In recent years, filmmakers have gotten a
lot better at making kids’ movies appeal

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.270
to adults – usually by filling it with jokes
and references that the average kid won’t

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.270
even understand.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.340
There are almost too many to choose from,
but these are just a few of our favorite adult

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.720
jokes that younger audiences never caught.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.739
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Hidden Adult Jokes
In Children's Movies.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:32.739
Space Jam (Warner Bros.)

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.360
In the wacky universe of Space Jam, anything
could happen!

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.360
After a cosmic amusement park experiences
a dip in attendance, the owner starts to scout

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.390
out some new talent.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.219
When The Looney Tunes become the target of
a cosmic amusement park owner looking to boost

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.600
profits, they wind up having their freedom
bet on a basketball game.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.019
Thankfully, the Looney Tunes have Michael
Jordan on their side, but the opposition is

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.019
tough.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.079
The MonSTARS cheat by stealing the talents
of real-world NBA stars.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.769
When the players are given physicals to try
to understand why they suddenly can’t play

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.594
basketball, the doctor drops a erectile dysfunction
joke (“how’s your performance off the

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:13.190
court?”) that definitely stayed under the
radar of most kids.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.190
Shrek (DreamWorks Pictures)

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.640
In Shrek’s movie debut, his peaceful existence
is ruined when an evil Lord banishes all fairy

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.780
tale characters to live in his beloved swamp.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.520
Shrek heads off to see the Lord and convince
him to reverse the decision, but even before

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.580
he meets “Lord Farquaad," kids will have
missed a particularly crude joke.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.820
Try saying Lord Farquaad’s name twice as
fast, and you’ll hear the R-Rated nickname

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.470
“F-wad” some fans claim is an obvious
joke, not to mention Shrek and Donkey implying

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.100
that his massive castle is making up for a
shortage elsewhere.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.100
Monster House (Columbia Pictures)

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.960
Neighborly disputes are common, but Monster
House shows how bad things can get when the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.250
owner’s soul literally merges with his house.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.210
When the films’ trio of kids loses their
basketball on the property leads to a grisly

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.080
scuffle, the kids decide to investigate inside.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.030
The house is modeled after the human body,
with references to anatomy worked right into

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.030
its architecture.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.180
The parts of the house never head below the
belt, but when a part of the human anatomy

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.530
comes close, the filmmakers couldn’t pass
up the gag that even adults might miss.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.920
101 Dalmatians (Walt Disney Pictures)

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.310
Not all cartoons translate well to live-action,
but Disney’s retelling of 101 Dalmatians

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.170
sticks pretty close to the original story.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.780
When Cruella De Ville talks to stars Roger
and Anita, it’s revealed that the couple

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.610
is also expecting a baby to go along with
the upcoming litter of puppies.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.510
Cruella snaps her gaze to Roger and makes
a crude joke that is at best, accusing him

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.800
of cheating, and at worst, well you’ll see.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.629
Neither one seems at home in a Disney movie.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:45.689
The Little Mermaid (Disney)

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.739
When the restless mermaid star of this Disney
classic falls in love with a human, she makes

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.450
a deal that goes horribly wrong.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.200
She winds up with her prince in the end, but
the wedding scene didn’t kill the rumor

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.109
that Disney likes to hide adult references
in all of their films.

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.159
Conspiracy theorists like to point out that
the minister is far too excited to be leading

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.640
the ceremony (See Still Image), while Disney’s
defenders claim his knobby knees are the obvious

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.640
explanation.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.749
Either way, Disney took note, and only copies
produced during the original run contain the

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:11.919
scene in its true state.

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.739
It was modified for the 2006 re-release.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:16.739
Muppet Treasure Island (Buena Vista Pictures)

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.860
Based on the classic pirate caper, Muppet
Treasure Island keeps to the original plot,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.510
sending Muppets on a search for treasure while
navigating pirate-infested waters.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.360
The Muppets have always been as popular with
adults as kids, and known for incorporating

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.599
dirty, sometimes dark humor into their show.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.590
One of the film’s more risqué scenes sees
Kermit and Miss Piggy reunite, with the pink

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.609
pirates discussing her past lovers.

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.840
She then greets Tim Curry’s Long John Silver
a little too intimately, leading Kermit to

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.879
assume they’ve also knocked boots.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:49.879
Madagascar (DreamWorks Pictures)

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.549
Most parents learn fast that inventing words
or phrases to replace cursing in front of

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.559
their kids is a must, but sometimes, the cleverest
solutions make it into film.

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:01.129
In the animal adventure Madagascar, a group
of pampered animals escape their New York

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.650
zoo to wind up on the island of Madagascar.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.519
Alex the lion is prone to hunger-induced hallucinations,
which means his friend Marty the zebra starts

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.099
to look a little too delicious.

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.510
When their ride home arrives, Marty runs to
fetch a starving Alex.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.340
As Marty turns to flee the attack, he shouts
out a seemingly meaningless string of words

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.519
(“sugar honey iced tea”).

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.890
When adults take a second to think it over,
they’ll realize the words’ first letters

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.830
are a bit more accurate.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.410
The Rugrats Movie (Paramount Pictures)

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.410
If you were watching Nickelodeon in the nineties,
there’s a good chance you know cartoon babies

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.810
Tommy, Chuckie, Phil and Lil, and the rest
of the Rugrats gang.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.370
The cartoon’s full-length movie saw Tommy
and his friends set out to return his newborn

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.530
brother Dil to the hospital.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.770
The show was always a bit edgy, but one dirty
little joke slides by almost completely undetected.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.480
A conversation between two newborns turns
dark as one laments the loss of her umbilical

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.930
cord.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.660
The second baby stares longingly into his
diaper, telling her to be happy that’s all

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.030
they took.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.630
Mrs. Doubtfire (20th Century Fox)

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.030
Deadbeat dads are nothing new for Hollywood,
but when it’s Robin Williams in the role,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.220
you know it’s going to be funny.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.050
It’s bad enough that his character loses
his kids in a custody battle with his soon-to-be

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.960
ex-wife, but disguising himself as the elderly
Mrs. Doubtfire actually works - until a new

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.220
suitor named Stu starts courting his wife.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.800
People who only saw the movie as children
might now realize that the villainous Stu

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.150
was actually a decent guy, but most of the
sexual innuendo probably went completely over

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.150
their heads.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.670
No conversation proves it better than Mrs.
Doubtfire’s attempt to scare him off by

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.680
discussing her nighttime hobbies, all of which
were completely meaningless to the kids just

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.330
laughing at a man dressed as an old woman.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.440
The Road to El Dorado (DreamWorks Pictures)

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.060
In this Dreamworks adventure, two quasi-criminals
quest to find a mystical “city of gold,”

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.970
but it wouldn't be much of a movie if things
went smoothly for the heroes Tulio and Miguel.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.390
The journey isn't all bad though, especially
for Tulio, who enjoys the company of a beautiful

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.390
woman named Chel.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.960
In fact, he might be enjoying it a little
too much.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.860
In one scene, the camera pans across a couch
before Chel appears from below, followed by

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.640
a satisfied Tulio.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.920
Considering the sounds heard before they're
interrupted - and the fact that their heads

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.830
pop up from two different places - the animators
seem to be implying something far more adult

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.390
than a PG kids movie.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.830
But we'll let you decide.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.990
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.000
