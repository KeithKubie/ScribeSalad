parents are finally figuring out that
you're in good shape but this is a sort

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600
you're in good shape but this is a sort
 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.280

of a strange strange moment of course
 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.800
of a strange strange moment of course
it's a moment of being on a threshold

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810
it's a moment of being on a threshold
 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.150
it's a moment of being on a threshold
and because your post professional

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160
and because your post professional
 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.130
and because your post professional
students it's a very strange threshold

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140
students it's a very strange threshold
 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.350
students it's a very strange threshold
like you kind of walk in you play with

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360
like you kind of walk in you play with
 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.969
like you kind of walk in you play with
us for a while and then you rock it out

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979
us for a while and then you rock it out
 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.639
us for a while and then you rock it out
and in theory you leave faster than you

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649
and in theory you leave faster than you
 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:09.959
and in theory you leave faster than you
came in in other words what goes on

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969
came in in other words what goes on
 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.179
came in in other words what goes on
during your time with us as you

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189
during your time with us as you
 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.209
during your time with us as you
accelerate but i think it's just very

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219
accelerate but i think it's just very
 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.349
accelerate but i think it's just very
very important to get rid of those

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359
very important to get rid of those
 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.730
very important to get rid of those
clothes because also what comes with the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740
clothes because also what comes with the
 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.609
clothes because also what comes with the
uniform is that everything is sealed up

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619
uniform is that everything is sealed up
 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.709
uniform is that everything is sealed up
like all the differences between you get

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719
like all the differences between you get
 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.139
like all the differences between you get
sealed up but also the openings it goes

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149
sealed up but also the openings it goes
 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.700
sealed up but also the openings it goes
full length you basically become a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710
full length you basically become a
 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.580
full length you basically become a
little bit invisible and this is a

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590
little bit invisible and this is a
 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.319
little bit invisible and this is a
school as you know totally devoted to

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329
school as you know totally devoted to
 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.300
school as you know totally devoted to
opening up architecture to new potential

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310
opening up architecture to new potential
 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.819
opening up architecture to new potential
so it's really about taking away one set

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829
so it's really about taking away one set
 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.059
so it's really about taking away one set
of clothes and trying alternative

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069
of clothes and trying alternative
 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.440
of clothes and trying alternative
operations and that of course as you

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450
operations and that of course as you
 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.029
operations and that of course as you
know is what I think an architect is

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039
know is what I think an architect is
 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.059
know is what I think an architect is
since what an urban designer is is

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069
since what an urban designer is is
 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.190
since what an urban designer is is
simply somebody who creates new

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200
simply somebody who creates new
 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.889
simply somebody who creates new
potentials which does not mean that you

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899
potentials which does not mean that you
 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.719
potentials which does not mean that you
change the physical fabric of the world

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729
change the physical fabric of the world
 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.300
change the physical fabric of the world
it means much bigger thing which is you

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310
it means much bigger thing which is you
 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.969
it means much bigger thing which is you
change the way people see the world and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979
change the way people see the world and
 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.219
change the way people see the world and
all you do is invite them to think

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229
all you do is invite them to think
 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.840
all you do is invite them to think
differently and you've got all sorts of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850
differently and you've got all sorts of
 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.020
differently and you've got all sorts of
tricks all sorts of ways to make people

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
tricks all sorts of ways to make people
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.490
tricks all sorts of ways to make people
see the world differently and as you

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500
see the world differently and as you
 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.900
see the world differently and as you
know I think for me this is almost like

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910
know I think for me this is almost like
 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.870
know I think for me this is almost like
a technical procedure

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880
a technical procedure
 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.270
a technical procedure
everybody's busy living their lives like

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280
everybody's busy living their lives like
 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.190
everybody's busy living their lives like
billions of people in in a huge world

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200
billions of people in in a huge world
 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.080
billions of people in in a huge world
and almost everybody is actually trying

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090
and almost everybody is actually trying
 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.410
and almost everybody is actually trying
to survive I mean it's really a planet

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420
to survive I mean it's really a planet
 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.320
to survive I mean it's really a planet
of people trying to survive and what the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330
of people trying to survive and what the
 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.210
of people trying to survive and what the
architect of the urban designer does is

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
architect of the urban designer does is
 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.610
architect of the urban designer does is
insert into the rhythms of everyday life

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
insert into the rhythms of everyday life
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.370
insert into the rhythms of everyday life
something slightly different kind of a

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380
something slightly different kind of a
 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.800
something slightly different kind of a
hesitation a way of thinking different

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810
hesitation a way of thinking different
 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.720
hesitation a way of thinking different
and it's almost a surgical thing it's

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
and it's almost a surgical thing it's
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.250
and it's almost a surgical thing it's
not like you design whole new cities

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260
not like you design whole new cities
 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.080
not like you design whole new cities
it's that you change the way people

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090
it's that you change the way people
 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.800
it's that you change the way people
think about what a city might be what

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810
think about what a city might be what
 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.720
think about what a city might be what
that means is that you are incredibly

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
that means is that you are incredibly
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.600
that means is that you are incredibly
optimistic like an amazingly optimistic

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610
optimistic like an amazingly optimistic
 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.490
optimistic like an amazingly optimistic
that you will go out in the world make a

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
that you will go out in the world make a
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.010
that you will go out in the world make a
little adjustment that will have people

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020
little adjustment that will have people
 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.780
little adjustment that will have people
think differently see the world

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
think differently see the world
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.370
think differently see the world
differently and then maybe live their

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380
differently and then maybe live their
 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.370
differently and then maybe live their
lives differently and I think this

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380
lives differently and I think this
 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.220
lives differently and I think this
optimism is incredibly important if you

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230
optimism is incredibly important if you
 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.320
optimism is incredibly important if you

way the world is going and what's weird
 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.450
way the world is going and what's weird
about an architecture school is

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460
about an architecture school is
 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.940
about an architecture school is
precisely because the world needs our

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950
precisely because the world needs our
 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.430
precisely because the world needs our
care we have this extraordinary optimism

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440
care we have this extraordinary optimism
 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.960

when everybody else is sort of down
we're sort of up even in the financial

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940
we're sort of up even in the financial
 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.870
we're sort of up even in the financial
crisis interestingly the architects who

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880
crisis interestingly the architects who
 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.060
crisis interestingly the architects who
are the first not to get any jobs as a

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070
are the first not to get any jobs as a
 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.530
are the first not to get any jobs as a
result of the crisis the kind of

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540
result of the crisis the kind of
 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.800
result of the crisis the kind of
Canaries of the economic world are the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810
Canaries of the economic world are the
 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.720
Canaries of the economic world are the
most optimistic and the most interested

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730
most optimistic and the most interested
 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.080
most optimistic and the most interested
in what the new potentials the new

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090
in what the new potentials the new
 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.660
in what the new potentials the new
potentials are so basically what goes on

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670
potentials are so basically what goes on
 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.340
potentials are so basically what goes on
here is that we spend some time with you

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350
here is that we spend some time with you
 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.500
here is that we spend some time with you
totally crazy in this intense laboratory

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510
totally crazy in this intense laboratory
 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.110
totally crazy in this intense laboratory
of experimentation in theory you come

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120
of experimentation in theory you come
 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.780
of experimentation in theory you come
out somehow different but you also leave

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790
out somehow different but you also leave
 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.400
out somehow different but you also leave
the school totally different as well and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410
the school totally different as well and
 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.310
the school totally different as well and
this particular class has changed the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320
this particular class has changed the
 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.530
this particular class has changed the
school and the school yet doesn't yet

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540
school and the school yet doesn't yet
 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.910
school and the school yet doesn't yet
know what that means in other words you

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920
know what that means in other words you
 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.680
know what that means in other words you
haven't left yet we're still suffering

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690
haven't left yet we're still suffering
 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.290

the shark of the end of year show so

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300
the shark of the end of year show so
 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.550
the shark of the end of year show so
basically the end of the show we

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560
basically the end of the show we
 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.920
basically the end of the show we
realized what kind of damage you are

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930
realized what kind of damage you are
 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.680

doing to our assumptions to our way of
 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.990
doing to our assumptions to our way of
thinking so basically the school is sort

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000
thinking so basically the school is sort
 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.220
thinking so basically the school is sort
of thinking well what does that mean for

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230
of thinking well what does that mean for
 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.289
of thinking well what does that mean for
the future of architecture and education

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299
the future of architecture and education
 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.180

the school so you have to go really fast
 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.950
the school so you have to go really fast
and be going at such a speed that we

desperately in need of intelligence it's

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240
desperately in need of intelligence it's
 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.670
