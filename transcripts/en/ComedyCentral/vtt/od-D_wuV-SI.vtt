00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.468
I put my protein shake down some
place

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:04.137 size:75% position:38%
and now I can't find it!

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.773 align:end position:100%
Listen, I'm sorry,
but I told your friends

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.708 align:end position:100%
that they were making a little
too much noise--

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:10.443 align:start position:0%
Those aren't my friends
anymore, Dad.

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:13.379 align:start position:0%
I don't need friends.
I'm perfect.

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.048 align:end position:100%
They just drummed louder,
you know?

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:18.418 align:end position:100%
So I--I called the police
to file a noise complaint.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:19.519 align:start position:0%
The police?

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
Dad, the police
are weaklings.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:22.355 align:start position:0%
They can't do anything.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:23.856 align:start position:0%
Watch this.

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:26.426

I have already told
you to be quiet!

Artificially elevated levels
of testosterone

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.901 line:0%
may be useful for short-term
muscle gain,

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.203 line:0%
but not for
conflict resolution.

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:41.307
[yells]
This is ending now!

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.942
One, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.711
Evict the outcast!
Evict him.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:49.082
I have achieved perfection
in body and mind!

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:52.652
- I am the ultimate man!
all: Five, six.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.388
I will destroy everything
you have built,

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:58.091
starting with this
stupid tambourines!

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.493
- And the these stupid drums!
- Hey! Hey! Not the bongos.

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:03.329
This flag used to stand
for something beautiful!

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:06.632
I want you
off my dad's property!

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:09.735 align:end position:100%
Would you please just stop?
Stop this!

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.871
(Forrest, voice-over)
As I rampaged against
my ex-girlfriend

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.806
and her heavily armed
followers,

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:15.408
the police my dad
called arrived on the scene.

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.677
Drop it now!
Drop it!

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.847
(Forrest, voice-over)
They were joined by members
of the FBI cult squad.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.250
As they pulled out their guns
on Mrs. Greenfield's militia,

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:27.487
I pulled out the last weapon
I had at my disposal.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.724
Look upon my works
and despair!

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:34.327
- Oh--Oh, God!
- Put down the weapon!

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.029
Oh God, oh God,
oh God.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:41.033
(Forrest, voice-over)
I do not know who fired first,
or how the horrible chaos began.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:45.404
But clearly, I had to get
out of there--and fast.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:46.606
- What are you doing?
- All right, all right,

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.843 align:start position:0%
all right, all right--
Oh God!

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:55.748
- I can't find my--
- No! No! No! Ahh!

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:05.958
Protect the space ark!
Protect the space ark!

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.393
(Officer)
Drop it now! Drop it!

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:10.630
Officer! Don't shoot
the orange Hulk!

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.298
He's a good boy!

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:14.934
Oh, God.
Oh God, oh God!

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.209
(Father) He's really sweet!
- Dad!

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:25.611
Forrest, I love you!

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:28.748
(Officer)
Down! Drop the gun!

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.918
- Dad!
- Oh!!

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.786
- Dad!
- Put down the weapon!

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.623 align:start size:59% position:41%
Die, monsters, die!

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:43.829 align:end position:100%
Oh, no! God, no! Oh!
We got to get out of here.

00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:45.464
- What?
- Don't look. Don't look.

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.833
- They blew up what?
- Don't look at the house.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.735
- Don't look at--why?
- Don't look at it.

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:51.938 align:start position:0%
Ahh! No!

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.839
- Not again!
- We got to go!

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:55.575
(Forrest, voice-over)
All this time later,

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.977
I'm still coming to terms
with the horror

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.246
of what happened
in that field.

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.615
How did my quest
for the perfect body

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:05.851
cost so many other people
their bodies?

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:07.420
It is, by far,

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:08.788
the most terrible experience 

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.491
this show has subjected me to.
