00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.490
Welcome to the presentation on
subtracting decimal numbers.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.390
Let's get started
with some problems.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:23.470
The first problem I have
here says 5.73 minus

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.670
0.0821 equals who knows?

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.260
So the first thing you always
want to do with a decimal like

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.680
this, and I actually kind of
inadvertently did this, is that

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.920
you want to line
up the decimals.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.250
so you actually want this
decimal to be right

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.540
above this decimal.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.870
I almost did that when I did
it, it must have been my

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.870
subconscious doing it.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.290
But let me just do it
a little bit neater.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.630
So it's 5.73, and I'll
put the decimal here.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.060
0.0821.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.580
And some people say it's good
to always put a zero in

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.350
front of the decimal.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.600
My wife's a doctor and she
says it's critical otherwise

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.310
you might give someone the
wrong amount of medicine.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.510
So, we've lined up the
decimals and now we're

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.175
ready to subtract.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.150
So one thing that you have
to think about when you do

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.830
decimals is we're going to
have to subtract this 21

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.890
ten-thousandths or this 2
and this 1 from something.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.470
We can't just subtract it
from this blank space.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.910
So we have to add two 0s here.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.270
And as you know, with the
decimal when you add 0s to the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.870
end of it, it really doesn't
change the value

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.980
of the decimal.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.650
So at this point, we just
view this like a level

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.660
four subtraction problem.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.610
So the first thing we do in any
subtraction problem is see if

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.970
any of the numbers on top are
smaller than any of the

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.770
numbers on the bottom.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.350
Well in this case there
are a lot of them.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.040
So this 0 is less than this 1,
this 0 is less than this 2,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.410
this 3 is less than this 8.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.780
So we're going to
have to borrow.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.990
Some people will like to
do their borrowing and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.250
subtracting, they kind of
alternate between the two.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.510
I like to do all of my
borrowing ahead of time.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.540
So what I do is I start in
the top right and I say

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.990
OK, 0 is less than 1.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.670
So that 0 becomes a 10.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.710
But in order to become a
10 I would have had to

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.620
borrow 1 from some place.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.580
I look to the left of that
0 and I say well, can

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.500
I borrow the 1 from 0?

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.570
Well, no.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.440
This is just the way I do it.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.610
There are people who would
actually let you borrow the 1

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.630
from the 0, but I say no,
instead of borrowing the 1

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.790
from the 0, I borrow the
1 from this entire 30.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.470
So this 30 -- see, there's a
30 so I'm going to borrow 1

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.650
from it and it becomes 29.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.710
So we borrowed 1 from this 30
to get a 10 here, and now let's

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.700
check again to see if all of
our numbers on top are larger

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.900
than all the numbers
on the bottom.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.550
Well 10 is larger than 1,
9 is larger than 2, 2

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.090
is not larger than 8.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.230
So we have to borrow again.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.040
So if we're going to borrow,
the 2 becomes a 12, and the 7

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.100
-- we borrowed 1 from
that -- becomes a 6.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.970
So let's check again.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.500
10 is larger than 1, 9 is
larger than 2, 12 is larger

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.280
than 8, 6 is larger than 0,
and 5 is larger than 0.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.330
So now we've done all of our
borrowing and we're ready to

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.010
do some subtraction, and
this is the easy part.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.630
10 minus 1 is 9.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.460
9 minus 2 is 7.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.370
12 minus 8 is 4.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.420
6 minus 0 is 6.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.920
5 minus 0 is 5.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.640
And we just bring down
the decimal point.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.850
So there's our answer.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:55.130
5.73 minus 0.0821 is
equal to 5.6479.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.530
There you go.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.655
I probably confused you, so
let's do some more problems.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.260
Here's another one.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.795
8 -- let me leave some space
on top to do the borrowing

00:04:09.795 --> 00:04:25.880
-- 8.25 minus 0.0105.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.100
So what was that first step
that I always have to do?

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.030
Right.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.190
To line up the decimals.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.720
So let me do that.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:46.080
So it's 8.25 and 0.0105.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.300
Notice I lined up this decimal
right below this decimal.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.330
Now I add the 0s, just because
this 0 and this 5 need to be

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.040
subtracted from something.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.630
Now let me do my borrowing.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.190
So once again, all I do is
check to see whether the

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.180
top number is larger than
the number below it.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.550
Well, this 0 is smaller than 5,
so I'm going to have to borrow.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.350
So I'm going to borrow.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.400
I can't borrow from this
0, I have to borrow

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.990
from this entire 50.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.900
So this 50, if I borrow
1 from 50 I get 49.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.840
And this 0 will then
become a 10, right?

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.060
I borrowed 1 from
50 to get a 10.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.560
Now, am I done?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.440
10 is larger than 5.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.550
9 is larger than 0.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.970
4 is larger than 1.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.910
2 is larger than 0.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.530
8 is larger than 0.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.610
So I think I'm
ready to subtract.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.130
10 minus 5, well that's 5.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.240
9 minus 0 is 9.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.140
4 minus 1 is 3.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.710
2 minus 0 is 2.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.960
8 minus 0 is 8.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.730
And I bring down
the decimal point.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.690
So if you mastered level four
subtraction, the decimal

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.450
problems really are just about
lining up the decimal point,

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.060
adding the 0s and then
just doing a normal

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.440
subtraction problem.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.400
In general with subtraction I
think most people have the most

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.260
trouble with the borrowing.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.230
The way I do it I think is a
little bit different than is

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.100
taught in a lot of schools.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.140
A lot of schools they'll do
the subtraction and they'll

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.670
borrow alternatively.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.140
But I find this easier when I
just borrow ahead of time, and

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.320
I also, like for example in
this problem, when I had to

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.930
make this 0 into a 10, instead
of borrowing from the 0, which

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.820
is not intuitive because I
can't really borrow from the 0,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.720
I borrowed from this entire 50
and I made that into a 49.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.040
Let's do one more problem.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:58.500
If I have 2.64 minus 0.0486.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.670
So once again, let's line
up the decimal points.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:11.720
2.64 and it's .0486.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.620
Lined up the decimal
points, the 0s on top.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.380
You're going to have a 0
here, so I have to borrow.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.490
Becomes a 10.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.260
Can't borrow from the
0, so I have to borrow

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.920
from this entire 40.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.166
So this 40 becomes a 39.

00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:29.440
I think I'm running
out of space.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.450
So 10 is larger than 6.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.020
9 is larger than 8.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.420
3 is not larger than 4.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.750
So this 3 I'm going
to have to borrow.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.480
So 3 becomes a 13.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.000
I apologize, I'm
becoming scrunched.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.396
And this 6 becomes a 5.

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:46.040
This is really bad, I
shouldn't do it so messy.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.040
But now we say the 10 is larger
than 6, the 9 is larger than

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.560
the 8, this 13, this 13
should be on top of that 3.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.550
The 13 is larger than 4,
and 5 is larger than 0.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.120
So we're ready to subtract.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.270
10 minus 6 is 4.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.590
9 minus 8 is 1.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.320
13 minus 4 is 9.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.800
5 minus 0 is 5.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.880
2 minus nothing is 2.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.180
Bring down the decimal point.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:21.530
So 2.64 minus 0.0486
is equal to 2.5914.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.200
Hope I didn't confuse
you too much.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.740
But I think you're
ready now to try the

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.680
subtraction of decimals.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.250
Have fun.
