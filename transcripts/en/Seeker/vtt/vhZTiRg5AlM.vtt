00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.140
The holidays are a time of happiness, families,
food and DEATH.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:13.860
You heard me.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.510
Death happens, it's an inevitable part of
life.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.310
Some holidays, like Dia de Los Muertos and
Halloween celebrate the dead; and others,

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.040
like the running of the bulls, in Pamplona,
seems to invite death!

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.890
The most dangerous holidays however, might
be a surprise.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.430
The Running of the Bulls, for example, only
see Two to three hundred injuries, most of

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.320
those being bruises and scrapes.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.290
In San Miguel, Mexico a sledgehammer firework
festival takes place, where they strap fireworks

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.240
to the end of sledgehammers and swing them
at the ground really hard.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.120
When the plastic explosive hits the ground,
the molecules are compressed and the friction

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.730
causes heat and an explosion…

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.080
Though there aren't stats for how much death
this has deathed…

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.080
It is totally…

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.080
Yeah.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.080
Wow.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.190
50 people were injured in 2008 alone.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.489
Holidays can be dangerous, even without exploding
sledgehammers.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.340
The American Automobile Association or Triple
A, uses auto crash statistics to estimate

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.580
which holiday is the most dangerous, and though
Thanksgiving is bad, with 50% more drivers

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.160
on the road and a lot more alcohol consumption.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.580
The winner is the Fourth of July!

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.990
The National Safety Council estimates around
540 deaths and 58,000 serious injuries from

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.140
drinking and driving, and surely from people
letting the fireworks blow up in their hands.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.450
*eye roll* // Protip: put it down BEFORE you
light it.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.090
// According to the US Consumer Product Safety
Commission, 240 people EVERY DAY OF JULY head

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.970
into their local ER for fireworks-related
injuries; with 36 percent of those being hand

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.820
or finger injuries and 22 percent being head
injuries.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.439
7 percent is trunks or…

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.439
Other…

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.440
I hope it's not…

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.440
You know.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440
*shudder*

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.830
But, the deadliest holidays according to science?

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.939
Christmas and New Years; says a A 2010 study
in the journal Social Science &amp; Medicine!

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:07.380
Researchers looked at 57-and-a-half million
death certificates from 1979 and 2004 and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.200
found that 42,325 natural deaths occurred
during that time, and a SPIKE happens in the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.069
two weeks trailing Christmas.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.269
Death the halls, everybody!

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.200
In fact, more people die in hospitals on Christmas,
Boxing Day (the day after Christmas) and New

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.780
Year's Day than any other day.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.349
Essentially increasing your chances between
3 and 9 percent overall; 6 percent more on

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.349
Christmas.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.349
alone!

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.140
There's no one cause for the increase, which
is puzzling; they hypothesize it could be

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.959
psychological stress, substance abuse, cold
weather, winter travel, and even simply overcrowding

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.459
in emergency rooms.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.879
In the end, the biggest killer is going to
be nature, but we sure are okay with helping

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.099
it along at times.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:03:00.699
What do you think of all this?
