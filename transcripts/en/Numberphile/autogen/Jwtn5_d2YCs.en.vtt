00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.110
so I'd like to talk about three infinite

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120
so I'd like to talk about three infinite
 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.990
so I'd like to talk about three infinite
series so sums of infinitely many

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000
series so sums of infinitely many
 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.450
series so sums of infinitely many
numbers so here's the first one 1 plus

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
numbers so here's the first one 1 plus
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.830
numbers so here's the first one 1 plus
1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8 plus blah blah

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8 plus blah blah
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.410
1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8 plus blah blah
blah what's that and the answer is it's

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420
blah what's that and the answer is it's
 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.900
blah what's that and the answer is it's
2 this is the problem of Achilles and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
2 this is the problem of Achilles and
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.509
2 this is the problem of Achilles and
the tortoise Achilles is to Stadio or

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
the tortoise Achilles is to Stadio or
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.400
the tortoise Achilles is to Stadio or
whatever the unit of length is in

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
whatever the unit of length is in
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.529
whatever the unit of length is in
ancient Greece from The Tortoise well

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539
ancient Greece from The Tortoise well
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.849
ancient Greece from The Tortoise well
after a while

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
after a while
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.999
after a while
Achilles gains on the tortoise one unit

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
Achilles gains on the tortoise one unit
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.630
Achilles gains on the tortoise one unit
and so the remaining distance is only 1

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640
and so the remaining distance is only 1
 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.690
and so the remaining distance is only 1
then after a while Achilles gains half

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
then after a while Achilles gains half
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.810
then after a while Achilles gains half
of the distance to the tortoise and now

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
of the distance to the tortoise and now
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.959
of the distance to the tortoise and now
the distance to the tortoise is 1/2

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969
the distance to the tortoise is 1/2
 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.369
the distance to the tortoise is 1/2
after a little while Achilles gains

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379
after a little while Achilles gains
 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.290
after a little while Achilles gains
another 1/4 of the distance to the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
another 1/4 of the distance to the
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.600
another 1/4 of the distance to the
tortoise and so on and so on and so on

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
tortoise and so on and so on and so on
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.670
tortoise and so on and so on and so on
the story according to Zeno's paradoxes

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680
the story according to Zeno's paradoxes
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.610
the story according to Zeno's paradoxes
is that achilles never catches the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
is that achilles never catches the
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.279
is that achilles never catches the
tortoise well of course

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289
tortoise well of course
 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.599
tortoise well of course
achilles never catches the tortoise at

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
achilles never catches the tortoise at
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.819
achilles never catches the tortoise at
any of these times but if you just wait

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
any of these times but if you just wait
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.290
any of these times but if you just wait
a little longer Achilles will have

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
a little longer Achilles will have
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.270
a little longer Achilles will have
caught the tortoise the total length

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
caught the tortoise the total length
 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.609
caught the tortoise the total length
that Achilles gains on the tortoise is 2

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
that Achilles gains on the tortoise is 2
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.950
that Achilles gains on the tortoise is 2
and that's why this is true now let's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
and that's why this is true now let's
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.249
and that's why this is true now let's
look at 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/3 plus 1/4

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
look at 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/3 plus 1/4
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.780
look at 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/3 plus 1/4
plus 1/5 plus 1/6 plus 1/7 plus 1/8 and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
plus 1/5 plus 1/6 plus 1/7 plus 1/8 and
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.999
plus 1/5 plus 1/6 plus 1/7 plus 1/8 and
so on and this never ends how big is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
so on and this never ends how big is
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.940
so on and this never ends how big is
that what is that what I mean is if I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
that what is that what I mean is if I
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.690
that what is that what I mean is if I
stop after many many many terms so I can

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
stop after many many many terms so I can
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.090
stop after many many many terms so I can
so I'm adding some huge finite list of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
so I'm adding some huge finite list of
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.179
so I'm adding some huge finite list of
numbers how big is that and what happens

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
numbers how big is that and what happens
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.649
numbers how big is that and what happens
when I add more and more and more of

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
when I add more and more and more of
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.810
when I add more and more and more of
them and the answer is this is infinity

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
them and the answer is this is infinity
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.960
them and the answer is this is infinity
why well let me group the terms here's

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
why well let me group the terms here's
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.230
why well let me group the terms here's
the first one here are the next two here

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
the first one here are the next two here
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.960
the first one here are the next two here
are the next for the next eight would

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
are the next for the next eight would
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.690
are the next for the next eight would
end with 1 over 15 and this goes on

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
end with 1 over 15 and this goes on
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.420
end with 1 over 15 and this goes on
forever I don't want to mark up my desk

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430
 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.450
well so what exactly does this mean you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
well so what exactly does this mean you
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.749
well so what exactly does this mean you
give me any number at all 50 trillion

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759
give me any number at all 50 trillion
 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.590
give me any number at all 50 trillion
and I can stop this series and say ok I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
and I can stop this series and say ok I
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.540
and I can stop this series and say ok I
will only go this far I'm adding only a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
will only go this far I'm adding only a
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.580
will only go this far I'm adding only a
finite number of numbers together but

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
finite number of numbers together but
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.230
finite number of numbers together but
that sum will be more than

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240
that sum will be more than
 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.870
that sum will be more than
D trillion that's true not only for 50

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880
D trillion that's true not only for 50
 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.060
D trillion that's true not only for 50
trillion but for any number you name no

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070
trillion but for any number you name no
 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.340
trillion but for any number you name no
matter how big and that's what it means

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350
matter how big and that's what it means
 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.650
matter how big and that's what it means
that the sum of the series is infinity

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
that the sum of the series is infinity
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.820
that the sum of the series is infinity
so it's blowing up it's like exactly

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830
so it's blowing up it's like exactly
 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.710
so it's blowing up it's like exactly
exactly we say that the series diverges

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720
exactly we say that the series diverges
 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.680
exactly we say that the series diverges
so let's look at the first term well

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690
so let's look at the first term well
 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.280
so let's look at the first term well
it's 1 thank you how about these next

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290
it's 1 thank you how about these next
 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.620
it's 1 thank you how about these next
two terms well you know what this one is

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630
two terms well you know what this one is
 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.280
two terms well you know what this one is
bigger than 1/2 each one of these terms

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290
bigger than 1/2 each one of these terms
 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.980
bigger than 1/2 each one of these terms
is bigger than 1/4 1/2 is bigger than

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990
is bigger than 1/4 1/2 is bigger than
 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.140
is bigger than 1/4 1/2 is bigger than
1/4 1/3 is bigger than 1/4 and there are

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
1/4 1/3 is bigger than 1/4 and there are
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.810
1/4 1/3 is bigger than 1/4 and there are
two terms so this is bigger than 2/4

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820
two terms so this is bigger than 2/4
 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.630
two terms so this is bigger than 2/4
which is again 1/2 how about these four

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640
which is again 1/2 how about these four
 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.810
which is again 1/2 how about these four
terms they're all bigger than 1/8 and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820
terms they're all bigger than 1/8 and
 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.360
terms they're all bigger than 1/8 and
there are 4 of them so if I add these

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370
there are 4 of them so if I add these
 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.200
there are 4 of them so if I add these
guys it's bigger than 4 eighths which is

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210
guys it's bigger than 4 eighths which is
 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.380
guys it's bigger than 4 eighths which is
1/2 if I look at the next eight terms

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390
1/2 if I look at the next eight terms
 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.890
1/2 if I look at the next eight terms
they're all bigger than 1/16 and they're

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900
they're all bigger than 1/16 and they're
 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.790
they're all bigger than 1/16 and they're
eight of them so the sum is bigger than

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800
eight of them so the sum is bigger than
 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.690
eight of them so the sum is bigger than
8/16 which is 1/2 if I stop far enough

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700
8/16 which is 1/2 if I stop far enough
 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.750
8/16 which is 1/2 if I stop far enough
this sum will be more than 1/2 plus 1/2

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760
this sum will be more than 1/2 plus 1/2
 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.850
this sum will be more than 1/2 plus 1/2
plus 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2 and I can go

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860
plus 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2 and I can go
 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.420
plus 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2 and I can go
on as many times as I like accumulating

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430
on as many times as I like accumulating
 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.300
on as many times as I like accumulating
what have until I get to more than 50

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310
what have until I get to more than 50
 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.870
what have until I get to more than 50
trillion so sooner or later the sum of

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880
trillion so sooner or later the sum of
 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.910
trillion so sooner or later the sum of
these numbers will be more than 50

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
these numbers will be more than 50
 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.240
these numbers will be more than 50
trillion the catch is that I have to go

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250
trillion the catch is that I have to go
 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.970
trillion the catch is that I have to go
enormous ly far out in order to do it

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980
enormous ly far out in order to do it
 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.490
enormous ly far out in order to do it
but let's not worry about that now okay

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500
but let's not worry about that now okay
 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.440
but let's not worry about that now okay
never mind just how enormous that's

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450
never mind just how enormous that's
 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.710
never mind just how enormous that's
let's leave it there for this sum which

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720
let's leave it there for this sum which
 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.210
let's leave it there for this sum which
has a name it's called the harmonic

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220
has a name it's called the harmonic
 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.600
has a name it's called the harmonic
series I'd like to explain how to use

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610
series I'd like to explain how to use
 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.300
series I'd like to explain how to use
the harmonic series to stack dominoes

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310
the harmonic series to stack dominoes
 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.730
the harmonic series to stack dominoes
well actually I don't have dominoes in

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740
well actually I don't have dominoes in
 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.920
well actually I don't have dominoes in
my office but I have lots of issues of

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930
my office but I have lots of issues of
 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.130
my office but I have lots of issues of
the annals of mathematics oh yes I have

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140
the annals of mathematics oh yes I have
 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.070
the annals of mathematics oh yes I have
lots and lots and lots so we're going to

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080
lots and lots and lots so we're going to
 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.530
lots and lots and lots so we're going to
use copies of the annals of mathematics

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540
use copies of the annals of mathematics
 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.630
use copies of the annals of mathematics
as dominoes let's just take two of them

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640
as dominoes let's just take two of them
 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.230
as dominoes let's just take two of them
first if I move this one here it's going

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240
first if I move this one here it's going
 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.530
first if I move this one here it's going
to collapse but if I move it so that its

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540
to collapse but if I move it so that its
 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.310
to collapse but if I move it so that its
center of gravity is let's see if that

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320
center of gravity is let's see if that
 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.080
center of gravity is let's see if that
works I'm being a little conservative

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090
works I'm being a little conservative
 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.210
works I'm being a little conservative
the center of gravity of this guy

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220
the center of gravity of this guy
 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.850
the center of gravity of this guy
is sitting over that guy and so it does

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860
is sitting over that guy and so it does
 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.980
is sitting over that guy and so it does
not collapse now let's take these two

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990
not collapse now let's take these two
 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.590
not collapse now let's take these two
and put them very carefully on top of

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600
and put them very carefully on top of
 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.330
and put them very carefully on top of
the third one taking care that the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340
the third one taking care that the
 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.220
the third one taking care that the
center of gravity of this whole guy is

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230
center of gravity of this whole guy is
 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.320
center of gravity of this whole guy is

above this issue of the annals of
mathematics and therefore looks

precarious ok there it does not collapse

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960
precarious ok there it does not collapse
 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.140
precarious ok there it does not collapse
and now perhaps I could put these three

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150
and now perhaps I could put these three
 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.150
and now perhaps I could put these three
on top of a fourth and if I succeed in

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160
on top of a fourth and if I succeed in
 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.670
on top of a fourth and if I succeed in
doing that I will not tempt fate I will

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680
doing that I will not tempt fate I will
 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.290
doing that I will not tempt fate I will
just declare that that we have succeeded

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300
just declare that that we have succeeded
 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.220
just declare that that we have succeeded
whoop so let's see how are we doing it

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230
whoop so let's see how are we doing it
 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.260

one another are in the proportions 1/2
1/2 to 1/3 to 1/4 to 1/5 to 1/6 and so

the fact that the harmonic series
diverges tells you that you can

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030
diverges tells you that you can
 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.330
diverges tells you that you can
eventually make this pile come out as

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340
eventually make this pile come out as
 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.810
eventually make this pile come out as
far as you like because 1 plus 1/2 plus

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820
far as you like because 1 plus 1/2 plus
 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.090
far as you like because 1 plus 1/2 plus
1/3 plus 1/4 plus and so on if

1/3 plus 1/4 plus and so on if
 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.130
1/3 plus 1/4 plus and so on if
you stop way way far out after a

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140
you stop way way far out after a
 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.200
you stop way way far out after a
gazillion for a large enough value of a

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210
gazillion for a large enough value of a
 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.480
gazillion for a large enough value of a
gazillion will be more than 50 billion

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490
gazillion will be more than 50 billion
 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.790
gazillion will be more than 50 billion
and therefore this distance out there

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800
and therefore this distance out there
 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.800
and therefore this distance out there
will be more than 50 billion times the

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810
will be more than 50 billion times the
 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.660

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:52.710
height of the annals of mathematics all
right let's put the annals of

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720
right let's put the annals of
 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.010
right let's put the annals of
mathematics aside now let's do the same

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020
mathematics aside now let's do the same
 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.590
mathematics aside now let's do the same
thing to the series 1 plus 1/2 squared

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.600
thing to the series 1 plus 1/2 squared
 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.850
thing to the series 1 plus 1/2 squared
plus 1/3 squared plus 1/4 squared plus

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860
plus 1/3 squared plus 1/4 squared plus
 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.750
plus 1/3 squared plus 1/4 squared plus
let me keep going squared ok blah blah

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:12.760
let me keep going squared ok blah blah
 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.060
let me keep going squared ok blah blah
now let's try to do the same thing we're

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.070
now let's try to do the same thing we're
 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.860
now let's try to do the same thing we're
gonna take the first term all right so

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870
gonna take the first term all right so
 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.470
gonna take the first term all right so
that's 1 thank you let's look at the

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480
that's 1 thank you let's look at the
 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.600
that's 1 thank you let's look at the
next two terms now this is 1 over 1/2

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610
next two terms now this is 1 over 1/2
 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.020
next two terms now this is 1 over 1/2
squared this is smaller than 1 over 1/2

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.030
squared this is smaller than 1 over 1/2
 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.420
squared this is smaller than 1 over 1/2
squared so we've got two terms and

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:30.430
squared so we've got two terms and
 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.360
squared so we've got two terms and
they're each smaller than 1/2 times 1/2

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.370
they're each smaller than 1/2 times 1/2
 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.500
they're each smaller than 1/2 times 1/2
so that's smaller than 2 times 1/2 times

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:37.510
so that's smaller than 2 times 1/2 times
 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:42.000
so that's smaller than 2 times 1/2 times
1/2 that's smaller than 1/2 let's look

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.010
1/2 that's smaller than 1/2 let's look
 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.980
1/2 that's smaller than 1/2 let's look
at the next four terms here they are

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:43.990
at the next four terms here they are
 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.280
at the next four terms here they are
they're all 1 over 4 squared or smaller

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.290
they're all 1 over 4 squared or smaller
 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.100
they're all 1 over 4 squared or smaller
so they are smaller than 1/4 squared

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.110
so they are smaller than 1/4 squared
 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.030
so they are smaller than 1/4 squared
plus 1/4 squared plus 1/4 squared plus

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.040
plus 1/4 squared plus 1/4 squared plus
 

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.080
plus 1/4 squared plus 1/4 squared plus
1/4 squared

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.090
1/4 squared
 

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.630
1/4 squared
there are 4 terms there and so these

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:57.640
there are 4 terms there and so these
 

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.650
there are 4 terms there and so these
guys together are no bigger than 4 times

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.660
guys together are no bigger than 4 times
 

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.430
guys together are no bigger than 4 times
1/4 squared that's 4 times 1/4 times 1/4

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440
1/4 squared that's 4 times 1/4 times 1/4
 

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.370
1/4 squared that's 4 times 1/4 times 1/4
and that's 1/4 so this whole thing is

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:08.380
and that's 1/4 so this whole thing is
 

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.340
and that's 1/4 so this whole thing is
less than 1/4 if I looked at the next

sum of all of these terms and that was a
 

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.019
