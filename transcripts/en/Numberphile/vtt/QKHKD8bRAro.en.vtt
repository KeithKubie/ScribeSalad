00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm interested in the twin prime conjecture

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.210
so this is

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.950
Asking about consecutive prime numbers p 1 as the first prime which be equal to [2] and there'll be the second time

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.170
P 2 which would be equal to 3

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.360
And you can look at the gaps between the primes, so the gap between three and two...

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.600
is one, this is the only time you can possibly have two prime numbers which differ by exactly one, so the next smallest possible gap

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.900
Would be a gap of size, [two]

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.520
It's only not the case that all gaps become size 2

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.140
But the question is how many of these gaps of size two? So for example,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.620
101 and 103 are two rather large prime numbers which differ by exactly 2. And then the twin prime conjecture

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.340
says that this having two primes which differ by exactly 2 happens infinitely often

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.340
If the twin prime conjecture is false,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.740
At some point you go along the number line, and then all prime gaps would always be bigger than two

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.249
But we don't believe that's the case. We believe that it should be the case the twin prime conjecture is correct

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.350
So no matter how far you go along

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.529
There's always going to be some bigger primes and in fact infinitely many bigger primes that differ by

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.559
Just exactly two so you can test this on a computer

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.800
And we found pairs of primes that differ by exactly [2] with over

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.939
300,000 decimal digits and in fact they're surprisingly common that it's certainly not all the time

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.750
but if you look at the first

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.009
how far you have to go after a million to find a pair of twin primes

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.069
It's not very far. If you look after a billion, It's not very far if you look after a thousand billion

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.460
It's actually not very far until you start finding twin pines

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.930
Most primes aren't going to have the one after it been just two apart

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.409
But we still believe that you should be relatively plentiful and so far if you check on a computer this seems to be true

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.480
but whether it's really true all the way as far as you go is something that you can't check on the computer and

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.880
That's where you need to try and prove the real mathematical result

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.719
So we don't actually know how old the twin prime conjecture is

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.479
that some people have claimed that it should go all the way back to euclid and it's certainly the kind of question that the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.540
Ancient Greeks could easily have thought about the most recent time where we've seen someone really write down the conjecture

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.220
officially was just over 100 years ago by de Polignac

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.328
But he actually conducted a rather stronger more general form of the twin prime conjecture that's a bit more complicated

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.769
It's not just gaps of size 2 but also gaps of size 4 and gaps of size six

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.040
And so there's a suspicion that the twin prime conjecture itself is rather older than that

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.040
But we know it's at least a hundred years old possibly thousands of years old. If we're still finding these things

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.250
Way way down the number line, and we know they're an infinite number of primes

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.230
This is a known thing... if they did stop

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.719
What would stop them occurring like what is... what beast out there could stop twin primes occurring?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.060
It doesn't seem as any roadblocks of them happening forever.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.240
This is one of the interesting and frustrating things about prime numbers,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.740
that often it's clear what the right answer should be if you give me a simple problem

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.980
Like the twin prime conjecture, you can think about it heuristically a bit, you can check it on the computer

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.720
And you can quite quickly convince yourself that this should clearly be the right answer

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.320
And you can do it in a fairly confident way so lots of problems about prime numbers

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.149
we believe we know what the correct answer should be it's just that we don't know how to prove it and

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.609
The game is always trying to rule out there being some very bizarre conspiracy amongst prime numbers

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.228
That would mean that they would behave in a rather different way to how we believe that they should behave

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.089
So you're completely right that if the twin prime conjecture was false there'll be some

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.409
strange switch that happens at some strange point far down the number line

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.649
There's an absolutely huge breakthrough by Yitang Zhang just relatively recently in 2013

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.500
He showed that although he couldn't prove the twin prime conjecture (that two is a gap infinitely often)

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.329
And he similarly couldn't conclude that four is a gap infinitely often, he showed that either two or four or six or eight or some number

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.819
Less than 70 million has to be a gap infinitely often. So the gap wasn't 70 million

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.160
It was just somewhere between two and 17 million, but he didn't know what it was?

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.720
Right, he couldn't say which one of these came as a gap,

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:16.169
but he was able to show that at least one of these occurs as a gap infinitely after and 70 million might sound like a

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.029
Huge number to most people it's certainly a lot bigger than two for example

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.899
But before that we had no idea of, how we could possibly prove anything like this

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.490
That he showed that no matter how far you go down the number line

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.980
There's always these primes that get clumped bizarrely close together

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.040
Because when you start looking at really really really big prime numbers, prime numbers become quite rare

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.429
so if you're looking at numbers with billions and billions of decimal digits for example

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.760
Then suddenly the average gap will be well over a billion and if you look at even bigger ones you get even bigger gaps

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.580
So typically prime numbers will have these very big gaps

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.400
And he showed that no matter how far you go down the number line you will get these pairs that come really close together

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.740
At least compared to how they typically look I guess.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.540
Earlier on around 2005,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.340
there was this earlier work of Goldston Pintz and Yildirim, who came up with a new method for thinking about the twin prime conjecture

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.760
and problems closely related to it. People worked really hard to try and push

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.890
Goldston Pintz and Yildirim's ideas a little bit further

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.200
but there seemed to be this big obstacle that we kept on not being able to make progress on and

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.289
It was this problem which Yitang Zhang managed to break through, came as a complete shock to everyone

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.020
I think precisely because people had worked so hard on this

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.200
particular approach and all the experts had been completely stumped on this. so 70 million is a

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:48.189
Slightly arbitrary number that just comes out of the method and in fact his method really just showed some number

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.170
And he didn't try and optimize the 70 million too much. So if you take exactly his argument

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.219
But you're ever so slightly more careful with the numerical calculations

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.579
You can bring 70 million down to 30 million

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:07.299
And then if you tweak his arguments and rearrange things ever so slightly it's still fundamentally the same argument as what he had

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.150
But you can bring 30 million down to 20 million and so as soon as Yitang Zhang's result came out

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.160
there was this huge excitement at the result in trying to understand the result, but they also became a

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.560
Small online competition amongst

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.740
Mathematicians as to

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.860
How low can you make the gap that we knew 70 million was an upper bound, this is the first time we had a

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.580
Finite bound, but we also knew that by tweaking the arguments

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.489
You should be able to bring 70 million down to some smaller number

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.100
How low could you go just using what he had put out there and putting in the extra work?

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.799
So there was a polymath project

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:47.780
Which was a big online collaborative project that set up precisely to try and optimize the arguments in Zhang's work,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.580
Now, they came up actually with quite a lot of neat ideas to make Jang's argument as efficient as possible

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.920
They were able to bring Zhang's bound of 70 million down to I think

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.040
4680.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.460
so I'd actually been thinking about a

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.160
Completely separate approach to this bound of gaps problem before Zhang's work came out

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.230
so I was super excited that Zhang's work came out 'Cause it's fascinating to me because I was

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.840
still a phd student at the time. Excited or disappointed? Like did you feel like "Oh no I've been beaten" or were you really excited?

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:26.880
So I never had any belief that my ideas would lead to bound of gaps between primes in any way,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.450
So I was just excited. I think you always super excited when you

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.239
Suddenly one of these big results comes out and you know that collectively we understand something new about prime numbers

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.709
So I was just desperate to get into the details of Zhang's work. There's always this

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.939
Intense frustrating game that you play when you do mathematics that you sort of feel that you have an idea

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.940
but you don't quite know

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:54.359
Exactly how it fits in and it takes a long time of fumbling around in the darkness before you really get intuition for how

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.739
What you're thinking about works... It's a huge motivation to me that this is part of the fun

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.340
It's the chase of the problem and trying to understand what's going on

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.519
So I was still completely addicted to this thing that I've been working on

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:10.589
And I viewed it as a side benefit that it might actually be able to help this

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:18.479
big collaborative project if I could sort my ideas out, but then the huge surprise to me was that actually once I managed to

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.240
Grasp a hold of this and look at things in from the right perspective

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.880
A variation on the ideas that I was thinking about

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.980
Were able to prove bound of gaps in a completely different way to Zhang's work.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.140
This gave a completely new way of proving bound of gaps between times

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:39.480
so both my work and Zhang's work is very much based on the earlier work of Goldston Pintz and Yildirim

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.500
and Goldston Pintz and Yildirim used an argument that's fundamentally using a technique known as Sieve methods

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.849
They proved a great result about primes which come close together

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:55.089
And they said if we could prove this other technical result that isn't to do with Sieve methods

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:01.420
Then we'd be able to bound of gaps between primes, and so what Zhang managed to do is

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.620
Essentially proved something like what they wanted to prove and therefore use their argument to get bound of gaps between primes.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.680
Whereas

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:17.700
my approach was based on their original ideas rethinking some of the way their original argument worked which meant that you didn't need such a

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.080
Strong technical input and so I could use weaker results that be known for the past 50 years or so instead

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:30.729
On the one hand I tend to sort of feel my way to a proof and know it's right before I

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:36.549
Actually write down all the details so I did have this feeling that yes, this has the feeling of being right

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.160
But at the same time I remember

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.120
Being pretty scared when I first came up with the ideas

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:46.389
Because you know I was going to be very much putting myself out there

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:51.969
And it's very important for mathematicians to really be strict with themselves to check that they've got all the details right

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.649
but you often have this internal feeling about these things and it felt like it to me.

00:09:57.769 --> 00:10:01.149
I was really surprised, so yeah there was suddenly lots and lots of interest

00:10:01.149 --> 00:10:06.159
I was a postdoc at the time in Montréal when this came out and suddenly I was getting invitations to fly all over

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.409
to give talks in different places in the US, so it was really exciting for me being able to

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:17.979
Meet all these famous mathematicians, give talks of my work suddenly everyone is very excited. I hadn't really expected this at all

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.279
I thought you know I was pleased that I'd proven a nice result

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:25.029
But I was more pleased because I'd finally managed to get an understanding of these things and

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.989
I had the satisfaction of the proof. I hadn't really expected there to be any

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.000
Media interest or all these people asking me to give talks and things.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.200
So some people have called it the Maynard and Tao method

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.760
So Terry Tao was also thinking about similar ideas

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.819
He was very actively involved in leading this polymath project

00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:46.869
And so he came up with essentially the same method at the same time

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.269
It was another bizarre coincidence that there were

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.610
There was this one proof by Yitang Zhang that came out and then both terry and I came up with

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:02.920
This new alternative method. So some people been calling it the Maynard Tao method. So the current state of the art, trying to optimize

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.760
All these techniques including with these new method and these new ideas is

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:15.149
Is that they're infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by no more than two hundred and Forty-six. We expect that every even number

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:20.879
between 2 and 246 occurs, it's no different, in particular we expect two

00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:25.859
But we know there's at least one between 2 and 246

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.800
Can your method get us to two?

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.620
Unfortunately there's a

00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:36.898
Fundamental barrier to our method get my sequel to to you so in some later work

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:43.919
we said that if you [a] really optimistic about how we could maybe get all the technical stages of the argument to fit together and

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:51.239
If you able to prove these other very strong results that were sort of strong versions of what yu tang jang managed to prove then

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:57.060
Maybe you can just about push our methods to get gaps of size at most six infinitely often

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.279
But we also showed that there's not going to be any small variation on

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.019
These sorts of ideas that can really get down to two so you can get close to you

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:08.170
But not quite all the way

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:13.170
there's a new idea that's needed to get all the way to the twin type of injection for sure the reason for it is that

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.819
We have these mathematical devices that are trying to detect time numbers

00:12:17.819 --> 00:12:22.169
But they don't work perfectly there are only approximately detected prime numbers

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.889
So maybe they get it like one in ten of the time or one in

00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:30.359
six of the time or something like that, and if you're getting like one in ten at the time

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:35.879
Then maybe if you're looking for primes that come close together you miss a whole load of being between primes

00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:37.949
But you still find to that a pretty close together

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.709
So you may be missed out 10 of them

00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:45.599
But on the tenth one you find one and there may be 10 times further apart in you love hopes

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.909
But they're still pretty close to get there no variation on these techniques even if you're really optimistic

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.949
Can ever improve your way of finding primes to one into?

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:03.420
Without using some extra automatic information and really a big new idea the fact that your proof has this

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.250
Trait to it that it involves approximation of things that aren't always right

00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:11.189
Doesn't sound like what I mentioned a method proof

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.739
Is that already sounds like it's a bit hand wavy

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:19.859
And wishy-washy I happen to this beat one of these classic rigorous proof if it's like sometimes a bit wrong

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.550
like so this is actually a

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:29.009
common feature of lots of Modern mathematics that you'll maybe take inspiration from

00:13:29.529 --> 00:13:34.768
Probability or engineering and you still have to write down the rivers mathematical proof

00:13:35.019 --> 00:13:38.459
But you maybe think about the whole approach in a heuristic way

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:45.480
in a much less rigorous sense and so you might [think] about lots of randomness in your problem, and

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
You might be deliberately trying to

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.360
model prime numbers as random objects and

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.909
Think about them is not always being definitive and things being a bit approximate here and there

00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:01.139
And when you write [down] your argument you have to write it down in a very rigorous way

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.789
But all the intuitive ideas for why you come up with that out one in the first place?

00:14:06.339 --> 00:14:09.749
often taken inspiration from [Private] [sector] areas of

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:16.499
mathematics and science are you trying to find that breakthrough that will take us to tell you or do you feel like you've made your

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:23.279
Contribution, and that's gonna some come from another part of map or are you in the hand still and I would certainly still love to

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160
Prove the Twin prime conjecture or something like that

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:33.750
And I do think about it on Friday afternoons and things that somehow. There's a big new idea

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.000
That's needed and at the moment collectively

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.149
I think we don't really have a

00:14:37.149 --> 00:14:40.139
Clue for how to go about that someone needs to come up with an idea

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:45.270
and it's good to have these problems in the back of your mind because sometimes your subconscious just comes up with a

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.620
Good idea out of nowhere. So I like to think about it on and off

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.789
But I'm not working full time on the twin prime conjecture now just because at the moment

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.540
I don't have a plausible approach to how to get over their current bias

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:05.040
I still get my main motivation from the problems themselves, and I would certainly claim I

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.890
Haven't I [don't] feel terribly affected by the outside interest the reason that I want to

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.549
Understand things about prime numbers is because I'm fascinated by prime numbers

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:20.159
And I really want [to] get into the grips of the mathematical dirty details and do this although

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.010
[I] know that there's lots of good reasons for being interested in time

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.739
There's more generally for applications in the world Real world

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:33.419
And they certainly interest that it can be picked up on the popular press and things like that those aren't my personal motivation somehow

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.940
There's an inherent beauty about prime numbers

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.570
That's always what really motivates me to try and understand the mysteries of these seemingly very simple

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.409
But actually very complicated objects, but you don't get pressures

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:50.160
it's not like a boss will come up and say you know [James] to be really good for us if the

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.630
Number two came from here. I certainly not had anyone come

00:15:55.630 --> 00:16:02.849
Try and get the enforces to make me bring the gap down so I've not felt any pressure myself. I can't speak for others

00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:08.688
Which one would you most like to see solved which one would excite me the most I?

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:16.879
Think the Riemann hypothesis would be the first choice for most number theorists in terms of if you want a problem on prime numbers

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:22.610
The Riemann hypothesis just automatically proves about a million other theorem straight away, just off the bat

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:27.439
That's all these firms that say if we're even hypothesis to than this and so you

00:16:27.689 --> 00:16:34.789
automatically prove a million other theorems just with this and we have this huge new understanding that even more than

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.910
The Riemann hypothesis as a result the proof and the ideas and the proof that [prove] [the] reason hypothesis

00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:47.299
Inherently must get such a good understanding of prime numbers that will have this whole new way of looking about prime numbers

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.209
I would guess if someone was able to prove the [Riemann] hypothesis

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:53.029
And this whole new technique that would open up all kinds of new possibilities

00:16:53.699 --> 00:17:00.349
So yeah, if I had to choose one, it'd be the Riemann hypothesis does the Riemann hypothesis ever get any of your brain done?

00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:02.579
I

00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:04.579
like to sometimes think about

00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:07.579
Some questions connected to the Riemann hypothesis

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:15.109
but the Riemann hypothesis itself I feel I have no good intuitive way of even starting to how to

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.860
attack that kind of problem

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:21.589
But there's lots of smaller problems connected the Riemann hypothesis that are very important for Par numbers

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:27.438
And those are things that I'm very interested in certainly thinks about quite a lot yeah likely to find your n

00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:33.259
You know your true love because the prime numbers are so far apart at that large end of things

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.100
So it's a pretty loveless place

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.529
You know at that end of things so you get a bigger a bigger numbers you might think there's just no way you're going to

00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:41.529
Find your true [love]
