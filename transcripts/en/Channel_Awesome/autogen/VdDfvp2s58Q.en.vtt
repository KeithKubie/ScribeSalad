the only other thing I'll say is that I
 

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.570 align:start position:0%
the only other thing I'll say is that I
think<00:14:19.210><c> probably</c><00:14:20.170><c> if</c><00:14:20.770><c> I</c><00:14:20.890><c> had</c><00:14:20.920><c> to</c><00:14:21.070><c> guess</c><00:14:21.310><c> like</c>

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:21.580 align:start position:0%
think probably if I had to guess like
 

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
think probably if I had to guess like
the<00:14:21.700><c> biggest</c><00:14:22.420><c> sort</c><00:14:23.380><c> of</c><00:14:23.440><c> fault</c><00:14:23.740><c> of</c><00:14:23.920><c> Shyamalan</c>

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:24.490 align:start position:0%
the biggest sort of fault of Shyamalan
 

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
the biggest sort of fault of Shyamalan
is<00:14:24.760><c> that</c><00:14:25.060><c> I</c><00:14:25.090><c> think</c><00:14:25.660><c> I</c><00:14:25.810><c> think</c><00:14:25.840><c> a</c><00:14:26.110><c> lot</c><00:14:26.320><c> of</c>

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:26.350 align:start position:0%
is that I think I think a lot of
 

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
