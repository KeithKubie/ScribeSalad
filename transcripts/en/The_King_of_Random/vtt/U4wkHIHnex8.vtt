00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.957
What's up guys? Today is the last day to get your King of Random T-shirts.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.500
Now if you don't want one, no big deal.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.680
But if you do, now is your last opportunity to drop down, click the link in the description

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.260
and get yours before time runs out

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.950
Hey guys, welcome back. I'm Nate. Thank you for joining me today on the King of Random.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.500
In our last couple videos, we've shown you how to take zinc powder and sulphur

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.800
and make a simple rocket fuel and how to make a small rocket out of a ballpoint pen.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.060
Today we're gonna show you how to build the launch pad

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.360
and the electric igniters that we used to fire off those rockets

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.869
Let's start by building our launch pad. The materials for this are very simple.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.619
I have here a 5 by 1 board, a coat hanger and four screws

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.739
We're also going to be using some wood glue, a staple gun and a drill

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.199
Let's start by cutting a square piece off of our board

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.549
You don't have to use this same size. Anything over about 4 inches by 4 inches will work

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.860
Before I take the measurements to make my square,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.169
I want to be sure that I have a clean straight edge on my board

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.199
Before I call this a 5 by 1 inch board

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.280
But that's actually the size of the plank before it's milled down.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.360
The actual width of this board appears to be about 4 and 7/16

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.120
So we'll measure that size and cut the board out of the square

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.860
Now let's cut off a strip about one inch wide which will then be cut into four pieces as feet for our launch pad

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.180
It doesn't have to be exactly an inch. I ended up cutting mine about 7/8 of an inch wide

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.189
With our four feet cut we're ready to attach them, but before we do that really quickly

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.959
I'm gonna draw a couple lines going across our launch pad base, so we know exactly where the center is

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.589
Now using a small dot of wood glue. Let's attach one foot in each corner of the base

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.720
While the glue on the base is drying, let's prep our coat hanger.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.529
First we want to cut the coat hanger here and here

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.660
The long straight part of the hanger wire is going to be the guiding rod for the rocket

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.280
and we want to bend the bottom part into a curve that will fit nicely inside our base.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.260
You'll want the curved base of the wire to be as perpendicular to the straight part

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.100
of the wire as you can make it. This will help your rockets launch straighter.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.300
Now that the glue has dried. Let's pre-drill a hole into each foot and drive a screw into them

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.220
To be sure our base can sit flush with the ground, I'm going to countersink each of the holes a little bit

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.339
Now let's drill a hole for the hanger wire which will act as a guiding rod for our rockets.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.420
We want to drill bit that is slightly larger than our hanger wire so that it will fit through the hole easily.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.130
I'm using a 1/8 inch drill bit.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.259
I'm going to set the hole about a quarter inch off center so that the rocket can sit in the middle of the launchpad.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.800
Let's quickly sand down the launchpad just to give it a nice finished look.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.499
Just for fun, I'm going to use some of this truck bedliner spray to get a part of our launchpad a cool textured look.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.550
The last step is to fit the wire through the hole and use a staple gun to secure it in place.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.340
With the launchpad built, let's get started on the igniters.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.040
These are a simple single-use electric starter that works great with this type of fuel.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160
You'll need the following supplies.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.300
Some Christmas lights. The small non LED type bulbs,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.520
some speaker wire, wire cutters, tape and a 9-volt battery. Let's start with the light bulb.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.409
First, we need to remove it from the string of lights and it's plastic housing.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.849
Usually you can do this just by pulling on the bulb. If this piece of plastic comes out with your bulb,

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.519
straighten out the copper wires at the back and just pull it off

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.380
We need to expose the filament on the inside. So once we've removed the bulb

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.860
from the string, we need to break off the glass around it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.020
Over a trash can you want to use your wire cutters to break the bulb.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.120
The first step is to break off the small glass ball at the tip of the light bulb

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.220
Start at the top and very carefully break the bulb off using the wire cutters

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.010
It's easy to cut through the glass and into the wire

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.000
You need to make sure you don't damage any of the wires inside.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.320
If you do accidentally break the tiny filament, fill the bulb away and get a new one.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.620
In newer lights there will be a very thin wire wrapped around the bottom of the two copper posts.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.020
This helps keep your Christmas lights from going out in case the bulb dies.  We need to carefully remove that wire.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.700
Our bulb is ready. Now let's attach a length of wire to the back of it.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.700
Cut off a length of speaker wire about a foot long.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.980
Put the ends of the wires and strip three quarters of an inch from all four ends.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.709
Carefully wrap wire around each of the two copper leads running into the light bulb.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.260
Use a small piece of tape to wrap around one connection and then the other.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.340
This will prevent the two wires from touching each other and interfering with the intended path of the electricity.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.309
At this point our electric igniter is actually ready to use.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.790
But because we don't want to be standing quite so close to the rocket when it goes off,

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.579
we can attach a longer length of speaker wire to the back

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.260
To activate your igniter, touch the other ends of your longer wire to the

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.809
positive and negative terminals of a fresh 9-volt battery.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.360
Now that our launch pad and igniters are complete, let's grab some rockets and fire them off.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.020
In our test launches yesterday, a couple of the rockets turned sideways shortly after ignition.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.960
When watching the video in slow motion,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.880
I noticed that there is a small jet of flame coming out the side of the pen.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.489
These pens usually have a very small hole in them which lets the pressure equalized and the ink flow better.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.340
But that's not good for rocketry. Some of the fuel was burning sideways out of the pen and

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.280
pushing it as it launched. That pressure was enough to tear the guiding straw

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.560
off of the rocket and the whole rocket would go sideways.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.000
To try and fix this problem, I've plugged up the hole with a small dot of super glue

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.220
and reinforced the connection of the straw to the rocket.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.300
To start let's fill our pen rocket with fuel.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.890
A small creased piece of paper is an easy way to pour fuel into the narrow opening in the rocket

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:35.000
I like to hold the rocket over the container that holds the fuel. So that if I spill, It's not lost.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.140
You want to fill the body of the pen rocket with fuel until there's about half an inch empty at the top

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.019
It's important that you don't pack this fuel down too much. The denser it is, the slower it burns.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.180
We want a very quick burn so we try to leave it nice and unpacked inside the pen.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.020
Once your rocket is full of fuel, gently press the igniter down into the fuel.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.740
Be careful with this. Because if you're too rough,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.120
you can tear the filament of the light bulb and it won't ignite.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.600
Next, we want to take a small piece of paper towel or toilet paper and use it to fill in the gap between the wire

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.249
and the body of the rocket. This will keep your fuel from spilling out around the sides of the igniter.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.410
With the pen rocket back right side up, gently tap it so that the powder fuel settles around the igniter.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.419
Run the hanger wire through the guiding straw on the rocket and lower it down until it rests on the launch pad.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.939
Let's twist on our longer piece of wire.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.010
We've filled our rocket with fuel, we have attached our igniter,

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.800
we've attached our extension wire to our igniter, and we're ready to go with the rocket on the launch pad.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.300
Three, two, one...

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.760
Our battery ignition system worked great. But because it's cooler,

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.100
I'm going to use our N64 control launcher that we've built in a previous video.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.900
Three, two, one...

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.400
HA!! RIGHT HERE!

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:04.820
Hahaha. Our rocket only traveled like eight feet away from it's launch site that is straight up and down.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:13.380
That's amazing. One, two, three, four, five. Five steps away. That's how straight down it came this time.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.340
Whew! it's all hillarious. You're like hmm. I wonder where it landed. Oh well.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.660
I guess I'll never find it. 'Thump' and then it lands. These things get pretty good height.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.649
Like I was sure it already landed somewhere, and I was like it's lost forever. Nope.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.520
Boom...

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:36.010
Beautiful. It smells like sulfur, just a little bit almost no smell to it really

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:42.140
But sulfur is the main smell. All right winds died down.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.940
Three, Two, One...

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.360
That exploded.. into pieces.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.520
All right that was supposed to be a rocket

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.620
and ... instead

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.810
It shattered everything. I saw pieces flying everywhere.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.040
This is probably the largest piece and it's the easiest to find because it's got a bright orange tip.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.540
Uh. Haven't had that happen before. I've done at least 10 of these so far

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.240
and I've talked to someone who's done like dozens of them.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.620
Uh, nope, haven't had one explode before. This one did.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.800
Interesting.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.320
Three, Two, One...

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.620
Three, Two, One...

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.460
There you have it, that's how you can build a custom rocket launch pad and electric igniter.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.919
This launch pad and igniter work perfectly with our pen rockets and our zinc-sulfur fuel mixture.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.820
This is a super easy and basic way to get into beginning rocketry.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.680
You could build the pen, the base, the igniter and mix up the fuel all in one day.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.520
It's been a fun few projects and I hope that you have a chance to build these and try them out yourselves.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.360
Be sure to check your local laws about where you are and are not allowed to launch rockets.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.020
Thanks for joining us for this project today and we look forward to the next one. Talk to you then.

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:57.509
It looks so good until you launch one rocket on it.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.969
Our rocket launch pad used to look so pretty with its black textured base and the wood border going around it

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.120
It still it's really cool because it's got authentic blast patterns on it.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.549
But it's not quite as clean as it was before. I think the rocket may have melted through some of that paint too.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.549
Beautiful. Ah!! So that's a great failure. You're gonna have a failure it better be catastrophic.

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:23.939
