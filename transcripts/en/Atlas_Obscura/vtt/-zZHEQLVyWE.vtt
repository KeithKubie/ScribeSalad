00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.480
- Hi, I'm Eric Grundhauser,
community editor

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.850
at Atlas Obscura.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.683
And I'm here to show you, the
greatest statue in Budapest.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.137
Discovering little known public statues

00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:23.920
is one of the great
unsung wonders of travel.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.970
And the greatest public
statue in the world,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.883
for my money, is the
bronze Columbo in Budapest.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.870
Budapest is a city of statues.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.930
You have the iconic Little
Princess sitting by the Danube,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.570
the Policeman Statue that
is said to grant good luck

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.040
with a belly rub like some
kind of authoritarian Buddha.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.173
Or the anonymous notary of King
Bela, also know as Master P.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.100
Wondering the city
streets it can seem like

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.020
there's a new statue or monument
popping up every few feet.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.310
Now leaving aside discussion
of the troublesome politics

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.920
of modern day Hungary,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.250
after over a century of political turmoil,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.980
having been variously occupied

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.520
and influenced by other cultures

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.910
from the Austrians to the Soviets,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.020
preserving native Hungarian culture

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.810
is an important part of
the city's character.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.207
Figures both major and minor
have been captured in bronze

00:01:12.207 --> 00:01:14.480
in locations across the city,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.020
immortalizing literary figures,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.593
sports stars and Ronald Reagan.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.990
All in celebration of their
various Hungarian connections.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.460
In the spirit of this
wide reaching appreciation

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.156
for all things the Magyar
Republic can call it's own,

00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:30.063
the Columbo Statue was born.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.350
For those who aren't
familiar with Columbo,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440
well shame on you.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.220
Lieutenant Columbo was the main character

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.980
in a series of TV movies and later,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.370
a series that aired between 1971 and 2003.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.600
Played by American actor, Peter Falk,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.660
Columbo was a cigar chomping,
salt-of-the-earth detective

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.360
who looked like he'd never
laid hands on an iron.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.793
To say he was rumpled
would be very correct.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.750
An archetypical wise-ass gumshoe,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.140
Columbo was a vintage television treasure,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.910
without which we never
would've had shows like Castle,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.490
Bones, House and probably a bunch of other

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.510
one word detective shows.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.820
The actor Falk, who died in 2011,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.290
was rumored to have been
related to 19th century

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.219
Hungarian writer and
political figure, Miksa Falk.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.760
While Peter Falk did have some
concrete Hungarian heritage,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.580
his familial connection to Miksa Falk

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.640
seems to have been mostly coincidence.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.620
Despite this connection never
having been exactly proven,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.590
the possibility was enough.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.850
The statue of Peter
Falk's Columbo was erected

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.169
on the Budapest street named
after Miksa Falk as part of

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.493
general civic improvements
in the area in 2014.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.440
They even added Columbo's
pet dog, whose name was Dog,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.453
because who doesn't love a dog?

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.100
Budapest's Columbo Statue might
not be the most sober bronze

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.200
monument in the city or the
most secret or the most popular,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.920
but it stands out as a singular
example of the fascinating

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.859
and wonderful oddities our
global culture can inspire.

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.160
Generations of strife and
political upheaval leading to a

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.730
need for cultural appreciation so strong,

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.700
that it birthed a monument
to an increasingly obscure

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.827
television character from
halfway across the world.

00:03:10.827 --> 00:03:13.180
You don't have to be Columbo to know,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.080
that's a monument worth investigating.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.950
Hey thanks again for watching.

one and possibly even better.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.980
Why don't you head down to the comments

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.030
and tell us, what television character

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.453
do you think should be
immortalized in bronze?
