ERIC SCHMIDT: It's a
great pleasure for me

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.039
to welcome back my two very
good friends Bill and Kevin,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.339
who have a book they
want to talk about.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:12.880
I wanted to start
by saying that I've

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.680
known the governor for
more than a decade.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.930
His background, of course,
was a political leader,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.870
secretary of energy,
governor, and a negotiator

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.000
of interesting things.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.370
When we initially thought
about going to North Korea, who

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.170
better to go with than
Governor Richardson.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.610
And the best part of the
story, from my perspective,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.430
is we were sitting
in Beijing, and we

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.040
can't take our mobile phones in.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.360
And so we have to give our
mobile devices, all of them

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.000
to the Google Earth
Chinese people.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.506
So my daughter and I, Bill
and Kevin, and a few others,

00:00:50.506 --> 00:00:54.440
we give them all to
Chinese Google Earth

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.630
and then my daughter says, are
your fingers twitching yet,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.180
Dad?

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.300
And for a few hours, it
was just really weird,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.787
and then we discovered that
we actually liked each other.

00:01:04.787 --> 00:01:05.620
KEVIN BLEYER: Right.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.610
We had conversations.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: And we actually
spent four days together

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.890
getting to know each
other by ourselves,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.810
and we had the most
wonderful time.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.520
Governor, it's a pleasure
to have you here with Kevin

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.360
to promote your book,
so welcome to Google.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.397
GOV.

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:20.458
BILL RICHARDSON:
Thank you very much.

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:21.394
Thank you.

00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:24.202
Thank you.

00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:27.230
ERIC SCHMIDT: Now, I
think with this audience,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.440
maybe what we should do is
I'll ask a few questions

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.730
and we have some Dory questions
and maybe some questions

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.100
here from the audience.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.430
I think there's actually a
pretty interesting question

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.030
sort of right now, which has to
do with the bizarre activities

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.227
of the last two weeks
of the US government.

00:01:47.227 --> 00:01:48.560
Is that a fair characterization?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.880
it's just bizarre.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.415
Just bizarre.

00:01:51.415 --> 00:01:54.190
And I think we don't
get it, and perhaps we

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.610
don't get it because
we're too rational,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.930
and this requires sort of
an irrational planning,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.770
thinking, negotiating mind.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.900
You've faced these before.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.540
Go ahead.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.040
GOV.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.650
BILL RICHARDSON: Well
first, thank you, Eric.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.760
Thank you, Google.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.998
Congratulations, 10%
increase in your stock today.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.110
And if you get a chance
to read the book,

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.925
I'm giving enormous credit
to this guy, Kevin Bleyer

00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:27.740
and "The Daily Show" guy.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.687
What we tried to do--

00:02:28.687 --> 00:02:30.770
ERIC SCHMIDT: We should
say that Kevin is actually

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.580
a professional comedy writer who
moonlights with the two of us

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.460
to help us to diplomat.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.850
And Kevin, you've worked for?

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.957
KEVIN BLEYER: You name it.

00:02:41.957 --> 00:02:44.290
Six years for Bill Maher,
three years for Dennis Miller,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.290
and then for the
last eight years

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.920
I was a writer on
"The Daily Show."

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.003
ERIC SCHMIDT: You liberal.

00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:49.040
KEVIN BLEYER: I am
a comedic mercenary

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.370
or a rabid schizophrenic.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.125
I'm not quite sure,
back and forth.

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:52.625
GOV.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:55.200
BILL RICHARDSON: But
what we try to do

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.380
in this book and President
Clinton used to say,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.030
bad people like Richardson.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.575
Send him to talk to them.

00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:05.000
ERIC SCHMIDT: By the way, you
don't treat President Clinton

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.550
very well in this book.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.633
GOV.

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:07.466
BILL RICHARDSON: Well,
but I'll get to that.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.980
The point that I'm
trying to make here

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.190
is that we're trying to
make this book not just, OK,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.590
I negotiated with these
bad guys, Saddam Hussein,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.660
North Korea, Cuba, Sudan.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.170
But how do you apply
this to your daily life?

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.530
When you're negotiating
with your spouse, your wife,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.960
your kid, you know, what--

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.340
ERIC SCHMIDT: Kevin, do
you have an analogy there

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.974
or what's your comedic
objective there?

00:03:32.974 --> 00:03:34.390
KEVIN BLEYER: After
all, it's best

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.700
to treat your spouse like
an armchair dictator.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.775
GOV.

00:03:36.775 --> 00:03:38.191
BILL RICHARDSON:
It's to find ways

00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:40.160
to get things done
with difficult people,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.050
but on the shut down,
on the shut down,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.820
I wrote a little piece in the
"Washington Post" last week.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.540
Obviously, nobody's
listening to me,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.850
but I suggested four things
that they should do differently.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.300
And this is our Congress.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.530
These are our leaders.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.310
I was a congressman
15 years, so I

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.750
know the intense
pressure, the media glare.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.230
You've got to suck up to your
caucuses when you're a leader.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.190
You know, I'm tough.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.630
We're going to be
tough on our side.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.380
I would have done four
things differently.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.975
One, they needed mediation.

00:04:13.975 --> 00:04:15.975
That's reached a point
where it was so personal.

00:04:15.975 --> 00:04:17.970
They hate each other so much.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.079
They're talking to the cameras
instead of to each other.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.610
They're talking
to their caucuses

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.340
to show how they're
strong leaders,

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.320
and they want to get
reelected speakers, et cetera.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.100
So I would have had somebody
like Henry Paulson, Tim

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.930
Geithner, ex Secretaries of the
Treasury that are respected,

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.060
that know budgets that maybe
can go in and cool things down.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.090
Number two, I would have had the
president or somebody take them

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.010
away from the hill,
go to the White House,

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.370
lock up the locale,
and say, you're

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.350
not coming out until
you come up with a deal.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.340
Because what happens when
you're in intense pressure,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.210
you're showing off to the press,
to your own constituencies.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.874
Set a date certain for the
end of the negotiation.

00:05:05.874 --> 00:05:07.790
I would have had everybody
at the White House.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.400
Let him stay at
the Lincoln bedroom

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.960
and see if they-- that's
supposed to be funny.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.241
KEVIN BLEYER: Pack 'em all in.

00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:13.384
GOV.

00:05:13.384 --> 00:05:14.950
BILL RICHARDSON:
And then thirdly, I

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.580
think there was always,
Eric, outlines of a deal.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.080
But what happened was, the
very intense Tea Party people,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.950
what I would have done if I
had been Boehner, the Speaker,

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.590
I would have tested the
Tea Party guys on a vote.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.910
You know, machos,
40 votes, we want

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.320
to shut down the government.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.760
I bet you there would have
been some peeling off.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.140
Until you put
somebody to a vote,

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.090
go on record, because you'll
be attacked, pro and con, when

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.370
you take a vote.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.000
So I would have done
that differently.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.460
The last thing that I would
do, the outlines of the deal

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.110
were obvious.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.800
OK.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.590
President's going to not do
anything about Obamacare.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.090
That's passed as
law of the land.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.530
The default, the debt limit,
take that off the table.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.230
That should have been done
early, a shut down negotiation.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.150
But say, OK.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.080
What we're going
to do now is, we're

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.620
going to talk about
what the country needs.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.240
The country needs
economic growth.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.070
The country needs
immigration reform.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.130
The country needs
entitlement reform.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.550
The country needs tax
reform, regulatory reform,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.430
technology initiatives.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.340
So I would have framed the
negotiation differently,

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.560
but now, I think it's crucial
that the president step

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.940
in and say, OK.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.100
This is a bad episode,
but we're going

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.770
to move on and
pursue an agenda, not

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.090
just it's related to
the budget shutdown.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.539
That's what I would have done.

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:43.580
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
interesting that in your book,

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.410
you have a lot of
sort of subtle points

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.070
about negotiating,
which I actually

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.390
learned a number
by just reading it.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.230
And you tell an
interesting story

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.860
about you had been
aligned with Mrs. Clinton

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.220
and then you switched
allegiance to Mr. Obama.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.690
And you tell a story about
both the wrath of the Clintons,

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.540
I'll use your word, but
you also tell something

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.010
about a mistake
you made in that.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.380
Can you take us through that?

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.506
GOV.

00:07:11.506 --> 00:07:12.520
BILL RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.630
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's rare
for a political leader

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.960
to admit a mistake, and I think
this one is an interesting one

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.485
because you may have
been right, but you

00:07:20.485 --> 00:07:22.360
may have handled it a
little bit differently.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.460
GOV.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.376
BILL RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:26.980
Well, in the book, I
point out the successes

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.380
we had, the good techniques,
but also the mistakes, this one

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.210
and one I made in Cuba when
I got really ticked off

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.950
at the Cubans and denounced
them for not turning

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.790
over a prisoner, which
was a terrible mistake.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.770
With the Clintons,
this is the scene.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.830
I'd been a
presidential candidate,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.900
which I didn't
last too long, OK?

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.970
But no jokes.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.320
I lasted three primaries,
but still the only

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.630
Hispanic in the race,
Richardson, excellent Hispanic

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.820
name.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.770
Nobody knew period about me.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.910
And so people wanted
my endorsement.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:03.960
Obama would call.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.900
Hillary would call.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.760
John Edwards would call.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.790
Biden was already out.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.860
I always tell Biden, I got
more votes than you do,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.120
Iowa, New Hampshire.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.260
He doesn't like that but--

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.210
So what happened was,
I was being solicited,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.480
and Bill Clinton, I'd
been very close to him.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.780
I had been his UN Ambassador,
Secretary of Energy

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.200
We'd been pals together.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.500
I defended him on
the Lewinsky stuff.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.457
We'd watch TV together.

00:08:30.457 --> 00:08:31.915
And he says, I want
to talk to you.

00:08:31.915 --> 00:08:33.289
I want you to endorse Hillary.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.000
I want to come to Santa Fe
to the governor's mansion.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.230
But let's just chill out.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.350
We'll watch the Superbowl.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.210
And I said, OK.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.330
But instead of saying, no,
which I should have because it

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.850
raised enormous
expectations, his visit.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.960
You know, the great negotiator
himself, former president,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.450
my friend coming to Santa Fe
to ask for my endorsement.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:01.400
And there was such a media glare
and then when I didn't endorse,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.990
it was a mistake.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.710
I shouldn't have-- well, when
I didn't endorse Hillary,

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.980
it was a mistake
to have him come

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.830
to Santa Fe with that glare.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.470
And I say that in the book.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.970
I raised expectations.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.804
I made him look bad.

00:09:15.804 --> 00:09:17.969
ERIC SCHMIDT: But what's
interesting in your framing

00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:20.250
of this is that, the
individuals you're working with

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.820
are surrounded by other actors
that put pressure on them.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.170
In your case, a lot
of it is the media,

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.130
and once somebody gets
committed in the media,

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.820
it gets much, much
harder for them

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.193
to do anything
rational with you.

00:09:33.193 --> 00:09:33.693
GOV.

00:09:33.693 --> 00:09:35.150
BILL RICHARDSON:
And at the time,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.710
I really was soul searching.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.790
I saw Obama, I thought he was
something special, something

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.880
new, inspirational.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.920
I loved his speeches, the
people he was attracting.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.850
I knew the Clintons, and I
served well with the Clintons.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.950
But I did say, oh, jeez.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.870
All the same Clinton
people are coming back.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.240
Let's try something
new with Obama.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.426
That's supposed
to be funny, but--

00:09:58.426 --> 00:09:59.300
KEVIN BLEYER: It was.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.210
Trust me.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.470
But if I may, I'm
speaking of the media,

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.910
there was a particular moment, a
media moment during the debates

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.002
that Obama gave
you the impression,

00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:11.960
or gave you the sense
that you could trust him.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.460
GOV.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.050
BILL RICHARDSON: You know, these
debates, you all watch them.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.620
But when you're a candidate
that's not up in the polls,

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.930
they ask you very few questions.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:27.120
So the media is having a field
day with Obama and Clinton.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.510
I always used to sit next
to Obama in the debates.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.614
They always put the
minorities on the side.

00:10:34.614 --> 00:10:39.920
And there was a time in
one of the debates where

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.640
I'm like chatting with Obama.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.110
We're saying just little
gossip, and no one's

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.150
asking me questions.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.310
But all of a sudden, I think
it was Wolf Blitzer, says,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:55.140
Governor Richardson, what's
your position on this issue?

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.160
And there's a slight problem
because I wasn't listening.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.200
I was talking to Obama.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.010
So here's my big chance, and
I'm going to blow it, right?

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:10.210
So Obama leans over and he says,
they asked you about Katrina.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.680
Katrina.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.930
My position on Katrina is--
He could have thrown me

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.110
under the bus, but
little incidents like

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.656
that, I liked the guy, you know?

00:11:19.656 --> 00:11:20.330
Very gentle.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.416
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
he told the truth.

00:11:22.416 --> 00:11:22.916
GOV.

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.209
BILL RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:11:24.209 --> 00:11:25.000
KEVIN BLEYER: Yeah.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.499
Right.

00:11:25.499 --> 00:11:26.030
Exactly.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.738
That rare moment.

00:11:26.738 --> 00:11:27.860
That's a flub in politics.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:27.878
GOV.

00:11:27.878 --> 00:11:29.878
BILL RICHARDSON: And so
little things like that.

00:11:29.878 --> 00:11:31.078
And so I endorsed him, and--

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.070
KEVIN BLEYER: Not
right then, but later.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:36.570
GOV.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.932
BILL RICHARDSON:
I almost did then.

00:11:39.932 --> 00:11:41.880
KEVIN BLEYER: When
you're in a debate,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.550
probably the best tactic is
not to say, he's got my vote.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.880
We're still in the debates.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.880
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's talk
a little bit about some

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.460
of the crazy people
you've dealt with

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.490
and then we'll return
to North Korea,

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.890
a large set of crazy
people, I think.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.400
Let's talk a little
bit about Cuba.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.140
Did you have a
special role in Cuba

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.072
because of your
Hispanic connections?

00:12:04.072 --> 00:12:06.280
Why did you end up in Cuba
doing all of these things?

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.712
What did you, in fact, do, and
what were the Castro people

00:12:08.712 --> 00:12:09.295
actually like?

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:09.380
GOV.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.713
BILL RICHARDSON: Well, President
Clinton at the time-- I

00:12:11.713 --> 00:12:13.390
was a congressman
at the time, but I'd

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.080
done a lot of these
unofficial missions that

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.270
had gotten results,
mainly ceasefire, getting

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.020
political prisoners out.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.330
And I knew Castro.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.680
I'd made visits--
this is Fidel--

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.820
and I had succeeded in getting
political prisoners, three

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.620
political prisoners out, an
immigration agreement allowing

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.940
more Cubans to come into the
United States paying less.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.880
At one point, I remember
Jesse Jackson also

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.260
did a lot of this, Jimmy
Carter going in and trying

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.010
to bring people back.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.520
And I remember succeeding
once with Fidel Castro.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.270
We spoke Spanish to each other.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.480
We talked baseball.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.050
That was a big plus.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.520
I mean, he's a very
interesting, fascinating guy.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.800
He doesn't sleep at night.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.960
He sleeps during the day.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.230
He's up all night.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.280
He's a night owl.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.030
But he reads everything.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.050
He's probably the most
intelligent leader

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.620
I met in terms of
mentally, not necessarily

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.000
his values and his policies.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.390
But I remember pleading.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.920
Give me some of these
Cuban political prisoners.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.340
You're not getting any help in
the press by keeping them here.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.620
And I remember him saying, no.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.640
I'm not going to--
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.220
You know, Cubans, Latins call
each other by their last name.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.130
They don't say Mr.
Governor or anything.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.190
No, Richardson.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.210
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.610
And I said, please, please.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.590
You gave Jesse Jackson,
the black guy, 25.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:43.792
I'm asking as your Hispanic
brother, give me four.

00:13:43.792 --> 00:13:45.903
KEVIN BLEYER: The
word is quatro.

00:13:45.903 --> 00:13:46.403
GOV.

00:13:46.403 --> 00:13:48.790
BILL RICHARDSON: And you
know, he looked at me,

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.060
and he started
laughing, laughing.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.576
He said, all right.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:55.576 --> 00:13:59.970
So that was a real, but
then after he left power,

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.800
this is the one area where I
made a terrible mistake, Eric.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.620
This was about two years
ago, three years ago.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.880
I was no longer governor.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.560
I forgot that.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.450
When you have power, you
have a little more juice

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.810
when you're negotiating.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.210
But I just had my foundation.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.970
I went to Cuba.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.800
There's this guy
named Alan Gross.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.260
He's a contractor, an American
who got stuck in Cuba four

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.942
years ago because he was selling
telephone-- he had telephone--

00:14:25.942 --> 00:14:28.400
KEVIN BLEYER: --wiring up some
communities to the internet,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:28.570
actually.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:28.587
GOV.

00:14:28.587 --> 00:14:30.795
BILL RICHARDSON: And they
accused him of being a spy.

00:14:30.795 --> 00:14:32.710
He was in jail, and
it was a single issue

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.390
the divided the US and
Cuba more than anything.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.860
By the way, I think
our policy towards Cuba

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.910
doesn't make sense, the embargo.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.100
It makes no sense.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.000
I mean, let American
technology come in,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.650
democracy will come right after.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.360
But what happened
there was I thought

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.020
I had some agreement with the
Cubans to get Alan Gross out.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.530
We'd take them off
the terrorism list.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:01.430
We would find ways to have
better ties environmentally,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.570
drugs.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.140
And so I had this very
contentious meeting

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.220
with the Foreign
Minister of Cuba.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.470
I thought we were going to make
a deal, but he basically said,

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:14.200
Bill, you're not going
to get Alan Gross.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.230
I'm not only not going
to let you take him away,

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.510
I'm not going to
let you see him.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.940
And third, I want you to
leave Cuba right away.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.600
And I said, jeez, this is a
very hospitable meeting, Bruno.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.300
Not very funny.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.500
And so instead of like
shutting up and leaving,

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.170
going to my hotel,
cooling down, there

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.550
were all these cameras there.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:41.760
And I was angry, and
I went and I said,

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.780
Alan Gross is a hostage.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.850
He should be allowed to leave.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.360
The Cuban government
is being unreasonable,

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.730
and furthermore, unless I go
visit him in his hospital,

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.040
I'm not going to leave Cuba.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.770
Four days later
I left because it

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.630
was obvious I wasn't
going to see him.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.350
Big mistake.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.490
When you're negotiating,
don't lose your cool.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.200
I mean, it seems common.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.110
Don't lose your cool.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.660
Don't go to the press.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.830
Don't get ticked off needlessly.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:09.557
ERIC SCHMIDT: So my
rule for negotiation,

00:16:09.557 --> 00:16:11.640
which is going to be
expanded, based on your book,

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.360
It's called PIA, which
stands, by the way,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.970
for pain in the ass.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:21.380
So patients, information,
have some alternatives.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.530
Now, you in your book actually
lay out a deeper foundation,

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.540
and let me just summarize it.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.350
You need to set the mood
because it has to be controlled.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.080
Minutes matter.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.810
You need to say yes, right?

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.620
to keep it moving along.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.590
Humor.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.370
I guess we should always
travel with Kevin.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.480
KEVIN BLEYER: You're supposed
to lower the expectations.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.230
ERIC SCHMIDT: Don't ask
for a yes, assume a yes.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.530
Sometimes the soft sell works.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.030
I think these examples
that you're describing

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.780
don't-- and sales
people know this--

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.249
if the customer is thinking,
keep your own mouth shut,

00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:59.790
because when the
customer is talking,

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.589
you're winning even if it
doesn't appear to be true.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.790
So can you kind of
codify that for us?

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.460
I mean, we have lots
of what-- Google

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.293
is involved in lots and
lots of negotiations

00:17:11.293 --> 00:17:12.944
in lots of different
kinds of ways.

00:17:12.944 --> 00:17:13.444
GOV.

00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:16.200
BILL RICHARDSON: Well,
those are principles.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.060
I think others that
I would add is,

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.560
let the other side save face.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.310
Don't try to take
all the credit.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.670
In other words, share the credit
in a successful negotiation.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.060
Let the other side talk, but
also what's very important

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.730
is, try to establish
a personal connection.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.410
In diplomacy, where the United
States, a powerful country

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.790
militarily, I
always see the turf.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.310
This is why I end up in
North Korea or Cuba or Sudan.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.050
I go there, and I don't
think it's a big concession.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.790
So if it's a territorial
issue with your negotiator,

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.210
they want you to come visit them
at their headquarters, do it.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.640
It's an easy concession.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.670
Humor, I think,
is very important.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:06.390
The good news about negotiating
with a dictator, a bad person,

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.220
is dictators can make the
decision that give you

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:14.530
what you want without having to
go through Congress or t press,

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.020
so you need one shot.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.425
And what I've tried to do
is establish these rapports,

00:18:21.425 --> 00:18:23.880
like with Saddam
Hussein when I was

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.100
trying to get two Americans out.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.114
And we started the negotiation,
he tried to intimidate me.

00:18:30.114 --> 00:18:32.280
ERIC SCHMIDT: By the way,
describe what he was like?

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:32.780
GOV.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.385
BILL RICHARDSON: I mean, he's
a big guy, immaculate uniform.

00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:38.950
He had about three
knives and pistols,

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.790
and he had the revolutionary
guard around us,

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.920
so I was slightly intimidated.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.970
And he had these beady
eyes, and he'd look at me.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.630
And then he'd vent and say,
you know, US policy is wrong,

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.600
and your a bad country.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.619
And what am I getting out
of these negotiations?

00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:55.910
I give you these two Americans.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.110
He was like really ticked off.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.820
Then I made a terrible
mistake, another one.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.110
I showed them the
sole of my shoe, which

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.870
to an Arab-- like
this, Eric-- is

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.900
a supreme insult, like if
you're facing each other.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.935
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank you
for letting me know.

00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:15.450
KEVIN BLEYER: You've
just been insulted.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:15.950
GOV.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:17.491
BILL RICHARDSON: He
left the meeting.

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:18.300
He stormed out.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:18.670
ERIC SCHMIDT: Really?

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:18.762
GOV.

00:19:18.762 --> 00:19:19.040
BILL RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.670
And I hand this translator.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.800
I said, is he coming back?

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.630
What's going on?

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.950
Am I toast?

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.080
He said, no.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.100
You made a mistake.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.550
You insulted the president.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.790
He's coming back, and
you must apologize.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.169
He came back.

00:19:34.169 --> 00:19:34.960
I didn't apologize.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.820
I said, you know, I think you
may be trying to intimidate me.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.140
I think this is a mind game.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.300
I'll be respectful,
but I won't apologize.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.800
So I went back and forth.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.087
We went back and
forth with each other.

00:19:47.087 --> 00:19:48.670
I'm making the case
for the Americans,

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.610
and then all of a
sudden, ramrod straight,

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.600
he says, by virtue
of the section

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.090
131 of the Iraqi
Constitution, I am

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.555
going to turn over the
two Americans to you.

00:19:58.555 --> 00:20:01.770
And my first instinct
was, hey, thanks.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.490
Swooping in were the
Iraqi Revolutionary Guard

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.730
thinking I was going to
do something onerous--

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:08.575
KEVIN BLEYER: You grabbed him,

00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:09.075
GOV.

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:10.890
BILL RICHARDSON: --or kill him.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.550
We finished the negotiation.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.770
We got up.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.510
He said, I'm going
to call in the press.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:23.630
And you know, Congressman,
this is through a translator,

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.510
my appearing with you
in the Iraqi press

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.410
does not help my
political standing.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.940
And I said, well, Mr.
President, my standing with you

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.940
doesn't help mine either.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.910
We finished.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.710
We were heading out
and said, by the way,

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.900
he says, I noticed
that you asked--

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.140
you're a Roman
Catholic-- you asked

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.410
that you go to a
Catholic service.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.220
And Tariq Aziz, my
Foreign Minister's wife

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.770
is a Chaldean Catholic,
so you should go.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.960
Another lesson you learn
in dealing in a negotiation

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.570
with dictators, when you've
got what you want, and he had

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.940
already announced that I was
getting the two Americans,

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.050
get out.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.500
Because they change their
mind, they're temperamental,

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.530
they're crazy.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.250
You don't want them
to add something new,

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.880
some press statement
screws everything up.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.020
So I wanted to leave right after
I had the two Americans who

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.670
I was going to pick up
at the Swiss Embassy.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.670
And he said, no, no, no.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.230
You said you wanted
to go to church.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.190
I have arranged for
you to go to church.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.940
He says, but if you
really are in a hurry,

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.440
because I'd made some excuse.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.500
I was a congressman.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.314
I got votes coming up,
which was not true.

00:21:26.314 --> 00:21:26.980
It was a recess.

00:21:29.485 --> 00:21:30.860
KEVIN BLEYER: He
would have known

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:31.943
that if he had Googled it.

00:21:31.943 --> 00:21:33.226
So he didn't at the time.

00:21:33.226 --> 00:21:33.726
GOV.

00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:34.684
BILL RICHARDSON: Right.

00:21:34.684 --> 00:21:36.190
So he said--

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.976
KEVIN BLEYER: I get
that all the time.

00:21:37.976 --> 00:21:38.476
GOV.

00:21:38.476 --> 00:21:43.910
BILL RICHARDSON: So he says,
the only advice I have is,

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:48.400
when you go to the service,
don't go to confession

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.190
because if you go to confession,
you're going to be late.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.450
KEVIN BLEYER: You'll
be there for a while.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:52.490
GOV.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.073
BILL RICHARDSON: In
other words, jeez.

00:21:54.073 --> 00:21:56.510
They don't have a sense
of humor, these guys.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.910
But he was basically saying,
whatever the message,

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.780
we established like
a little connection.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:03.930
He smiled.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.870
This is the most evil
man in the world,

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.400
but I left, and I
got what I wanted.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.130
I mean, the relationship
as you know was turbulent.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.750
Later I was UN ambassador
probably involved

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.250
in the military
operation with him.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:18.750
So--

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.137
ERIC SCHMIDT: Right.

00:22:20.137 --> 00:22:20.637
GOV.

00:22:20.637 --> 00:22:22.178
BILL RICHARDSON:
That's what happens.

00:22:22.178 --> 00:22:22.710
Use humor.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.640
Use a personal connection.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.140
ERIC SCHMIDT: But
what's interesting

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.830
is, that there's
another group of people

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.270
who take the entire
opposite view of everything

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.020
that you tried to do.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.750
Stonewall, firewall,
don't engage,

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.570
they're criminals, they're
assholes, shoot them,

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.929
and so forth, and so on.

00:22:40.929 --> 00:22:41.970
You've heard all of this.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:42.470
GOV.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.480
BILL RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.680
KEVIN BLEYER: And when
the State Department

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.430
tells you to recite
that in front of them,

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:47.440
you usually decline.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:47.543
GOV.

00:22:47.543 --> 00:22:48.130
BILL RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.150
I mean, the State
Department would give me

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.510
talking points when I'm
talking to a bad guy

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.560
because they want
US policy reflected.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.265
KEVIN BLEYER: So Dear Mr.
Bad Guys, you are a bad guy.

00:22:57.265 --> 00:22:57.765
GOV.

00:22:57.765 --> 00:22:58.540
BILL RICHARDSON:
You are a bad guy.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.832
KEVIN BLEYER: How
are we doing so far?

00:22:59.832 --> 00:23:00.020
Yeah.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:00.132
GOV.

00:23:00.132 --> 00:23:01.640
BILL RICHARDSON: And I'm
trying to get something

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.460
from the bad guy.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.819
That's not a good start,
so I don't use that.

00:23:04.819 --> 00:23:06.360
KEVIN BLEYER: So
the exact 180 degree

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.420
from that is how you approached
Omar Suleiman, in Egypt.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:09.920
GOV.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.836
BILL RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:23:10.836 --> 00:23:15.060
I mean, there humor, and
sometimes macabre humor.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.580
And this one worked
because we were

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.550
trying to get this
Israeli named Shalit.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:24.130
You all remember we
were involved in that.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.210
I was governor, but
I had some people

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:30.750
try to get this Israeli
military guy out.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:37.240
And Omar Suleiman was the head
of security in Egypt, the most

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.870
notorious human rights
violator, put people in prison.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.350
And I knew that.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.660
And I opened up the meeting.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.550
I only talked to
him on the phone,

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.230
and I'll tell you a
quick lesson on that.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:56.730
But I started the conversation
by saying, Vice President

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.620
Suleiman, it's good to be here.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.930
Now, where are we?

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.030
He says, well, this is my
headquarters, et cetera.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.140
I said, well, now
where are the dungeons?

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.220
Where do you take the
people's fingernails off?

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.300
Is it nearby here?

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.020
ERIC SCHMIDT: You said this?

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:09.045
GOV.

00:24:09.045 --> 00:24:10.253
BILL RICHARDSON: I said that.

00:24:10.253 --> 00:24:11.860
Yeah.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.470
And he looked at me.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.250
Huh huh huh huh.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.530
You know, and all his-- so it
broke the ice a little bit.

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:20.030
It did.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.738
KEVIN BLEYER: It's
fair to say that could

00:24:21.738 --> 00:24:23.140
have gone either way.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.840
But it worked out.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.990
Starve a cold by setting
Governor Richardson into fever.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.490
GOV.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.160
BILL RICHARDSON: The
other conversation

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.040
I'd had with him,
we wanted to engage

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.690
in the negotiations
on Shalit, but we

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.530
had to get Suleiman's approval.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.700
And I remember talking
on the phone with him

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:45.000
before I'd met him, and he
said, yes in the conversation.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.580
But then he started
talking again.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.910
And I hung up.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.970
Now, did you guys see
"Moneyball," the movie?

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:53.570
All right.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.950
Remember when Brad Pitt
is negotiating and trading

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.550
for new ball players and Jonah
Hill, his assistant, says,

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.810
hey, the general manager
still was on the phone.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.970
You cut him off.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.850
And Brad Pitt said, when you get
the answer you want, hang up.

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:16.400
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's spend a
few minutes talking about North

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.240
Korea, then we'll go to
everybody's questions.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.260
So I'm extraordinarily
thankful to the governor

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.640
for one of the great trips of
my lifetime with my daughter

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.150
to North Korea.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:32.840
And this started when we met
in New York, Jared Cohen, who

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.060
of course, had set this
up along with a couple

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.540
of our other friends.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:40.180
And I couldn't quite figure out
what the governor was up to,

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.230
but we became good friends when
the State Department found out

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.692
we were going and told
us we couldn't go.

00:25:45.692 --> 00:25:47.150
So I called up the
governor, and he

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.721
said, oh, they say
that all the time.

00:25:49.721 --> 00:25:50.866
Is that roughly correct?

00:25:50.866 --> 00:25:52.240
KEVIN BLEYER: Yes,
but not to me.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:52.333
GOV.

00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:53.166
BILL RICHARDSON: No.

00:25:53.166 --> 00:25:54.050
It's true.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.640
The State Department, and we
have a good diplomatic corps,

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.130
and I'm not criticizing them,
but they're very cautious.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.340
They don't want anyone
else in our foreign policy,

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.380
anybody else except,
quote the professionals.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.540
And I happened to think
that with North Korea,

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.570
we need a new policy.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:14.330
We need to have a dialogue,
not necessarily a negotiation,

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.120
but a dialogue that
leads to negotiation.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.460
Isolating them,
punishing them, that's

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.320
not the way I
personally think you

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.350
deal with other countries that
have nuclear weapons, that

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.620
have missiles, that
are unfriendly.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:33.970
And so they said, well, Eric
and governors and Kevin's trip

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.010
are not timely.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.690
The State Department said that.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:42.195
But I felt that we made a
difference in that trip.

00:26:42.195 --> 00:26:43.840
ERIC SCHMIDT: So
right before we leave,

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.923
I get a phone call from
Denis McDonough who is now

00:26:45.923 --> 00:26:49.114
the Chief of Staff, who says,
we don't want you to go.

00:26:49.114 --> 00:26:49.780
And I said, why?

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.988
He said, the timing is wrong.

00:26:50.988 --> 00:26:52.000
And I said, well, why?

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.625
Well, what's going
to happen is there's

00:26:53.625 --> 00:26:54.790
going to be an escalation.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.249
We're going to retaliate.

00:26:56.249 --> 00:26:57.290
They're going to do this.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.170
We're going to retaliate.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.940
They're going to do something
else, we're going to retaliate.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.189
And I said, well, we're going
to be back on Wednesday.

00:27:02.189 --> 00:27:04.860
Could you retaliate
after Wednesday?

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.200
And he laughed.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.990
And it was pretty
clear in talking

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:13.200
to Jared and to the governor
that we would be OK.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.860
So we showed up and for those
of you who haven't seen it,

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.460
my daughter wrote
a blog which has

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.500
been read by many,
many people now,

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.350
which is just sort of a
26-year-old summary of what

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:26.070
it's like to show up in the
world's last repressive state.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.530
What I remember the
most about North Korea,

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.359
aside from the bizarreness
of it, is the temperature.

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:33.650
And the governor in the book
talks a lot about the fact

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.608
that we were heavily
photographed with exactly,

00:27:35.608 --> 00:27:37.170
you never changed your scarf.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:37.237
GOV.

00:27:37.237 --> 00:27:37.775
BILL RICHARDSON: Right.

00:27:37.775 --> 00:27:39.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
it was so cold,

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.120
we had to wear all of
our outfits inside.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:48.270
And I did not understand how
disabling extreme cold is.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:51.140
And this is a country
with no energy,

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.740
and I developed a
tremendous sense of sadness

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.060
for Kenneth Bae who
is the gentleman, one

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.546
of the goals we had was trying
to get him out of the gulag.

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:00.920
Because I'm sure
he was literally

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.590
sitting there shivering and what
shiver is, shivering to death.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.960
That's how disabling this was.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.450
And I also remember the
governor, because he would

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:12.950
always sort of
layout the framework,

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.650
and I would sort of
assist, is repetition,

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.640
repetition, repetition.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.920
Trying and trying and trying.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.550
Take us through
what you were trying

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.843
to do with us as
leading our team.

00:28:24.843 --> 00:28:25.343
GOV.

00:28:25.343 --> 00:28:27.010
BILL RICHARDSON:
Well, on that trip,

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:28.650
I was trying to do
three things, one

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:34.910
was Kenneth Bae, the
American, detained unfairly,

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:37.360
Korean American in a gulag.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.210
And we tried to do that, get
him out or at least get him

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:42.280
medical treatment.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.590
His trial hadn't started, so
we were pushing for his trial.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:50.160
And after his trial, usually
negotiations can move forward.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.250
The second was saying
to the North Koreans

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.610
a new leader had come in,
Kim Jong-un, 30 years old.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.730
Nobody knew anything
about him, but they'd

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.590
increased the escalation.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.660
They'd increase
missile launchers.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.280
They detonated a nuclear
weapon underground.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.090
And I'm saying to them,
what are you doing?

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.290
You're driving everybody away.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.180
You want food,
fuel, sanctions off.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.640
This is not the way to do it.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.290
Why are you doing this?

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.030
I know you.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:17.910
Take my advice.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.890
Just cool down.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.900
Needless to say, the
uncertainty of the leadership

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:27.111
there, and we tried to see,
Eric and I and Kevin, the dear

00:29:27.111 --> 00:29:27.610
leader.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.580
He wouldn't see us,
but later he saw

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:34.320
Dennis Rodman,
which ticked me off.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.530
And then the last
objective, and I

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.630
think Eric has being
very, very self effacing,

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:45.890
and this is the Google message,
which I say everywhere,

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:49.100
the technology, the
American technology.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.175
We went into this
university, and Eric

00:29:51.175 --> 00:29:54.314
will tell a little
bit about that--

00:29:54.314 --> 00:29:56.480
KEVIN BLEYER: Kim Il-sung
University, the E-Library.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:56.496
GOV.

00:29:56.496 --> 00:29:58.162
BILL RICHARDSON: Kim
Il-sung University.

00:29:58.162 --> 00:30:01.320
They had all these people
on their computers,

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.780
but they were
software engineers,

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.530
professionals there,
professors there.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:10.360
Eric came in with his Google
stuff, and he was the star.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.190
They were fascinated.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:15.080
The political
leadership, and Eric

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.530
was spreading the importance
of the internet, how

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:21.610
if you've read his book,
that's the essence of his book,

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:23.050
"The Digital Age."

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.940
But I really felt if
they were exposed,

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.100
the North Korean leadership,
to just expanding

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.500
the internet to not just
the elite that have it,

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.700
very small group, but to
universities, the software

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.140
engineers, this would
be good not just

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.890
for the people in
North Korea, but it

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:42.740
might lead to an
Arab Spring there,

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.330
an opening that doesn't exist.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.780
But I was just
another politician.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.990
They all went over
to talk to him.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.230
ERIC SCHMIDT: I was the
rock star of the group.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.730
GOV.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.860
BILL RICHARDSON: And I was
stuck with Kevin in the corner.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.810
But give them your impression.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:58.700
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yeah.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.980
Well, I agree with
all that, and you

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.561
go through this
in the book some.

00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:04.560
Let's talk a little bit
about North Korea today.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.190
So after our visit, they did
actually open up a few things.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:11.210
They allowed, for example, 3G
roaming on their million or so

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:13.540
phones that are, in fact, used.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.380
There's a partnership with
a company called Orascom.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.630
It's an Egyptian company
which actually provides this,

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.450
and they actually opened up.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.640
Shortly thereafter,
they turned it back off.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.400
They decided to do this
further escalation of conflict

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.460
with South Korea.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.560
For some bizarre reason,
they close the factories

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.018
that are on the
border that provide

00:31:34.018 --> 00:31:37.220
foreign currency for
the Northern country.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.220
They spent three months
screaming at each other.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.300
The new South Korean
prime minister

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.480
was a new leader, says
she's going to retaliate.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.950
Everything gets worse.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.460
And now in the last few
weeks, it's gotten better.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.620
I'm going to be in South
Korea in a couple of weeks

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.740
where I'm going to
meet with these people

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.450
again and try to figure out
the South Korean view of all

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.310
of this.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:04.560
So I can't tell whether North
Korea is better or worse, more

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.223
liberal, more conservative,
or just crazier.

00:32:07.223 --> 00:32:07.722
GOV.

00:32:07.722 --> 00:32:12.450
BILL RICHARDSON: You
know, my assessment, Eric,

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:15.820
is, I don't know the answer,
and I've been there probably

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.160
as many times as any American.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.450
The uncertainty is
because of this new leader

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.760
who has assumed power.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.105
He's consolidated
his military power.

00:32:27.105 --> 00:32:29.090
His name is Kim Jong-un.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:30.310
He's 30 years old.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:33.850
He was educated in Switzerland.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.540
His father had the choice of
three of his sons leading,

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.710
and they picked the youngest
because the other two had

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.350
problems, were
playboys, et cetera.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:47.150
But this guy, nobody
knows what makes him tick.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:52.990
What I suspect is happening is,
he is being manipulated right

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.370
now by, unfortunately,
the harder line

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.990
members of the
Korean people's army,

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.750
the military,
which is enormously

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:05.880
powerful with the people in the
party in the Communist Party

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.190
in North Korea, that are
anti engagement, anti US.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:13.790
My hope is that this
is just a phase where

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.830
with all this bluster
that he throws,

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.900
all these missile
launchers, he's

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.660
establishing and
consolidating his own power

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.610
within the country,
not that he's

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.940
going to have difficulty
in an election

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.210
because it's a cult
of personality.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.940
My only point there,
Eric, is I think whatever

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:35.920
you could do to get the
South Koreans to engage more

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.110
with the North Koreans when it
comes to family reunification.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:44.860
The Kaesong facility is a high
tech facility that employees

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.610
about 50,000 North
Koreans, I don't

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:51.350
know how many thousand South
Koreans, keep that going.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:56.260
Any kind of economic engagement,
family reunification.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.430
And then maybe there's
a big unknown element.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:03.550
The Chinese have influence
over North Korea,

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.920
and I think they're
starting to get ticked off

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.550
with all the bellicosity
of the North Koreans.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.989
And if they put real
pressure on North Korea,

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:13.320
because they provide
food and fuel,

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.239
I think you may see
a more moderate.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:15.980
ERIC SCHMIDT: One of
the things that we

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.949
learned was that North Korea is
completely dependent on China

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:21.345
for water, power, and energy.

00:34:21.345 --> 00:34:24.850
So if China were to decide that
they didn't like what the dear

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:26.850
leader is doing, they
could stop it in a second.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.141
KEVIN BLEYER: There are a
few famous stories of Chinese

00:34:29.141 --> 00:34:32.070
giving aid to North Korea,
true or not, we're not sure,

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.034
but they would often
send this aid via trains

00:34:35.034 --> 00:34:37.659
and the North Koreans would say,
thanks for the aid, and thanks

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:38.342
for the trains.

00:34:38.342 --> 00:34:40.300
They would keep them as
well, and the engineers

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.960
would have to find
a way to get back

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.430
sometimes walking
across the border.

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:46.250
It's true.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.350
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's go
to a few Dory questions,

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.808
and maybe we could get a couple
people here in the audience

00:34:50.808 --> 00:34:51.460
as well.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.679
There's a series
of questions that

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.199
have been previously
submitted, Governor,

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.469
and I'll just read them, and
then maybe you can answer them.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.250
And they're all sort
of in a similar vein.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.240
How do you negotiate
when one party is not

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.800
interested in any compromise?

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.950
In "The Charisma Myth."

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:08.110
Olivia Fox explains the
professional negotiators

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:10.670
could accurately predict
the outcome of negotiations

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.410
fairly early using
one simple clue.

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:19.440
Whoever has the less
endurance for silence loses.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.075
How do you negotiate when one
party is holding hostages?

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.510
What are your top
three negotiating tips

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.210
for daily life?

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:32.330
What do you do in
extreme situations

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:35.110
when the other party is
just unwilling to negotiate?

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:35.610
GOV.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.030
BILL RICHARDSON: Well, I
mean, there are cases here

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:42.590
where, my view is you can make
a deal with almost anyone.

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.260
That's a fundamental premise.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.080
KEVIN BLEYER: Which is why he
got the nickname undersecretary

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:46.690
for thugs.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:47.190
GOV.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.950
BILL RICHARDSON: Right.

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.280
And I believe the
most important element

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.600
there is, you have to relate
to that person personally,

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.570
and you have to
do it real quick.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.800
But to do that, you have
to do a little research.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.900
You just can't go
in and tell a joke.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.060
I want to know who
the last person that

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.260
talked to this dictator.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.860
I want to-- if I still have
access to intelligence files.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.440
What makes this person tick?

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.770
Where is he vulnerable?

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.460
Why is he meeting with me?

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.850
There must be a reason if
he's taking the meeting.

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:21.160
Then what I think
is essential is

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.140
you have to break
through the glass

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.600
and let the other
side know with candor,

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.470
what is the other side getting
out of the negotiation?

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:31.490
In some cases, it's very little.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:34.910
There's one case that
I use another joke,

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:39.000
but also somebody
that was refusing

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.880
to let this American
journalist out.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.060
His name was Salopek from
the "Chicago Tribune."

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.099
Bash-- what's his name, Kevin?

00:36:47.099 --> 00:36:48.390
KEVIN BLEYER: You got it right.

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.465
GOV.

00:36:48.465 --> 00:36:49.080
BILL RICHARDSON: In Sudan.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:49.415
KEVIN BLEYER: Yeah.

00:36:49.415 --> 00:36:49.498
GOV.

00:36:49.498 --> 00:36:50.350
BILL RICHARDSON:
Well, what's his name?

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:50.600
KEVIN BLEYER: Bashir.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:50.840
You just said it.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.320
ERIC SCHMIDT: Bashir.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:51.470
GOV.

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.920
BILL RICHARDSON: Bashir.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.827
KEVIN BLEYER: The
convicted ICC war criminal.

00:36:53.827 --> 00:36:54.327
GOV.

00:36:54.327 --> 00:36:57.070
BILL RICHARDSON: In all the
lists, the worst dictator

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.140
in the world, it's
always Bashir of Sudan.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.690
Well, he likes me.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:05.870
Anyway, I'd gotten
three Red Cross workers

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:10.480
12 years before from
Sudan, not Americans.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.170
And I thanked Bashir 13 years
ago for turning them over.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:16.530
He didn't have to do it.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:19.570
This is another negotiation
that's in the book.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:25.950
But with Salopek, it was a case
where nobody could get him out,

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:29.710
even Barack Obama as a
senator had traveled there,

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.010
and he couldn't get them out.

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:32.810
He couldn't even
meet with Bashir.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:34.540
US government couldn't do it.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.280
So it was intractable.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:40.180
And this guy was mad, Bashir
was mad at the journalist

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.810
because the
journalist had written

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:46.160
that Bashir was terrible
and the Darfur case.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:51.290
And so Bashir had imprisoned
Salopek and these two

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:55.290
black Chadians that carried the
equipment for the journalists.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:58.390
They were in jail
in southern Sudan.

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:00.140
So I went to Bashir.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.470
The family came to
see me, and I don't

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:06.160
get involved in prisoner issues
unless the family asked me.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.495
Then after a letter,
then we get involved.

00:38:08.495 --> 00:38:09.370
We try to be helpful.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.940
We don't charge anything.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.740
We do the diplomacy.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:17.202
And so I went to see this man,
Bashir, and we were desperate.

00:38:17.202 --> 00:38:18.910
We didn't know what
it was going to take.

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:24.020
Salopek was sick, so I took
his wife, Salopek's wife,

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.490
and I said to his wife, we're
going to meet with Bashir.

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:32.140
And I want you to do one
thing in the meeting.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.570
I want you to cry,
and show some emotion,

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.700
and you know, that you want
to get your husband out.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.050
I said, you do want
to get him out, right?

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:48.430
So we had the
meeting, and I kept

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:53.140
pleading with Bashir, and this
woman, bright, smart woman,

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.430
she wouldn't cry.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:58.970
And I'd look at her.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:59.820
She finally did.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:00.705
KEVIN BLEYER: You
started peeling onions.

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:01.205
GOV.

00:39:01.205 --> 00:39:03.560
BILL RICHARDSON: Very
effectively, she did.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.546
And so I say to Bashir, come on.

00:39:06.546 --> 00:39:09.440
Are you going to give
me Salopek or not?

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.140
He said, OK.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.010
You got him.

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.660
You got him.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.300
But the two Chadians,
"they're enemies of the state.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.910
I'm not going to let them go!"

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:24.300
I said, Bashir, I can't
leave with just one person.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.980
I got to get them all.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.960
And you know, we went
back and forth, back,

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.740
and I said I'm going
to try this one.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.940
I said, OK, Bashir.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.940
You're a politician.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.230
I'm a politician.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:39.150
How's it going to
look, and he nods.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:43.270
His last election he got 98%,
you know, like some election,

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.190
right?

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:49.660
I said, Bashir, how can I go
back to the United States,

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.870
and you know I have
political ambitions.

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:54.500
And he almost said, well,
I'm ready to endorse you.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.806
I said no.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:01.872
He actually said something
to the AP reporter

00:40:01.872 --> 00:40:02.580
that was with us.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.110
That wasn't helpful.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:08.740
Anyway, I said to
him, come on, Bashir.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:14.270
How can I leave with a
white guy going with me

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:17.081
and the two black
guys staying behind?

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:21.620
It was like, I've gotten
grief for saying this,

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.880
but I did say it.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.950
And he looked at me and like
Castro he burst out laughing.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.020
He'd laughed and
laughed and laughed.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:34.970
And he called in his staff,
and he told them the joke.

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:36.320
And he said, OK.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.380
Go.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:37.880
Go.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.750
ERIC SCHMIDT: At
which point, you

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.380
headed right to the airport.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.857
KEVIN BLEYER: Well,
actually, with a crying wife.

00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:44.205
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yeah.

00:40:44.205 --> 00:40:45.080
And you got them all.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:45.216
GOV.

00:40:45.216 --> 00:40:46.080
BILL RICHARDSON:
We got them all.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's great.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.510
We had a question here.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:52.930
Somebody had a
question that stood up?

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.060
There's a microphone.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.102
Use the mic here.

00:40:57.102 --> 00:40:59.270
AUDIENCE: When do
you stop negotiation?

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:01.580
Meaning, is there any point
you reach where you say,

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:02.593
I can't do anymore?

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:03.093
GOV.

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:04.843
BILL RICHARDSON: You've
got to keep going.

00:41:04.843 --> 00:41:06.830
You've got to be patient.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:11.890
I believe in a negotiation where
the next concession you want

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:13.960
is for them to meet again.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.355
Keep going after it.

00:41:15.355 --> 00:41:19.370
With North Korea, when I got
a couple of American pilots

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:22.410
that had been down, this
was one of my first,

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.600
I told the North
Koreans, I am not

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.470
leaving North Korea
until I get the pilots.

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:32.160
One of them was dead that
had been down and helicopter

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.160
pilots off the DMZ.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.640
You just keep going,
you're respectful,

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.500
but you don't take no.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:45.760
But then you avoid
mistakes like I

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.382
made in Cuba of getting too hot.

00:41:48.382 --> 00:41:50.590
ERIC SCHMIDT: You're obviously
a pretty fearless guy.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:52.540
Have you ever actually
been scared for your life?

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:52.610
GOV.

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:52.820
BILL RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.460
I was scared with
Saddam Hussein.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.050
I was scared on that
first North Korean trip.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:01.410
One time in the Sudan, in the
Bush, there was rebel groups.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:02.910
They held three Americans.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:05.800
They had all these
kids with AK-47s,

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.923
these little African
kids 11 years old,

00:42:08.923 --> 00:42:11.550
and we had no security.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.270
Yeah.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.830
Sure you do.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.366
ERIC SCHMIDT: Next question.

00:42:14.366 --> 00:42:16.500
AUDIENCE: Governor
Richardson, what

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.190
is your advice for
Americans and other citizens

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:23.630
of the Western world who want
to go and travel to the DPRK

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:25.468
and see it as you have?

00:42:25.468 --> 00:42:25.968
GOV.

00:42:25.968 --> 00:42:33.630
BILL RICHARDSON: Well,
the first thing you do

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:37.540
is let the American
Embassy know.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.404
Secondly,--

00:42:38.404 --> 00:42:40.320
ERIC SCHMIDT: Don't be
a Christian missionary?

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:40.423
GOV.

00:42:40.423 --> 00:42:40.940
BILL RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:41.810
ERIC SCHMIDT: Don't try to--

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.850
GOV.

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:43.141
BILL RICHARDSON: Be very clear.

00:42:43.141 --> 00:42:44.660
Don't take any
technology with you

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:48.974
because it gives them an op--
don't take your Google stuff.

00:42:48.974 --> 00:42:50.390
Because that gives
them an excuse.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:56.570
Third, go commercially, go
openly, like Eric and I did.

00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:57.750
We went through Beijing.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.600
That's the only
place you can fly to.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.270
Be careful.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:03.812
It's a Russian plane, you know.

00:43:03.812 --> 00:43:05.186
KEVIN BLEYER:
Actually, Air Koryo

00:43:05.186 --> 00:43:06.549
is the airline that we took.

00:43:06.549 --> 00:43:07.840
It's the North Korean Airlines.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.350
And it's never crashed.

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:12.120
But I mean, it's
officially never crashed.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.680
It's actually the second
most dangerous airline,

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.802
they just don't report it.

00:43:14.802 --> 00:43:16.010
ERIC SCHMIDT: So we're clear.

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.620
Air Koryo has the lowest
customer satisfaction

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:19.950
in the entire world.

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.650
KEVIN BLEYER: And
beyond that, yeah.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:23.260
Right?

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:26.260
I don't need technology to
show you one quick anecdote.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.430
We had given up our technology.

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:31.300
We knew it was in safe hands in
the Beijing office of Google,

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:36.459
because after all China is the
safest place to some material.

00:43:36.459 --> 00:43:38.250
But we arrived there,
and we had given away

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:41.650
most of our technology,
our phones, everything.

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:43.775
So when we got to the
foreign ministry guest house,

00:43:43.775 --> 00:43:45.483
I think we had arranged,
all right, we're

00:43:45.483 --> 00:43:47.680
going to meet is 730 in
the lobby the next morning.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.790
And as we're walking to
our rooms, a couple of us

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.480
said, wait a minute,
I don't have my phone.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.870
I can't tell the time.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:56.954
So how are we going to
know when to get up?

00:43:56.954 --> 00:43:58.370
And we'd been told
that everyone--

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.560
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's called a
wake up call at the hotel.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.120
KEVIN BLEYER:
Well, I don't think

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.730
that was an option
the first night

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:03.520
because we hadn't arranged it.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:04.710
We didn't know how to do it.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:07.251
So we actually just said, well,
we know the rooms are bugged,

00:44:07.251 --> 00:44:11.092
so just go in and say, I'd like
to wake up at 7:30, please.

00:44:11.092 --> 00:44:13.790
ERIC SCHMIDT: So Jared
announced that he was concerned

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:15.610
about cameras in his
room, so he would

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:18.174
shower in his bathing suit.

00:44:18.174 --> 00:44:20.935
And I actually slept, and
this is true, with the door

00:44:20.935 --> 00:44:23.060
open because I figured they
knew everything anyway.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.170
KEVIN BLEYER: Why not?

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:27.850
The vent in the shower,
the vent in the shower,

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:28.860
was made by Panasonic.

00:44:32.876 --> 00:44:33.650
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:34.290
Next question.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:35.849
KEVIN BLEYER: Suspicious.

00:44:35.849 --> 00:44:37.890
AUDIENCE: Governor
Richardson, you used the word,

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:38.900
this guy's a bad guy.

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:39.580
He's a bad guy.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:40.320
He's a bad guy.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.445
Is that any way to start
a negotiation particularly

00:44:42.445 --> 00:44:45.100
when who is good and who is
bad is a very fungible concept?

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:45.253
GOV.

00:44:45.253 --> 00:44:46.836
BILL RICHARDSON:
Well, I was referring

00:44:46.836 --> 00:44:48.930
to President Clinton
did actually say that.

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:50.860
The bad guys like me.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.460
And what I do in the book,
actually, it was my publisher.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.560
I didn't think of it.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.990
He calls them a shark.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:59.670
Shark is a more
generous attribute

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:01.780
than calling somebody a bad guy.

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.610
But yeah, you've
got to be careful.

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:04.990
You can insult people.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:07.340
I mentioned that
Cuba instance, when

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:10.170
I said the Cubans
were unreasonable.

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:13.350
Try to not get personal
except to connect

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:14.400
with the other person.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.983
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
an interesting thing

00:45:15.983 --> 00:45:18.400
in the bizarre
negotiation in DC, things

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.980
became so bad between
the people that one

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.100
of the political leaders
had his staff release

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.930
the emails from the other side
onto the blogosphere, right?

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:29.460
in order to embarrass
them in between meetings.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.042
I mean, it was brutal.

00:45:31.042 --> 00:45:31.875
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:31.875 --> 00:45:33.203
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes, sir.

00:45:33.203 --> 00:45:35.070
AUDIENCE: Hi,
Governor Richardson.

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:38.570
So have you ever like
been in such a situation

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:41.570
that when you're trying to
make a personal connection

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:45.250
with a dictator you're trying to
be humorous and telling a joke

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.370
but the other one just
didn't get, and feel

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.060
like you're too personal.

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:53.660
Have you met the situation,
and how you would deal with it?

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:54.160
GOV.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.620
BILL RICHARDSON: Well, you
know, the North Koreans,

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.380
they don't think like we do.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:02.290
We believe the
concept of negotiation

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:03.800
is the quid pro quo.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.570
You do something.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:05.710
I do something.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:07.770
The North Koreans
don't believe in that.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:11.790
They believe that their
position is the right one.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:15.180
And the concession they make
is, they'll give you a few weeks

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.410
to come to their position.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:18.130
That they're concession.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:21.150
And when you have that
mindset against you,

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:23.530
remember this is a
cult of personality,

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:26.475
you've got to be careful
sometimes about the humor.

00:46:26.475 --> 00:46:30.380
You know, with North
Korea, Eric, these guys,

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.470
we try to be as
serious as we can.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.510
We want to drive home a message.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:38.480
You want to be candid,
but at the same time,

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:43.050
so I won't say you delete the
humor from the North Koreans,

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:48.266
but you're selective
in how you use it.

00:46:48.266 --> 00:46:50.140
KEVIN BLEYER: They
weren't totally humorless.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.942
One of the last
nights we were there,

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:56.290
there was a moment when I
think maybe Jared had said

00:46:56.290 --> 00:47:00.070
to the woman who they called
the Condi Rice of North Korea,

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.890
Kevin actually has been a
writer for "The Daily Show."

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:03.990
Her eyes lit up.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.180
She said, Jon Stewart?

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.412
Next time you come you
have to bring him with you.

00:47:09.412 --> 00:47:10.370
I thought two thoughts.

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:12.494
One, next time I come,
is that an invitation,

00:47:12.494 --> 00:47:13.910
and the second
thought is, I don't

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:15.770
think Jon Stewart would
come to North Korea.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:16.520
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.090
Yes, sir.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:20.060
AUDIENCE: I was just taking
a few pages on your chapter

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:24.600
on Venezuelan, your interactions
with Hugo Chavez including

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.560
one of the first defining
moments of the US

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.100
and Venezuelan
relationship, which

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.910
was his first visit
to the White House.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:34.840
But aside from your
experience with the bad guy,

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.790
can you elaborate more on
mistakes done by other US

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:44.326
officials along those 14 years
of really bad relationship?

00:47:44.326 --> 00:47:44.826
GOV.

00:47:44.826 --> 00:47:48.750
BILL RICHARDSON: Well,
my view with Hugo Chavez

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:53.410
is encapsulated in the thought
that our policy towards him

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.090
was basically ignore him.

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:57.115
This was US policy.

00:47:57.115 --> 00:47:59.890
It was almost stated.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:03.270
I think that was a
mistake, Clinton, Bush.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:04.180
And you're right.

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.470
I went to his inaugural when
he was first made president.

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:12.380
He was insulted that I went and
not President Clinton or Gore.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.070
So that was like his first--
I won't say that was decisive.

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:23.550
So I think ignoring
somebody doesn't make sense.

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:25.880
I think eventually
you have to engage.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.660
I always feel that
Latin America is

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.140
a part of the world we
should pay more attention to.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:33.150
But right now, you know our
relations with Venezuela

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:34.530
is not good.

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:36.940
Our relations with
Nicaragua is not good,

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.750
with Cuba, it's not good,
with Bolivia, it's not good.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.300
We barely have
ambassadors there.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.310
With Ecuador, it's not good.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:49.480
So ignoring is a
policy option, but I

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:55.890
would prefer engaging, engaging
in technology interactions,

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:57.850
and academic interactions.

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:01.540
And once in awhile have the
Secretary of State visit

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.480
even if there are differences.

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.290
I think that only
inflames a country more.

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:09.430
With Venezuela, I
was at the election

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:12.390
of the new president, Maduro.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:16.100
I don't know if he really
won. it was so close.

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.960
But he reached out to me
knowing that I was an America

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:23.480
and I was an observer of the
organization of Americans.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.230
And he sent a message,
well, I'd like

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:29.160
to improve the
relationship with the US.

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.490
And this guy, Maduro,
he's not like Chavez was.

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:34.680
Chavez was very strong.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.660
His people believed in him.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.760
And the problem with
Maduro, a few days

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:46.060
after, he says to the
world, I'll take Snowden.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.030
He's in Russia.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:48.510
I'll let him come in.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:50.390
By the way, this
may not be popular.

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:52.970
I'm not a big fan of
Snowden, what he did.

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:55.610
I mean, that's the National
Security of the United States.

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:58.690
For him to decide he's going
to release what's right

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:01.370
and what's wrong, I
think that's wrong.

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:03.650
But did I answer your question?

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:04.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.040
GOV.

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:05.430
BILL RICHARDSON: Thank you.

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.816
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:50:05.816 --> 00:50:06.316
Yes, sir.

00:50:06.316 --> 00:50:09.120
AUDIENCE: Governor Richardson,
I'd like to hear from you.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.080
What kind of
negotiation you think

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.340
might help to convince
the Chinese leaders,

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:18.164
those new leaders to open up the
so-called great firewall given,

00:50:18.164 --> 00:50:19.580
you know, they
have only a quarter

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.610
of the internet
is running there.

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:23.720
ERIC SCHMIDT: You remember
from our discussions

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.219
that the Chinese have a
censorship portal, which

00:50:26.219 --> 00:50:28.260
was known colloquially as
the great firewall that

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.246
sits between Google and
the Chinese citizens

00:50:30.246 --> 00:50:30.746
GOV.

00:50:30.746 --> 00:50:32.120
BILL RICHARDSON:
Yeah, but, Eric,

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.280
guys fixed that problem,
didn't you or not?

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.790
Didn't we not?

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.080
I know you're pushing
it, but wasn't there

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.700
some progress on that or not?

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:42.846
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:50:42.846 --> 00:50:46.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: I think
it's on negotiation,

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.630
and we're losing it.

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.470
KEVIN BLEYER: Perhaps
they need a mediator.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.970
GOV.

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:54.830
BILL RICHARDSON: You know,
look, we should not fear China.

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:58.700
You know, American politics,
oh, every campaign, the Chinese,

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.790
bah, bah, bah.

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:06.300
First, we should think of China
as a strategic competitor.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.530
We should also think of
China as a country that

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:12.870
is trying to decide
where it wants to go.

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:16.830
When I was at the UN, they
were already a major power.

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:19.120
They only paid 3% of the budget.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.070
We paid 28% of the UN.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.180
And they'd say, well,
we're a developing country.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.760
We can't afford more than 3%.

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.100
Now, they're paying more
now, but they still, I

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.410
don't think they've
decided in terms

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:33.584
of their great
economic power what

00:51:33.584 --> 00:51:34.750
they're going to do with it.

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:35.730
That's my theory.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.160
I may be wrong.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:41.860
My point is that the
American-Chinese relationship

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.310
has a lot of different handles.

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:47.800
There's the North Korea side,
the national security side,

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.680
military presence in East
Asia, the technology side,

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.380
the trade side they control.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:56.240
They spoke out on the shut down.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.660
They were worried about
their investments in the US.

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:02.700
So we have to be very
careful in this relationship

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.900
and know that it has
a lot of branches.

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.170
And when you start
insulting each other,

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:12.620
the Chinese are very
big on saving face,

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.980
on decorum, on proper channels.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:20.020
I wouldn't use too
much humor with them

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.300
if I were negotiating with them.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.660
But I think on the technology
side, one of the things

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.840
that the Chinese will say at
the end of the conference,

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.810
I know Eric goes
to a lot of them

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:35.990
like I do as does Kevin, is
the Chinese will blast us

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:38.620
at the conference,
Davos, anywhere.

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:40.880
But then at the end
of the conference,

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.030
this is what they say.

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:43.310
They say, OK.

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:48.770
America, clean up your
act, but lead, lead.

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.610
What I'm trying to
say is that I think

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:53.790
we just continue
these discussions.

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:56.830
I think the negotiation on
cyber security between the two

00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:59.510
countries are
enormously important.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:02.940
And it's better to try to
make agreements with them

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:05.250
while their policies
are evolving,

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:09.440
and I think they're trying to
decide where they want to go.

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.856
Eric, what's your
thought on that?

00:53:10.856 --> 00:53:13.040
ERIC SCHMIDT: I
actually agree with you.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.875
Let's have these be the
two final questions,

00:53:15.875 --> 00:53:17.500
and then we'll have
a wrap-up question,

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:18.458
and then we'll be done.

00:53:18.458 --> 00:53:19.295
Yes, sir.

00:53:19.295 --> 00:53:20.837
AUDIENCE: Hello,
Governor Richardson.

00:53:20.837 --> 00:53:23.420
I wanted to go back to what you
mentioned with regards to Cuba

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:24.290
and American policy.

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:26.450
And you said you were
against the current policy.

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:29.360
I used to have a young
colleague, an American

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:32.620
of Cuban descent, who used
to say that his father was

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.610
against changing these policies.

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:37.140
His grandfather was against
changing these policies

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:42.250
and that Americans of Cuban
descent had these opinions

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.280
and that they represented
a strong voting block,

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.738
and that was one
of the reasons why

00:53:45.738 --> 00:53:47.590
things weren't changing
and wouldn't change

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:50.352
until these people
had passed on.

00:53:50.352 --> 00:53:51.935
How do you feel about
that assessment?

00:53:51.935 --> 00:53:52.880
Is that accurate?

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.380
GOV.

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:55.213
BILL RICHARDSON: That
assessment is accurate

00:53:55.213 --> 00:54:04.250
because on a presidential race,
Florida and New Jersey are key.

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:07.700
Florida, the Cuban American
vote is very strong.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:11.294
The same in New Jersey where
Senator Menendez is from.

00:54:11.294 --> 00:54:13.085
Where's Menendez-- what
town in New Jersey?

00:54:13.085 --> 00:54:14.130
KEVIN BLEYER: I don't recall.

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:14.250
GOV.

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.999
BILL RICHARDSON: One
of you guys, come on.

00:54:15.999 --> 00:54:18.099
One of you guys are from
New Jersey, aren't you?

00:54:18.099 --> 00:54:20.140
Eric, what's that town
right after New York City?

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.230
ERIC SCHMIDT: We are Google.

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.220
We could look this up.

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:23.720
GOV.

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:24.950
BILL RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:29.360
By the way, Eric had said you
guys did a Google map on North

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.930
Korea, and I got a message Eric
wanted to do it before we left.

00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:36.390
I said, Eric, let's wait
till after we get back.

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:38.540
And it was a great map.

00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:43.750
But my point is that the Cuban
American vote is changing.

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:46.130
The younger
generation is saying,

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:51.310
we've had this hostile policy
towards Cuba, the embargo.

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:53.400
Castro is still in power.

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.066
The country is not doing well.

00:54:55.066 --> 00:54:56.690
What are we getting
out of the embargo?

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:59.110
So there's questioning going on.

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:02.250
And I think Obama has moved
in the right direction on side

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:07.140
issues, like more
family visits, loosening

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:11.110
the opportunity of travel
of Americans going to Cuba.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:14.140
It's easier to get in right now.

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:18.530
But this Alan Gross case, which
I mentioned, is a big barrier

00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:23.590
and the Cuban five, five
Cubans in American jails

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:26.390
that have been in
jail for spying,

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:29.660
are the human barriers
between the two countries.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.070
But that vote this
changing a bit.

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:36.230
Obama won Florida and
just about the only thing

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:38.270
I'll say about
the Hispanic vote,

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:40.980
on this shutdown and
the immigration reform,

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:43.450
the Republican
Party only got 29%

00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:46.770
of the Hispanic vote, the
lowest they've ever had.

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:50.400
And if they don't change
that policy on immigration,

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.860
they're going to become
a minority party.

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:56.970
And right now the Tea Party
Republicans in the house

00:55:56.970 --> 00:56:01.276
are adamantly opposed to any
changes in the immigration law,

00:56:01.276 --> 00:56:03.400
and that's going to hurt
them with Cuban Americans,

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.100
with Mexican Americans,
Central Americans that

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:10.457
are part of this American
political fabric.

00:56:10.457 --> 00:56:11.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:12.289
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank you.

00:56:12.289 --> 00:56:14.200
And our final question.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.490
AUDIENCE: Governor
Richardson, I would just

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:19.910
like to ask you on a comment
on the situation in Syria,

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:22.620
how the ongoing
negotiations don't

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.850
seem to bring much in
the whole situation

00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:27.790
with attack and not attacking.

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:29.130
What's your view on this?

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:29.630
GOV.

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:33.620
BILL RICHARDSON:
Well, God, I love,

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:37.620
besides my love for
Google, I love Facebook.

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:42.770
I love to read all the comments
on Twitter on this issue.

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:48.540
I came out saying I support
Obama in the military strikes.

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:49.250
Why?

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:52.780
Because I think there has
to be a consequence of cost

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:55.970
when there's a violation
of human rights of chemical

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:57.190
weapons used.

00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:59.270
I think it's an
international crime.

00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:02.640
Now, I'm not for
intervening with boots

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.280
on the ground and
more than that.

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.220
So I thought that
was a right response.

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.150
Now, what has happened since?

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:12.770
Right now, everybody
dumps on the UN.

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:16.470
But you know who's enforcing
the chemical weapons ban, which

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.380
I think is going
to happen in Syria?

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:19.310
The UN.

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:21.210
Who won the Nobel Prize?

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:23.830
The chemical weapons
investigators.

00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:25.210
They won the Nobel.

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:28.330
I think that Pakistani
woman should have won it.

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:29.430
But apart from that--

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.680
KEVIN BLEYER: Malala.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:29.757
GOV.

00:57:29.757 --> 00:57:30.600
BILL RICHARDSON:
The little girl.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.190
What's her name?

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.996
KEVIN BLEYER: Malala.

00:57:31.996 --> 00:57:32.097
GOV.

00:57:32.097 --> 00:57:33.013
BILL RICHARDSON: Yeah.

00:57:33.013 --> 00:57:33.670
I mean, jeez.

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:37.380
This little girl was
such a great symbol.

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:42.260
So what I think is going
to happen in Syria,

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:45.530
I think Russia, and I'm
being generous here,

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:49.110
I think Russia realizes
that Assad is a loser.

00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:50.740
He's going to go down.

00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:52.110
He's not popular.

00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:54.780
His own military, I believe,
is going to take him down.

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:57.030
Now, a lot of people
disagree with me.

00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:00.560
They say, oh, you know,
nothing is going to change.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.980
Obama made a mistake.

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:06.410
I think we were actually
lucky that what happened

00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:11.630
was an opportunity that the
Russians presented saying, OK.

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:13.610
What if we get rid of
all the chemical weapons?

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:15.910
Will this deter the
military strike?

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:19.930
And of that negotiation
leads to a negotiation

00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:23.950
on the future of Assad on
a political transition,

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:26.250
I think it's a major
accomplishment.

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:29.380
But the situation is unstable.

00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:31.760
There's no question about it.

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:35.810
But I think the Russians know
that this guy Assad is a loser.

00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:40.250
So if they are maneuvering to
have a political transition

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.960
after the chemical
weapons are banned,

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.290
and I believe the
inspectors will make sure

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:46.360
that does happen.

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.850
You know, everybody's a cynic.

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:49.330
Oh, it's not going to happen.

00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:52.230
I'm an optimist by nature.

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:53.510
Do you disagree?

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:54.400
AUDIENCE: No.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:54.900
GOV.

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:55.735
BILL RICHARDSON: No?

00:58:55.735 --> 00:58:56.870
ERIC SCHMIDT: Kevin?

00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:58.029
He's negotiating.

00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.820
KEVIN BLEYER: Yeah.

00:58:58.820 --> 00:58:59.320
Right.

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.250
ERIC SCHMIDT: Kevin.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:05.175
after the successful book tour,
what are you going to do next?

00:59:05.175 --> 00:59:06.819
KEVIN BLEYER: That's
a good question.

00:59:06.819 --> 00:59:08.485
I don't know how to
live this down or up

00:59:08.485 --> 00:59:12.050
or what have you after traveling
the world with the two of you

00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:13.810
and also feeling
like I've traveled

00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:16.310
the world for the last three
decades and sitting at his knee

00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:18.170
and learning all the
negotiations he's

00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:19.710
had with these amazing people.

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:21.430
I feel like I've
lived there too.

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:23.687
I was in those rooms and
hopefully, the book as well

00:59:23.687 --> 00:59:24.770
gives you a sense of that.

00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:26.644
So quite frankly, I'm
a little bit exhausted.

00:59:26.644 --> 00:59:28.060
I'll be honest with you.

00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:33.560
Next I feel like there's---
I'm told that political satire

00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:36.850
to some degree, the fake news
world is the growth industry--

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:39.580
ERIC SCHMIDT: They have
generated so much new material

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:40.080
for you.

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:40.690
KEVIN BLEYER: So
apparently, yeah.

00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:42.898
I'm going to keep pursuing
that and see what happens.

00:59:42.898 --> 00:59:45.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: Governor,
after this is over,

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.280
you have a foundation
you've been heavily engaged,

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.720
I know, in Cuban issues.

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.643
What do you think your
next negotiation is?

00:59:53.643 --> 00:59:54.143
GOV.

00:59:54.143 --> 00:59:57.360
BILL RICHARDSON: Right
now, I believe, by the way,

00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:01.090
I formed a foundation
with Robert Redford.

01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:05.840
I am passionate about protecting
wild horses and mustangs.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.690
And there's a move afoot
to start slaughtering them

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:09.940
because they're proliferating.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.710
There's no question about it.

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:14.700
I just negotiated an agreement
with the Navajo nation,

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.810
which had announced
a policy of killing

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:20.460
these horses because they
were overrunning the Navajo

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.640
reservation.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:26.780
So in exchange for them not
doing this, the Navajos,

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.940
we're providing what is
called PCP, birth control,

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.110
sanctuaries for the horses.

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:37.840
So I have this other foundation,
the international foundation.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.740
We specialize in trying to
get political prisoners out.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:44.920
We specialize in relations
with difficult countries,

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:50.560
like North Korea, training
the legislature where

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.690
Eric Schmidt's daughter
helped us train

01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:56.350
the legislature in
Burma on technology.

01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:59.050
But apart from that,
Eric, right now,

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:05.410
I've been 32 years in the
public sector in government.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:06.430
I do speeches.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.180
I've got a speaker's bureau.

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.680
I serve on boards.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:16.180
I have a relationship with
this PR firm called APCO.

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.700
But I stay involved
in the policy.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.420
I'm a defender of the president.

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:24.670
I think he's done
a good job on TV.

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:31.240
And my last point is, I'm
making a little money.

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.920
OK?

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.060
And Eric, my taxes are too high.

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.245
What do we do about it?

01:01:36.245 --> 01:01:37.170
ERIC SCHMIDT: Kevin.

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:39.440
KEVIN BLEYER: There's
one, I would be remiss.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.237
Forgive me.

01:01:40.237 --> 01:01:42.820
I would not let this opportunity
go by in this particular day.

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.650
As I stare across
Governor Richardson

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:46.970
and see you across
the way to not

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:48.921
tell this very quick anecdote.

01:01:48.921 --> 01:01:51.170
That this is the only place
I would be able to tell it

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.350
nor should I tell,
but I will do it.

01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:56.304
As you may recall, we didn't
get to see Kim Jong-un.

01:01:56.304 --> 01:01:57.762
But on the day we
thought we might,

01:01:57.762 --> 01:01:59.824
we were instead brought
to the Palace of the Sun.

01:01:59.824 --> 01:02:01.240
Palace of the Sun
is the mausoleum

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.780
where King Jong-il and
Kim Il-sung are actually

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.545
laid out in state, embalmed.

01:02:05.545 --> 01:02:07.170
They get the Madame
Tussauds treatment.

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:08.160
I didn't know that.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.630
So I'll jump to
the chase and say

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:11.530
after seeing the
entire mausoleum,

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:14.740
you get brought into the actual
moment where Kim Jong-il is

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.390
laying there,
bathed in red light.

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:18.040
You're surrounded
by military police.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.665
We happened to be there on a day
when only military police were

01:02:20.665 --> 01:02:23.280
also allowed to visit, so
we kind of got separated.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.580
We ended up being with
our own essentially troops

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.170
and military police going in.

01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:30.422
You're supposed bow at
the side, bow at the feet,

01:02:30.422 --> 01:02:32.380
walk around the head and
bow at the other side.

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.960
We didn't bow, but
the military did.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.755
And as they bowed, I was staring
across Jim Jong-il's nose,

01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:39.640
and Eric Schmidt is on
the other side of it.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:44.080
And he kind of looks to
the side, stares at me,

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.210
and at the absurdity
of the situation,

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:50.320
I got the worst fifth
grade giggle fit.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.495
I just close my eyes and
just every muscle tensed,

01:02:53.495 --> 01:02:57.847
and thought I cannot
start laughing now.

01:02:57.847 --> 01:02:58.930
There are military please.

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:00.870
There are 50 military
police around here,

01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:03.710
and I'm pretty sure I would
have been this escorted away.

01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:04.910
But I just thought as I was
staring across your nose--

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:06.600
ERIC SCHMIDT: And this
is their most sacred site

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.224
in North Korea.

01:03:07.224 --> 01:03:08.345
KEVIN BLEYER: Absolutely.

01:03:08.345 --> 01:03:11.280
ERIC SCHMIDT: I
hope in our hour,

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.940
you got a sense of why we've
become such good friends.

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.640
And it's a bit of
advice for all of you.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.620
If you ever find yourself in
a foreign country with five

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.560
or six fellow
travelers, turn off

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.806
your devices a little while.

01:03:22.806 --> 01:03:25.180
Get to know them because
they're going to be fascinating.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.440
We've had such a good time.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.510
Thank you for this.

01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:31.010
Thank you for coming, and
thank you all for coming.

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:31.510
GOV.

01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:33.210
BILL RICHARDSON: Thank you.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.885
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank you.
