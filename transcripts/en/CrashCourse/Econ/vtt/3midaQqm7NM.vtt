00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.180
Welcome to Crash Course Economics, I'm Jacob
Clifford.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.580
And I'm Adriene Hill. We've been talking a
lot about macroeconomics: GDP, unemployment,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.960
fiscal and monetary policy. That kind of thing.
Now we're going to start talking about microeconomics.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.400
Microeconomics looks at individual markets
and the decision-making of consumers, businesses,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.720
and governments. They answer questions
like, "How many workers should we hire?" or

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.160
"Is increasing minimum wage and good idea?"
and "Why is health care so expensive?"

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.600
Now you might be thinking, which is more important:
micro or macro? The answer is (BOTH) micro/macro.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.360
Actually (BOTH) macro/micro. They're both
important.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:43.240
[Theme Music]

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.320
Let's start with one of the most important
concepts in microeconomics: marginal analysis.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.540
For economists, the word "marginal" is pretty
much the same as "additional". Marginal analysis

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.870
looks at how individuals, businesses and governments
make decisions. Basically, they're interested

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.970
in additional benefits and additional costs.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.259
Businesses do the same thing when they decide
how many workers to hire. They compare the

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.280
additional revenue that an additional worker
will likely generate for their company. And

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.249
to the additional cost of hiring that worker:
wages and benefits.

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:21.889
If hiring that worker brings in more marginal
revenue than marginal cost, then, congratulations!

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.159
Someone's got a job!

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.810
This also applies in the realm of how people
feel about things. Take the development of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.759
city parks: citizens obviously get more total
satisfaction from, like, four city parks than

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.080
from only three. But that doesn't necessarily
mean that the government should build four parks.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.580
Instead, the government looks at the additional
benefit or satisfaction generated by the fourth

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.149
city park and compares that to the additional
cost and here, when we're talking about cost

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.689
we're talking about the use of city land,
and the tax money spent on building the park.

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.729
If the additional benefit is higher, then
they build the park. The government keeps

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.759
doing this for each additional park. The benefit
of the first park is higher than the additional

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.519
benefit of the second park, and on and on.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.960
Eventually, the marginal benefit of another
park will be less than the marginal cost,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.520
so they stop building parks.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.160
Sure it's nice to have lots of parks, but
the difference between having 200 parks and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.090
201 parks is pretty small. This is the Law
of Diminishing Marginal Utility. By the way,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.260
when economists talk about consumers, the
word 'utility' means 'satisfaction' or happiness

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.569
people get from consuming a good, or service,
or 201 parks.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.959
So you could reword this as the Law of Decreasing
Additional Satisfaction, as you consume additional

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.650
amounts of anything, you'll eventually get
less and less additional satisfaction.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.280
It's like how the first slice of pizza or
cookie that you eat, is awesome, and the second

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.500
one might be even better, but eventually, each
additional one gives you less additional enjoyment.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.280
Economists have even made up a new word to
help quantify satisfaction called 'utils'.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.360
Utils are like happiness points and they are
completely subjective.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.080
So one person might get 100 utils of satisfaction
from the first slice of pizza and another

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.700
person might only get 10 utils.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.180
So the ideas here make sense, right? But the
whole numbers thing, this 'utils' idea it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.090
does seem a little contrived. People don't
actually make these calculations, do they?

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.469
Yeah, they do. You don't write them down or
think about your happiness in terms of utils,

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:16.109
but you do likely unconsciously use marginal
analysis every day.

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.720
Let's go to the the Thought Bubble.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.829
Marginal analysis can explain all sorts of
human behaviour. Let's say that Stan goes

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.799
to an amusement park. He's unlikely to ride
the best ride in the park, the tallest rollercoaster,

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.030
over and over and over, the entire day.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.939
Why? Well even if there's a one-time park
admission fee and the rollercoaster is free,

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:37.249
there's still a cost - that's how long he
has to wait in line.

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:42.689
So Stan estimates his marginal utility of
riding the ride and compares that to the wait.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.640
Riding the best rollercoaster might give him
the highest utility of all the rides in the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.579
park but it might not be worth waiting in
a four-hour line.

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.420
A smaller ride gives him less utility but
if the line is super short, he'll choose that

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.719
one instead. Even if there's no line for the
large super-awesome rollercoaster, he probably

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.359
won't ride it all day because eventually it
gets old.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.480
Marginal analysis explains the behaviour of
consumers like Stan, but it also explains

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.319
the pricing strategies of businesses.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.780
Assume instead that the rollercoaster charges
$5 for each ride. Because Stan gets less and

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.810
less utility each time, he might not be willing
to pay full price for the third ride

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.200
The seller gets this, and figures it might
be better to charge Stan less for the third

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.130
ride. That's why we have deals like 'Buy two
and get the third half off'. The point is

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.590
we all use marginal analysis when we make
decisions.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.450
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So that's marginal
analysis. Armed with our new knowledge, let's

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.210
go back and look at the most important model
in microeconomics: supply and demand, on the runway.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.520
Let's use the market for strawberries. Remember,
the price of strawberries is on the vertical

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.060
axis, and quantity is on the horizontal axis.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.750
The demand curve for strawberries is downward
sloping,showing the Law of Demand. When prices

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.980
are high, people don't wanna buy very many,
and when prices are low, people want to buy a lot.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.340
The shape of the demand curve reflects the
idea of the law of diminishing marginal utility.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.000
The first pint of strawberries you buy give
you a lot of additional utility.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.500
The second one, maybe not as much. And the
third pint, even less. If you eat ten pints,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.900
you're gonna get sick. So, as you consume
more, you're willing to pay less and less.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.560
This explains why the demand curve is downward
sloping and why it's really just a marginal benefit curve.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.160
The supply curve is upward sloping representing
the Law of supply an increase in price gives

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.550
producers an incentive to produce more.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.250
It turns out that supply curves are really
just marginal cost curves. It represents the

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.950
additional amount of resources and energy
that each additional pint of strawberries

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.120
costs. This graph explains why markets tend
to be so efficient with ours scarce resources.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.610
If strawberry producers produced too few strawberries,
the marginal benefit of the last unit will

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.850
be greater than the marginal cost. That's
the market calling out for more strawberries:

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.730
"Give us strawberries, please!"

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.750
If they produce too much, out here, then the
marginal cost would be greater than the marginal

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.790
benefit, they'd be wasting resources on things
that consumers don't value.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.170
Equilibrium is efficient because the marginal
benefit of the last unit consumed equals the

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.290
marginal cost of that unit. The market is
making the exact amount that consumers want.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.260
This is reminiscent of an example Adam Smith
used. Why are diamond more expensive than

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.840
water? Water is absolutely crucial for keeping us alive,
while diamonds do nothing except sparkle. But

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:29.020
the price of a bottle of life-giving water is around a buck
twenty and that's when you're overpaying for water.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.040
The average one-carat diamond is well over
$3,000. This is called the Diamond Water Paradox,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.740
and it can be explained with marginal analysis
and the law of diminishing utility.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.300
The total utility we get from water is VERY
high, but since it's so plentiful for most

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.400
people, the marginal utility is really low.
If you can stay hydrated, cook, take showers,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.770
wash your clothes and occasionally use your
slip 'n' slide, then the additional satisfaction

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.380
of yet another gallon of water is small. The
result is a lower price.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.050
On the other hand, diamonds are extremely
scarce because they have to be extracted from

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.610
expensive, dangerous, mines. Since there are
relatively few diamonds, the additional satisfaction

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.360
of another one is relatively high, so people
are willing to pay a higher price.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.660
If diamonds fell out of the sky like water,
we wouldn't get that much additional satisfaction

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.190
from them, and the price would be low. It
might seem irrational that society values

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.250
diamonds more than water, but using marginal
analysis, it sort of makes sense.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.540
Relative scarcity does contribute to a product's
value - that's partially why Action Comics

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.630
number one, the first comic book with Superman
recently sold for over for over £3m on eBay,

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.120
but just because something is limited doesn't
automatically make it valuable.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.770
There are plenty of other things that are
scarce that we don't value as much as diamonds.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.470
For example, panda boogers. They're super-rare,
but we don't put them on engagement rings

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.000
or pay an outrageous price for one in mint
condition.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.560
The point is, utility is subjective, and demand
depends on the tastes and preferences of consumers.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.480
That's why there's no market for panda boogers.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.440
Hold on, Stan tells me that, because the internet,
there does seem to be a market for panda boogers.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.200
But it's gotta be a small one. I think the
example still holds up.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.430
Anyway, the demand also depends on the number
of substitutes. For example, strawberries

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.060
have plenty of substitute goods - cherries,
raspberries, blueberries. When the price goes

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.710
up for strawberries, consumers buy less because
they'll go buy something else instead.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:24.060
This is a substitution effect and along with the law
of diminishing marginal utility, it helped shape the demand curve.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.060
Let’s see what this looks like in the real
world. Have you ever wondered why gas stations

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:34.050
don’t have sales? It has to do with substitutes
and what economists call elasticity of demand.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:39.599
Elasticity shows how sensitive quantity is
to a change in price, when the price of gas

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.980
goes up people don’t buy that much less gas because
they need it and there are few close substitutes.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.170
Now you can walk, or ride your bike, or get
an electric car but there is nothing else

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:54.610
you can put in your current gas guzzler, this
goes the other direction too, if gas stations

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.320
had sales, consumers wouldn’t buy that much
more gas. Economists would say that the demand

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.940
for gasoline is relatively inelastic: a large
percent change in price leads to a small percent

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.960
change in the quantity demanded.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.280
This is shown on the graph by making the demand
curve steeper, other products that have that

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.800
have relatively inelastic demand include electricity,
healthcare and coffee, there’s no substitute

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.280
for my five cups of coffee in the morning.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.070
And there are few products that have perfectly
inelastic demand, if the price goes up people

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:31.000
who can afford it will always buy the same
amount, an example is insulin for diabetics

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.340
because in that case they need it to live.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.440
What about the demand for pizza? Well there
are many close substitutes, I could eat a

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:42.830
burrito or a burger, I don’t really need
pizza. So a small increase in the price could

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:49.070
cause the price to decrease a lot, for pizza
the demand curve would be more flat, showing

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:54.900
the demand for pizza is relatively elastic.
If a pizza place has a sale a lot of customers

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.170
would buy pizza instead of other substitutes
like burgers and burritos.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.890
Now there’s also elasticity of supply. A
steep curve shows the supply is relatively

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:07.000
inelastic, so a large change in price, leads
to a small change in quantity. Like an airplane

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.820
is difficult and time consuming to build,
so even if a buyers willing to pay more for

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.870
one, they’re still going to have to wait.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.380
Relatively elastic supply is when quantity
is sensitive to a change in price because

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.310
producers can respond quickly, stuff like
t-shirts and strawberries. Something like

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.150
the supply of Vincent Van Gogh paintings,
well that’s perfectly inelastic because

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.230
when the price goes up, the quantity doesn’t
change. It doesn’t matter if people want

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.890
more, Van Gogh is not going to be doing anymore
paintings.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:36.460
So that’s microeconomics in a nutshell,
it doesn’t focus on GDP or on unemployment,

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.310
it analyses the details. It’s helpful to
understand concepts like marginal analysis

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.779
and elasticity. You’re going to be using
them to make decisions anyways so you might

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:50.150
as well understand what’s going on. Ideally
that’ll help you make better decisions.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.640
We hope the additional benefits of watching
this video was greater than the additional

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.890
cost. I’d say it was at least 50 utils for
me.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.330
And not that it’s a util contest but I’d
say 55 utils. See you next week

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:05.290
Crash Course Economics made by the help of
all these nice people. If you’re still watching

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:10.090
the credits, your demand for this video is
just about to outstrip the supply, but you

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:15.060
can create more supply when you support Crash
Course at Patreon, you’ll help keep Crash

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.400
Course free for everyone, forever and get
great rewards. Thanks for watching and I hope

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.340
you got some utils out of this.
