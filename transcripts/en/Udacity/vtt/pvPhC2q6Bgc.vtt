00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Whoa, that was really weird.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.822
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was awesome, except that
I noticed that I've come back and

00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:11.430
it looks like your handwriting not mine.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.110
&gt;&gt; Yes indeed.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.962
And in fact, since control
has come back to me anyway,

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:18.390
maybe I can add a little bit to
that lesson that we just watched.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.690
&gt;&gt; What could you possibly add?

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.750
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.830
I was thinking about saying a little
bit more about the Bellman Equation.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.660
And how it relates to
reinforcement learning.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.950
&gt;&gt; Okay, that seems reasonable.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.950
&gt;&gt; Because, ultimately, we're going
to have to connect these things up.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.920
&gt;&gt; Seems fair, looking forward to it.
