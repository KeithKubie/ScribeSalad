00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.760
So it's probably not obvious why this
would be true, but this is the thing

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.860
that we're claiming, and I want to at
least make it clear what we're claiming.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.270
The claim is that any value function at
any given step of value iteration can be

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.990
represented finitely as just a maximum
over a bunch of linear functions.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.450
Each linear function can handle
an infinite number of inputs.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.330
Right?
And that is not so

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.080
surprising if a linear
functions can do that.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.970
But what is cool is we don't actually
have to represent the value for

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.270
each possible belief state b.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.259
Instead, we just throw all these linear
functions into a bag, gamma sub t.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.220
And then when we want
to know the value for

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.320
a given belief state b, we compute
all the linear function values and

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.350
just take whichever one is
the highest at that point.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.930
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.270
I mean I guess that that
makes sense in the abstract.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.310
I guess the only thing that I don't yet
get is exactly where gamma comes from.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.880
&gt;&gt; Yes,
that's what we have to step through.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.640
And that is not at all obvious,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.600
I think, but it is very
elegant that it all works out.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.800
And this was originally shown
by a fellow named Sondik and

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.660
once you see it, it's maybe not so

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.440
hard to see, but I don't know how
he got here in the first place.

00:01:05.558 --> 00:01:08.510
&gt;&gt; It's, to me,
not all readily apparent, but

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.760
once you see things this way,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.980
it gives you a very powerful way to work
with these infinite-sized state spaces.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.770
You just have to take operations
on bags of vectors and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.750
so it ends up all being finite.
