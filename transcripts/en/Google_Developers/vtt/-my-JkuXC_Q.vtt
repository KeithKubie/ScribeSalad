TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.803
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.803 --> 00:00:08.050
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.750
We recently released the final
SDK for Android Wear 2.0.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.410
This release has added support
for new hardware features,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.720
material design for
Android Wear, watch face

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.430
complications, and more.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.130
All the details are on the
post, linked in the description

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.030
below.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.030
We also released Developer
Preview 2 for Android Things,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.330
bringing new features and
bug fixes to the platform.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.460
A summary of changes
and links to the code

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.950
are on the post,
where you'll also

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.680
find a really cool sample that
shows how to use TensorFlow

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.340
on Android Things devices,
using an early access TensorFlow

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.790
inference library
pre-built for Arm and X86.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.680
It demonstrates
accessing the camera,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.830
performing object recognition
and image classification,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.460
and speaking out the results
using text to speech.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.070
TensorFlow Fold makes it easy
to implement deep learning

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.850
models that operate over data
of varying size and structure.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.280
It also brings the benefits
of batching to such models,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.490
resulting in a speedup
of more than 10x on CPU,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.110
and more than 100x on GPU over
alternative implementations.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.530
Links to the paper and
GitHub are on the post.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.020
Google Cloud Endpoints is a
fast, scalable API gateway,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.110
and is now generally available.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.360
It features a server
local proxy and is

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.940
built on the same services
that Google uses to power

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.380
its own APIs.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.270
More details and
links to get started

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.400

the description below.
