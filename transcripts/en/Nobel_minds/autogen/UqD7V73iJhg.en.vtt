you know you have to be prepared for the
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.340
you know you have to be prepared for the
kind of events in your research that

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350
kind of events in your research that
 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.890
kind of events in your research that
there's not really predictable and you

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900
there's not really predictable and you
 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.550
there's not really predictable and you
have to be pretty resilient to

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560
have to be pretty resilient to
 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.730
have to be pretty resilient to
unexpected things happening and also

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740
unexpected things happening and also
 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.770

of be creative and recognize that there

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600
of be creative and recognize that there
 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.840
of be creative and recognize that there
are things that you can do that maybe

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
are things that you can do that maybe
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.180

weren't what your initial hypothesis in

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190
weren't what your initial hypothesis in
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.760
weren't what your initial hypothesis in
your research would you know that said

your research would you know that said
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.900

you also have to be rather persistent in

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910
you also have to be rather persistent in
 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.780
you also have to be rather persistent in
pushing through the research because

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790
pushing through the research because
 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.250
pushing through the research because
often the answers won't come right away

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
often the answers won't come right away
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.460
