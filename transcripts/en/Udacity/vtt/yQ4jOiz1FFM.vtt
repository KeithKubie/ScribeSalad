00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.159
You know what I'm a big fan of? Atom-atons, you know, self-thinking robots

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.519
running around doing chores and all that stuff. Of course, if they have the

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:08.776
ability to think for themselves, they're probably going to get into some

00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:12.444
trouble? Nah, we'll worry about that later. Anyhow, entities are a fantastic

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:15.612
concept, attaching logic to units is the backbone about how your simulation is

00:00:15.612 --> 00:00:20.336
going to exist. Now, don't get too far down the rabbit hole here, entities

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:24.590
bridge the line between design and code. So, at every step of the way, when you

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.406
add features, you're going to have to negotiate between how much of the control

00:00:27.406 --> 00:00:31.634
is on the designer side and on the programmer side. So, make sure when you're

00:00:31.634 --> 00:00:34.230
designing your framework, keep both parties involved.
