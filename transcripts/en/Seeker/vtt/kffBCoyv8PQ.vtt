00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.740
Have you ever seen something move out of the
corner of your eye?

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.700
Ever heard something whispering from the walls?

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.830
Hear footsteps down the hallway when you were
home alone?

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.680
What if I told your house isn’t haunted,
it’s just moldy

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.190
Hey guys julia here for DNews

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.039
Fungi, like mushrooms and molds might be some
of my favorite kinds of organisms on this

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.039
planet.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.480
But these special eukaryotes can do some serious
damage, I mean more than just making your

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.000
toenails disgusting.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.280
Sometimes they can make people go a little
bananas.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.590
So you’re home alone and it’s one in the
morning.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.609
And you hear footsteps creeping down the hall.

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:34.609
Is it ghost?

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.690
Maybe the scientific explanation isn’t ectoplasm.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.059
Maybe it’s just a fungus.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.379
I mean there’s been more than a few cases
throughout history where fungus caused a paranormal

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.409
calamity.

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.010
Like one of the most famous and one of my
favorite stories from history.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.170
Once upon a time in a little town called Salem,
people started get scared.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.170
Very scared.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.239
The young girls in the village were acting
a little weird.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.019
They had seizures, visions, and so the most
logical thing at the time was to start pointing

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.050
fingers… at witches.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.740
After all was said and done, more than 200
people were accused and 20 were put to death.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.719
And some researchers think it was all because
of a little fungus.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.590
Specifically the species Claviceps purpurea.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.759
Or as it’s commonly called.

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:13.759
Ergot.

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.189
Ergot’s a nifty little fungus that grows
on rye -- a wheat-like cereal grain -- when

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.890
conditions are cold and damp.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.530
It's so nifty it might possibly be hallucinogenic,
it’s the source of lysergic acid; the thing

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.039
LSD is based off of.

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.670
Ergot contains certain alkaloids that can
react with serotonin receptors in the brain

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.579
producing those hallucinogenic effects LSD
is so famous for.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.080
but besides the fun effects, ergot rot on
wheat plants can get pretty nasty.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.009
It’s two main types of symptoms are gangrenous
(St.Anthony’s Fire) or convulsive (St.Vitus’

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.009
Dance).

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.710
Gangrenous is popularly called Saint Anthony’s
Fire, so named because of the effects on people’s

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.710
limbs.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.250
It makes them feel like they’re burning
and causes blisters on the skin.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.530
Eventually the limb can die and fall off at
the joints.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.399
Seriously... not a pretty sight.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.899
Convulsive ergotism is the belle of our ball
here, so Salem’s ball.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.939
If ingested, it’s poison can cause hallucinations
and convulsions, very similar symptoms to

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.240
what the girls in Salem experienced.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.910
The idea was first put forward in the journal
Science in 1976 by psychologist Linnda Caporael.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.410
She noticed that the girl’s symptoms closely
matched those of ergotism.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.300
In another analysis, historian Dr. Mary K.
Matossian came to the same conclusions.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.920
She told the New York Times that the Salem
Witch Trials “'may have been part of a largely

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.300
unrecognized American health problem.'”

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.160
Even 40 years later, it’s still the best
explanation we’ve got what occurred all

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.160
those years ago.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.250
So, knowing about ergot poisoning could explain
a lot of the unexplained still happening in

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.610
some parts of the world; perhaps it's just
a fungus growing in your home.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.950
Researchers from Clarkson University are hitting
the houses.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.560
They believe there might be a link between
old houses and hauntings, but not because

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.970
of the reason you might think.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.380
Not because someone died in there.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.040
But they’re investigating the possibility
that poor air ventilation and a few decades

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.880
of mold growth might make things go bump in
the night.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.060
Well they’ll make you think they did.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.240
Similar to how ergot effect the girls in Salem,
some other toxic molds commonly found in the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.880
house can cause similar symptoms.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.710
Lead researcher Dr. Shane Rogers Associate
Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering,

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.650
told DNews that “reported mental and physical
health symptoms and experiences of those exposed

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.230
to poor air quality, including molds; and
experiences, including physical and mental,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.240
reported in hauntings are strikingly similar”.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.700
And he even mentioned that there have been
other cases where toxic mold in homes drove

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.090
people mad.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.670
mentioned a case where a mass murder claimed
“god told him to do it”.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.540
But upon investigation of his home, they found
high levels of lysergic acid!

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.550
Which the investigators concluded were “contributing
factors” to his horrific acts.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.400
As for his current research, well…they ”have
been varied and interesting” with more than

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.860
a few “tense moments, anxious feelings,
or odd happenings that [they] could not find

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.530
easy answers to”.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.530
Because of mold?

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.640
Well more research is needed.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.480
So have you ever experienced something unexplained?

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.720
Maybe you knew something you couldn’t have
known.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.700
Did you ever wonder if it’s ESP?

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.560
Are you actually picking up on the paranormal?
or are you picking up on something else altogether?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:16.070
Anthony and Laci have the spooky scoop in
this episode 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:30.480
right here.
