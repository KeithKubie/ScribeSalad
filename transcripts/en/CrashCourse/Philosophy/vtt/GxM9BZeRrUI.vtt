00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.149
I bet you think you know a person when you
see one.

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:13.209
For example, I am a person, right?

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.189
But was I always a person?

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:17.920
Was Johann Strauss a person?
Or Freddie Mercury?

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.860
Are they still people?
What about a nine-month-old baby?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.670
What about a fetus?
Or Chewbacca? Or C3PO?

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.779
To philosophers, ‘personhood’ is a technical
term.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.980
‘Person’ doesn’t equal ‘human.’

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.580
“Human” is a biological term – you’re
human if you have human DNA. That’s it.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.739
But ‘person’ is a moral term.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.840
For a philosopher, persons are beings who
are part of our moral community.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.900
They deserve moral consideration.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.920
This distinction is really useful, but it
kinda complicates things.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.609
Because there might be non-humans that we
think deserve moral consideration.

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.920
And there might be some humans who don’t.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.229
But the determination of who’s a person
and who’s not, is tricky.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:01:00.849
And the slipperiness of what constitutes a person is at the core of almost every major social debate issue you can think of.

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:04.069
Abortion. The death penalty. Euthanasia.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:10.220
Whether your passion is human rights or robots, science or sociology, you have to get to the bottom of personhood.

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:20.720
[Theme Music]

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.840
We’re gonna do something a little different
today and head straight into the Thought Bubble.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.580
Because I think there’s some Flash Philosophy that’ll help us a lot when we start thinking about what constitutes a person.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.179
Is Superman a person?

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.320
I mean, if you encountered Superman on another planet, the question wouldn’t even cross your mind.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.860
The way he acts and talks certainly indicates
that he’s a person.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.249
But Supes definitely isn’t human – he’s
Kryptonian.

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:48.020
He lacks human DNA, and is affected by the sun and by kryptonite in a way that humans are not.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.679
So, calling him a human is incorrect.

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.739
But most of us would disagree with anyone
who wanted to deny him personhood.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.560
Superman’s non-humanity is one of the reasons Lex Luthor hates him. And part of why we hate Lex Luthor.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.480
Just because Superman happens to be from another planet doesn’t make him different in any moral way,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.600
just like skin color doesn’t make a moral
difference among humans.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.090
For the people who really know him – Lois
and Jimmy and Ma and Pa Kent –

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.799
there’s no question that Superman is a person.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.400
In fact, if anything, Superman might be more
of a person than Luthor is.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.320
Because Luthor is fueled by hatred and prejudice
and a lust for power.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.560
He’s less deserving of moral consideration
than Superman.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.440
So, if Superman is more of a person than Lex, then humanity definitely isn’t what makes someone a person.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.040
So, yeah. Is Thought Bubble a person?
Bye-bye, Thought Bubble!

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.439
Now, there are plenty of candidates for non-human
persons.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.060
Aliens like Superman, as well as artificial intelligences like WALL-E, or Samantha from the movie Her.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.820
Many people think some non-human animals are persons too – great apes like Koko are a good example.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.220
But is it possible to be human, yet not a
person?

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.000
Some people believe that fetuses, though clearly
human, are not yet persons.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.560
Others think that bodies in persistent vegetative
states,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.140
or that have experienced a complete and irreversible loss of brain function, are no longer persons, either.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.280
Still others argue that a human can surrender his or her personhood through grossly inhumane actions, like rape or murder.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.519
Many careful thinkers disagree about what
personhood really is – where it starts and stops –

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.739
which explains why we disagree about abortion,
and euthanasia, and capital punishment.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.820
And I’m sure no one in the comments will
be shouting their opinions on the matter at all.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.860
But it seems to come down to this question:

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.280
What must one possess to be part of our moral
community, to be deserving of our moral consideration?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.250
A contemporary American legal scholar named
John Noonan gives us one option

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.370
– he calls it the genetic criterion.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.610
This view says you are a person if you have human DNA, and you are not a person if you don’t.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.660
The virtue of this view is its simplicity. But its implications are so problematic that most philosophers dismiss it.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.780
If all you need to be a person is human DNA, then like my mouth cells are persons. And so are corpses.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.100
None of our favorite androids – or aliens,
like Superman – meet the genetic criterion,

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.750
even though they seem more like persons than,
like, you know some of my cells.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.140
But American philosopher Mary Ann Warren offers five, more specific criteria that she believes, together, constitute personhood:

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.630
Consciousness, reasoning, self-motivated activity,
capacity to communicate, and self-awareness.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.240
These five factors are known as the cognitive
criteria for personhood.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.530
Warren argues that some humans just aren’t
persons, either not yet, or not anymore.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.050
In her view, if a being is incapable of communicating,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.230
isn’t aware of itself as a self, can’t
think, or move around on its own,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.540
or isn’t conscious, then she says that’s not a being that we call a person, even if it happens to have human DNA.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.600
Now you might have noticed that Warren’s
criteria definitely rules out fetuses.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.760
But it also kind of rules out young children. Kids don’t become self-aware until at least 18 months.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.580
So, Noonan’s criterion seems to allow some obvious non-persons into its definition, like the cells in my spit,

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.920
but Warren’s criteria may kick out of the personhood club some beings that to you, are clearly people.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.280
Then maybe you’d find the social criterion
more palatable.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.900
This view says that you’re a person whenever
society recognizes you as a person,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.900
or whenever someone cares about you.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.560
This one seems pretty intuitive. It says that
you matter, morally, when you matter to someone.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.220
It allows for society’s understanding of
a person to change over time,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.140
which seems good when we’re thinking about something like expanding rights to protect primates, for example.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.180
However, if you think carefully about this
view, it also means that,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.630
if no one happens to care for a particular
being, that being simply isn’t a person.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.660
It would mean that fully rational, healthy, functioning adult human beings might not have personhood –

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.020
just because no one happens to care about
them.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.800
And we probably want inclusion in our moral community to be something more than a popularity contest.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.360
So, then there’s contemporary Australian
moral philosopher Peter Singer,

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.690
who says that the key to personhood is sentience,
the ability to feel pleasure and pain.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:58.470
This criterion ignores the whole idea of species altogether, and instead looks at a being’s capacity to suffer.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.800
This view says it’s wrong to cause unnecessary
pain to anything that can feel,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.900
but if it can’t feel, well, we do no harm by excluding it from the group of beings that matter.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.060
So, fetuses younger than at least 23 weeks are not persons, nor are humans in persistent vegetative states.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.420
But any animal with a developed central nervous
system is a person.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.720
Now, some people think that personhood is
a right,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.440
a sort of ticket to the moral community that you forfeit when you violate the laws of society in a major way.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.100
In this view, you can surrender your own personhood
through grossly inhumane actions.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.460
This line of reasoning is one way that people
justify capital punishment.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.430
Yes, killing people is wrong, they might say,

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.900
but if a criminal has surrendered their personhood
through their actions,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.770
then they’re no longer a person anymore.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.960
So we, as members of the State, would think
ourselves justified in killing them.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.780
Now, so far we’ve been talking about personhood like it’s a toggle switch – you have it or you don’t.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.940
But a more nuanced option is the gradient theory of personhood, which says it’s not all or nothing

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.680
– it’s more like a dimmer switch.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.620
So, personhood comes in degrees, and you can
have more or less of it.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.260
In this view, a fetus would slowly grow in personhood throughout pregnancy, as cognition develops.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.050
So a 26-week old fetus would have less personhood
than a 34-week old fetus,

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.200
which would have less personhood than a newborn baby, who would have less personhood than a toddler.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.800
And likewise, personhood can be lost as gradually
as it can be gained.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.650
A lot of people think this is a reasonable
way to look at the issue.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.280
For instance, you might think a fetus has some degree of personhood, and so deserves moral consideration.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.020
But when the fetus is compared with its mother – a being with far more personhood, by this logic –

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.540
then the interests of the being with more
personhood gets more weight.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.340
So, this doesn’t deny the personhood of either being, but it allows that some beings have more personhood than others.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.140
This stuff is hard to talk about. But that’s why we’re talking about it. Because it merits your attention.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.460
Not only does it matter now, as we’re studying
the concept of personhood for its own sake,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.900
but the answers you give to these questions are going to be important later, when we’re studying ethics.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.280
So give it a good long think and try to figure
out what you believe constitutes personhood.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.200
As you consider the factors that you think are most important, be careful how you cast your net.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.960
Make sure you include everyone you think should be included and exclude those you think should be excluded.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.340
It’s harder than you might think.
Good luck.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.340
Today we talked about personhood.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.700
We considered several criteria – genetic, cognitive, social, sentience, and the gradient theory –

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.280
for determining what constitutes personhood.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.680
And we explored how the definition of personhood
informs some important social debates.
