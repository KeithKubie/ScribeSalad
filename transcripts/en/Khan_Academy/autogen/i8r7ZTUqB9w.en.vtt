00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.369
 The number is 357. 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.806
 The figure 3 is in the order of the hundreds. 

00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:07.726
 So it presents 3 hundreds: 

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:10.478
 1 hundred, 2 hundred, 3 hundred. 

00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:14.553
 3 hundreds here, 

00:00:14.553 --> 00:00:16.500
 they are represented by this 3, 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.120
 because it is in the order of the hundreds. 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.227
 Let me write this. These are the hundreds. 

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:25.826
 Then we have 5 in the order of the decimal. 

00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:31.294
 So it presents 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 tens. 

00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:33.396
 5 tenths. 

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:36.176
 Finally, we have ... 

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:38.922
 In the order of the units we have 7. 

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.756
 So it presents 7 units: 

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:45.372
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, seven units. 

00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:49.920
 Now we want to get 251, 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.540
 or we want to get 2 hundred, 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.150
 5 tenths and 1 unit. 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.667
 Now stop the video and think 

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.797
 how much it will get. 

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:00.508
 Let us decide together. 

00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:02.542
 Let's first look at the units. 

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:04.533
 We start with these 7 units 

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.937
 in 3 hundred, 5 tens and 7 units. 

00:01:06.937 --> 00:01:09.183
 357. Seven units. 

00:01:09.183 --> 00:01:12.472
 And we'll get out 

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.225
 1 unit right here. 

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:15.669
 Let her color it in a different color. 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.700
 So we'll get 1 unit. 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.650
 We scratch 1 unit. 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.439
 And then we will have 6 units. 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.582
 Now look at the dozens. 

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:30.881
 We start with 5 tens, 

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:33.575
 but we will pull out, 

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:35.736
 we'll pull out five tenths. 

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:38.424
 So to cross 1 dozen, 2 decades, 

00:01:38.424 --> 00:01:40.877
 3 tens, 4 tens, 5 tens. 

00:01:40.877 --> 00:01:42.604
 We scratched all the tens. 

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:47.533
 So now we have 0 tenths. 

00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:52.777
 We started with 3 hundred, 

00:01:53.427 --> 00:01:56.170
 but we want to get 2 of them. 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.213
 We want to get 2 of the hundreds. 

00:01:58.213 --> 00:01:59.533
 Let's do it, let's scratch 

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:01.738
 1 hundred and 2 hundred. 

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:02.929
 And we will only remain 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.400
 this hundred right here. 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.460
 We'll have 1 hundred. 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.820
 3 hundreds minus 2 hundreds 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.638
 is equal to 1 hundred. 

00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:12.842
 I hope you understand now that, 

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:14.982
 what happens depends on the order. 

00:02:14.982 --> 00:02:17.860
 You can just say, "Oh, I'll align the numbers, 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.821
 I will look at the places in the different rows. 

00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:21.841
 So here I have 7 minus 1 is 6, 

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.431
 5 minus 5 is 0, 

00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:25.601
 3 minus 2 is 1. " 

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:27.873
 But I want you to really understand what's going on. 

00:02:27.873 --> 00:02:30.597
 This is 7 units minus 1 unit, 

00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:33.268
 and is equal to 6 units; 

00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:35.858
 this is 5 tenths minus 5 tens, 

00:02:35.858 --> 00:02:39.420
 there will be no tenths, there are 0 tenths, 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.971
 and 3 hundreds, 3 groups of 100 

00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:45.273
 minus 2 groups of 100 will remain us 

00:02:45.273 --> 00:02:48.304
 only 1 group of 100. 

00:02:48.304 --> 00:02:50.802
 So we'll get 106: 

00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:56.770
 1 hundred, 0 tenths and 6 units.
