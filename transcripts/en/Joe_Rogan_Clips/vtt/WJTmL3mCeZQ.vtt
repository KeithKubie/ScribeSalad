1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
First Time,
you know,

2
00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:05.640
I was just standing and out and I had no idea what was going on.
And,
and then,

3
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:06.120
uh,

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.010
I really didn't come back to a cause I did a show in Newport beach.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.820
It's a laugh stop out there and just got this horrifically horrible reviewed

6
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.900
that I tell this story.
Last time I was,
it was so bad how bad

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.890
it was a picture of me.

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.120
I'd only been saved with stand up for my three and a half years.
And then,

9
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.210
and so then the guy that booked that room watching me do it like an eight minute

10
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:37.080
set in Austin and I had a killer eight minutes,

11
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:40.990
but he hires me to do 45 minutes and uh,

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.020
in,
so I go out there and,
and I'm nervous anyway,
right?

13
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:49.920
Because it's an,
that's a big club.
And,
uh,

14
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.330
and the two guys before me were a Seinfeld in Slayton,

15
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.850
so,
right.
So,

16
00:00:55.851 --> 00:01:00.690
and then Ron White's three and a half year old booger eating moron thing and,

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.740
and uh,
so,
and,

18
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:07.080
and at this point I don't realize how bad I am because they haven't read it yet.

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.140
And,
uh,
so before I'm nervous and they got to go with that.

20
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:15.840
That's done.
And Strauss and,
uh,
and he writes a,

21
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.680
the comedy reviews for the Orange County addition to the La Times,

22
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:24.060
which is about 6 million people.
And,
uh,
I'm like,

23
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.060
oh,
I,
well,

24
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.420
I wish he'd have given me a day or two to settle in.
And so,
so

25
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.720
I do the set and it's not great and it's a,

26
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.860
but it's not bad,
you know,
I think I pulled it off,
you know,
they laughed at it.

27
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.100
They laughed at what I'd put together and whatever it was,

28
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.240
and I expected him to be there to congratulate me on the,

29
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.620
on how good the,
uh,

30
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.010
set was and shake my hand and do a little interview to build this great

31
00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:02.340
interview.
So buddy wasn't there.
And I'm like,
oh,
okay.

32
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.450
Well then that next night there's like an a little open mic night before me.

33
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:10.550
So there's a,
in one of the guys I know Steve Apps from,
uh,
uh,

34
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.760
taxes on that.

35
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.040
And then that night I fucking kill and I'm really drunk and you know,

36
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.300
and I'm giving advice to other comedians you know about,

37
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.440
cause I made my ego's just flare and I'm like,

38
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:29.700
I'm probably gonna leave my wife and go find that girl and the to beer posters.

39
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.920
And uh,
they,
you know,
it's amazing and uh,

40
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.810
people are patting me on the bag on here,
man you are really,

41
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:38.430
really good at is amazing.

42
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.810
And I am so I'm staying at the Marriott suites hotel in the bay,

43
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.950
which is a nice hotel I've ever stayed in.
And a,

44
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.160
you had to pay for part of it yourself.
But that was all I had.
I was making,

45
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.230
I didn't met,
never made that much money before.
He was like 14 or $1,500 and,

46
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.820
and uh,
for week and,
and uh,
so it's,
it's,

47
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.810
it's unbelievably beautiful with a gorgeous view.

48
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.830
Found bathroom to bathroom,

49
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.690
big marble Everytime big not stuff.
And uh,

50
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.290
I go back after that.
Well the,

51
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.320
now the review comes out the next morning and I've got this massive hangover.

52
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.630
I'm just so sick,
drunk,
waking up,
going out,

53
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.430
Jesus Christ.
And I says,
I blink my eyes and start going,

54
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.220
oh,
the review,
the glorious review,

55
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.620
the review of this gotta be touting my praises to the masses,
all over the,

56
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.850
this area of a southern California.

57
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.300
Probably the beginning to my hugeness and,
uh,

58
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.720
probably is what's going to happen.

59
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.350
So it turns out I had bought a bag of popcorn when I was drunk and I've followed

60
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:02.590
that bag,
that popcorn trail from my bed out the

61
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.650
door,
down the hall into the elevator.
The elevator I got on,

62
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.130
had popcorn on it.
So it was the same one I came up and I was just drunk,

63
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:15.160
staggering around with a popcorn bag.
And I followed that.

64
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:19.240
Now this place is just right down the block from the,
from the club.

65
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.770
And when I go to a,
when I'm playing at a club,
I'll,
I hang out at the club a lot,

66
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.110
you know,
cause that's,
I just,
those are the people I know.
Anyway,

67
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.720
those have been my friends forever,
so,
and they're still my friends,
you know,

68
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:30.880
I loved the,
so these are the people that work there.

69
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.660
So I walk in the door and,
uh,

70
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:38.050
one of the girls that worked there and looked at me and she goes,
don't read it.

71
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.080
And I'm like,
what?
He goes,
don't read it Ron.
It's not true.
It isn't true.

72
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.380
And,
uh,
it's a hatchet job.
I'm like,

73
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.260
what a hatchet job.

74
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.320
So I'm like,
no,
give it to me.
I can read it.
Got,

75
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.200
you know,
how bad could it be?
So

76
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.200
there's a big picture of me,

77
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.940
this big 6 million people this big.
It was,

78
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.110
the article was this big,

79
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:11.710
it was a quarter of a page and it said in big black print,

80
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.010
even when whites not blue,
he's not funny.

81
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.310
And I dropped the newspaper on the floor.
I couldn't hold up a,

82
00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:24.070
a one ounce newspaper because the life is sucked out of me.

83
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.550
And I also agreed with them and felt like I had just been found out as a phony

84
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.680
and I was a phony and I didn't belong here at all.
And,

85
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:40.390
uh,
and I picked it up and read it and uh,
and it said,

86
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.230
watch and why it's 41 minute show.
So they were nice enough to point out,

87
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:48.520
I didn't,
I just had to,
I had to scrape and crawl to get to 41 much less.

88
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:52.240
The 45 I had agreed to,
they pointed that out with,

89
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.360
was like watching a polar bear lumber around on stage and something comical or

90
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:02.840
interesting happening only occasionally.
Now,

91
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.980
here's why I'm,
I can quote that

92
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.580
all these 29 years later,

93
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.580
I went across the street to the liquor store and bought a bottle of Tequila and

94
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:19.070
a pack of razor blades through story.

95
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.120
And I go back up to my Marriot suites on the bay and a set,

96
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:28.430
they're this big desk and I've just drinking this Tequila,

97
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:31.190
reading it over and over and over and over.

98
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.730
And I got a big bag of weed and I'm smoking pot and I've convinced myself that

99
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:41.240
they're going to cancel the show because who would come to a show,

100
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.030
right?
With the review like that.
And,

101
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:49.220
uh,
and then I'm thinking,
well,

102
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:53.330
they probably have to pay me for the shows I did even,
you know,

103
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.960
even though I wasn't able to finish the week,
right.
So I,
I just,

104
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.190
I just assume I'm fired.
A genuinely believed that in my heart that I'm fired.

105
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.930
And,
uh,

106
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.490
so w I wake up from the stupor and I got a Drupal stain on his fucking article

107
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:13.670
and I have a joint in biology.

108
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.250
I mean it's dismal shit,
right?
It's dark,
dark time.

109
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.900
And I walked down there,
fuck the show sold out.
Both of them are,

110
00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:27.190
it's comedy and fucking 1990,
[inaudible] 89 or 90,

111
00:07:27.191 --> 00:07:29.780
whatever it was.
And you know,
all the gloves were sold out.

112
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.260
Nobody gave a fuck about that fucking review.
And uh,
they,

113
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.530
they give a shit.
And I then I went on stage because I was still a recto.

114
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.510
I'm drunk,
I just woke up.
I'm not very good anyway.

115
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:45.520
I have no confidence whatsoever.

116
00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:49.180
I totally agree that I suck and I'm not worth a goddamn thing.

117
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.720
And I go up there and have the worst set I've ever had a sold out house and it

118
00:07:55.181 --> 00:07:59.560
was just sucked.
It just sucked.
It was horrible.
And,
uh,

119
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.820
and then the guy that booked me calls the club and they go,
he goes,
yeah,

120
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.820
cause he read the fucking article and he goes,
that's gotta be a Gut Punch.

121
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.630
I mean,
it was a long,
there was other shit in it too,
and none.
It was good.
And,
uh,

122
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.220
so then,
uh,
they,
they get me on the phone with him and then they get,

123
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.770
cause they asked them,
they said,
we just want to see if he's okay.

124
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:22.550
And they're like,
oh no,
he's not okay.
He's not okay at all.
I'm like,

125
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.570
I'm really now,
I'm now,
I'm calling my wife going,

126
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.860
I just want to talk to you cause I love you so much.

127
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.620
I'm not even thinking about the Ducati beer pong through anymore.

128
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:34.610
I'm just calling her.
I just love you.
I want to be together forever.

129
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:36.620
And she's like,
kind of standoffish.
And I'm like,

130
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.610
like she could tell I had a bad review.
Hmm.
So that,

131
00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:46.300
uh,
that kind of scared me away from,
uh,
La for awhile.

132
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.760
And I realized then that they were right and I should have been slapped in the

133
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:52.700
face and I wasn't good enough to be on that stage.
I was not.

134
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.730
And that guy actually apologized to me one time cause I was showing him later in

135
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:59.790
lab and I'm like,
no dude,
you were totally right.
You are completely right.

136
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:02.190
I should've been slapped into fucking fast three years in,

137
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:06.900
you're just getting your legs.
No,
he didn't.
He had no business there.
And uh,

138
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:09.750
and so,
you know,
and it all worked out the,
you know,

139
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:11.490
the best way it possibly could have in that.

140
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:16.050
But that also included a couple slaps in the fucking face going,
you're,
you know,

141
00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:16.640
you're not thinking

142
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.630
<v 1>those are important.
I really do.
I think in the,
in the moment those feel bad,</v>

143
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.900
but every big leap I've made as a comic does after I bombed every big leap for

144
00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:30.110
real,
like the,
you know,
someone telling me they had a bad time,
my show,

145
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.450
I just felt like you were off.
I'm like,
fuck,

146
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.430
that feeling makes me so hungry to figure out how to do it right.

147
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.410
That's where,
where it comes from,
it makes you,
you know,
you,

148
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:43.640
you realize there's an urgency to this thing.
And then over the years,

149
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:48.620
part of the fear of bombing is what makes me work so hard on new shit.

150
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.980
Fraud are the fears.
What makes me do so many sets.

151
00:09:51.981 --> 00:09:56.330
I'll do two podcasts at night and then I'll do four shows.
I'll go to the store,

152
00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:59.990
I'll do the two at the show,
a store,
I'll do one or two at the Improv.

153
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.710
I might even go to the ice house or the,
ha ha,
I'll fuck around.
Yeah.

154
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.520
<v 0>These are all the reasons I'm not as good as Joe Rogan right here.
I get scared.</v>

155
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:13.100
Ron White.
I get scared.
Yeah.
You know,
I do too.
And I,
you know,
I,
I,
I,

156
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.520
well I can't,
I can't tell you at,
uh,
at 62 I do all those sets,

157
00:10:17.521 --> 00:10:18.620
but I can do,
I do what?

158
00:10:18.621 --> 00:10:22.830
Go out and do site and a lot of guys that are kind of in my,
you know,

159
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:26.220
in my age group really don't come out and do sets that much.

160
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.400
And I come out and do says,
Anna,
hang out.
You're ageless too.

161
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.360
<v 1>Think of you.
You know,
you said that one time,
uh,
in the back room.
You're like,</v>

162
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:38.300
I'm older than you guys.
And we were like,
we don't give a fuck.

163
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.010
That doesn't mean anything.
This,
this,
this,
this thing is about comedy.

164
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.570
It doesn't matter if you're a lesbian,
if you're trans,

165
00:10:47.571 --> 00:10:50.480
if you're from Philadelphia or the Philippines,

166
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.760
no one gives a fuck.
Are you funny?
If you're funny,

167
00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.150
that's all we care about.
We don't care if you're 90 or 19.
I mean,
I'm,

168
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.510
I'm not fucking Kowski is,
what is she 22 or some shit?

169
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.900
She might be 22.
She's one of my best friends.
I love that girl.

170
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:13.730
She's Goddamn hilarious.
She's kid.
We talk all the time.
We talked about comedy.

171
00:11:13.731 --> 00:11:17.900
We,
I have her,
she hosted my sets at the Improv all the time.
Nobody cares.

172
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.210
Nobody cares about your age.
They care about comedy.
