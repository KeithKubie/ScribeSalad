00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.620
(eerie music)

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.900
You're always so early. (snicker)

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.620
Great acceptance speech, by the way.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.050
(footsteps, eerie music continues)

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.590
(woman clears throat)

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.090
Oh.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.860
Thank you.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.260
- Before we dive into today's meeting,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.560
let's all take a moment to congratulate
Miss Nervosa on her award.

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.869
(applause)

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:35.689
Great, so now upstairs is very happy with the numbers,

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:39.769
but we are looking to increase consumers
by 20% over the next quarter.

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.038
Today's meeting is to brainstorm some
new strategies targeting the female demographic.

00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:45.798
We're all here to pitch potential tactics,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.601
and I expect everyone to participate in the discussion.

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:51.620
- Then why's SHE here?

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.513
(screams)

00:00:54.038 --> 00:00:55.845
Okay, who's first?

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.268
The oval face shape

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:02.267
is the ideal face shape.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.330
Chin fillings are a non-surgical procedure

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.416
where gel is injected into the chin
to elongate the face.

00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:10.388
Everyone can have the ideal.

00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:11.916
- Great work.

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:13.130
Next?

00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:17.676
Oh, come on.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.507
I know you've got something.

00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:21.477
I can feel it in my bones.

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:25.337
(laughter)

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:38.011
(screams)

00:01:38.676 --> 00:01:41.268
Investing in computer software technology.

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:44.359
Specifically, digital photograph alteration.

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.100
The industry will Photoshop women
to impossible standards,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.859
and, in turn, those women will be fed
an unrealistic image to strive for.

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.538
- Excellent.

00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:54.859
This is the way you ladies need to think.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.859
Her ideas fuel all of your departments.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:58.947
Next?

00:01:58.947 --> 00:02:00.867
I've been working closely
with schizophrenia,

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:03.730
And I really think we're working
on some good stuff!

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.600
I mean...

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.948
You know...

00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:07.731
And I hope you like my ideas.

00:02:08.207 --> 00:02:10.073
I hope...

00:02:10.073 --> 00:02:16.593
(suspenseful music)

00:02:16.598 --> 00:02:18.662
...You're a bitch.

00:02:18.662 --> 00:02:21.007
- Fantastic work today, ladies.

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:24.600
May I have a word with you?

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.951
- Of course.

00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:26.708
I'd, um...

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:30.221
I'd like to put my notice in.

00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:31.737
You're quitting?

00:02:31.737 --> 00:02:32.767
(gasps)

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:33.687
You're leaving?

00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:35.569
Did I do something?

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.983
You have the highest mortality rate
out of any of us!

00:02:38.983 --> 00:02:41.752
I'm sorry, but I've made my decision.

00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:42.326
I just...

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:45.298
I can't do it anymore.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:45.946
Do what?

00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:48.388
This.

00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:49.827
All of it.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.768
I can't perpetuate what I don't believe in.

00:02:53.768 --> 00:02:56.538
Let me tell you something about this company.

00:02:56.538 --> 00:02:59.844
There's a reason why we've been around for so long.

00:02:59.844 --> 00:03:01.977
With, or without you,

00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:05.916
There will be new afflictions that our
consumers will buy, if not innovate themselves.

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:09.343
So why not thrive off your talent?

00:03:09.343 --> 00:03:11.391
Don't blame yourself for what the market demands,.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.206
After all, the customer is always right.

00:03:14.206 --> 00:03:16.538
It--It doesn't bother you?

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:19.827
We sell...death.

00:03:20.798 --> 00:03:23.038
I saw one of them for the first time yesterday,

00:03:23.038 --> 00:03:23.736
and it was...

00:03:24.268 --> 00:03:25.327
she...was...

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.797
I do that to 24 million of them a year!

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.328
We're creating monsters...

00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:36.977
(laughs)

00:03:36.977 --> 00:03:38.916
You've got it all wrong...

00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:40.216
(dramatic music coming to a crescendo)

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.700
They created us.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:04:18.400
(eerie music playing while credits are shown)
