00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:04.304
MAN: Rained in a
little from this wall.

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.373
So I'd like to
build this wall in.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:08.141
I think I'm ready to go
chop down another tree.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:20.687
So found a widow maker.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.056
Usually I look around
my shelter and I'm like,

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.090
I don't see any branches.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.892
I remember doing this.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:28.261
For some reason,
I missed this guy

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:32.932
right here that is in direct
deadline to my shelter.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:36.669
And being in a storm, that
could have easily smashed me

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:39.672
and make me a widower.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.408
I don't know.

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:43.743
Kill me, dead.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:47.881
When I chop this, it could
land right in my shelter.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:52.118
Smart thing to do would
be to take off my tarp

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.686
and then try to
fell it after that

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.555
just to make sure that it's
not going to take my shelter.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.927
I'm not going to do that.

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:03.630
Wish me luck.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.697
Idiot!

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:05.832
I'm an idiot!

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.041
The most intimidating
thing about this location

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.177
is the weather.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:21.681
That crazy storm
concerned me a lot.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:22.582
It's just going to get worse.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.321
Right between the two trees.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.523
Good, good, good.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.892
I want something that
I feel comfortable in.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:35.395
I want something that I
don't have to worry about,

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.063
crazy storm comes in.

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.466
But you know, if the bear
starts pounding on it,

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.434
I want something that's
going to keep me safe.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:47.874
Here it goes.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:48.741
Oh crap.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.111
Ha!

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.985
And I was concerned.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.621
Ha!

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.591
Another tree's going to
fall right on my head.
