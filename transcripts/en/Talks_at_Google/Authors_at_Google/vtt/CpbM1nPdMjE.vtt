MATT BRITTIN: So let's give a
very warm Google welcome to

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.840
James Cracknell and Beverley
Turner, please.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.291
Welcome.

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.997
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.997 --> 00:00:12.330
MATT BRITTIN: Have a seat
on the comfy chairs--

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.250
BEVERLEY TURNER: Thank you.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.100
MATT BRITTIN: --here with us.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.715
So welcome to Google.

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:17.430
BEVERLEY TURNER: Thank you.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.790
MATT BRITTIN: And it's the
first time we've met.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.240
But James and I met a little bit
when I was crashing out of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.900
the bottom of the British
rowing team as he was

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.610
escalating his way up towards
a couple of gold medals.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.480
So it's very nice
to welcome you.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.480
BEVERLEY TURNER: We
want to work here.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.990
MATT BRITTIN: You want
to work here?

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.159
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.663
JAMES CRACKNELL: No, you
don't want to work.

00:00:32.663 --> 00:00:34.010
You just want to have
a [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.320
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.085
I don't want to work here.

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.190
I just want to have lunch here
and use the library and the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.800
gym and sleep in the library.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.686
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:41.670
BEVERLEY TURNER:
Obviously, no.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.014
MATT BRITTIN: Don't give
anybody ideas.

00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:44.990
That's not what we
want them to do.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.990
So maybe we could start the
conversation with--

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.110
and we'll give everybody
a chance to have a

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.930
chat with you as well.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.910
But we were just looking at some
video there, which was, I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.350
think, the beginning of James'
race across America, which is

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.670
when he had a bike accident.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.700
We'll talk about that as well.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.140
But Beverley, just tell us a
bit about what that was.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.210
What stage in your
life was that?

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.610
And what was James doing?

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.585
BEVERLEY TURNER: Funny enough,
James has never seen that.

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:12.730
So that was actually the first
he's ever seen that.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.390
I was actually giving birth the
day that transmitted on

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.840
television.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.560
So I vaguely remember
watching it.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.450
When he was actually
doing the trip in

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.560
America, it was July 2010.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.270
And it was a coast to coast
trip for the Discovery

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.203
Channel, could he be the
quickest man to go under his

00:01:32.203 --> 00:01:34.170
own steam using Olympic
disciplines, because it was

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.030
2012 as well.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.990
So running, cycling, rowing
and then swimming to the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.370
Statue of Liberty, that
was the plan.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.163
Anyway, he got as far as Arizona
and then ended up

00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:46.470
spending a month in hospital,
which was

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.230
definitely not the plan.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.280
JAMES CRACKNELL: Odd that
you should laugh

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.055
whilst saying that.

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:51.005
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:54.580
BEVERLEY TURNER: It's just
so ludicrous, really.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.050
So we're two and a half years
out from the accident.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.680
MATT BRITTIN: So two and
a half years later.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.360
And James, you were watching
that for the first time.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.910
You haven't seen that
footage before.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.050
Do you remember much of it?

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.570
Or how much do you
remember before?

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.630
JAMES CRACKNELL: I remember
that was the bit as it was

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.240
going into the round.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.480
I remember that stage of it.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.370
I remember actually right
up to where I

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.300
got hit by the truck.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.770
So we left from Santa Monica
Pier, which is the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.940
end of Route 66.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.280
So I got into Death Valley.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.790
And then I was running through
Death Valley, which is about

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.140
75, 80 miles, and then
back on the bike, up

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.590
Route 66 to Lake Erie.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.720
And then I was going
to row Lake Erie.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.650
And so I can remember the bit
of Death Valley was just--

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.440
I think, it's just been
re-awarded the hottest

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.590
temperature ever recorded
on earth.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.030
And it was 50 degrees.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.770
Even at night it
was 40 degrees.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.610
And I think it probably went on
to say that I consumed on

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.280
the run, which took about,
maybe, though 18, 20 hours,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.010
something like that--

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.230
MATT BRITTIN: So that was 18,
20 hours to run how far is

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.520
that, really?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.810
Is that three marathons?

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.285
JAMES CRACKNELL: I said between
75 and 80, I think.

00:03:07.285 --> 00:03:08.220
MATT BRITTIN: 80 miles?

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.970
BEVERLEY TURNER: It was three
back-to-back marathons.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.070
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.730
I wasn't [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.283
pacing it.

00:03:14.283 --> 00:03:14.490
MATT BRITTIN: OK.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.525
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:16.820
JAMES CRACKNELL: It was
more fairly steady.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.720
But still, I drank 35 liters
of fluid in that time and

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.990
still lost eight kilos.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.190
It's just so hot.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.780
And you get running past signs
that are minus 100 meters

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.550
below sea level.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.360
And don't stop, turn your
air conditioning off.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.110
Though I actually hadn't
any when I was running.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.170
But it is a pretty brutal
place, considering it's

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.480
developed country.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.120
BEVERLEY TURNER: Horrible.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.840
Horrible.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.900
I was actually there to watch
him finish the run stage,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.050
which is unusual, because any of
the trips that he normally

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.070
does are so remote that you
can't be there to give him a

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.270
hug, because he crossed the
finish line in the South Pole

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.250
or whatever it is.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.463
MATT BRITTIN: But this
was near Vegas.

00:03:59.463 --> 00:04:00.369
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:01.275
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:02.120
MATT BRITTIN: So this one--

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.090
BEVERLEY TURNER: You
spotted that one.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.210
I like that.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.470
Yeah.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.270
So I'd had a weekend in Vegas--

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.390
[LAUGHS]

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.176
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah.

00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:09.070
BEVERLEY TURNER: --and then
drove into Death Valley.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.430
But there's no mobile signal.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.930
It is appropriately named
Death Valley.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.290
It's brutal.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.870
It's a horrible environment
to be in.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.540
And James was at the peak
of his physical

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.420
fitness, I would say.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.060
I think, even as a rower for all
those years and having won

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.730
two Olympic gold medals, I think
he was at his physical

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.480
peak, actually, at--

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.814
what was that, 38 years old.

00:04:30.814 --> 00:04:31.682
About 38?

00:04:31.682 --> 00:04:32.116
Yeah.

00:04:32.116 --> 00:04:35.050
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah. as I
mentioned, I was piggy backing

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.960
of two guys who were
pretty good.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.475
So otherwise, you're running
on your own.

00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:39.380
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah, we're
not buying that.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.990
MATT BRITTIN: We'll come onto
what you've been doing

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.800
subsequently in a minute.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.250
But just fill in the blanks
a bit for me, James.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.340
So when I knew you, you were
sleeping on people's floors

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.261
and eating baked beans
out of a can and

00:04:51.261 --> 00:04:51.290
trying to break into--

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.410
BEVERLEY TURNER: Oh,
he still does that.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.460
MATT BRITTIN: --trying
to break into the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.380
British rowing team.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.680
You then had a couple of
Olympics which were

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.350
frustrating for you.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.210
And then you won a couple
of Olympic gold medals.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.120
And people will probably
know that about you.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.800
So just tell us a bit
about that you won

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.640
Olympic gold medals.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.230
And then you became this bold
adventurer type with that

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.750
slightly camp guy from the TV.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.462
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:05:14.462 --> 00:05:14.820
JAMES CRACKNELL: [LAUGHS]

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.170
MATT BRITTIN: So
what happened?

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.870
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.752
No, thanks.

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:20.340
That's a good snapshot of--

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.870
BEVERLEY TURNER: It's
your CV, right?

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.760
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.950
No.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.740
I think retiring from
sport is difficult.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.530
You only need to look at the
last five or six weeks as to

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.140
what's happened to people you
think should be happy who came

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.390
back for different reasons.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.240
Take Michael Schumacher.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.830
Why would someone come back
who'd won that match.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.870
And then not come back in the
team that could have given him

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.120
the opportunity to win.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.990
You take Ricky Hatton who
struggled after retiring and

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.030
didn't go out in the way he
wanted after fighting many

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.710
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.370
You take Freddie Flintoff.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.200
He didn't retire on his own
terms, because of injury and

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.040
not looking after it.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.460
So he went back into
the boxing ring.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.650
I think it is really hard to
retire and come to terms with

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.610
the decision.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.300
And a psychologist told me that
it takes you two years to

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.460
genuinely retire and not look
at sport in the same way and

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.760
think, oh, I wish
I could do that.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.440
And so I managed to not compete
for a year after the

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.970
Athens Olympics.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.260
And you get invited to
parties for about a

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.680
week after the Olympics.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.380
And then the invites go rrr.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.940
And I was at all these parties
when the slightly camp bloke

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.400
from the TV comes up--

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.230
I hope you're not watching
Google, Ben--

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.327
and said, I'm going
to do a rowing

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:52.200
race across the Atlantic.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.150
Do you want to do it with me?

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.000
I was like, can you row?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.010
He goes, no.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.960
I go, no, no, no.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.700
And then I realized that I
didn't have a goal for the

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.230
first time in a long time.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.610
And I thought about
it for a month.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.000
And I thought, actually, it
might be a really good

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.360
distraction.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.830
And it gave me time to think
about whether I wanted to row

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.340
in the Beijing Olympics
or not.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.230
MATT BRITTIN: So at that stage,
you were still thinking

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.630
you probably would?

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.680
JAMES CRACKNELL: I was thinking
because of that run

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.520
up to Athens with a whole
lot of injuries.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.950
And I went from a two-man boat
to the four-man boat.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.170
And as far as our first
race as the four-man

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.560
boat, was the Olympics.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.020
So I just wasn't ready to commit
to another four years

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.050
straightaway.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.130
And that's the real difference,
is this.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.460
MATT BRITTIN: By then, you
were already a couple.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:41.780
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.875
JAMES CRACKNELL: We had a
10-month-old little boy at

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:44.410
that stage.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.080
MATT BRITTIN: So you've seen
James go through the Olympics.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.300
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.020
MATT BRITTIN: And win the
second medal, yeah.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.690
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.300
I think the word you're looking
for is "supported"

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.366
James going through
the Olympics.

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:52.562
[LAUGHS]

00:07:52.562 --> 00:07:53.346
MATT BRITTIN: Supported.

00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:54.360
BEVERLEY TURNER: Not seen.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.950
MATT BRITTIN: OK.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.710
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.010
MATT BRITTIN: Tell us
more about that.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.290
BEVERLEY TURNER: You know it's
hard being the partner of an

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.950
Olympian is really hard.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.970
I watched London 2012.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.080
And you see Mo Farah's wife
there on the sidelines.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.210
When he's won, she'll just
look so wonderful.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.820
And I just thought, oh,
you've been through

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.900
hell, haven't you?

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.570
Because the big sacrifices that
the Olympians inevitably

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.270
have to make, it's everything.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.220
It's the complete focus
of their life.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.540
And so, as the partner, you're
standing going, come on.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.440
When is this Olympic final?

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.200
Let's get it over with.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.240
And then we can get
on with our life.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.630
And James obviously won
the gold medal.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.820
That was all marvelous.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.500
And then he said he was going to
row across the Atlantic for

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.919
two months, which was not what
I had in mind at all.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.680
I was thinking maybe a holiday
or spend some time as a

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.270
family, because we'd
actually spent very

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.430
little time as a family.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.460
So I was really hacked
off about it.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.860
And Ben Fogle's wife was
very supportive.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.090
JAMES CRACKNELL: I didn't
enjoy it, if that's any

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.820
consolation to you.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.093
BEVERLEY TURNER: No.

00:08:57.093 --> 00:08:57.800
You hated it.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.750
Actually, I liked the fact
that you didn't enjoy it.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.880
BEVERLEY TURNER: But when he
came back, it was actually the

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.680
best thing he'd ever done.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.510
MATT BRITTIN: It was?

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.230
BEVERLEY TURNER: It was the
best thing he ever did.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.420
Yeah, it was.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:05.763
MATT BRITTIN: Why was that?

00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:07.232
Why do you say that?

00:09:07.232 --> 00:09:10.780
BEVERLEY TURNER: Because, as
James was saying, as a

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.970
sportsman, I think, when you're
retiring or you're

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.245
trying to work out what you're
going to do with the rest of

00:09:14.245 --> 00:09:17.000
your life, when you're in your
30s, it's such an identity

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.670
crisis because what do you do?

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.250
How do you go from living such
an exciting and demanding and

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.830
challenging day to day
existence and all the

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.960
adulation that comes with
winning an Olympic gold medal?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.280
JAMES CRACKNELL: Matt
rowed, by the way.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.880
So you realize that's not
how it is at all.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:34.870
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.776
The adulation really
did not happen.

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:37.870
MATT BRITTIN: I certainly don't
remember any adulation.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:38.640
JAMES CRACKNELL: No.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:38.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.170
MATT BRITTIN: So not necessarily
quite so

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:40.360
successful.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.250
BEVERLEY TURNER: But you know
James can't sit still long

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.610
enough to do a job like
you do, Matt.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.420
That's the difference, is he
needed to be on the move.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.980
And so actually, to have this
trip, which made him decide

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.640
what he wants to do.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.260
And he wanted to make his
hobbies into his job, which is

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.430
to do this kind of thing.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.370
MATT BRITTIN: So he found this
by chance, thanks to a chance

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.290
conversation at a party.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.080
BEVERLEY TURNER:
Yeah, with Ben.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.510
Yeah.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.520
And then, obviously, raced to
the South Pole and did all the

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.630
various marathons and
stuff like that.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.800
MATT BRITTIN: It seems to
be there's an important

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.210
difference between being a
supportive wife watching

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.560
somebody trying to win an
Olympic gold medal and waiting

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.180
for him to phone in that he's
crossed the Atlantic in a

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:17.770
rowing boat.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.210
And that is what's the worst
that can go wrong in a rowing

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.920
race is, well, you might
not get the medal.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.660
I know about that.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.090
It's not quite the same
thing as the danger

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.765
that is being at sea.

00:10:28.765 --> 00:10:30.280
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah,
it's funny though.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.510
MATT BRITTIN: And since then,
he's done lots of dangerous

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:32.630
things, right?

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.340
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah, but
they're not really dangerous.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.720
He's not a base jumper.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:37.975
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:40.810
BEVERLEY TURNER: I know it
sounds a bit crazy, but I'm

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.712
such a safety girl.

00:10:42.712 --> 00:10:46.400
I'm a seat belt and a condom
type of girl, and

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.230
not at the same time.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.443
JAMES CRACKNELL: We have
three children.

00:10:47.443 --> 00:10:47.550
That's not [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.640
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.440
Clearly not.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.290
MATT BRITTIN: Not always.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:50.920
BEVERLEY TURNER: But
I've always been--

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.200
JAMES CRACKNELL: But
statistically unlucky.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.810
BEVERLEY TURNER: From being very
young, I've always been

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.650
about self-preservation
and safety.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:10:59.380
MATT BRITTIN: I think that
should be the title

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.010
of your next book.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.965
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:00.965 --> 00:11:01.970
MATT BRITTIN: "Seat Belts
and Condoms."

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.410
BEVERLEY TURNER: "Seat Belt
and a Condom." And so I'm

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.420
quite careful.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.450
And so, for me--

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.150
JAMES CRACKNELL: Well,
not really.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.765
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:10.765 --> 00:11:11.300
MATT BRITTIN: Keep going.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:11.480
Keep going.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.500
We're with you.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.625
BEVERLEY TURNER: So anyway, I
actually always worried more

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:16.585
when he went on his bicycle.

00:11:16.585 --> 00:11:17.140
MATT BRITTIN: Right.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.495
BEVERLEY TURNER: For
me, that was the

00:11:18.495 --> 00:11:19.290
most frightening thing.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:19.830
MATT BRITTIN: Just
in around London.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.368
BEVERLEY TURNER: Just
going out of

00:11:20.368 --> 00:11:21.420
the door on his bicycle.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.360
Or he used to ride
a motor bike.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.450
I had much more of a problem
with that than I did--

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.740
because with all of these
trips there are safety

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.680
measures in place.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.140
And the Atlantic row
was probably,

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.480
actually, the most dangerous.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.600
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:42.250
I think the things that I've
done, they may be remote, but

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.280
it's going to be your mistake
that is a problem.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.860
The Atlantic is slightly
different, because there are

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.120
tankers that are
on auto-pilot.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.900
And you need to make sure
you're aware of it.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.162
BEVERLEY TURNER: [LAUGHS]

00:11:50.162 --> 00:11:50.870
Now you tell me.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.480
JAMES CRACKNELL: But the South
Pole, it's generally a

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.680
deserted environment.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.260
It's your decision in
the environment.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.140
Whereas, on a public highway,
you are liable to other people

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.720
making mistakes.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.870
You can't control the people's
behavior, if that be on a

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:10.350
street in London or a train
or a plane or on a road.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.150
Whereas, in the South
Pole, there may be

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.260
a knocked off penguin.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.190
But it's, pretty much,
everything else is going to be

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.880
down to you.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.300
MATT BRITTIN: Yes.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:16.720
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.590
MATT BRITTIN: So you did
the rowing across

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:19.300
the Atlantic thing.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.820
You did the South
Pole expedition.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.450
I think quite a few people have
seen that on the TV, the

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.060
documentary that you made there
which, again, looked

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.420
like very, very tough
conditions.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.270
JAMES CRACKNELL: Tough
conditions, yeah.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:35.010
It was tough in that the
temperature was not very nice.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:39.330
It's not an easy place to go,
because everything takes so

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.550
much longer to do.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.690
MATT BRITTIN: In the TV show,
it looked like you also--

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.840
the difference between James
Cracknell as a somewhat

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.460
extreme Olympian and the other
more regular guys in the team,

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.630
it certainly looked like
you were pushing

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.580
it harder than the--

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.220
I've read the book.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.110
And I think your view is that
you were portrayed in a little

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.340
bit of an extreme way in that,
in terms of [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:59.340 --> 00:12:59.840
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.920
I think, in terms of--

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.170
you know as well.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.800
In a sports environment, you
end up racing a boat and

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.400
training with eight people.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.180
And your thoughts and opinions
may be here and here, either

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:17.870
end of the scale.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.860
But there's always the target,
which is to win.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.810
And so that brings you
back together.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.700
Whereas, if you're with people
whose end goal is not the

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.710
same-- well, it's to get there,
but not get there as

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.130
quick as you can--

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.820
there isn't that same
focal point to

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.750
bring you back together.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.860
So it was very useful for me
in terms of learning how to

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.360
work with other people.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:46.150
But there's a mentality of a
elite or full-time sportsman

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.030
that is different from
some people.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.660
You think, well, Bev, you've
come to a few Olympic

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.870
receptions that we've been to.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:59.740
And I didn't take this quite as
positively as she meant it.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.970
Well, I hope she
meant it to be.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.380
She was like, show me a room of
Olympic gold medalists, and

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.590
I'll show you a room full
of insecure people.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.826
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:08.510
JAMES CRACKNELL:
I was like, hm.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.590
BEVERLEY TURNER: It's true
though, isn't it?

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.320
MATT BRITTIN: It's true.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:10.770
BEVERLEY TURNER: It
is true, isn't it?

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.045
You know that.

00:14:11.045 --> 00:14:12.230
JAMES CRACKNELL: Sort of
judging you basically--

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.024
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:14.024 --> 00:14:14.640
BEVERLEY TURNER: Come on.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.840
All you Olympic gold medalists,
it's true.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.040
I think that there has to be
something about wanting to

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.300
prove yourself, prove
yourself.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:23.590
But thank goodness.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.257
I did also say--

00:14:24.257 --> 00:14:27.610
JAMES CRACKNELL: Or
being judged by

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.585
something other than yourself.

00:14:29.585 --> 00:14:30.260
MATT BRITTIN: Yep.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.970
JAMES CRACKNELL: Fulfillment
and belief in yourself.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:32.310
MATT BRITTIN: I can see that.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.810
JAMES CRACKNELL: And judging
by a kind of

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:34.070
target of other people.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:34.750
BEVERLEY TURNER: It's an
exterior kind of validation.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.120
MATT BRITTIN: Well, I guess
that's your thing about

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.640
finding your next thing which
is going to validate you or

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.500
give you the goal, et cetera.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:40.570
BEVERLEY TURNER: Exactly.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.030
JAMES CRACKNELL: Which I don't
think is a particularly

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.140
mentally healthy place to be.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:49.170
I think the guys I went with,
Ben and Ed, they found self

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.760
fulfillment in a different
way, rather than it being

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.845
something extra that
is outside.

00:14:55.845 --> 00:14:56.770
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.020
Just getting there would
be fine for them.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:58.350
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.600
MATT BRITTIN: But you wanted
to get there and beat the

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.660
Norweigians in your
first attempt.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.425
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:15:03.425 --> 00:15:04.130
BEVERLEY TURNER: There
won't be a second.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:04.805
JAMES CRACKNELL: Be rewarded.

00:15:04.805 --> 00:15:05.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.170
JAMES CRACKNELL: But then
we'd also said--

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:13.630
I'd taken the philosophy in
training that, with me and

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.250
with them, if we make it as
uncomfortable and as hard as

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:20.400
possible here, which I'll make
it worse here than it is

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.040
there, no day there is going
to feel that bad.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.900
Whereas, if you don't train that
hard before we go, it's

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.120
going to be really horrible.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.840
If it's nasty, we're just
going to go, oh!

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.020
And we're miles from anywhere.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.970
MATT BRITTIN: So just on that
point, I cycled in this

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.180
morning through Richmond Park.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.900
And having read your book, I
had in my mind the image of

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.400
you climbing over the gate at
Richmond Park with a bicycle

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.430
tire, which you were then going
to drag around the park

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.760
in training for this event
during the night so not to

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.580
disturb the kids.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.030
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.020
I have to say that--

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.690
MATT BRITTIN: That's what
you were doing.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.710
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:54.680
Yeah, because it's very hard to
recreate pulling a sledge.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.200
So you basically drag a tire.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.240
Not a bicycle tire.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.075
It's more like a lorry tire.

00:16:00.075 --> 00:16:02.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.590
JAMES CRACKNELL: But the reason
I had to climb the

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:09.870
fence is because every year they
have a month where they

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.180
cull the deer in
Richmond Park.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.490
It's like eight miles
around the outside.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.620
And so it's generally
open 24 hours a day

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.240
to people on bikes.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.870
So there's lots of weirdos
cycling around at midnight.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:21.840
But then they have cars.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.330
And they obviously
have proper jobs.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.390
And they can't get out
during the day.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.440
And so they lock
the gates then.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.720
So I had to climb over, drag
this bloody tire over the

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.450
fence, and then walk around.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.450
And every so often, you'd
hear a crack of a rifle.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.470
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.065
So it's real lucky I didn't
go in my antler hat.

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:40.143
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:40.143 --> 00:16:41.393
JAMES CRACKNELL: So
I was all right.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:50.190
And at that stage, you
were pregnant with

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:50.780
Ki Ki, weren't you?

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.930
But we had a family and
everything else.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:59.450
It was more beneficial to us, as
a family, if I trained when

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.010
the others were asleep.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.855
So do admit I was a bit of a
weirdo going around the park

00:17:04.855 --> 00:17:07.090
in the middle of the night
pulling a tire.

00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:07.736
BEVERLEY TURNER: It's true.

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:09.235
I was just going to say, people
said, obviously, all

00:17:09.235 --> 00:17:11.849
that training, he must
be very selfish.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:13.660
And actually, he
did used to be.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.550
But I think what James has
managed to do quite well-- and

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.630
I think anybody who works and
has long hours-- is it's so

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.930
hard to find any kind of time
to put exercise or anything

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:25.589
into your day.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:27.050
I don't really get to do any.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.240
But there was one night when
he was training for the

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.030
Marathon des Sables, which was
another event that is on one

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.430
of the DVDs, on the
book, actually.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.620
And we'd been to a black
tie event in London.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.710
And I was actually driving.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:42.730
And we came out.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:46.040
And James gets out of his suit
and puts on his running gear.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.540
And it's midnight.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.730
And I said, what
are you doing?

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.536
He said, well, I'm going
to run home.

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:50.932
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:50.932 --> 00:17:53.400
BEVERLEY TURNER: So I drove
down the A4 back out to

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.060
Chiswick where we lived from
the center of town.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.240
And James ran home.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.980
And I think he pretty much
beat me there, I think.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.225
MATT BRITTIN: That's
pretty normal.

00:18:01.225 --> 00:18:03.076
I used to do that all the
time when I was pissed.

00:18:03.076 --> 00:18:04.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.960
MATT BRITTIN: You just glossed
over another thing that--

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.880
I want to move forward a bit.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.630
But just briefly, Marathon des
Sables, James, how far do you

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.970
run in that?

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.260
JAMES CRACKNELL: It's a
series of marathons

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.510
in the Sahara desert.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.410
There's a marathon every day
for six, seven days.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.310
And then, one day, they decide
you do two marathons.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.835
But you carry all the food
and everything you

00:18:28.835 --> 00:18:30.090
need for the week.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.620
MATT BRITTIN: It's literally
over sand dunes, isn't it?

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.280
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah, sand
dunes and rocky [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.220
and that sort of just being in
a tent with no [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.220
MATT BRITTIN: We're sort of
throwing around Olympic gold

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.200
medals and gold medalists as
though they were two a penny.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.260
But I think one of the
remarkable things is it's

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.780
quite hard to get an
Olympic gold medal.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.840
We're taking them for
granted here now.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.260
But also, you're the fastest
Brit, I think, ever to have

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.275
finished a Marathon
des Sables.

00:18:50.275 --> 00:18:50.700
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.050
No, I was--

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.020
MATT BRITTIN: It's pretty
impressive for

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.070
a guy of 100 kilos.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.440
JAMES CRACKNELL: I was
really thinking.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.840
And I was really chuffed,
because I decided to do it.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.580
Well, there's two [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.280
The first one, I was
at the South Pole.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.570
And we'd had the thing about
being honest with each other.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.060
As I said, I was training
very hard for it.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.150
And we had also said we'd
be really honest.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.350
So if we were struggling, it
didn't matter what weight we

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.340
all took, as long as the three
of us and all our kit got to

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.070
the South Pole.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.880
So some day, if you were feeling
good, you'd take more.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.610
If you weren't, you wouldn't
feel bad about giving someone

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:24.370
else some weight.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.170
And over the first week, the
others were struggling a bit.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.900
So I took some of
their weight.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.390
And then I started
to struggle.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.460
And I didn't say.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.890
And so I got really
nasty blisters and

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.450
pneumonia on my left lung.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.570
And that really slowed
us down.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.044
And I was at South Pole and
feeling really not very good.

00:19:40.044 --> 00:19:42.010
And it's also weird
I was at the South

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.670
Pole, for various reasons.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.653
And this one comes into the
tent and he goes, oh, you

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:49.040
think those blisters are
bad, you should do the

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.490
Marathon des Sables.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.550
I don't know why, at that
point, I thought

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:52.303
that'd be a good idea.

00:19:52.303 --> 00:19:52.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.230
BEVERLEY TURNER: He
was like, yeah.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.070
That's a really great idea.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.910
JAMES CRACKNELL: I know.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.070
I'll go running in the sand.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.510
But the second reason was,
I wanted to show, in a

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.690
competitive environment, I could
make the right decision

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.180
at the right time.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.950
So stopping in the middle of a
race was quite alien to me.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.320
But two minutes, five minutes
there would save an hour

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.370
further down the line.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.950
And for me, making that decision
then was something I

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.130
wouldn't have done
in the past.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:22.920
And I think that's why I did do
better there is that I made

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.350
the right decision at
the right time.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.460
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.310
And actually, it's an
amazing program.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.120
It's my favorite film of
all of James' films.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.470
It's just a fantastic filmmaker

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.450
called David Harrison.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.890
And it's just the most brilliant
documentary.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.280
And like you say, it
was Easter time.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.000
And I was with the kids
down in Devon.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.450
And just got the odd phone
call to say, he's alive.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.340
He's fine.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.805
And then, when he called
and said, oh, well,

00:20:44.805 --> 00:20:46.540
actually, I came 12th.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.670
And how many people were--

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:48.132
JAMES CRACKNELL: There was
1,000 did it that day.

00:20:48.132 --> 00:20:49.520
BEVERLEY TURNER:
1,000 runners.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.240
JAMES CRACKNELL: That year.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.000
BEVERLEY TURNER: He came 12th.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.470
Oh.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.940
Well done!

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.410
JAMES CRACKNELL: The
guy who won it--

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:53.640
BEVERLEY TURNER: The
fastest ever Brit.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.760
The fastest ever Brit, which is
amazing because they're all

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.410
tiny little gazelles,
aren't they?

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.965
JAMES CRACKNELL: Well, the guy
who came over and we did some

00:20:58.965 --> 00:21:02.440
sort of heat testing for the
documentary before we went.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.180
And the guy who had won it the
previous year came over, a

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.660
Moroccan guy called Mohammad.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.420
And we just ran in a 50 degree
chamber on the treadmill.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.420
And he got off the plane from
Morocco, gets to the chamber.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.600
And the first thing they do is
give him a thermometer to

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.640
stick up his bum,
because his core

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.990
temperature could be monitored.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.330
And if health and safety
is breached, you

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.380
could be dragged out.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.055
And so he wasn't delighted about
that the first thing.

00:21:26.055 --> 00:21:26.960
This is not a very
good country.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.766
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:29.766 --> 00:21:33.400
JAMES CRACKNELL: But we ran
for an hour in 50 degrees.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.000
And I lost four kilos.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.720
And he lost half a kilo.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.360
And that's just how
attuned to--

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.920
BEVERLEY TURNER: He was
up to here on you.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.170
JAMES CRACKNELL: He
was not very big.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.000
And you get the same amount
of water every day.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.300
So they give you water, but
you carry your own food.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.950
So he was like showering
in it.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.850
Whereas, I was every drop
was a prisoner.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.905
MATT BRITTIN: So I'd like to
move it on to what happened at

00:21:54.905 --> 00:21:56.480
your accident and
then after it.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.180
But just before we do that, so
all of the stuff you've done

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.570
up to the point of the race
across America, what would you

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.795
say was the hardest?

00:22:02.795 --> 00:22:06.158
And what would you say
you're most proud of?

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.450
JAMES CRACKNELL: I think I was
most proud of the Marathon des

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.315
Sable in terms of making
the right decision

00:22:11.315 --> 00:22:12.980
at the right time.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.430
And having learned from the
others, and showing that, in a

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:21.710
competitive environment, I
could separate the two.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.880
In terms of the hardest, I
think, for the first week of

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.150
the Atlantic I found really hard
because everything I'd

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.020
done previously, as you said
at the start, is what's the

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.070
worst that could happen?

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.980
Well, you might lose the race.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:41.680
But even in the start of the
Athens Olympics, I always make

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.850
sure we're straight
in the lane.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.935
And I could see the finish tower
2,000 meters away, which

00:22:45.935 --> 00:22:47.900
is our race distance.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.695
And as much as you should be
thinking positive things, I

00:22:51.695 --> 00:22:53.360
thought, cor, that's
a long way.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.110
JAMES CRACKNELL: But the
difference between that and,

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.230
say, the Atlantic is that it's
the first race I've done where

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.840
you couldn't see the
finish line.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:11.300
And even after you row a week,
we're still 3,000 miles away.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.030
And that was getting my head
around a target that

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.030
seemed so far away.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.830
And even if you break it down
into chunks that are big

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.110
enough to take something out of
the overall distance, but

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.813
small enough to get your head
around was really hard.

00:23:25.813 --> 00:23:30.290
And it took me a week
to get myself into

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.875
the right space to--

00:23:31.875 --> 00:23:32.930
MATT BRITTIN: So
mentally ready?

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.590
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.760
BEVERLEY TURNER: He
kept ringing and

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.700
crying on the phone.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.120
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.360
It was that way.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.085
Not a very good time.

00:23:39.085 --> 00:23:40.590
BEVERLEY TURNER: Ben
Fogle cried a lot.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.730
Ben Fogle does cry a lot
most of the time.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:42.226
MATT BRITTIN: Right.

00:23:42.226 --> 00:23:42.325
Yeah.

00:23:42.325 --> 00:23:42.524
OK.

00:23:42.524 --> 00:23:42.921
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:44.190
BEVERLEY TURNER: But James
doesn't tend to

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.940
cry an awful lot.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:45.680
MATT BRITTIN: Oh, yeah.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.610
BEVERLEY TURNER: He'd ring on
this big satellite phone,

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.260
wouldn't you?

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:47.725
[LAUGHS]

00:23:47.725 --> 00:23:48.570
MATT BRITTIN: But you
sound like you

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:49.020
weren't very bothered.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:49.370
BEVERLEY TURNER: No, I wasn't.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:50.390
I was just like, yeah,
suck it up.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.540
You chose to be here.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.510
The children are--

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:53.820
Cory's fine, thank you.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.050
JAMES CRACKNELL: The ability
to be positive in any

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:00.050
situation is something that
I've learned as well.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.110
MATT BRITTIN: I see how
the supportive wife--

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.010
BEVERLEY TURNER: [LAUGHS]

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.710
Yeah.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.090
MATT BRITTIN: But let's go to
a different phone call.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.900
So you got a phone call
telling you that

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.310
James was in hospital.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:12.360
And what happened then?

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:12.800
What happens next?

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.155
BEVERLEY TURNER: Well, that was,
as you said, I was back

00:24:15.155 --> 00:24:16.100
in Vegas having a lovely time.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.130
And I got a call at 6, 7 o'clock
in the morning, I

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.850
think it was, just to say, oh,
don't go back to London.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.140
You need to get to Phoenix.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.300
James has been hit by a truck.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.760
And at that point, I didn't know
what the prognosis was

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.300
going to be.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.510
I didn't know anything.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.450
In fact, one of the trainers
on that film was one of the

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.390
guys who rung me.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.090
And I was on my own in Vegas.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:45.275
I think human beings are much
better at coping, probably,

00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:46.660
than we imagine we're
going to be.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.110
And I think women, particularly,
are good.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:54.140
And I think we kind of go into
coping strategy, coping mode.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:59.500
And I got to Phoenix and booked
a flight and got there.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.245
And I didn't know when I got off
that flight whether he was

00:25:01.245 --> 00:25:04.500
going to be alive or dead
by the time I got off.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.760
I didn't know much
about the injury.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.235
I knew that he'd been
helicoptered from

00:25:07.235 --> 00:25:07.920
the side of the road.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.238
It obviously was very serious,
because they were saying you

00:25:10.238 --> 00:25:10.470
have to get here.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.260
And they would never do that.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.650
The team would never say, Bev,
you need to come out.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.760
Because, as you can see, he has
a lot of people that look

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.670
after him on those
kind of trips.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.670
And I was met in the hospital
by a really

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.530
lovely American doctor.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.830
And it was all kind
of very odd.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.430
It was sort of like it's so
familiar to you because of

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:34.260
"ER" and American television
medical dramas that

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.530
it's sort of odd.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.720
But it's strangely familiar
in the same way.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:43.190
And obviously, he was heavily,
heavily sedated and had a

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.690
collar that was--

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.810
and to all intents and purposes
he looked fine.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.990
He looked quite well, because
he was fairly well.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.090
He was very well, except that
he'd had a very bad--

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.470
JAMES CRACKNELL: Well?

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:54.250
BEVERLEY TURNER: Well, you
weren't very well.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.840
But I mean, at that time in
your life, you were--

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.750
MATT BRITTIN: But physically,
he was in good condition.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.240
BEVERLEY TURNER: Physically,
you were in great shape is

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.830
what I mean.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.660
And so he had a tan and
he'd been running.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.080
And it sounds ridiculous
doesn't it?

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.140
But it was the perfect
introduction, actually, to

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:13.020
brain injury as the hidden
illness because, amazingly, to

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.170
be hit from, we think, about 70
mile an hour petrol tanker,

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:20.940
the wing mirror to the back of
the head, he didn't have a

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.500
broken bone in his body.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.710
He should have had
a broken neck.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.110
He should have never been able
to walk again, really.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.340
And he was so lucky.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.590
Bike helmet, that wasn't luck.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.680
But he sustained a frontal lobe
injury, what they call a

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:35.990
contrecoup.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.750
So it's like the brain swings
forward in the head.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.104
So even though the impact is to
the back, the injury is to

00:26:41.104 --> 00:26:42.950
the front of the brain.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:49.890
And James' parents came
out not long after.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:50.810
My mom came out.

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:54.450
And then James started
to come round.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.420
JAMES CRACKNELL: Don't look
at me for answers.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.203
BEVERLEY TURNER: I know.

00:26:56.203 --> 00:26:57.090
You have no idea do you?

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.540
You can't help me out
at all can you?

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.800
And they'd established fairly
quickly that he

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.650
was going to live.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.700
And then they had said, oh, you
know, we need to watch to

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.830
see if we need to do brain
surgery, if the brain

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.120
continues to swell.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.110
I mean, in some ways, it was
great that we were in America,

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.745
because the care there for that
kind of injury-- well,

00:27:15.745 --> 00:27:17.320
for anything in that
kind of setting--

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.150
is the best in the world.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:23.345
And so we had a month in
Arizona, in Phoenix.

00:27:23.345 --> 00:27:28.430
MATT BRITTIN: And how long was
it before James came round and

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:29.580
was able to converse with you?

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.670
BEVERLEY TURNER: Well, I
can't really remember.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:37.150
It was a few days
of touch and go.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:42.250
And the thing is they couldn't
say, he will be fine.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.680
They just can't say that about
the brain, because it will

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.980
affect people in
different ways.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.440
And in fact, the severity of
James' injury, there's just no

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.270
way that he should be able
to stand here and

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.030
talk to you like this.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.870
It's incredible.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:58.740
And then he did start to come
round and was clearly mad as a

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.848
box of frogs.

00:28:00.848 --> 00:28:02.660
MATT BRITTIN: He was incredibly
posh, you said.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.600
BEVERLEY TURNER: He was
incredibly posh.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.030
He started talking
in this accent.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.281
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:08.281 --> 00:28:10.230
MATT BRITTIN: That's too long
with Mattie Pinsent, though.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.790
JAMES CRACKNELL: [LAUGHS]

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:11.270
Yeah.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.370
BEVERLEY TURNER: And Ben
Fogle, isn't it?

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:12.860
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.310
BEVERLEY TURNER: And just sort
of asking to use the water

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.250
closet and talking about,
[WITH ACCENT]

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.280
"Oh, when I was in the household
cavalry, there was

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.760
this one occasion--" And
it was freaky, trippy.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.290
Like you would think it was past
life stuff, seriously,

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:28.570
the craziness that was coming
out of his mouth.

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.840
And as much as we laugh
about it now, we

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.810
laughed about it then.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.880
His parents and I were just
doubled over some days in the

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.090
hospital, because it was
just ridiculous.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.150
But I think, again, it's kind
of that coping strategy.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.120
And I think mother nature's
very clever.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.520
You need something to drag you
through those dark times when

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.270
it seems so desperate.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.350
And he was bloody hilarious.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.735
[LAUGHS]

00:28:49.735 --> 00:28:50.890
MATT BRITTIN: Right.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.220
So you were just pleased he was
there and being funny and

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:53.820
coming out of it.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.420
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.440
It was a bit like that.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.050
And I found out I was pregnant
nine days after the accident.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:00.850
MATT BRITTIN: Right.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:01.840
So he's lying there and--

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.860
BEVERLEY TURNER: With
child number three.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.297
MATT BRITTIN: Number three child
inside you, and he's in

00:29:04.297 --> 00:29:04.720
this situation.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.180
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah, that was
a low point, to be honest.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.010
Well, it was and it wasn't.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.330
In some way it was great.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:14.730
But in another way, it was
oh god, how am I going

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:15.300
to deal with this?

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:20.900
Because we weren't quite sure
what the care was going to be,

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.020
how we were going to manage
the recovery.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.132
And really, throwing
a new baby into all

00:29:25.132 --> 00:29:26.015
that as well was difficult.

00:29:26.015 --> 00:29:28.510
MATT BRITTIN: And you took him
home after a month or so.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:28.865
Is that right?

00:29:28.865 --> 00:29:31.960
JAMES CRACKNELL: Well, I think
what would have been weirder

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.210
for you was--

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:40.110
because the staff see a
traumatic brain injury victim

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:45.070
so regularly, that they're
sort of normal.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.560
It's like, oh, they always do
that, as though you're some

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.890
part of a new civilization.

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:54.360
So when I was sitting up and
able to eat, they bring you a

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.150
starter, a main course
and desert.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:04.750
And I just mixed it all
together, because you're not

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.340
really sure what you're doing.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.750
And I still have no sense
of taste or smell.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.120
So it doesn't really
matter what.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.090
It could be anything.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:14.770
And so Bev says that she and
my mom and dad looked at me

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.210
just pouring my custard
on top of my--

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.859
BEVERLEY TURNER: Chicken.

00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:18.942
JAMES CRACKNELL: Pasta or
on top of my burger.

00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:19.375
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:19.375 --> 00:30:21.550
JAMES CRACKNELL: And the staff,
oh, they always do

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:24.875
that, as though I've suddenly
joined this group.

00:30:24.875 --> 00:30:25.415
MATT BRITTIN: This
class of people.

00:30:25.415 --> 00:30:26.870
JAMES CRACKNELL: And at
that must have been

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.530
really hard for them.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.916
And then, on top of that, I then
insult the nurse, which I

00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:31.390
didn't think was an insult.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:32.080
BEVERLEY TURNER: No, you
insulted everybody.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.340
JAMES CRACKNELL: No, I didn't
think it was an insult.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:37.735
It's that I asked her if she was
a running back, which is

00:30:37.735 --> 00:30:40.860
an American football position,
because apparently, she had a

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.820
very, very powerfully
built backside.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:44.526
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:44.526 --> 00:30:45.700
JAMES CRACKNELL: Slash large.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.040
MATT BRITTIN: Right.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.022
Perfectly fair question.

00:30:48.022 --> 00:30:49.535
BEVERLEY TURNER: He asked her if
she'd put some time in with

00:30:49.535 --> 00:30:50.180
the Pittsburgh Steelers.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.220
JAMES CRACKNELL: But
that's because--

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.360
if you'd known anything about
American football, I did watch

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.580
a bit of it--

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.180
there's this guy, a running
back, which is like--

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:01.920
MATT BRITTIN: Don't
try and justify.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.300
BEVERLEY TURNER: No, no, no.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:02.575
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:02.575 --> 00:31:04.060
JAMES CRACKNELL: It's
a position of--

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.090
so if you take in Rugby--

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:06.110
BEVERLEY TURNER: There's
no logic to it.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.470
JAMES CRACKNELL: It's
the center.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.260
So the guy runs anywhere.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.450
What [INAUDIBLE] used to
play and [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:14.150
And there's this guy with the
Pittsburgh Steelers who must

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.696
have won the Super Bowl a
couple of years before.

00:31:15.696 --> 00:31:18.700
And he had a very powerful
backside.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.901
He was called the Fun Bus.

00:31:20.901 --> 00:31:21.872
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah, I
think you called her

00:31:21.872 --> 00:31:22.790
the Fun Bus, actually.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.432
JAMES CRACKNELL: And I might
have actually called her the

00:31:24.432 --> 00:31:25.276
Fun Bus by mistake.

00:31:25.276 --> 00:31:25.700
BEVERLEY TURNER: I
think you did.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.700
And then he rang me--

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.980
JAMES CRACKNELL: I can't
remember exactly.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.640
BEVERLEY TURNER: --in the
hotel one morning.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.890
And we had to confiscate
phones and change email

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.060
passwords and everything,
because he was trying to--

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.380
this is a couple of weeks in--

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.180
he was trying to communicate
with the outside world and

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.610
still thought he was fine.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:40.220
There was no problem.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.400
Everybody else had gone mad.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.800
He was completely normal.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.790
And he rang me at the hotel and
said, you've got to bring

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:49.770
me some extra kit
to the hospital.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:50.650
And I said, right.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:51.310
OK, what do you mean?

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.550
And I'm thinking where
is this going?

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.820
And he said, I need
some running kit.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.835
And I need some extra kit,
orange preferably.

00:31:56.835 --> 00:31:58.290
And I said, why?

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.190
And he said, because I'm
representing Holland in the

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.740
synchronized pooing
championships.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.890
BEVERLEY TURNER: Seriously.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.300
Seriously.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.790
MATT BRITTIN: I can't--

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.340
I don't know.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:09.720
JAMES CRACKNELL: It's OK.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.300
BEVERLEY TURNER: Our

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.455
nine-year-old loves that story.

00:32:11.455 --> 00:32:12.200
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:12.320
BEVERLEY TURNER: Our
nine-year-old boy thinks that

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.095
is brilliant.

00:32:13.095 --> 00:32:14.710
MATT BRITTIN: I think
you could organize

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:15.600
an event to do that.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.366
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:32:16.366 --> 00:32:17.740
JAMES CRACKNELL: Again,
that's one I'll take

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.366
Matthew Pinsent in.

00:32:18.366 --> 00:32:19.734
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:19.734 --> 00:32:22.700
MATT BRITTIN: OK.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.750
JAMES CRACKNELL: He's
a big fellow.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:26.275
He's got skills in that area.

00:32:26.275 --> 00:32:29.615
MATT BRITTIN: I guess, for all
of us sitting here, people who

00:32:29.615 --> 00:32:32.160
didn't know you previous to the
accident, you look like a

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.100
very happy pair who
get on well and

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.010
known each other forever.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:38.390
But Bev, he's quite different
from before.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.090
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:39.390
MATT BRITTIN: Well,
to some extent.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.782
He's obviously not as different
as when he was posh

00:32:40.782 --> 00:32:41.650
and pooing for Netherlands.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:42.542
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:42.542 --> 00:32:44.070
MATT BRITTIN: He's still
a bit different.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.960
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah, he is.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.780
He is different.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.370
I mean, we're probably both
different, because the

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:49.300
experience has changed us.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:56.010
But yeah, it's been a very long,
slow, difficult road of

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:57.370
two and a half years
of recovery.

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:00.470
But the frontal lobe controls
your personality.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:01.860
And it's how you understand
emotion.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.110
It's how you communicate.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.700
James won't remember any of the
time of coming home from

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.560
the hospital.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.550
But he was very angry.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:14.795
And it's typical, unfortunately,
of how we look

00:33:14.795 --> 00:33:16.750
after people in this country
who have a brain injury.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.450
We send them home.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.660
They go home to families
with small children.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.020
And they are a completely
different person.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.990
They bear no resemblance to
the kind and considerate--

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:28.460
MATT BRITTIN: And you're talking
in the general now.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.240
BEVERLEY TURNER: In
the general term.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.920
But it applies specifically
to James, yeah.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.700
And actually, what it does,
when I say it bears no

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.270
resemblance, the way the
neurologist described it to me

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.870
is he will be more of himself.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.610
So people with frontal lobe
injury often become a kind of

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:43.160
evil caricature of themselves.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.500
So if you can imagine your
partner's worst traits and

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.460
magnify them by 100 and take
away all the good stuff,

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.360
that's kind of what
you're left with.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.790
He's not like that now.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:54.150
I should just point this is
two and a half years.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.143
MATT BRITTIN: That what it was
like when he landed back at

00:33:56.143 --> 00:33:56.470
home after a month.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.130
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:57.300
Yeah.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.170
And it was like that
for a long time.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.750
But I think, actually, the drive
that we were talking

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.920
about at the beginning of the
chat, the whole wanting to be

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.100
as good as he could possibly
be, James, just in very

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.020
typical fashion, has
applied that

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.025
mentality to his recovery.

00:34:15.025 --> 00:34:17.350
And I think the exercise
actually helped.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:18.400
He was in the gym every day.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.290
And he has been since the
day of the accident.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:24.310
That getting physically well,
trying to be fit and healthy,

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.199
I think, has put him
in great stead.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:28.130
MATT BRITTIN: But in this case,
James, you're going to

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:28.920
the South Pole.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.280
It's clear how you're going
to train for that.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.080
You're going to try and win an
Olympic gold medal in rowing.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.150
It's clear how you're going
to train for that.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.290
In this context you've said,
I'm trying to get back to

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.870
being James Cracknell.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:37.830
There's no roadmap for that.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.800
So what have you done to try
to recover what you want to

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.199
recover of yourself?

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:45.420
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah,
you're right.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:45.980
That's the one thing.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.690
There is no objective scale to
work onto, it's a little bit

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:51.690
subjective.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:54.530
And people often don't
say what they think.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.335
They may say something,
after they've seen

00:34:57.335 --> 00:34:58.460
you, to someone else.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.160
But they never really say it to
your face, whether you're

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.890
different or you get angry
slightly differently.

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:11.990
It's like, I guess, doing
something productive, except I

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:16.420
wasn't able to go back to, say,
a writer of a newspaper

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:19.230
or get back to other work.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.200
So I would--

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.210
getting fit was something
I could control.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:26.190
And then I'd have to see
the neurologist,

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.710
neuropsychologist, occupational
therapist.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.690
And you spend a lot of time
talking about yourself and

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:38.810
about issues that you've
probably avoided.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:41.680
And we didn't really
see a sports

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.480
psychologist when I was competing.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.610
We were, luckily, in a
team, so we'd talk to

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:48.850
each other about it.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:52.690
And so it was something
that was alien to me.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:56.850
It was taking me time to get
to a position where I

00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:00.040
understood that this is an area
that I had to work on as

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:04.140
well and to really buy
into it to progress.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.400
Because it's not fair on Bev
or the kids, if you're

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.170
reacting differently or quicker
to a certain situation

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.030
than you would have
in the past.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:16.560
Because Bev's had a different
husband for the last three

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.550
years than she had for
the first seven.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:22.020
And my little boys had a
different dad for the last

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.600
three years than they had for
the first six, because I get

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.080
angry and non-consistent.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.170
I think that all kids
especially want is a

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:30.610
consistency in their life.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:36.150
And they find behaving like his
age one minute and then

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:40.720
like a really grumpy grand dad
the next minute is hard in

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.830
terms of being fixated on
certain things like table

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.750
manners, of which I'm not
the best at anyway.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:52.980
But if it just means eating a
meal, it's not fun for him to

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:53.550
be with me.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.970
And that's been the hardest.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:55.780
BEVERLEY TURNER: They're
running into hooks.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.610
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah, literally.

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.160
BEVERLEY TURNER: I mean, on a
good day I go, well, who wants

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.730
to be married to the same
man for 10 years anyway?

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:00.495
Not me, [LAUGHS]

00:37:00.495 --> 00:37:00.820
you know?

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.070
I was ready for a new one.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.825
But then, on a hard day, it
can be quite difficult.

00:37:06.825 --> 00:37:07.350
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.720
And James, was there a period
during which you had to accept

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.530
that you were different?

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.200
Because it sounds like you felt
everything you were doing

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.530
was normal.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.830
Was there a period during which
you realized that things

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:18.980
had changed?

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.430
You said people weren't treating
you differently.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.780
But you were conscious they
were saying something

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.852
afterwards.

00:37:23.852 --> 00:37:24.650
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:28.690
I'd say yes, in a number of
different ways, because the

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:29.830
Olympics were here.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.070
And I got back to working.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:35.210
And I worked for a local
company that

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.190
organized the Olympics.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:41.780
And so I had to do this speech
to one of the Olympic sponsors

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:43.520
on behalf of [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.440
And I'm in a briefing before.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.960
An afterwards, talking about
some other things, and he

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.130
said, yeah-- you hit
every one of them--

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:56.040
that was very good, especially
for a guy with a brain injury.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.910
And then right since the
accident I haven't wanted to

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:05.880
be judged on any other scale.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.110
So it was a bad thing to use
as, that's very good,

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.620
especially for someone
who's had cancer.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.800
Go off and pump yourself
with drugs.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.990
The attitude is you don't be
judged along any other

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.500
And that's been one of the
things that has been hard.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:30.350
And then also, with our third
child, we needed to get a

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.010
bigger house.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.140
And then we found out we had
to try to get a mortgage.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:38.620
And they're like, well, we can't
guarantee your earnings

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.510
over the next 10 years.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.910
And I'm saying, well, who can?

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.330
But it's not because of that.

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:47.800
It's because of, bang,
a brain injury.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:55.090
This, whether it's practical,
emotional or being judged, is

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:55.870
very difficult.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.730
And the one thing that I've
found, from the medical, to

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:03.490
friends, to colleagues, is that
people are very quick to

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:07.280
impose a ceiling on you and
think, well, you won't be able

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.520
to do that.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.280
So if people lower their
expectation of you and then

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.210
that affects your expectation
of yourself.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.840
And if you only aspire to that
ceiling, that's the only place

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.330
you're going to reach.

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.660
And also I think there are too
many dream takers there,

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:26.165
whether it be you're in a pub
with mates and you're going to

00:39:26.165 --> 00:39:27.170
ask that girl out.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.860
And they go, she's out
of your league.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.470
You'll never bother.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.130
When I said, I want to go to the
Olympics, you went, oh, a

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.120
lot of people have
tried to do that.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.845
And so, if you listen to those
things, you're never going to

00:39:38.845 --> 00:39:40.710
do it, whether it's starting a
business and someone goes,

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:42.410
most fail in three years.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:46.570
And all those things chip
away at someone's

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:47.813
belief to go for it.

00:39:47.813 --> 00:39:49.410
And then that's really
happened over the

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:50.470
last couple of years.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.800
And I just think it's very hard
for someone who maybe

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.950
wasn't so--

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.210
I say stubborn as though
it's a bad thing.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.880
MATT BRITTIN: Stubborn's
a good word.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.730
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:02.600
Someone as stubborn as me, they
think, well, I'm going to

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.800
prove you wrong or justify
what you say.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.670
Rather than just treat me
as a statistic, you

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.640
need to justify that.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.800
And I think it's really
important for anyone who's not

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.240
just suffered a brain injury,
but who's going through a

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.100
tough time or wants to achieve
something else or wants to

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:25.920
move their life on not to feel
they're being imposed on by

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.310
other people.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.370
And then the limits are being
set by something from outside.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.370
MATT BRITTIN: But at home, it
sounds like people aren't

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:32.260
imposing that on you.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.240
They're expecting you to--

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.390
JAMES CRACKNELL: Well,
I hope so.

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:37.106
And it's been difficult.

00:40:37.106 --> 00:40:40.490
MATT BRITTIN: How do you
do supporting role now?

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:42.445
BEVERLEY TURNER: The biggest
thing is the nag of trying to

00:40:42.445 --> 00:40:45.270
get him to rest a bit
and slow down.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.400
That's probably one of
the hardest things.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.410
And then I don't know.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.290
Now I might have to kind of
let him get on with it.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.560
I spent a lot of time,
especially when he first came

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.155
out of the hospital and he
wanted to go and enter the

00:40:56.155 --> 00:40:58.908
Great North Run in
a wheelchair--

00:40:58.908 --> 00:40:59.744
[LAUGHS]

00:40:59.744 --> 00:41:01.050
MATT BRITTIN: So you spent some
time saying no at that.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.170
BEVERLEY TURNER:
Yeah, exactly.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:04.230
And so I had to do quite a
lot of stepping in at the

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.160
beginning and just going no,
no, and dealing with his

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.320
agents and just trying to--

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.410
just being the jailer and
just saying, I know

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:12.490
he seems OK to you.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:14.730
But trust me, he's not.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:17.580
And so I had a lot of
time doing that.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.750
JAMES CRACKNELL: So that's
interesting, because you

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.120
wanted to get me into
a wheelchair

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:20.965
when we were in America.

00:41:20.965 --> 00:41:23.220
BEVERLEY TURNER: What
do you mean?

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.276
JAMES CRACKNELL: When we
flew back from America.

00:41:25.276 --> 00:41:25.702
BEVERLEY TURNER: [LAUGHS]

00:41:25.702 --> 00:41:26.870
JAMES CRACKNELL: See?

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:27.330
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.020
JAMES CRACKNELL: Getting out
of the hospital, we're

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.260
checking into the airport.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.000
So I had the type of doctor
with me on the plane.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.600
And checking in, the lady said,
can you use a wheelchair

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.290
to take to the plane?

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.240
BEVERLEY TURNER: Of course, he
was just like [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.450
JAMES CRACKNELL: I
was, I can walk.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:45.110
I'm fine.

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.130
And Bev goes, take
the wheelchair.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:47.744
We'll get to the front
of the queue.

00:41:47.744 --> 00:41:48.226
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:48.226 --> 00:41:50.210
BEVERLEY TURNER: Get in
the bloody wheelchair.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:51.210
There's a massive queue.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.450
JAMES CRACKNELL: So in the end,
the compromise was Bev

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:55.237
put the bags in the wheelchair
and pushed to the

00:41:55.237 --> 00:41:55.918
front of the queue.

00:41:55.918 --> 00:41:57.280
BEVERLEY TURNER: I said,
I'm pregnant.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:57.520
Do you mind?

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.880
JAMES CRACKNELL: So apologies
to anyone that was there.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.460
BEVERLEY TURNER: I was going
to sit in the wheelchair.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.800
But yeah.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.290
It's not that pride and
that stubbornness,

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:05.000
which can be difficult.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.920
But actually, like I say, it's
probably why his recovery has

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.600
been so good is because of that
mentality of saying, I

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.490
will prove you wrong.

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:12.900
MATT BRITTIN: So there's
lots more the book.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.870
And it's not actually a book,
really, about the sporting

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:15.400
endeavors at all.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.975
It's about rebuilding
a person, I guess.

00:42:17.975 --> 00:42:18.900
BEVERLEY TURNER: I think so.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.080
There's quite a bit, I guess,
of some rowing stuff,

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.320
childhood stuff to just kind
of give you a sense of who

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.760
James was before the accident.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.525
JAMES CRACKNELL: I like the way
you build up the rowing

00:42:29.525 --> 00:42:31.990
and the childhood
into just stuff.

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:34.305
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:34.305 --> 00:42:37.340
BEVERLEY TURNER: But actually,
we couldn't

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.630
not write this book.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:39.635
We have been through--

00:42:39.635 --> 00:42:41.390
MATT BRITTIN: What drove
you to write it then?

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.465
Why did you write it?

00:42:41.465 --> 00:42:43.590
BEVERLEY TURNER: Because there
is so little out there for

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:46.370
people with a brain injury in
terms of how you support

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.830
families and how you
cope with it.

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.440
There was one little book that
I was given by a physio in

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.290
hospital in Phoenix called,
"Where is the Mango

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:56.460
Princess?," which is an amazing
book written by the

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.670
wife of a brain injured man who
was a journalist as well.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:01.050
Her book is amazing.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:02.836
And she's actually,
sadly, died.

00:43:02.836 --> 00:43:07.560
But inspired by that largely,
we thought, well,

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.490
we've got to do it.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:10.150
James has been asked
to do his biography

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:11.250
so many times before.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:12.890
And he's always just gone, I'm
not ready to do anything.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:13.910
I'm not doing anything.

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:16.520
And actually, we just thought,
well, there's

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.440
a reason for this.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.520
We can't not write it.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.920
And in fact, the response we've
had from families who

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.220
have had similar injuries
has been immense.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.330
MATT BRITTIN: Well, I know we
were saying over lunch that

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:27.030
[INAUDIBLE] get to know you
James as well, but his name

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:28.040
came up during the summer.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.810
And he said, oh, yeah.

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:32.460
He made that great video about
wearing a bike helmet.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.030
And so now, actually, people are
being encouraged to wear a

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.990
bike helmets as a result.

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:37.100
But I want to give people,
while there's a couple of

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:41.430
minutes left, any chance for
anybody to ask questions of

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.060
this amazing couple.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:43.940
Now is your opportunity.

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.320
BEVERLEY TURNER: Oh, my god.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:45.780
Oh.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.700
MATT BRITTIN: Nobody?

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:47.583
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yep.

00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:47.747
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah.

00:43:47.747 --> 00:43:47.911
Oh.

00:43:47.911 --> 00:43:48.569
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:48.569 --> 00:43:51.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you, very much,
first of all, for coming

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.490
in and sharing your story.

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:56.760
Very inspiring.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.400
I have a question for
both of you, really.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.925
You talked about your
kids before.

00:43:59.925 --> 00:44:03.960
And I guess, if one day one of
them comes up to you and says

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.120
I want to become a professional
athlete, what

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.060
would your response be?

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:10.470
What would your advice be, given
all you went through?

00:44:15.566 --> 00:44:21.250
JAMES CRACKNELL: Well, I guess
it would depend how old he was

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:22.580
or she was.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.180
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:23.755
Did you see that?

00:44:23.755 --> 00:44:24.290
A little bit sexist.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.459
MATT BRITTIN: Yes.

00:44:24.459 --> 00:44:24.800
I saw that.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.668
I saw that.

00:44:25.668 --> 00:44:26.536
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:26.536 --> 00:44:29.010
MATT BRITTIN: He's going
to be a swimmer.

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:29.570
JAMES CRACKNELL: No.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:29.660
The one's nine.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.310
The others haven't really
started anything yet.

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:32.920
BEVERLEY TURNER: No.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.590
I see our little girl is
the most competitive.

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.340
The middle one is the
most competitive.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:40.340
Our nine-year-old has not got
this competitive drive at all.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.340
He's a very, very
good swimmer.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.090
And we're doing everything
we can to

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:45.210
encourage them at the moment.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.050
But I think it's our
middle one I'm

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.260
going to have to watch.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.380
Everything is a competition--

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.276
finishing desert, putting
your shoes on,

00:44:51.276 --> 00:44:52.850
putting your coat on.

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:53.690
I won, Mommy!

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:59.840
So actually, in a way, with
her, I spend a lot of time

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.780
saying, it's not a competition,
Ki Ki.

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.410
And yet, with our eldest,
sometimes he

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:04.990
needs a bit of a push.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:06.915
So I think they all sort
themselves out, whether they

00:45:06.915 --> 00:45:07.560
want to be athletes or not.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.725
JAMES CRACKNELL: No, I think
it's more they not specialize

00:45:09.725 --> 00:45:11.440
too early is what I would say.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:17.870
That if he came now, at nine,
saying I want to be a swimmer,

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:21.390
I would go, do you really want
to count tiles for the

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:22.510
rest of your life?

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:27.910
There's a reason why swimmers
give up at 25.

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:32.820
I think just to enjoy sports,
try many different ones.

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:38.780
And then, if you are best at the
one you enjoy most, then

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.280
that's the one for you.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.160
We don't want to pressure
them into it.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.080
But we're also not going to let
them give up straightaway.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.720
BEVERLEY TURNER: And I think,
also, education as well.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.580
That would be what I would--

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.750
you know we both-- well, I swam,
actually, so I'm just

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:56.530
ignoring the digs.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:56.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:00.100
BEVERLEY TURNER: But we both
went to university.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.340
I would encourage
them to do that.

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.420
But get your studies as well.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.570
JAMES CRACKNELL: So we've got
a slightly bad place in our

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:08.060
house because her mom
is a swimming coach.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.755
And her brother went to the
Athens Olympics in the British

00:46:10.755 --> 00:46:13.690
swimming team, which
is brilliant.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:16.260
Well, that was a bit of a jab.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.750
[INAUDIBLE] used to come down.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:21.700
You've get a very stiff back
rowing, generally, is one

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.920
thing that you kind of go, oh,
I've got this sore back today.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.440
The coach would go,
just go swimming.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:30.930
JAMES CRACKNELL: So for me, it's
more rehab than a sport.

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:34.590
MATT BRITTIN: That's
about right.

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:38.230
JAMES CRACKNELL: And the coach
wouldn't go, just go and

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:39.912
scrummage for an hour
or something if

00:46:39.912 --> 00:46:40.730
you've got a bad back.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:46.030
But it really drilled home
swimming as the devil sport

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:47.660
when, at the Olympics--

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.384
BEVERLEY TURNER: [WHISPERS]

00:46:48.384 --> 00:46:48.626
Answer the question.

00:46:48.626 --> 00:46:50.172
MATT BRITTIN: Yes, OK--

00:46:50.172 --> 00:46:52.830
the Olympics, that there's--

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:53.170
BEVERLEY TURNER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.030
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yes, OK.

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.530
Don't interrupt.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:55.860
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:56.360
BEVERLEY TURNER: [LAUGHS]

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:56.530
No.

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:57.864
Carry on.

00:46:57.864 --> 00:46:59.720
JAMES CRACKNELL: That
[INAUDIBLE], her brother, was

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.570
competing as well.

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:04.950
And his two events were
on the same morning as

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.660
my heat and my semi.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.920
And so I can understand Bev
going, her parents going.

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.020
But even my parents went
to watch him swim.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:13.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.160
JAMES CRACKNELL: And
their logic was,

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:14.915
you'll be in the final.

00:47:14.915 --> 00:47:16.610
I was like, you haven't
got a by.

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:18.882
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:18.882 --> 00:47:19.750
MATT BRITTIN: Very
unsupportive.

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:20.130
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.542
MATT BRITTIN: Very unsupportive
parents James had

00:47:21.542 --> 00:47:22.868
is the answer to
that question.

00:47:22.868 --> 00:47:23.752
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:47:23.752 --> 00:47:24.980
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.840
So I have a husband who
always has a crazy

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.160
running or cycling scheme.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.600
And the latest one is like run
the Lebanon Mountain Trail,

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.350
not to give you any
ideas, of course.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:36.630
But do you carry the veto
in your household?

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:37.935
So is there a time where
you can say, no,

00:47:37.935 --> 00:47:38.640
you're not doing that?

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.930
Or do you feel like, no, just
kind of let James go?

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:43.790
BEVERLEY TURNER: I never did
before the accident.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:48.660
I never said he couldn't
do something.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:50.810
I'd look at the safety, look at
how it would work out with

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:51.330
the lifestyle.

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:53.570
But I completely trusted
him to go and do them.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.570
Whereas, actually, post-accident
now, I kind of

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.200
go, no, that's not happening.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.040
And then he actually did
an amazing trip--

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.990
again, the Discovery Channel
filmed it, which is to the

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:05.390
Yukon, which is the coldest
race on earth--

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:06.420
after the accident.

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:10.080
And I spent hours on the phone
to the medics, to the

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.060
insurance people, to
the production--

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.520
just making sure that
everything was

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.770
done to make it safe.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:19.450
And that was the condition that
he had to go under, that

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:22.290
people he was with understood
the nature of his injury and

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:25.750
they understood him and knew him
well enough to know when

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:28.560
his behavior might be just
fatigue and when it might be

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.180
actually something that he was
actually struggling with.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:34.900
I think, once you have children,
it's much easier to

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.460
make demands, because it's
a shared responsibility.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:43.470
And I think you just have to
keep talking about them, don't

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:44.195
you, ultimately.

00:48:44.195 --> 00:48:45.720
JAMES CRACKNELL: But the
other thing is--

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.150
BEVERLEY TURNER: And make sure
all the safety is in place

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.160
that possibly can be.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.310
JAMES CRACKNELL: And that's a
really interesting question,

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:51.400
because the hardest
thing for me--

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.560
and we should go back to the
other question-- is being--

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.140
because when I had the accident
and woke up, that

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.670
everyone was used to me not
being me, because it had

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.810
been-- my first memories
are six or seven

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.830
weeks after the accident.

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:05.160
That everyone had become
normalized to

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.192
me not being quite--

00:49:07.192 --> 00:49:09.640
first, not being at all
normal and then being

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.390
slightly more normal.

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:14.970
But I've had a couple of
seizures, which are related to

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.980
lack of sleep.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.460
Although there's the three or
four hours where I don't

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:22.890
remember anything and
wake up in hospital.

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:28.830
It's been the reaction of having
been with Bev and our

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:34.020
kids beforehand, and then seeing
them a few hours later,

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:34.640
afterwards.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:41.110
And for them, I was suddenly
the daddy that

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:43.850
was not well in Phoenix.

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:49.600
And that is why I hadn't seen
them before from me being

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.355
normal in the evening.

00:49:51.355 --> 00:49:55.080
Then the next time I saw them, I
was the unwell person again.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.620
Whereas, I actually felt OK.

00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:59.770
It's just I had a seizure and
had to go to hospital.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.630
Yeah, the bit I never saw of how
horrible it was for them,

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:09.730
it was really hard to me.

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:13.680
And that, whether it would be
the Atlantic or the South

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.810
Pole, a lot of it has been
going without sleep.

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:18.310
That's something that
I can't do any more.

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.955
So in terms of an event, that's
the one thing Bev will

00:50:21.955 --> 00:50:22.380
always ask.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:22.740
BEVERLEY TURNER: Yeah.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.510
The epilepsy is quite a
big deal now for me.

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:26.385
JAMES CRACKNELL: Because after
every seizure, you can't drive

00:50:26.385 --> 00:50:27.530
for a year.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:30.740
So I've only been able to drive
for two weeks since the

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:33.230
accident three years ago, which
then places more stress

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:36.760
on Bev because she's the
only one who can drive.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.681
So she's almost got four kids.

00:50:39.681 --> 00:50:40.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.310
MATT BRITTIN: Thank
you, Michelle.

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:43.002
Another question?

00:50:43.002 --> 00:50:46.750
AUDIENCE: Thanks, so
much for coming.

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:49.940
I was reading the other day that
the eight fastest rowers

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:52.510
don't necessarily make
the fastest boat.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:54.010
JAMES CRACKNELL: I would
argue that, yeah.

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:55.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:58.870
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
how you dealt with that.

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:01.480
Back in Athens, for instance,
you might have had four

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.155
fantastic athletes.

00:51:02.155 --> 00:51:06.090
But how do you mold that
into a great team?

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:08.736
And link to that how
you dealt with your

00:51:08.736 --> 00:51:10.860
row across the Atlantic.

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:15.120
Can I assume that you were,
perhaps, a slightly more

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.970
strong athlete than Ben?

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:17.375
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:17.375 --> 00:51:18.185
AUDIENCE: Maybe?

00:51:18.185 --> 00:51:18.980
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:20.230
No.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.470
It was interesting going
to that event.

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:34.390
You think, well there's this
area of expertise where I will

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:37.610
have more understanding
or will be better at.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.330
Actually, it's one small part of
the big jigsaw because, at

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.830
the Olympics, you do feel like
you're doing everything

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:45.900
because you're doing
all the training.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.880
But you almost forget or ignore
the physiologist, the

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:53.100
coaches, the nutritionist,
other people helping you.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.520
And when you have to do all of
that yourself, the rowing is

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.330
actually only a very
small part of that.

00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:00.250
And a lot of it, as I said
before, was keeping positive,

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:03.220
make the right decisions at
the right time, and the

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:08.070
ability to keep going
is actually--

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:09.960
OK, when we were actually
rowing, would the boat get

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.990
faster when I was rowing it than
when he was rowing it?

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.310
Yeah.

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:12.950
It probably would.

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:19.720
But spread over 50 days and
3,000 miles, it gets reduced

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.570
significantly.

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:25.810
And I think it's the ability to
stay positive and determine

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.400
to hit your objective that
is as important,

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.250
rather than that speed.

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:33.740
So I think it does level out,
and especially as your

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:35.560
decisions you make
in that process

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.730
about the little things.

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:44.140
And ultimately, then it would
be the technology or the

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.700
equipment or something would let
you down that you had to

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:48.393
mend out there, because
you're [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:48.393 --> 00:52:48.500
someone else.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.740
MATT BRITTIN: James, just talk
about so your first gold was

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:52.700
Redgrave's last gold.

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.545
And you're in the boat
with him and Matt.

00:52:54.545 --> 00:52:54.870
So there was quite
the expectation.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:56.140
JAMES CRACKNELL: I felt
his fifth slightly

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:57.140
overshadowed my first.

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:57.370
MATT BRITTIN: Yes.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:58.740
It was a bit rude of him.

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:01.405
But also, he was going through
all kinds of medical traumas

00:53:01.405 --> 00:53:02.900
himself, his colitis and
everything else.

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:06.910
So you end up actually always
carrying the load that he was

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:08.170
bringing to the boat as well.

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:10.146
That must have been quite a
difficult team to put together

00:53:10.146 --> 00:53:11.330
in that context.

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:12.600
JAMES CRACKNELL: It
was difficult.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:18.130
And that's where rowing is,
as you know, Matt, is very

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:19.380
different from other sports.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:21.050
It's not like playing football
for Barcelona.

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:23.000
And I'm sure they're all
good footballers.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.430
But if I was playing for
Barcelona, I'd give the ball

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:27.330
to Messi as soon as possible.

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:31.220
With rowing, in a four-man boat,
you are only 25% of it.

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:33.410
Yet you're relying on three
other people to

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.810
deliver their 100%.

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:39.855
And you each do have a vaguely
specific role.

00:53:39.855 --> 00:53:41.650
They're doing 90% of
the same thing.

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:44.430
You need to be stronger in
one area than the other.

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:50.680
And in the four hours in for,
say, the Sydney Olympics,

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.570
rowing with--

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:53.560
you think we've got 29 gold
medals in London.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.470
We got one in Atlanta.

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:57.870
And that was Redgrave
and Pinsent.

00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:01.700
But for me, coming in, yes,
there was the pressure of the

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:04.390
Olympic history from them.

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:09.240
But also, from my perspective,
was none of us had any gold

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.340
medals, because that's the
one we all wanted.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:12.945
It didn't matter what you
had in your bag at home.

00:54:12.945 --> 00:54:14.890
That was kind of irrelevant
on the start line.

00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:21.760
And what I tried to get to them,
which annoyed them quite

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.820
a lot, was that what was good
enough there is not going to

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.150
be good enough now.

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:29.450
And so if you are going to
produce in four years what you

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:31.660
did four years ago and expect
to win, you're not going to

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:32.160
get anything.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.032
AUDIENCE: You told them this?

00:54:33.032 --> 00:54:34.240
JAMES CRACKNELL: I did
tell them that.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:34.550
Yeah.

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:35.660
MATT BRITTIN: Daily,
from what was said.

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:36.180
JAMES CRACKNELL: Daily.

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.987
And basically, I would try to
just make sure I'd beat them

00:54:39.987 --> 00:54:43.050
in training every day, because
it would generally annoy them

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:43.910
all for a while.

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:44.205
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:44.205 --> 00:54:47.190
JAMES CRACKNELL: And the more
angry they got, they would

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:49.510
probably take it out elsewhere
on the other people.

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.930
[LAUGHS]

00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:51.640
MATT BRITTIN: That was actually
a great documentary

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:52.180
you guys made.

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:52.795
Was it gold--

00:54:52.795 --> 00:54:53.650
JAMES CRACKNELL: "Gold
Fever," yeah.

00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:55.210
MATT BRITTIN: "Gold Fever." If
you want to look on YouTube,

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:55.720
you'll find it.

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:55.995
JAMES CRACKNELL: Yeah.

00:54:55.995 --> 00:54:59.840
BBC followed us for
four years.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.040
Steve got diabetes.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:04.110
And it was hard.

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:08.420
You think anyone you've met is
stubborn, you have no idea.

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:10.830
When he got told he had
diabetes, he wouldn't believe

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:11.890
the doctor.

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:18.220
And he would have a lack of
insulin, glycemic situation

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:19.520
where you'd find him
asleep in a corner.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.380
And he would just refuse to
take it at that stage.

00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:26.360
And even at the Olympic final,
I had sugar taped to my feet,

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.890
just in case he had
got it wrong.

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:31.650
It took him a few weeks
to realize, he may

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:33.290
actually have diabetes.

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:36.760
But he never, ever used
it as an excuse or

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:37.760
felt sorry for himself.

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.290
He was just, I've got something

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:40.170
I've got to deal with.

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:41.710
And that's fine.

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:44.415
MATT BRITTIN: It sounds like
you're taking that attitude to

00:55:44.415 --> 00:55:44.960
your life at the moment.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.190
So I think we have to
wrap it up there.

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:49.210
Huge thank you to Bev and
to James for coming.

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:58.480
