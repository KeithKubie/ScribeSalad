1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.070
Conquering fear in general,
right?
Right.

2
00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:06.150
If you're a failure or a fear of rejection for the unknown,
um,

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.670
what would your advice be to someone who wants to start a business or a major

4
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:16.080
project?
But they're,
but they're held back by fear.
So

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.610
this is,
again,

6
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:23.970
it's interesting for me because public speaking is not something that induces

7
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.120
fear in me.
It never has a,

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.480
but I know that it does make people scared.

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.690
And I think that overcoming
the key day,

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.110
any overcoming any fear in my mind is,
we talked about this a little earlier,

11
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.960
which is inoculation and this idea,

12
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.130
and I actually looked up the definition of an occupation and it's the introduced

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.420
the introduction of a pathogen or antigen into a living organism to stimulate

14
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:56.070
the production of antibiotic antibodies.
So you're giving yourself a little bit,

15
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.090
right?
Right.
You give yourself a little bit and you build them off them and,

16
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.350
and that's what you do.
You take the small doses,
so it prepares you for the big,

17
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.110
bigger doses.
And I,
uh,
one of my daughters,
my middle daughter,

18
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.740
she was really wanting to be in the school play.

19
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.060
Right?
And other plays around town and oh you know,
okay cool.

20
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.440
Well that's cool.
But she was horrified to go out in front of an audience.

21
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.640
Horrified.
And so I looked up and I said,
okay,

22
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.650
well how do you stop your kids from being,

23
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.150
getting stagefright is the one they call it.
And you know,
I read about people,

24
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.470
what they did and what I did was I said I'd say,
okay,

25
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.600
a singer song for me.

26
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.860
And it's not that big of a deal cause I'm her dad as she'd sing a song for me.

27
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.950
And even then she'd be a little bit embarrassed,
but she'd sing a song for me.

28
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.620
And then,
you know,
a couple of days later I have my wife,

29
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:53.430
hey sing that song for both of us.
And then it was,

30
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.640
oh my wife's got a friend over,
hey sing that song for the three of us.

31
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.700
Cause how do you get a mystery person?
An unknown in the room.
Okay.

32
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.970
So she's overcoming that fear and each time she's getting a little bit more and

33
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:05.640
more confident because we took her to a,

34
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.500
what do they call tryouts?
What's to try out called audition,
audition.

35
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:14.940
We took her to a couple auditions where it was her turn and she didn't go.

36
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.620
She broke down just crying and just,
just,
just couldn't handle it.

37
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.590
And so then it was then it was a few of my wife's friends were over than it was.

38
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:27.720
Some of my friends were over [inaudible] now you've got,
you know,

39
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.780
guys and girls and each time she got more and more confident and eventually she

40
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:33.750
just didn't care anymore.

41
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.440
And she was totally confident and she got the lead role in the school plays.

42
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.560
She legitimately got the lead role in the school play.
So,

43
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.570
so she was able to overcome that fear.

44
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.520
And in the seal teams we do the same kind of thing.

45
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.590
We know where you're going to get inoculated against stress as much as they can

46
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:51.210
stress you out in the school,
thinks they're going to stress you out.

47
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.340
There's going to be machine gun fire,
you're going to be used to that.

48
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:55.050
There's gonna be explosions going off.
You're going to be used to that.

49
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:58.920
We used to do,
we used to do fly fire machine gun drills and,
and,

50
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.670
and I add drills,
immediate action drills.
We are maneuvering around.

51
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:04.890
We do that without ear PR,

52
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.200
ear protection and sometimes so you get used to this crazy banging.

53
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.990
We don't do that anymore cause it's not smart.
But uh,

54
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.400
but you do that to inoculate.
It's like what you were talking about earlier.

55
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.920
When that gun goes off you should be completely comfortable with it.

56
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.860
And there's an,
uh,
one of my favorite stories on that,
one of my favorite stories,

57
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:25.330
but one of them,
one of the,
uh,
a buddy of mine who actually took my job,

58
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.530
I was a task and your commander and he actually took my job as task and a

59
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.540
commander and a flash bang is a grenade that you throw into a room before you go

60
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:37.840
into the room and it makes a loud explosion and smoke and then it allows you to

61
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:41.380
enter in on the room when the people that are inside are now startled.

62
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.710
So you have an advantage.
Well,
occasionally,
you know,

63
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.270
you have to open the door to throw the crash in there and occasionally someone

64
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:53.140
will open the door and someone will run in by,
they didn't coordinate it well.

65
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:56.780
And so the open the door guy runs in and then someone throws the crash in.

66
00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.030
So now you're crashing yourself.

67
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.790
It's not that big of a deal you got to use to it.

68
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.780
But what happened with one of his new guys,
you know that happened.

69
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.920
So the door went open,
the guy went in and I,
while the is running in,

70
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:09.880
somebody throws a crash in there,

71
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.910
the guy sees the crash and he runs back out of the room,

72
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.340
which is not what you're supposed to do.

73
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.830
So this guy was the task you to commander.
He goes,
Hey,
ah,

74
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.690
come with me and down here.

75
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.580
And so they walked down and he brought him into a closet in the kill house and

76
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:26.800
just sat in there and said,
yeah,
how's it going?

77
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.880
And they just sat there in the dark and dropped like eight crashes at their feet

78
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:31.990
and just blasted the guy.

79
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.570
Cause you realize that you just got to get an [inaudible].
You know,

80
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.520
you just got to overcome it.
So that's kind of,
I guess my,

81
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.940
my theory here would be if you're afraid of fighting and altercations,

82
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.460
go train Jujitsu.
If you're afraid of heights,
work on some rock climbing,

83
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.510
climbing.
If you're afraid of the water,
time to swim,
it's time to surf.

84
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:57.760
It's trying to get out there.
If you're afraid of pull ups,

85
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.820
if you pray to up to do pull ups,
if you're in squats,
do squats.

86
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.660
If you're afraid of public speaking,
go speak in public.

87
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.970
If you're afraid to start a business,
start a business,

88
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.830
make it small and on all these,

89
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.410
what you have to do is you have to mitigate the risk and you have to ease

90
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:17.380
yourself into it.
But you got to go for it.

91
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.220
And eventually you will overcome that fear.

92
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.630
But the hard part is you got to take that first step.

93
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.020
You got to take that first step to begin to inoculate yourself against the fear,

94
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.110
against the fear of the thing that's in your mind.

95
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.870
Cause that fear generally is in your mind that you know,

96
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.510
when you get up on stage,
do public speaking,

97
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.270
people are not going to throw tomatoes at you and say,
oh my,
you,

98
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.680
you're an idiot to get off the stage.
No,
they,
they're going to sit there,

99
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.490
you know?
So there's nothing to fear.
Yeah,
it's in,
it's in your head.
