00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.740
 So, a few days ago, I cheerfully shipped to my boyfriend and asked him ... 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.760
 -Hey babe, can you see something different? 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.820
 - Uhhhh ... 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.980
 is 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.880
 the 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.180
 your... 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.640
 Hua! Dancing vagina 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.220
 -Mhyhy, hahaha ... [vicious laughter] 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.140
 And it was so much fun! I mean it wasn't fun, but it was a little fun 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.600
 because every time I ask: 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.800
 - Can you see something different? 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.300
 It is as if my partner hears: 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.000
 â€œWhat always runs but never goes? 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.200
 often murmur but never speak? 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.980
 have a bed but never sleep? 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.320
 have a mouth but never eat? 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.980
 Um ... 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.500
 [Whispers] 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.060
 Haa ... 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.000
 It's a river! 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.560
 OK. 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.740
 "We hurt without moving. We poison without touching. 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.600
 We keep truth and lies. We cannot be judged on size. 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.400
 What are we? 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.080
 Aaaaa ... 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.400
 Oh god, think, think, think ... 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.840
 Word! It's words! 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.920
 "Can you see something different?" 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.580
 Um ... 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.900
 Oh. 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.260
 Is it... 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.000
 [Breathes heavily] 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.840
 ...your... 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.320
 ...hair? 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.900
 WRONG! 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.160
 AND NOW YOU MUST PAY WITH YOUR LIFE! 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.300
 But I can't let everybody, you know? 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.620
 if i do something i will know if you notice it. 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.680
 And it's like I'm trying to trick you. 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.700
 But I'm trying to test you. 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.480
 [dynamic music, clock ticking] 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.360
 [Alarm clock] 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.700
 NOTHING! NOTHING IS CHANGED! 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.840
 Wait! You fooled me! 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.400
 What has eyes but can't see? 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.280
 NOOOOOOO! 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.260
 An adult man but a baby 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.880
 Don't do this! 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.620
 You don't know me at all ... 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.100
 Oh no, babe! No! 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.820
 But I don't know, maybe this is a really heteronormative thing, right? 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.220
 If I was gay would I be able to get away with this? 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.720
 -Hey babe, can you see something different? 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.640
 -You've changed your hair parting to the middle, changed your glasses from Holcomb to Riple, dyed your brows, really made a good eyeliner. 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.100
 And you are now making a more conscious attempt to be fashion conscious. 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.620
 And you're doing great! 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.220
 - Oh my God! Baaaaabe! 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.720
 I love you. 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.860
 - Love you too! 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.140
 Or is it stereotypical of me? 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.080
 I do not know. 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.960
 &gt;&gt;&gt; I'd like to be more LGBT + inclusive. But that's not what I know so I can't necessarily speak on their behalf 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.340
 so understand that scene was a straightforward reflection of a heterosexual girl, of what is of course 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.860
 a more complex and three-dimensional gay relationship, in the context of this video's exploration of "can you see something different" &lt;&lt;&lt; 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.380
 disclaimer gone 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.300
 But what about you guys? Maybe you ask your partner that question, and that's not an important thing. 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.300
 And they don't react like that at all. 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.640
 - Can you see something different? 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.180
 - No, what did you do? 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.560
 - Oh, I've made my eyebrows. 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.340
 - Oh, cool. Want to watch TV? 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.220
 Maybe instead of fear of not getting it right, they are sad not to be able to see it sooner? 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.480
 Oh my God! What do you say! Of course, you've changed your hair! 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.560
 I should have seen it right away. What does it mean? 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.160
 Does that mean we're not in love anymore? But I thought you were the love of my life. 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.540
 I have failed as a human being. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.320
 Personally, I discover everything. 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.580
 - EVERYTHING - 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.000
 - Hey babe, do you see anything different? 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.440
 - Yeah, you're a giant cat now. 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.240
 - Uh. Can't get anything past you. 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.020
 Oh man ... 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.400
 I'm Anna Akana. 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.960
 Stay ... right here for a sponsored message that I wrote in an enigma and it was really hard, but I did. 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.740
 And maybe I fell into a pool afterwards, who knows? 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.460
 Only you know if you stay. 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.640
 Or you roll earlier 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.580
 I can't control, can't control you. 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.260
 Who sponsored today's episode? 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.280
 and offers news, comedy and audio books ...? 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.420
 When your eyes and hands are full but want to 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.940
 listening and learning in traffic or doing laundry. 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.240
 Who can explore the wisdom of the wise man anywhere? 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.300
 And other great collections of books ... if you dare. 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.920
 Which offer their service FREE for 30 days. So you can try their Audible roads ... 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.860
 Audible.com/Anna 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.980
 It's Audible.com/Anna 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.540
 The best way to fight a wizard is to drown them in knowledge. 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.880
 Where's my water bottle? 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.080
 Oh, it's here.
