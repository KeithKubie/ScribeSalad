and it's not clear whether it will again
so you may be moving towards a two or

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650
so you may be moving towards a two or
 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.800
so you may be moving towards a two or
three party system that is more

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810
three party system that is more
 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.750

multiracial and that has a balance of
 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.089
multiracial and that has a balance of
powers at the regional level that looks

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099
powers at the regional level that looks
 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.729
powers at the regional level that looks
very much like many many successful

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739
very much like many many successful
 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.890
very much like many many successful
democracies so that's tremendously

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900
