JUHA UOTILA: All right.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.336
So I'm Juha from Hookle.

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:04.085
You may remember--

00:00:04.085 --> 00:00:05.532
SPEAKER 1: Excuse me, sir.

00:00:05.532 --> 00:00:09.430
JUHA UOTILA: You may
remember my business partners

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.410
praising Flutter during
the keynote speech,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.970
and I'm here to keep it up.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.940
So I'll talk a bit about
Flutter from the perspective

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.530
of software development in a
high-growth startup company.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.360
So we are a young company.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.140
We just started five months ago.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.950
And we're really trying
to go light speed.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.160
And my idea is to develop a
mobile social media management

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.770
app that would be easy to
use, smooth user interface,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.660
and so on.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.740
So basically, our
strategic purpose

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.930
was to really focus on
the user experience.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.740
So web app development
wasn't an option.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.380
What we needed was the smooth
user experience and pretty much

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.950
native-like performance.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.640
So basically, we couldn't think
of going web app development.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.520
Although we did want the
app for both iOS and Android

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.770
in a cost-efficient
way, it kind of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.790
seemed that we couldn't get
all of these that we wanted.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.470
So originally, during the
summer for about a month,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.330
our plan was to
go Android first.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.112
So forget about iOS, since it
seemed impossible to do all

00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:34.140
that we wanted to do.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.110
However, one of our
developers, Jere, who's here,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.780
suggested that we
can go Flutter.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.440
Maybe that would help
solve our problems.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.560
So we looked into it.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.250
And for our purposes,
Flutter seemed

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.890
to have exactly what we needed--

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.950
basically, more or less
native-like performance,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.970
cross-platform development,
and it seemed stable enough.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.020
However, it was still
in this alpha phase,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.890
and we were kind of worried,
as we were a small startup,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.720
and it would be betting our
company on a new technology.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.800
So we started doing
due diligence.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.750
And it basically
took us two months

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.520
of looking into the
technology, looking

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.280
into what you can do with
it, how stable it is, and so

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.580
on, to finally
decided to go Flutter.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.210
And when we did--

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.460
well, it's basically the
best decision we made.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.360
It took us less
than half the time

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.900
of what we took to actually
look into the technology

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.760
to actually develop
a first working demo

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.540
that we could then
show to investors

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.940
and to use for customer testing.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.360
So basically, in one month
from the start of coding,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.960
we had a working demo
for both iOS and Android

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.820
that we presented in a big
Finnish startup event, Slush,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.570
in Helsinki, and all of this was
basically done by Jere himself.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.320
So I am obviously not
the technology guy.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.360
I'm a business guy.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.360
But I had some talk
with our developers,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.360
or Jere in particular,
and the things

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.120
that came out about Flutter
and why it was so great.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.760
The two things that
he wanted to bring up

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.840
was, first of all,
the customization

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.820
of user interface.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.360
So apparently, the
customization of UI features

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.690
is something that's
quite unique for Flutter

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.080
and that you can do really
easy and really well.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.020
But another thing
that we already

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.200
heard people talk here about
is the hot reload with states

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.620
option that radically speeds
up product development.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.360
And in terms of technology, we
really haven't had any issues.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.980
So I mean, even though
it's still in alpha stage,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.530
it hasn't caused us literally
any problems on the technology

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.830
front.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.130
So as already mentioned, we have
now the working beta version

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.320
that has the
back-end integration.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.920
You can use it to manage
your social media.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.880
At this point, you can do
Facebook and Twitter with it.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.330
So download it for
either iOS or Google

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.350
or Android for Google Play or
from our website hookle.net.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.090
So it has all kinds
of cool features.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.130
It uses all kinds of
cool Flutter technology

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.850
that I don't know
anything about.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.140
But when you download it
and look how great it is,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.500
you can ask Jere how he did it.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.790
Jere, can you stand up?

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.715
So Jere basically
did it himself.

00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:55.350
So download our app
and try to break it,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.440
because you're testing it.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.430
You're beta testing it.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.180
So try to break it, and
if you can break it,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.510
tell Jere what you
did and he'll fix it.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.290
Thank you.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.040
[APPLAUSE]
