00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
 Do you know what I hate? 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.820
 But 2 bags of Milano cookies, Mary? 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.460
 You don't know me at all! 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.160
 Exactly. Feelings. 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.640
 Especially when they are irrational feelings, what for me 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.320
 the whole goddamn time. 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.560
 I get angry about nothing. 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.660
 Look out your caps, you idiot! 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.020
 I'm getting too quick. 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.800
 Why do I have so many butter knives? 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.060
 I don't even eat butter. 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.240
 And often I have, without regrets 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.540
 conflicting feelings. 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.380
 I feel so harmonious with everything now, you know? 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.000
 I now have such a respect for everything that lives. 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.200
 And, I feel like I'm one with the universe. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.760
 My feelings tend to be very illogical, 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.500
 to be intense and overwhelming. 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.440
 And it's hard for me not to be swallowed up by them. 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.920
 Before I started therapy and antidepressants, 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.120
 I had no idea that this was abnormal. 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.800
 I thought everyone had such intense feelings about it 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.140
 everything and everyone, all the time. 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.120
 And it was until I was diagnosed that I realized 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.100
 that my feelings are fake news. 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.740
 Mm .. 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.580
 When I feel overwhelmed by emotions, 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.280
 the best thing I've learned from my therapist to do, 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.900
 is this breathing exercise where you inhale through 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.900
 your nose for 4 seconds, you hold it for 4 seconds, 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.520
 and then exhale through your mouth for 4 seconds. 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.100
 It really helps when you are just overwhelmed by feelings. 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.000
 and when to calm yourself down. 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.840
 But the worst thing about my feelings is 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.120
 that despite being extreme, it takes me a lot of time 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.740
 to really process them. 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.220
 And to figure out what is going on. 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.000
 Because, more often than not, by the time I do 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.360
 get overwhelmed by emotion, it is triggered 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.020
 something small and the underlying problem is 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.380
 something completely different that was ago or 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.100
 and some other different things that happened that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.520
 I have not processed. 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.960
 And once I know why I am one 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.440
 feel certain, it is much easier to remedy. 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.880
 I'm really sorry. I uhm .. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.240
 I have a lot of back and posture complaints at the moment. 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.400
 And I take care of myself poorly so .. 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.860
 it is entirely my fault. 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.460
 The best advice I have for someone who 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.220
 mood swings or just experiencing very intense emotions 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.760
 is to forgive yourself 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.440
 when you try to figure it out. 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.520
 Because you can breathe until you drop, but sometimes 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.720
 your feelings just get too much for you. 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.940
 For example: I was recently on the phone with a friend 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.480
 and we were shouting over and over again 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.740
 something very innocent that he had said 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.220
 until we both realized that we 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.720
 had not had our day and our feelings had increased 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.540
 and were reacting to each other. 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.600
 So be patient with yourself 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.180
 when you try to solve it. 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.440
 They learn along the way. 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.500
 and hopefully you do it better 50% or more of the cases. 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.380
 I'm Anna Akana 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.680
 Stay great Gotham.
