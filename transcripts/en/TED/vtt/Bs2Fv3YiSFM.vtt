00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.696
Priya Vulchi: Four years ago,
we really thought we understood racism.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.736
Just like many of you here today,
we had experienced and heard stories

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.336
about race, about prejudice,
discrimination and stereotyping

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.400
and we were like, "We get it,
racism, we got it, we got it."

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.176
But we weren't even close.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.256
Winona Guo: So we decided
that we had to listen and learn more.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.456
We talked to as many
random people as we could

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.656
and collected hundreds
of personal stories about race,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.976
stories that revealed how racial injustice
is a nationwide epidemic

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.976
that we ourselves spread

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.640
and now can't seem
to recognize or get rid of.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.856
PV: We're not there yet.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.696
Today, we are here to raise
our standards of racial literacy,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.296
to redefine what it means
to be racially literate.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.216
WG: We want everywhere
across the United States

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.736
for our youngest and future generations
to grow up equipped

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.816
with the tools to understand,
navigate and improve

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.576
a world structured by racial division.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.816
We want us all to imagine
the community as a place

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.856
where we not only feel proud
of our own backgrounds,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.120
but can also invest in others'
experiences as if they were our own.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.480
PV: We just graduated
from high school this past June.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.416
WG: And you'd think --

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.000
(Applause)

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.616
And you'd think after 12 years

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.936
somebody in or out of the classroom
would have helped us understand --

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.536
PV: At a basic level at least --

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.056
WG: The society we live in.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.880
PV: The truth for almost
all our classmates is that they don't.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.216
WG: In communities around our country,
so many of which are racially divided,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.016
PV: If you don't go searching
for an education about race,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.336
for racial literacy --

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.976
WG: You won't get it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.736
It won't just come to you.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.176
PV: Even when we did
have conversations about race,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.240
our understanding was always superficial.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.376
We realized that there are two big gaps

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.960
in our racial literacy.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.016
WG: First, the heart gap:

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.456
an inability to understand
each of our experiences,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.560
to fiercely and unapologetically
be compassionate beyond lip service.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.336
PV: And second, the mind gap:

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.160
an inability to understand the larger,
systemic ways in which racism operates.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.640
WG: First, the heart gap.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.776
To be fair, race did pop up
a few times in school, growing up.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.936
We all defend our social justice education

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.736
because we learned
about Martin Luther King Jr.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.536
and Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.856
But even in all of those conversations,

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.976
race always felt outdated, like,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.376
"Yes, slavery, that happened
once upon a time,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.376
but why does it really matter now?"

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.400
As a result, we didn't really care.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.296
But what if our teacher introduced
a story from the present day,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.336
for example, how Treniya
told us in Pittsburgh that --

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.896
PV: "My sister was scrolling through
Facebook and typed in our last name.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.136
This white guy popped up,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.936
and we found out that his
great-great-grandfather owned slaves

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.536
and my great-great-
great-grandmother was one of them.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.176
My last name -- it's not who I am.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.576
We've been living
under a white man's name.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.040
If slavery didn't happen,
who would I even be?"

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.056
WG: Now it feels relevant, immediate,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.296
because the connection to slavery's
lasting legacy today is made clear, right?

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.816
Or what would happen is our teacher
would throw out these cold statistics.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.816
You've probably seen this one before
in news headlines.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.696
PV: African-Americans are incarcerated

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.200
more than five times
the rate of white people.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.440
WG: Now consider Ronnie, in Seattle.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.496
PV: "My father means everything to me.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.136
He's all I've got, I don't know my mother.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.856
My father's currently being
wrongly incarcerated for 12 years.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.896
I've got a daughter, and I try to be
that same fatherly figure for her:

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.096
always involved in everything she does,
it might even be annoying at some points.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.216
But I'm afraid I'll go missing in her life

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.200
just like my father did in mine."

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.056
WG: Throwing out just the statistic,
just the facts alone,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.216
disconnected from real humans,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.055
can lead to dangerously incomplete
understanding of those facts.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:33.616
It fails to recognize that for many people
who don't understand racism

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.496
the problem is not a lack of knowledge

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.256
to talk about the pain
of white supremacy and oppression,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.096
it's that they don't recognize
that that pain exists at all.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.616
They don't recognize the human beings
that are being affected,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.816
and they don't feel enough to care.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.936
PV: Second, the mind gap.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.376
We can't ignore the stats, either.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.336
We can't truly grasp Ronnie's situation

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.936
without understanding how things
like unjust laws and biased policing

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.616
systematic racism has created

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.736
the disproportionate
incarceration rates over time.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.576
Or like how in Honolulu,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.416
the large prison population
of native Hawaiians like Kimmy

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.736
is heavily influenced
by the island's long history

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.216
with US colonialization,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.160
its impact passing down
through generations to today.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.416
For us, sometimes we would talk

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.296
about people's personal,
unique experiences in the classroom.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.440
Stuff like, how Justin once told us --

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.536
WG: "I've been working on psychologically
reclaiming my place in this city.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.776
Because for me, my Chicago
isn't the nice architecture downtown,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.136
it's not the North Side.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.336
My Chicago is the orange line,
the pink line, the working immigrant class

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.560
going on the train."

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.096
PV: And while we might have
acknowledged his personal experience,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.176
we wouldn't have talked
about how redlining

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.736
and the legalized segregation of our past

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.536
created the racially divided
neighborhoods we live in today.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.456
We wouldn't have completely understood

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.416
how racism is embedded in the framework
of everything around us,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.336
because we would stay narrowly focused
on people's isolated experiences.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.576
Another example,
Sandra in DC once told us:

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.136
WG: "When I'm with my Korean family,
I know how to move with them.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.936
I know what to do in order to have them
feel like I care about them.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.536
And making and sharing food

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.720
is one of the most fundamental
ways of showing love.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.056
When I'm with my partner
who's not Korean, however,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.736
we've had to grapple with the fact

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.536
that I'm very food-centric
and he's just not.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.456
One time he said that he didn't
want to be expected

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.016
to make food for me,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.896
and I got really upset."

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.056
PV: That might seem like a weird reaction,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.696
but only if we don't recognize
how it's emblematic of something larger,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.976
something deeper.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.216
Intragenerational trauma.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.216
How in Sandra's family,
widespread hunger and poverty

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.536
existed as recently
as Sandra's parents' generation

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.736
and therefore impacts Sandra today.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.936
She experiences someone saying --

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.456
WG: "I don't want to feed you."

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.696
PV: As --

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.176
WG: "I don't want to hug you."

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.456
PV: And without her and her partner
having that nuanced understanding

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.216
of her reaction and the historical
context behind it,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.856
it could easily lead
to unnecessary fighting.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.056
That's why it's so important
that we proactively --

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.496
(Both speaking): Co-create --

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.416
PV: A shared American culture

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.216
that identifies and embraces
the different values and norms

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.680
within our diverse communities.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.136
WG: To be racially literate --

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.776
PV: To understand who we are
so that we can heal together --

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.616
WG: We cannot neglect the heart --

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.136
PV: Or the mind.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.216
So, with our hundreds of stories,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.976
we decided to publish
a racial literacy textbook

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.496
to bridge that gap
between our hearts and minds.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.816
WG: Our last book, "The Classroom Index,"

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.776
shares deeply personal stories.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.536
PV: And pairs those personal stories

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.536
to the brilliant research
of statisticians and scholars.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.176
WG: Every day, we are still
blown away by people's experiences,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.936
by the complexity
of our collective racial reality.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.656
PV: So today, we ask you --

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.456
WG: Are you racially literate?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.816
Are you there yet?

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.376
PV: Do you really understand
the people around you,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.376
their stories, stories like these?

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.336
It's not just knowing
that Louise from Seattle

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.456
survived Japanese American
internment camps.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.056
It's knowing that, meanwhile,

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.216
her husband was one of an estimated
33,000 Japanese Americans

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.736
who fought for our country during the war,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.656
a country that was simultaneously
interning their families.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.136
For most of us, those Japanese Americans
both in camps and in service,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.576
now see their bravery, their resilience,
their history forgotten.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.816
They've become only victims.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.496
PV: It's not just knowing
that interracial marriages

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.376
like Shermaine and Paul in DC exist,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.736
it's acknowledging that our society
has been programmed for them to fail.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.376
That on their very first date
someone shouted,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.656
"Why are you with that black whore?"

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.496
That according to a Columbia study
on cis straight relationships

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.176
black is often equated with masculinity

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.136
and Asian with femininity,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.456
leading more men to not value black women
and to fetishize Asian women.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.576
Among black-white marriages
in the year 2000,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.296
73 percent had a black husband
and a white wife.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.216
Paul and Shermaine defy that statistic.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.976
Black is beautiful,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.320
but it takes a lot to believe so
once society says otherwise.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.456
WG: It's not just knowing
that white people like Lisa in Chicago

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.816
have white privilege,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.456
it's reflecting consciously
on the term whiteness and its history,

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.000
knowing that whiteness
can't be equated with American.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.296
It's knowing that Lisa can't forget
her own personal family's history

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.176
of Jewish oppression.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.056
That she can't forget how, growing up,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.176
she was called a dirty Jew
with horns and tails.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.496
But Lisa knows she can pass as white

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.136
so she benefits from huge systemic
and interpersonal privileges,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.736
and so she spends every day

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.296
grappling with ways that she can
leverage that white privilege

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.736
for social justice.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.496
For example, starting conversations
with other people of privilege about race.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.136
Or shifting the power
in her classroom to her students

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.056
by learning to listen to their experiences
of racism and poverty.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.416
PV: It's not just knowing
that native languages are dying.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.616
It's appreciating how fluency
in the Cherokee language,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.816
which really only less
than 12,000 people speak today,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.360
is an act of survival,
of preservation of culture and history.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.576
It's knowing how
the nongendered Cherokee language

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.636
enabled Ahyoka's acceptance
as a trans woman

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.016
in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.256
Her grandmother told her firmly
a saying in Cherokee,

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.816
"I don't tell me who you are,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.616
you tell me who you are.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.176
And that is who you are."

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.216
WG: These are just parts of a few stories.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.336
There are approximately
323 million people in the United States.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.256
PV: And 7.4 billion people on the planet.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.900
WG: So we have a lot to listen to.

00:11:03.924 --> 00:11:05.256
PV: And a lot to learn.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.776
WG: We need to raise the bar.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.336
PV: Elevate our standards
for racial literacy.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.096
Because without investing
in an education that values --

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.256
WG: Both the stories --
PV: And statistics --

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.176
WG: The people --
PV: And the numbers --

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.456
WG: The interpersonal --
PV: And the systemic --

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.936
WG: There will always be a piece missing.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.616
PV: Today, so few of us
understand each other.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.536
WG: We don't know how to communicate --

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.536
PV: Live together --
WG: Love one another.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.656
We need to all work together
to create a new national community.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.416
PV: A new shared culture
of mutual suffering and celebration.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.256
WG: We need to each begin by learning
in our own local communities,

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.216
bridging the gaps between
our own hearts and minds

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.856
to become racially literate.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.616
PV: Once we all do,
we will be that much closer

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.656
to living in spaces and systems
that fight and care equally for all of us.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.096
WG: Then, none of us
will be able to remain distant.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.056
PV: We couldn't -- sorry,
mom and dad, college can wait.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.296
WG: We're on a gap year before college,
traveling to all 50 states

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.216
collecting stories for our next book.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.296
PV: And we still have 23 states
left to interview in.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.296
(Both) Let's all get to work.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.576
Thank you.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.240
(Applause)
