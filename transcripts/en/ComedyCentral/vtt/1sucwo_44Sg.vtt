00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.561
THEY BUY LAND IN CANADA

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.664

A HOME AND FARM

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.433

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:36.803
JOHN BROWN GETS CAUGHT,

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.805
AND THEY FIND A LETTER ON HIM

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:40.607

SOME [bleep] HAPPEN.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:54.288
AND INSTEAD OF M.E.P.,
IT LOOKED LIKE W.E.P.

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:55.989
SO IT WAS PUBLISHED
EVERYWHERE.

00:00:56.023 --> 00:01:01.662

FOR SOME DICK NAMED W.E.P.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:06.967

WITH A MAN NAMED THOMAS BELL.

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:14.074
HE WAS A SCOTSMAN.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.142
[romantic music playing]

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.443
HE WAS A BUSINESSMAN.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.880
AND SHE LOVED HIM.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.315
[music stops]

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:23.817
THAT IS--
THAT WAS NOT ME FARTING.

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:25.819
THAT'S...THE...CHAIR.

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:30.991
AND THEY HAD BUSINESSES
TOGETHER,

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.626
MEANING LAUNDRIES,

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.462
AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
AND BULL[bleep].

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.966
AND TOGETHER,
THEY AMASSED A FORTUNE

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.770
OF $30 MILLION.

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:47.174
WHICH, LIKE, NOWADAYS...

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:52.179

IN, LIKE, ONE
OF THE "CENSUSESES,"

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:03.590
SHE OUTTED HERSELF
AS A BLACK WOMAN.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.795
WHEN THE LOVE OF HER LIFE,
THOMAS BELL, DIED,

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.899
PEOPLE STARTED TALKING
ABOUT HER BADLY.

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:13.867
THEY--
WHAT'S IT CALLED?

00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:17.104
THEY "DISMISSINATED" HER.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.207
THEY "SHENAMENANATED" HER.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.307
THEY [talking gibberish] HER.
