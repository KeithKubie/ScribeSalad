00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Here we have an ordinary piece of rope.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.380
It’s not one of those magician’s ropes that can mysteriously put itself back together once it's been cut it in half.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.600
And it’s not particularly strong or durable.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.360
But you might say that it does have special powers, because it’ll demonstrate for us the physics of traveling waves.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.060
Ropes and strings are really good for this kind of thing,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.960
because when you move them back and forth the movement of your hand travels through the rope as a wave.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.080
By observing what happens to this rope when we try different things with it, we’ll be able to see how waves behave.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.010
Including, how those waves sometimes disappear
completely.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.310
How’s that for a magic trick?

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:47.630
[Theme Music]

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.820
This is a typical wave.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.660
And waves form whenever there’s a disturbance
of some kind.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.680
Often, when something about the physical world changes, the information about that disturbance

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.740
gradually moves outward, away from the source, in every direction.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.720
And as the information travels, it makes a
wave shape.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.560
Think about all the disturbance you cause, for example, when you jump on a trampoline.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.960
When you hit the trampoline, the downward push that you create moves the material next to it down a little bit, too.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.039
And the same goes for the material next to
that, and so on.

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.619
And while that information is traveling outward,
the spot where your feet first hit the trampoline

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.920
is already recovering, moving upward again, because of the tension force in the trampoline.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.250
And that moves the area next to it upward, too.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.609
This up-and-down motion gradually ripples outward, covering more and more of the trampoline.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.799
And the ripples take the shape of a wave.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.219
Waves are made up of peaks, with crests -- the bumps on top -- and troughs -- the bumps on the bottom.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.889
They have an amplitude, which is the distance from the peaks to the middle of the wave.

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:47.580
They also have a wavelength, which is the distance between crests -- a full cycle of the wave --

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.760
and a frequency, which is how many of those cycles pass through a given point every second.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.980
Multiply the wavelength by the frequency,
and you get the wave’s speed -- how fast it's going.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.160
And the wave’s speed only depends on the medium it’s traveling through.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.120
That’s why the speed of sound -- which is
a wave -- doesn’t depend on the sound itself.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.979
It doesn’t matter how loud or quiet it is.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.779
It just depends on whether the sound is traveling through, say, air or water.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.820
Now, there are four main kinds of waves, and we can use our rope to show the difference between some of them:

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.830
A pulse wave is what happens when you move the end of the rope back and forth just one time.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.190
One lonely crest travels through the rope
-- that’s the pulse.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.720
Then there’s a continuous wave, which is what happens when you keep moving the rope back and forth.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.560
In that case, your hand is acting as an oscillator.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.220
Anything that causes an oscillation or vibration can create a continuous wave.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.960
Now, things that cause simple harmonic oscillation move in such a way that they create sinusoidal waves --

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.460
meaning that if you plotted the waves on a graph, they’d look a lot like the graph of sin(x).

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.420
But the waves we’ve mainly been talking
about so far are transverse waves --

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.220
ones in which the oscillation is perpendicular to the direction that the wave is traveling in.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.160
When a wave travels along this rope, for example,the peaks are perpendicular to the rope’s length.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.400
The same thing was mostly true for the waves that you made on the trampoline:

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.480
the waves were traveling along its surface horizontally, but the peaks were vertical.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.960
But there are also longitudinal waves, where the oscillations happen in the same direction as the wave is moving.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.980
In the case of a longitudinal wave, the back-and-forth motion is more of a compression-and-expansion.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.480
These are the kinds of waves that you get
by compressing and stretching a spring --

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.490
and they’re also the kinds by which sound travels, which we’ll talk more about next time.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.990
But all waves -- no matter what kind they
are -- have something in common:

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.450
They transport energy as they travel.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.530
At a microscopic level, waves occur when the movement of one particle affects the particle next to it.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.380
And to make that next particle start moving, there has to be an energy transfer.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.820
But how can you tell how much energy a wave has?

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.480
Well, remember that an object in simple harmonic motion has a total energy of one-half,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.120
times the spring constant, times the amplitude of the motion squared.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.960
Which means for a wave caused by
simple harmonic motion,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.340
every particle in the wave will also have that same total energy of (half k A squared).

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.960
All of this together tells us that a wave’s
energy is proportional to its amplitude, squared.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.310
In other words, if you double the wave’s
amplitude, you get four times the energy.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.890
Triple the amplitude, you get nine times the energy.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.850
So why is the relationship between amplitude and energy transport so important?

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.650
Well, the intensity of a wave is related to
the energy it transports.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:25.000
More specifically, its intensity is equal to its power, divided by the area it’s spread over and power is energy over time.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.110
So, changing the amplitude of a wave can change its energy -- and therefore its intensity

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.270
-- by the square of the change in amplitude.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.150
And this relationship is extremely important for things like figuring out how much damage

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.480
can be caused by the shockwaves from an earthquake.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.940
But waves also get weaker as they spread out, because they’re distributed over more area.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.940
A spherical wave, for example -- one that
ripples outward in all directions --

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.780
will be spread over the surface area of a sphere that gets bigger and bigger, the farther the wave travels.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.580
The surface area of a sphere is equal
to (4) times (pi) times (its radius squared).

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.860
So, as a spherical wave moves farther from its source, its intensity will decrease by the square of the distance from it.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.400
Two meters away from the source, and the intensity of the wave will be 4 times less than if you were 1 meter away.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.750
Three meters away, and it’ll be 9 times
less.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.880
That’s why being just a little bit farther away from the source of an earthquake can sometimes make a huge difference.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.060
Now, let’s go back to the waves we were
making with the rope.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.880
Suppose you attach one end of the rope to a ring that’s free to move up and down on a rod.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.700
Then, with your hand, you send a pulse -- in the form of a crest, rippling along it.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.410
When the pulse gets to the end of the rope, the rope slides along the rod.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.920
But then, it slides back to where it was.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.090
That motion -- the sliding back -- reflects
the wave back along the rope, again as a crest.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.670
But something totally different happens, if you attach the end of the rope so it’s fixed, and can’t move.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.450
Now, if you send a pulse along the rope, it
will still be reflected -- but this time, as a trough.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.880
The wave was inverted.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.180
That’s because, when the pulse reached the fixed end of the rope, it was trying to slide the end of the rope upward.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.720
But it couldn’t, because the end of the
rope was fixed.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.880
So, instead, the rope got yanked downward.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.300
And the momentum from that downward movement carried the rope below the fixed end, inverting the wave.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.660
Now sometimes, multiple waves can combine.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.710
For example: Say you send two identical pulses -- both crests -- along a rope, one from each end.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.960
When the two pulses overlap, they’ll combine to make one crest, with a higher amplitude than the original ones.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.120
That’s called constructive interference
-- the waves build on each other.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.230
Now, let’s say you do the same thing again.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.890
This time, both waves have the same amplitude,
but one’s a crest and the other is a trough.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.100
And when they overlap, the rope will be flat.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.180
It looks like the waves just disappeared!

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.840
That’s called destructive interference,
when waves cancel each other out.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.580
Constructive and destructive interference
happen with all kinds of waves --

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.419
pulse or continuous, transverse or longitudinal.

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.019
And sometimes, we can use the effects to our advantage.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.760
Noise-canceling headphones, for example, work by analyzing the noise around you and generating

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:55.030
a sound wave that destructively interferes
with the sound waves from that noise, canceling it out.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.449
There’s a lot more to talk about when it comes to the physics of sound, but we’ll save that for next time.

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:04.000
Today, you learned about traveling waves, and how their frequency, wavelength, and speed are all connected.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.830
We also talked about different types of waves,
including pulse, continuous, transverse, and

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.380
longitudinal waves, and how they all transport
energy.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.380
Finally, we discussed reflection and interference.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.910
