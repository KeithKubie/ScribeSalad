MATT RIDLEY: My
name is Matt Ridley.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.460
It's great to be here at Google.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.300
I've spoken in Mountain
View before but I've never

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.799
been here.

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.650
But I gather this is much more
important than Mountain View.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.080
And I write books when I'm
not doing other things.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.580
I'm also a columnist
for newspapers.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.960
And I also have a sort of
part-time day job these days

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.640
in the UK.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.690
I sit in a very, very
old-fashioned institution

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.610
called the House of Lords,
which is a very powerless arm

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.265
of the British government.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:30.890
But I can talk a
little bit about that,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.190
as well, if you want.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.494
And it might seem the message of
this book is very anti-elitist.

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:40.910
So you might think that's a
bit weird coming from somebody

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.500
in the House of Lords.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.980
But I'll explain as I go on.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.980
My last book was called
"The Rational Optimist."

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.580
I don't know if
anybody here read it.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.550
It was chronicling the
amazing improvements

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.680
in human living standards
over the last 50 years

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.170
and the fact that the
average person on the planet

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.940
is earning three times as much
as they were 50 years ago,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.470
that they're living 30% longer.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.800
They're burying
2/3 fewer children,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.290
the greatest measure of
misery anybody can think of.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.240
And on the whole, people are
wealthier, healthier, happier,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.310
cleverer, kinder, cleaner, more
peaceful, freer, and more equal

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.610
than they've ever been.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.620
And what I was interested in
was why this is happening.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.774
What we're seeing
around the world,

00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:27.190
this extraordinary
transformation,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.770
happening now much more fast--
much more rapidly in Africa

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.901
than any other continent-- a
continent that people thought

00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:34.400
was not going to
be able to catch up

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.180
with the rest of the
world is now doing so.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.360
And the answer, of
course, in a word

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.495
is innovation, which is
something you guys do here,

00:01:43.495 --> 00:01:44.790
I imagine.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.930
And where does
innovation come from?

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.740
How does it happen?

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.190
Why does it happen to us
and not to rabbits or rocks?

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.180
And what drives it--
was kind of what

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.496
I was interested in that book.

00:01:59.496 --> 00:02:01.870
And I've taken that idea quite
a bit further in this book

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.350
because my answer,
essentially, is that innovation

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.670
is about the combining
and recombining of ideas--

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.630
that virtually every
technology we can think of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.570
is a combination of
other technologies.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.020
And so it's just a matter
of combining technologies

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.060
in different combinations to
come up with new technologies.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.860
And there's an infinite
number of ways we can do that,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.000
because I'm not just
talking about objects.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.230
I'm talking about rules.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.650
I'm talking about
ideas, as well.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.990
And that is the fuel
that drives innovation.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.480
And that's why
innovation happens

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.510
where people can meet
and exchange ideas--

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.020
or as I put it, ideas have
sex with each other so as

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.070
to produce baby ideas.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.860
And that's very similar to how
biological evolution happens.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.670
Biological evolution depends
upon the recombination

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.960
of genes.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.340
Genes being thrown together
in new combinations

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.570
through sexual
reproduction in particular

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.381
is what is the fuel that
drives biological evolution.

00:02:58.381 --> 00:02:59.880
But of course,
there's another stage

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.870
to biological evolution,
which is selection,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.900
that it's no good just
having random mutations

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.150
and new combinations of genes.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.730
You, then, have to have
the environment pick out

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.640
the ones that make
an organism more fit.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.030
And as a result of that, you
can build complex organisms

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.510
from nothing, from the
bottom up, without a plan,

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.270
without a designer,
without an end in mind.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.050
And that's the
essence of the idea

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.250
of natural selection-- of
evolution by natural selection.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.900
And my argument in this book
is that human society changes

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.130
in exactly the same way.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.380
It's not even a metaphor.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.010
It's precisely what's happening.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.610
With any information
system, where

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.390
you're getting a
recombination of information,

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.410
you're going to get selective
survival-- in this case

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.360
because we choose the
ideas ourselves rather

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.200
than because the
environment chooses them.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.460
And that is going to result in
progressive and constructive

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.670
change of an incremental,
gradual, inexorable kind, which

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.800
is essentially a
form of evolution--

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.780
that evolution has jumped
into the technological sphere,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.450
as well.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.940
And that, as we look
around the world

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.950
and look at how
we change society,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.890
we need to understand that
most of the important things

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.600
that happen, in terms of changes
in human living standards

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.650
and so on, are not driven top
down by plans and people who

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.370
know how to get end results.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.390
They emerge from
the interactions

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.250
of ordinary people.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.920
That's why I say this
is an anti-elitist book.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.777
I think the idea of Darwinian
evolution by natural selection

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.360
is one of the greatest
insights that's

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.390
ever happened to our species.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.300
Dan Dennett calls
it a universal acid.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.990
And what he means by that is
that there is no container

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.320
you can hold this idea in.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.010
It eats through
everything you try

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.350
and-- you try and hold it in.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.620
It undermines all sorts of
ideas about the world because it

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.530
gives you, for example,
complexity and order

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.360
and fit between form and
function without design,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.160
without somebody knowing
in advance that that's

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.420
what they want to achieve.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.960
The human eye, for
example, is a complex organ

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.400
which is designed for seeing.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.830
It's pretty weird to think
of it in any other terms

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.010
but having the
function of seeing.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.490
And yet, it came into existence
without anybody planning

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.110
that it should be for seeing.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.270
It came into existence in a
bottom up spontaneous way.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.260
So I essentially
argue in this book

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.050
that biological
evolution of that kind

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.570
is the special
theory of evolution

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.790
is just like the special
theory of relativity.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.890
And that the general
theory of evolution

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.400
is that this happens in
systems without genes, as well.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.340
It happens in
information systems.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.420
It happens in technology.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.640
It happens in culture.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.780
It happens in morality.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.820
It happens in religion.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.800
It happens in music.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.850
It happens in government.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.555
It happens in all these
aspects of human behavior.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.230
And of course, natural selection
is-- there's a phrase for it,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.340
really, which makes
it much more clear,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.630
which is trial and error.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.320
Trial and error is actually
how we change society

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.850
when you think about it.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.920
We don't tend to plan one
goal and go straight for it.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.350
What happens is that lots of
people try different things,

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.400
and some survive and some don't.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.370
Some ideas persist and some
get left by the wayside.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.050
If you look at a technology
in the early stages of its

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.380
development, there's a huge--
there's a ferment of different

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.320
ways of doing it out there, some
of which get selected and some

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.360
of which don't.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.390
So for example, if you look at
the designs of early airplanes,

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.060
there's a wonderful plethora
of different designs--

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.930
different numbers of
wings, different shapes

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.880
of tail planes, different places
for the propeller, et cetera.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.534
For the first 20 years
or so of airplane design,

00:06:56.534 --> 00:06:58.450
there's an enormous
amount of experimentation.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.200
And then it gradually
settles down

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.680
into the best designs from that.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.910
So trial and error is much more
important in human innovation

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.590
than I think we
give it credit for.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.670
And we tend to make the mistake
of thinking the world is a more

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.740
top down place than it is.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.240
We did this for 100
years with respect

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.390
to biological evolution,
too, of course.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.570
The intelligent
design movement still

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.660
persists to some extent
in many parts of the world

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.090
where people refuse to
believe that it's possible

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.640
that the complexity
of a human body

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.280
or of a rain forest
ecosystem could have

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.230
evolved without a designer.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.200
And we're still struggling
to get our heads

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.190
around that idea of bottom up
design in the natural world.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.680
And even more, I would
argue, in the human world

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.360
do we tend to make the mistake
of thinking that someone's

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.020
in charge, someone designed
things, someone planned things,

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.800
whereas, in fact, a lot
of it is spontaneous order

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.240
that we're looking at.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.490
Now my book is a little bit
what you might call procrustean,

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.070
that is to say, I'm trying
to squeeze everything

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.360
into my theory.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.650
And occasionally, I might fail.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.300
And I've got chapters
on the evolution

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.190
of pretty well everything
you can think of.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.050
And some of them are more
persuasive than others.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.500
But that's kind of my
point is to sort of push

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.410
this idea as hard as it can go
and see what pushback I get.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.580
And people are saying don't
be ridiculous, you know.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.340
You're overdoing
the bottom up view

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.204
of the world in
some of the reviews.

00:08:30.204 --> 00:08:31.120
And they may be right.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.860
But it's-- part of my purpose
is to try and challenge people

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.770
into recognizing that things
are not as top down as we think

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.120
they are.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.574
Talking of top
down and bottom up,

00:08:42.574 --> 00:08:46.260
I use a metaphor throughout the
book, which is the sky hook.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.200
A sky hook is a hook that
you attach to the sky

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.460
in order to build the building
from the top down, which

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.190
would be extremely convenient
if we could invent it.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.990
Maybe you have invented
it here at Google.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.110
And the phrase comes from a
First World War reconnaissance

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.030
pilot, who was in an airplane.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.230
It was flying around,
and he was told

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.220
to stay up there for an hour
because we're out of action,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.770
and we'll get back
to you in an hour.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.920
And he replied, this machine
is not fitted with skyhooks.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.970
And that's, if you look
in the dictionary, that's

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.610
where the word originated.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.670
And of course,
skyhooks don't exist.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.700
Dan Dennett uses
them as a metaphor

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.130
for intelligent design.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.350
He says that,
essentially, when people

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.860
say that the human
body or the human eye

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.890
was designed by a creator,
they are essentially

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:32.900
inventing a skyhook.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.640
It's a kind of mystical
shortcut explanation to how

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.150
things came into existence.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.420
And I think we seek skyhooks
everywhere in human society,

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.950
and we need to
unlearn seeing them.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.210
Just a couple of examples to
give you what I'm-- to give you

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.400
an idea of evolution in human
affairs, think of music,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.120
for example.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.550
Music genres change over time.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.720
They change gradually.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.830
They change incrementally.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.440
They build on what came before.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.370
They take the previous
genre and twist it slightly.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.880
It's a descent with
modification, as Darwin put it.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.222
You can see the family tree
of different musical styles.

00:10:08.222 --> 00:10:10.430
And you can see how two
different musical styles come

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.590
together and breed, as it
were, to produce a new style.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.640
Gods evolved.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.440
Gods used to be vengeful,
petty tyrants, who got

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.970
cross if you didn't
do the right thing.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.380
Now, they are disembodied
spirits of benevolence.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.890
You can see that
change happening

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.090
in lots of different
societies at different times.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.119
And they haven't
finished evolving yet.

00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:33.410
They're going to keep changing.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.800
It's a bit cheeky to say
that gods evolve because gods

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.690
are supposed to be the opposite
of evolution, but there we are.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:39.630
Governments evolve.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.640
Government kind
of always started,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.420
if you go back in history,
as a protection racket.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.430
It essentially was
one strong man saying,

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.640
I will have a monopoly
on violence in exchange

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.177
for which I will ensure
peace among you guys,

00:10:54.177 --> 00:10:55.760
as long as you give
me all your money.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.910
And you can actually
see governments--

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.220
you can see the recreation
of that happening today.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.400
For example, prison
gangs-- gangs in prisons

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.700
are essentially imposing
monopolies of violence

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.320
within prison, saying,
we do all the violence.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.760
Nobody else can do it.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.420
And that's a sort of-- that's
a sort of incipient government,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.160
if you like-- governance
arrangements within prisons.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.370
So obviously, governments
go on to do other things.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.510
They evolve into things that
have welfare states and justice

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.196
systems and economic
planning functions

00:11:32.196 --> 00:11:33.320
and all that kind of thing.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.670
But that's how they started.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.960
Cities evolve.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.530
There's an
extraordinary regularity

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.760
about the way cities develop.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.460
As they reach a certain size,
they get certain features

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.210
into them.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.910
And there are scale economies
of cities that are surprisingly

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.530
regular and predictable.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.480
Now, these are all
examples of things

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.430
that are the result of human
action but not of human design.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.400
That's a phrase that comes
from a Scottish philosopher

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.500
of the 18th century
called Adam Ferguson, who

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.100
said that a lot of things are
the result of human action

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.385
but not of human design.

00:12:10.385 --> 00:12:12.010
And it's something
we just don't really

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.370
have a word for, you know.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:16.620
We know that this
object is an object

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.260
of human action
and human design,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.650
whereas the clouds from
which the rain is falling

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.830
are neither a result of human
action nor of human design.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.350
But there's lots
of things, when you

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:32.660
think about it, that are
man-made but not planned--

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.450
not directed by human beings.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.250
A really good example
is the English language.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.120
The English language
is man-made, obviously.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.840
It's ridiculous to
say that it's not

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.140
or that it's a
natural phenomenon.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.720
But it is-- but
nobody's in charge.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.870
Nobody started it.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.820
Nobody invented it.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.120
There is no central committee.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.245
There's no chief executive
of the English language,

00:12:54.245 --> 00:12:55.590
thank goodness.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.580
And it's an enormously
complex thing

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.670
with huge amounts
of order in it--

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.910
huge amounts of rules
and structure to it--

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.477
rules that we're not even
aware of and yet we use.

00:13:07.477 --> 00:13:09.810
For example, the rule that
if you use a word frequently,

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.870
it becomes very short.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.400
And if-- and that
you can't change

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.740
the meanings of
short words but you

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.281
can change the
meanings of long words

00:13:16.281 --> 00:13:18.617
that are infrequently
used-- those kind of rules.

00:13:18.617 --> 00:13:20.450
I bet you weren't even
aware of those rules.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.410
I wasn't until I did
some research on this.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.290
And so we're obeying the
rules of the English language

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.060
all the time.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.910
And yet there's no
one enforcing them.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.430
There's no law court
to prosecute you

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.850
if you don't use the
English language correctly,

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.860
at least I hope not.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.690
So that's the kind--
now, you know,

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.515
that's obvious for
the English language.

00:13:42.515 --> 00:13:44.390
I'm trying to say that
a lot of other things,

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.730
like our moral sense, like
our religious behavior,

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:54.590
like our technology actually
are of a similar character.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.440
I go right back 2000
years to the start of this

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.860
to get inspiration from a
wonderful Roman poet called

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.620
Lucretius, who wrote a poem
called, "De Rerum Natura,"

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.580
"On the Nature of Things" around
the time of Cicero and Caesar.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.420
He died while writing it because
it seems to be unfinished.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.692
The poem disappeared
for 14 centuries

00:14:14.692 --> 00:14:16.275
because the Christians
didn't like it.

00:14:16.275 --> 00:14:22.440
It was rediscovered in a
German monastery in 1417.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.550
And that the wonderful
thing about that poem,

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.620
which expresses the
epicurean philosophy,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.520
is that it's tremendously modern
in the way it sees the world.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.510
And it basically
says that the world

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.610
consists of atoms and voids.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.720
Nothing else.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.960
There are no spirits or
gods or special features

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.250
of living creatures as
opposed to non-living things.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.041
Living things are made
from atoms and voids

00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:48.780
just like non-living things are.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.670
Well, that's right actually.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.790
2000 years on, we know
that he got that right.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.380
And all that you do
to make new things

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.840
and to make living creatures
is recombine atoms and voids

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.690
in different combinations.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.620
And so he gets very, very
close to describing evolution

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.430
by natural selection
2000 years ago.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.760
And the rediscovery
of "De Rerum Natura"

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.490
was a fantastically
important event.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.980
It became terribly
influential on philosophers

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.810
of the Renaissance and the
Reformation, as well as

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:20.620
the Enlightenment.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.680
From Spinoza to
Thomas Jefferson,

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.390
there were a lot of people who
were huge fans of this poem.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:29.740
And I think-- I'm sort of
saying we should understand it

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.570
today and move on with it.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.490
Adam Smith, in 759, wrote a
book called "The Theory of Moral

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.870
Sentiments," before he wrote
his book-- his more famous book,

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:44.460
"The Wealth of Nations," which
expresses this bottom up view

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.900
of the world really rather well.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.990
And it's a very
subversive book because it

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.540
says that morality is something
we decide among ourselves

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.500
as ordinary people by
calibrating our behavior

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.040
against other people's
reactions to our behavior.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.200
So essentially, you
decide based on how

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:09.170
people react whether killing
is right or wrong, if you like,

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.517
or whether theft
is right or wrong.

00:16:11.517 --> 00:16:13.350
And so it will come to
different conclusions

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.470
in different societies
and at different times.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.530
But that it's a sort
of consensus view

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.330
that emerges among people about
what's the right thing to do

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.985
and what's the
wrong thing to do.

00:16:23.985 --> 00:16:26.110
But it's very subversive
because, essentially, he's

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.430
saying we don't need priests
to tell us what's moral.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:31.780
Priests are just telling it--
just reflecting back to us what

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.582
we've decided among ourselves.

00:16:33.582 --> 00:16:35.290
But the priests keep
going around saying,

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.206
if we didn't tell you
what was right or wrong,

00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:38.130
you'd have no idea.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.463
And he's saying that's not true.

00:16:39.463 --> 00:16:42.884
People work out among themselves
what's right or wrong.

00:16:42.884 --> 00:16:44.300
But, of course,
Smith then went on

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.980
to write "The
Wealth of Nations,"

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.010
which makes the same
argument about the economy,

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:56.600
that essentially the economy
is not run by the government.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.730
It doesn't matter
whether someone's

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.356
in charge of deciding who
trades with who, who makes what.

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:04.480
What counts is that
people have the chance

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.869
to negotiate among
themselves and supply

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.010
and demand and the
price system will

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.079
produce a surprising amount
of order and sophistication

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:18.290
and detail without anybody
being in charge of it.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.270
And he famously put
it, "the sovereign

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:26.710
is completely discharged from
the duty in the attempting

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.690
to perform, which he
must always be exposed

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:33.940
to innumerable delusions and for
the proper performance of which

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.280
no human wisdom or knowledge
could ever be sufficient,

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.230
that is the duty
of superintending

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.910
the industry of private
people and of directing it

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.520
towards the employment
most suitable

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.350
to the interests of society."

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:48.270
In other words, if someone
tried to tell New York

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:51.190
today how to organize
itself, how to feed itself,

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:54.550
you know, how to get the right
amounts of food to the right--

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.820
to everybody in
New York tomorrow,

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.560
we would fail
dismally, you know.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.240
It would be a right
cockup if someone was

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.820
in charge of feeding New York.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.794
And yet, New York
gets fed every day.

00:18:04.794 --> 00:18:06.210
Just the right
amount of food gets

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.070
to the right amount
of places every day

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.920
because of spontaneous order.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.990
So I'm making quite
a direct analogy here

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.890
between economics and ecology,
between the way a rain

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.970
forest comes into
being and functions

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:24.010
and between the way an economy
comes into being and functions.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.980
Each species has its
place in the rain forest.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.270
Each business has its
place in the economy

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.920
of a city or a country,
but not because someone has

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.694
decided and planned
that each species should

00:18:36.694 --> 00:18:38.360
be in the right place
in the rain forest

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:44.150
or which company should be in
the right place in the economy.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.530
By the way, this idea,
trying to extend evolution

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.370
to cultural and social
and economic systems,

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:55.490
is exactly the opposite
of Social Darwinism.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:00.000
That phrase, which was used in
the 19th century for the idea

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.140
that we should understand
evolution and interfere

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.700
in human reproduction in order
to achieve progress in society.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.350
That we should
actually tell people

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.516
whether they can or can't
breed, whether they should

00:19:13.516 --> 00:19:15.490
or shouldn't be sterilized,
and whether they

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.270
should or shouldn't live.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.900
That's essentially the
Social Darwinist idea.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.610
Because if we don't
do that, society

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.650
will deteriorate,
whereas if we do do that,

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.230
society will progress.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.760
This is the exact
opposite of that.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.510
This is saying, evolution
is not happening

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:34.900
within cultures and societies
irrespective of what

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.740
we do to the biology of people.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.110
So that the great thing is ideas
can compete and, if necessary,

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:46.250
die so that people
don't have to die.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:51.840
So this is, I think, a far
more humane view of the world.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.660
There is now a very
sophisticated theory

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.090
of cultural evolution.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.080
Rob Boyd, Pete
Richerson, and Joe Henrik

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.660
are the main
protagonists of this.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.380
And it's been
modeled very closely

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.780
to understand how culture
evolves and whether it evolves

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.697
and under what conditions it
will show natural selection.

00:20:09.697 --> 00:20:11.280
And it turns out
that these are really

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.980
quite permissive conditions.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.580
In other words, you don't have
to have a very close analogy

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.620
to genetics, to
faithful replication,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.980
and to strong selection.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.260
You can have weak selection and
not very faithful replication

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.590
of ideas and cultures.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.460
And you will still get
a natural selection,

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.240
leading to a constructive
spontaneous order.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.240
We tend to walk around
assuming that someone's

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.030
in charge, as I said.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.420
And when we see
something being done,

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.030
we assume it's
either being planned

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.770
or it's being messed up by
someone, whereas it might be

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.710
being emerging spontaneously.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.480
And this is a
manifestation of what's

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.830
sometimes called the Great
Man Theory of history.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:03.640
And it goes right back to
sort of deep instincts, which

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.400
are that we tend to have
the intentional stance.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.340
When a thunderstorm--
when somebody gets

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.330
hit by a bolt of
lightning, there's

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.384
a little bit of us
that says, oh, yeah,

00:21:16.384 --> 00:21:17.800
he must have done
something sinful

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.800
in order to deserve that.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.890
Or there must have been
purpose behind that.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:25.220
We find it hard to believe
that the events are

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.920
random in that sense.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.490
And that, I think, leads
us to credit people

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.750
with too much credit when things
go right, the person in charge,

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.390
and to blame them
when things go wrong.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.989
And it-- sure, it's true that
great men can take history

00:21:38.989 --> 00:21:40.530
by the scruff of
the neck and turn it

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:44.000
in a different direction, but
usually in a bad direction.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.840
As Lord Acton said, great
men are mostly bad men.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.710
Hitler, you know, undoubtedly
had an influence on history.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.370
Hitler was not a
bottom up phenomenon.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:59.280
He was a top down
phenomenon and a bad one.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.950
Now, what does this mean for
technology and innovation

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.600
and the kind of
business you work in?

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.880
And it's a little subversive.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.810
I'm here to say that individual
inventors, individual geniuses

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.560
probably don't matter as
much as you think-- that it's

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.860
ordinary people interacting
with each other that

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.780
produce the results.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.090
To give you an
example, Thomas Edison

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.510
gets the credit for
discovering the light bulb.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.820
But if you go back and
look at history closely,

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.510
there are 23 different people
who deserve just as much credit

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.730
for inventing the light
bulb, independently

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.300
around the world
in the same decade

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.687
to roughly the same idea.

00:22:39.687 --> 00:22:41.270
I mean, there's
obviously differences.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.450
In Britain, we say
Joseph Swan deserves

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.550
the credit for the light
bulb, not Thomas Edison.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.570
In Russia, they say Lodygin
deserves the credit.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.810
And we're not wrong.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.560
These people did come up
with the idea independently.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.870
It's just Thomas Edison was the
best businessman among them.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.420
And what that's telling you is
that the light bulb was ripe.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.030
It was ready to be
invented at that time.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.004
It was inevitable that
in that decade someone

00:23:03.004 --> 00:23:04.170
would invent the light bulb.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.950
And the same is true of
scientific discoveries.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.400
Charles Darwin came up with
the idea of natural selection

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.842
because Alfred Russel
Wallace was threatening

00:23:10.842 --> 00:23:12.300
to pip him to the
post because he'd

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.270
come up with the same idea.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:18.450
Newton came up with calculus,
so did Leibniz at the same time.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.010
Einstein came up with
special relativity.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.290
If he had fallen under
a bus, Hendrik Lorentz

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.747
would have come up with it
when within a few years.

00:23:25.747 --> 00:23:27.580
Watson and Crick
discovered the double helix

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.740
in the early 1950s.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.876
If they didn't exist
or if, as Crick once

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:33.000
put it, if Watson had been
killed by a tennis ball,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.041
what would have happened?

00:23:34.041 --> 00:23:36.326
Well, then, undoubtedly,
someone would

00:23:36.326 --> 00:23:37.950
have discovered the
double helix of DNA

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.540
probably within a year
of that discovery.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.250
So in that sense, great
scientists and inventors

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.920
are dispensable.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.960
I mean, somebody needs
to do the discovery.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.030
But it doesn't
really matter who.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.640
And we tend to give too much
credit to the person who's

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.060
there at the time.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.300
Google is surely a
good example of this.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.820
When Google came into existence
in 1994, I think around then,

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.730
it was one of many
search engines

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.340
that were already out there.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.830
The search engine had to
be invented around that.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.091
I mean, it was--
by the way, I think

00:24:08.091 --> 00:24:10.090
it's one of the great
inventions of my lifetime.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.150
I use it every day.

00:24:14.885 --> 00:24:18.430
We wouldn't use the word
Google for searching today

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.260
if Google hadn't existed.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:24.300
But we would certainly
know the concept.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.750
And so-- and that's
characteristic

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.240
of an evolutionary
system, that it's

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.280
moving under its own steam.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.530
The technology is choosing
its inventors rather than

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.090
the other way around.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.660
You can see why this is a little
bit subversive and perhaps

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.627
not terribly popular
with-- I wrote

00:24:42.627 --> 00:24:45.210
some of this in a "Wall Street
Journal" article the other day,

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.420
and elite scientists and
inventors don't really

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.590
like this idea because it
tends to take them down a peg.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.650
And I'm not saying
that they don't matter.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.370
And I'm not saying that
we shouldn't be investing

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.950
in discovery and invention.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.670
Of course, we should.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.960
It's just that we
need to understand

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.150
that this is a system
with its own momentum

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:10.840
that we need to encourage
and draw out rather than try

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.690
and plan and decide
what happens next.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.310
Just to ram home the point
about simultaneous discovery,

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:20.332
Kevin Kelly documents in his
book "What Technology Wants"

00:25:20.332 --> 00:25:22.790
that we know of six different
inventors of the thermometer,

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.130
three of the hypodermic
needle, four of vaccination,

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.580
four of decimal fractions,
five of the electric telegraph,

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.980
four of photography,
three of logarithms,

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.980
five of the steamboat, and
six of the electric railroad.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.140
And even if you go back
and look at Harry Potter,

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.220
it turns out there
are lots of books

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.770
about wizards who use owls that
come out around the same time.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.780
It's really weird
some of the things

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.950
that happen in that sense.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.100
The internet itself is
a really good example

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.970
of a thing that is the
result of human action

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.420
but not of human design.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.120
Now, you may say
people were involved

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.240
in the inventions that
led to the internet

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.040
and the design is part of it.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.190
But actually, if
you look closely,

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.480
you know, someone
was bound to come up

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.570
with packet switching as an idea
and all the other technologies

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.700
involved in it.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.290
If DARPA hadn't come
up with the ARPANET,

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.170
it would have emerged somewhere.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.310
It's impossible in
the state of computing

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.910
and communications of
the 1980s and 1990s

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.140
that computers wouldn't
have got connected

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.230
and some form of internet
would have emerged.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:37.132
And if CERN hadn't employed Tim
Berners-Lee to invent the World

00:26:37.132 --> 00:26:38.840
Wide Web, someone else
would have come up

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.860
something very, very similar.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.640
Actually, the origin
of the internet

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.390
really lies in lots and
lots of ordinary people

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.120
doing peer-to-peer networking.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.940
That's the crucial--
that's the hard work that

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.850
was done to put the
internet together,

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.850
people who you've never
heard of and people

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:59.050
who are often involved in
the sort of sharing model.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.640
It's very much a
bottom up thing.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.390
Actually, Steven Berlin
Johnson points out

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.014
that the internet is
not even bottom up

00:27:04.014 --> 00:27:06.090
because that implies
that there's a top, which

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.810
there isn't to the internet.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:08.920
Nobody's in charge of it.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.364
There is no central committee
of it, thank goodness.

00:27:11.364 --> 00:27:13.530
People keep trying to get
in charge of the internet,

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.070
as I'm sure you know.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:18.980
But long may they stay out
of it and long may it evolve.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.670
Where's it going
next, the internet?

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.360
I think the internet is
artificial intelligence,

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.260
if you like, because human
intelligence is basically

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.270
a collective phenomenon.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:31.500
We share ideas and
collaborate on things.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.092
And I think artificial
intelligence

00:27:33.092 --> 00:27:35.300
is going to prove to be a
collective phenomenon, too.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.540
I don't think individual robots
is where it's coming from.

00:27:40.942 --> 00:27:42.400
I don't know where
it's going next.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.640
But I do have my suspicions.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.200
And by the way, you
shouldn't take this as gospel

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.210
because nobody can predict
the future at all well.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.830
The block chain looks to me
like the most interesting thing

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.470
that's coming next
because of the ability

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.570
that it has to
build trust, which

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:06.456
is crucial to economic activity,
without a third party being

00:28:06.456 --> 00:28:07.830
involved, whether
it's government

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:12.040
or lawyers or other
expensive people like that.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.830
Where does blocked
chain come from?

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.000
Well, we give one bloke
the credit for it.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.420
He's called Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.430
But luckily, we don't
know who he is although we

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.500
have our suspicions.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.440
But actually, even when
you go back to that,

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.260
it could well be that Satoshi
Nakamoto is a combination

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.230
of two people or three people.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.630
And the whole idea is
gradually now emerging

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.310
through the interactions of
lots of different people.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:41.810
So I think that's kind of
the future of the internet.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:45.040
It hasn't-- if it's
evolving as I say,

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.610
then it's hardly
started its evolution.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.850
There's an enormous
amount of development

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:55.050
to go in the way the internet
is going to develop and change

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:56.830
our lives.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:00.690
And just to end on a
sort of funny story

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:02.590
about a friend of mine
in the House of Lords,

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:06.800
who's a bit too
elderly to get involved

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.420
in some of these internet
things, as he calls them.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.264
Social media, he
recognizes, I mean,

00:29:14.264 --> 00:29:15.680
he finds it just
too difficult. He

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.970
says I can't be bothered
with social media.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:20.915
I don't really even
know how to use it.

00:29:20.915 --> 00:29:22.539
I don't know what's
this Twitter thing?

00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:25.000
What's this Facebook thing?

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.460
But he realizes it's important.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.920
And it's part of life so
he's got to understand it.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.630
And he's got to--
so he's decided

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:35.880
what he's going to do is to
do in real life what people do

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.397
on social media.

00:29:38.397 --> 00:29:39.980
So he goes out to
people in the street

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.550
and tells them he likes
them and shows them

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.420
pictures of his
cats and his wife

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.940
and tells them what
he had for breakfast

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.322
and that kind of thing.

00:29:49.322 --> 00:29:50.030
And he's working.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:50.950
He's got followers.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:55.270
He's got two policemen and
a social worker after him.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:59.670
So evolution is
happening to all of us.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:01.150
Thank you very much.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.003
I'm happy to take questions.

00:30:03.003 --> 00:30:04.975
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:09.406 --> 00:30:11.030
MATT RIDLEY: Yeah go
to the microphone.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:11.863
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:30:11.863 --> 00:30:12.870
MATT RIDLEY: Thank you.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:16.490
AUDIENCE: One of the things
that evolution tends to produce

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.350
is hierarchy.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.990
There's hierarchy in the
sense of our nervous system.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.300
There is hierarchy in the
sense of most governments

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.840
are hierarchical in some form.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.520
The internet is hierarchical
in a lot of ways.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.520
Google may have arisen from a
bunch of competing products.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.880
But now, we are-- you know,
the biggest search engine

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.350
is run by a large hierarchy.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.870
How does that play in
with your overall thesis?

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.160
MATT RIDLEY: Well, I would
challenge you slightly

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.200
and say that it doesn't produce
as much hierarchy as we think.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.220
So, for example, when the
genome was being sequenced,

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.662
there were people saying, now
what's really interesting,

00:30:53.662 --> 00:30:55.370
we're going to find
out the master genes.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:58.490
Let's work out what
the master genes are.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.730
And that idea just faded
away as people realized

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.330
there are no master genes.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.910
The genome is a completely
paralleled network thing,

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:06.410
you know.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:10.900
It's ridiculous to say one gene
is more important than another.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.770
And I would say that
the internet's still

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.300
a pretty unhierarchical place.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.950
I mean, you say
it's got hierarchy.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.860
Is that really true?

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.960
It's true, though.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.710
I think what you're
getting at, and you're

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:27.740
absolutely right, is that
when we set up organizations,

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.010
we tend to make them like
armies with generals and then

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:34.420
colonels and then majors
and that kind of thing.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:39.440
And that has been the
fate of most companies.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.100
It's not absolutely essential
that we do it that way.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.480
And I have a section in the book
on a wonderful company called

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.920
Morningstar Tomatoes, which is
the biggest tomato processing

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.220
company in the world, based
in northern California,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.410
which is completely
without hierarchy.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:55.950
Totally.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.460
There is no chief executive.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.310
There's nothing.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.960
People negotiate
with their peers

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.840
their salary and their job
description when they join.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.110
And you know, you can vote
each other out of the company.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.769
It's an extremely
successful company.

00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:11.810
There are other companies
who are looking at that

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.060
and saying, how do we do that.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.872
And every time people
get interested in it

00:32:14.872 --> 00:32:16.580
and go back to their
ranch and say, look,

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.980
we should really try and
emulate this company,

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.850
they run up against their
existing hierarchies, which

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.210
say look, we can't
possibly do that.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:28.040
So I think we haven't
yet tried very hard

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:32.210
in the corporate sphere to build
things without hierarchies.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.049
Now, again, you might
say this is a bit rich

00:32:34.049 --> 00:32:35.840
coming from a member
of the House of Lords.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.350
And you wouldn't be wrong.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:41.090
I live inside hierarchies, too.

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.550
I don't think the nervous
system has much of a hierarchy.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:48.010
Again, we've tended to think in
terms of one bit of the brain

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.950
being in charge of the rest.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.660
But it's actually a misleading
way to think about the brain.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:53.700
It's very parallel.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.850
It's very flat in that sense.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:02.710
So hierarchy comes from
our top down tendencies

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.344
rather than from
evolution itself,

00:33:04.344 --> 00:33:06.760
which is a much more bottom
up thing-- would be my answer.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.860
AUDIENCE: So since you
brought up the House of Lords,

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.620
this is off-topic
but can you tell us

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.920
more about just House of Lords
and interesting things that

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.800
go on there.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.883
More specifically, I guess,
what I'd be interested

00:33:23.883 --> 00:33:25.920
in is to what extent
do, I mean, it's

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.670
obviously very rare
for the House of Lords

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:29.640
to do anything to
actually stop a bill.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.970
But there has to have been some
incident where there was-- does

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.250
each member research
a proposed bill

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:38.020
to stall themselves
or you get told

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.690
by the Whips or the
parliamentary equivalent,

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:43.060
it'd be like, hey,
do something here?

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.220
Or is it just so quiet
that you don't even-- just

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.260
to show up every
once in a while.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.330
MATT RIDLEY: No, 10
days ago, we were

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.690
in the middle of a huge
constitutional crisis caused

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.410
by us overreaching our
powers and turning down

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:56.800
a government money
measure, which

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.110
hasn't happened since 1911.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.870
And you know, the
television cameras

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.986
were live watching us vote.

00:34:03.986 --> 00:34:06.850
And we, the government
side, lost the vote.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:11.610
And that meant
that the bill died.

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:13.350
And this-- there
were a lot of people

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:14.560
saying this is outrageous.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.440
This is flouting the will of the
elected House of the Commons.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.659
So no, as it happens,
things have just

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:22.380
got rather exciting in the
House of Lords in recent weeks.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.854
And that's because
the government party

00:34:24.854 --> 00:34:27.020
is very strong in the House
of Commons but very weak

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.460
in the House of Lords, as for
various reasons at the moment.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.210
How does it work?

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:35.889
It's the Upper House of the
British Parliament, in theory.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:38.170
But because it's
unelected, it's supposed

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.868
to have very, very few powers.

00:34:39.868 --> 00:34:41.409
We don't have a
written constitution.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:44.300
So what we do is we work these
out in terms of conventions,

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.469
in terms of habits.

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:47.314
And it's been agreed
for about 100 years

00:34:47.314 --> 00:34:48.730
that the House of
Lords will never

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.080
really stop the Commons
passing legislation.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.719
But it will insist on amending
it in kind of sensible way.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:59.630
So the question is,
what's a sensible way?

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:03.470
So we debate every bill that
goes through Parliament.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.100
We amend them.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.020
Often, we-- our job is
to scrutinize and improve

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:08.650
legislation.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:09.530
That's the theory.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.710
We tend not to vote
purely on party lines,

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.060
although there is-- that's
increasingly not true.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.320
Increasingly, it is
getting party line.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.500
But there's a
balance of power held

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.080
by so-called crossbenchers,
who are nonpartisan.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.570
Most people are appointed.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:30.100
Some get there
because they inherit

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.149
the right to stand for
a [INAUDIBLE] election

00:35:32.149 --> 00:35:32.690
to get there.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.856
It's really weird but this
is a temporary situation.

00:35:34.856 --> 00:35:37.900
That's how I got there.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:42.510
So I mean, I'm going way down
into the details of the very

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.300
odd British constitution here.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.150
But we are a democracy.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.670
We're run by the
House of Commons.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.680
That's where 90% of the
power lies in Britain.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.010
But the House of Lords is a kind
of revising chamber attached

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:57.532
to the House of Commons.

00:35:57.532 --> 00:35:58.990
And we're in the
middle of a crisis

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:03.210
about its role at the
moment so watch this space.

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.814
That was rather more
than you bargained for,

00:36:05.814 --> 00:36:07.980
I think, in terms of British
constitutional history.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:08.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
as far as I'm concerned.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.570
MATT RIDLEY: But OK, just
one thing about how we're

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.540
hierarchical, every day when
I sit in the House of Lords,

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.830
I look up and there
are these statues

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:21.690
of men in suits of armor
around the-- above the--

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.380
between the windows.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.800
Those are the barons who signed
Magna Carta 800 years ago

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.770
this year and brought in--
and now, admittedly, they

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:32.720
were pretty elitist
blokes themselves.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.040
But they brought in
this idea that even

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.340
the king must be subject
to the law, which

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.980
was a totally new idea and
a very far-reaching one,

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.940
and one that had an
enormous influence

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.970
on your founding fathers,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.899
Sorry, enough on that.

00:36:47.899 --> 00:36:49.440
AUDIENCE: Could you
talk a little bit

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.250
about patent and copyright
law in light of the idea

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.746
that ideas intermingle in
order to create new ideas

00:36:56.746 --> 00:36:58.370
and that the person
who came up with it

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.560
isn't particularly important
and that maybe they

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.554
shouldn't own that idea?

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:04.970
MATT RIDLEY: Yes,
and I'm somewhat

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.090
of an anarchist on this.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.410
I think we've gone
much too far in terms

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:12.039
of intellectual property rights
and intellectual protection.

00:37:12.039 --> 00:37:13.580
I think, on the
whole, it's beginning

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:17.070
to stifle invention rather
than encourage invention.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.140
I think, on the whole,
the whole business

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.040
of giving either a Nobel
Prize or a patent to somebody

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.634
tends to be a bit unfair.

00:37:25.634 --> 00:37:27.550
Because although they've
done a brilliant job,

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.680
so has the person one link
down in the chain or one

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.040
link up in the chain.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:38.340
And so, that said, you know,
the purpose of a patent

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:44.570
was to persuade an inventor
to publish what he'd done so

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.310
that other people could use it.

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:49.850
That's what the word
means, to make it

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.600
patent, that what you've
done-- not to keep it a secret.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.220
And to some extent, you do
still find that that does help.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.110
The fact that people
are publishing patents

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.620
does get information
out there that

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.150
would otherwise stay secret.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:05.610
But increasingly, outside
the pharmaceutical sector

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.090
where patents do play
a very important role

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:11.850
because of the enormous
cost of safety testing

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.650
before you bring
something forward so

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.300
that there needs to be a reward
for people to doing that.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.130
But outside the
pharmaceutical sector,

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:21.910
I'm bothered by the fact
that patents are increasingly

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:27.100
used as tollbooths,
as barriers to entry,

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:32.450
as ways of milking revenue
from-- by suing companies

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:36.740
for trespassing on your
property rather than as ways

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.720
to help innovation in itself.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.730
Patent troll is the phrase used
for companies that do that.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.580
I think it's gone too
far in that direction.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.580
A little bit of intellectual
property protection

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.870
is a good thing.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:50.510
Too much is a bad thing.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.070
I think, particularly
in the US, it's

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.700
slightly too far to that side.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.770
Copyright.

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:57.110
Well, as an author, you'd
think I'd defend copyright.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:58.666
Actually I don't.

00:38:58.666 --> 00:39:02.990
I think it's ridiculous that
for 70 years after my death,

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:06.040
you will not be able to reprint
my words without the permission

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.720
of my executors, except unless
you do a very small chunk.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.810
That's completely crazy.

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:17.090
I mean, I quoted a couple
of lines from the song,

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:19.720
"What a Wonderful
World" in my last book.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.360
And I discovered
I had to approach

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.930
three different owners of
the copyright on that--

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.390
and why it was three.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.613
And I had to pay $250 to
each of them or something.

00:39:30.613 --> 00:39:31.830
That's mad.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.970
I mean, this song was
written in the 1920s.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:37.660
Everybody knows the words.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.504
Yet if you print them, you have
to pay these-- so Shakespeare

00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:42.420
didn't have copyright.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.190
People wrote down
his plays hurriedly

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.350
in the back of the theater
and then published them.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:50.446
Didn't stop him writing plays.

00:39:50.446 --> 00:39:55.350
I think we've gone
far too far to assuage

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:58.260
Walt Disney Company on this.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:05.250
AUDIENCE: So it sounds like a
lot of what you're describing

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.680
is like memes, as described
by Richard Dawkins,

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.310
refined by Susan Blackmore.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:14.280
Can you comment on if you,
like, endorse their ideas?

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.580
Or are you presenting
something subtlely different?

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.070
MATT RIDLEY: It is and
it isn't the same thing.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.315
I'm a great fan of
Richard Dawkins' work.

00:40:23.315 --> 00:40:24.940
Generally, I think
the idea of the meme

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.590
was a really useful idea.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.230
I think Susan Blackmore's
exposition of it, as you said,

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.680
was brilliant actually.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.570
And she made a very
persuasive case

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.410
that, actually, this
is quite a useful way

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:37.810
of looking at the world.

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:41.650
But it slightly predates this
Pete Richerson, Rob Boyd,

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:46.590
and Joe Henrik model of cultural
evolution, which essentially

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:53.510
says that the stuff that evolves
doesn't have to be particles.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:56.060
It doesn't have to
be lumps, as it were.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.060
The meme is an attempt
to say, like a gene,

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.930
you know, there have to be
units of information that

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.340
compete with other
units of information.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.500
It can be much more
blurred around the edges

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.410
than that theory implies.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:16.920
It can-- the object
can expand and contract

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.780
and include other things.

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.030
And yet, you still
get evolution in it.

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:22.960
So I think it's a
bit restrictive,

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.990
that way of looking at it.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.360
And while I think it's
a huge contribution,

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:31.550
I feel it's moved on since then.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:33.600
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.590
I have a question.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:39.010
So as we know,
evolution is the process

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.870
by which things change
to fit their environment.

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:46.780
And the ones that best fit
the environment continue.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.340
This doesn't always mean
that those things are better

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.602
for humanity or for us.

00:41:51.602 --> 00:41:53.560
It doesn't mean that
they're better in any way,

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.390
depending on how
you define better.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.070
As you said before,
you know, Hitler

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:59.640
can be seen as a
top down phenomenon.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.970
But I guess, he could also
be seen as a bottom up one

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:06.670
because he was in an environment
that did produce such a person.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:09.280
So my question is if,
you know-- how do we

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:14.780
reconcile our own agency to
actually change things and plan

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.610
things if we're looking at the
world from this kind of not

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:20.890
purely naturalistic view where
everything is kind of chaotic

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:21.840
and happening?

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.560
MATT RIDLEY: Yeah, I don't
think everything is chaotic,

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.059
by the way.

00:42:24.059 --> 00:42:26.570
I think the great thing
about natural selection

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.524
is it produces non-chaos
out of chaos, if you like.

00:42:29.524 --> 00:42:30.690
And you're absolutely right.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.300
There's a bottom up nature
to the early 20th century

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.300
dictators.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.964
There's something about
the state of technology,

00:42:36.964 --> 00:42:38.880
the state of society in
the early 20th century

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.825
that encourages the emergence
of demagogue dictators,

00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:43.840
you know, Mussolini,
Hitler, Stalin, you know.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.800
There's plenty of them,
Franco, et cetera.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.610
And I think it's radio.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.510
I think the invention
of radio was

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:57.660
a technology that helped
demagogue populist dictators

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:58.640
to come to power.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.670
And if you notice Oswald
Mosley, the man who

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:04.531
tried to become
Britain's dictator,

00:43:04.531 --> 00:43:06.280
the one thing he really
wanted from Hitler

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.720
was money to help start another
radio station, you know.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.630
So I think the role
of radio in the 1920s

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:17.560
and '30s is, as it were,
a bottom up phenomenon

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.840
driving dictatorships.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.040
So you're not wrong there.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.830
And yes, bad things
can evolve just

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.160
as good things can
evolve-- computer viruses,

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.150
cybercrime, you know.

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.440
There's evolution happening
in those kind of things.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.480
But as those two
examples, computer viruses

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.420
and cybercrimes,
show on the whole

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.670
the good guys will win because
the good guys can do it

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:37.250
in the light.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.679
The bad guys have to
do it in the dark.

00:43:39.679 --> 00:43:41.720
And therefore, when you're
doing it in the light,

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.740
more people can join in.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.660
More people can
contribute to it.

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.550
That's one point.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:50.000
And the second point is
that the selection part

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.790
of natural selection,
in the case

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:57.090
of evolution of human
institutions and culture,

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:58.970
is us ourselves.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:03.910
We're choosing whether to
adopt a new technology or not.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.420
And if something is
really bad for us,

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.380
we're not going to choose it.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.389
And if it's really
good for us, we are.

00:44:10.389 --> 00:44:11.930
So in that sense,
there's going to be

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:14.090
a bias towards good
things emerging

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.350
from this process rather
than bad things, I think.

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:19.530
That's sort of my
answer to your question.

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.550
That's where agency
comes in-- human agency--

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:28.240
because humans are the agents of
natural selection in this kind

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.830
of evolutionary system.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:31.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:33.380
AUDIENCE: I was wondering,
do you think it makes sense

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:38.372
to only rely on this bottom
up efforts to improve humanity

00:44:38.372 --> 00:44:39.580
and go forward in the future?

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.960
Or do you think there is a
role for some top down efforts,

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:42.459
as well?

00:44:42.459 --> 00:44:45.300
Like, just to give an
example-- the Apollo program,

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.700
very sort of top down effort.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.050
We haven't had anything
really close to it since then

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:52.870
because there hasn't been such a
huge government emphasis on it.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:54.850
And a lot of people, me
included and certainly

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.560
a lot of Googlers, would
say that getting into space

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.240
is obviously a very important
future goal for our species--

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.189
multiple baskets and
whatever-- or eggs, yeah, don't

00:45:03.189 --> 00:45:05.730
put all your eggs in one basket,
whatever that kind of thing.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.240
So what do you think about that?

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.790
MATT RIDLEY: Yes, you're right.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.800
Of course, there's a role
occasionally for top down.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.820
It would be wrong to ban
anyone from ever doing anything

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.460
in a directed planned
or top down way.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.020
The Apollo program
is a good example.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:28.300
But it's probably an
example of something that,

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.640
would it have emerged anyway
without government doing it?

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.080
I suspect it might.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:37.980
I mean, going to the moon
would have been something

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:42.240
that ordinary people
would have come up with

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.770
and got together the
finance for by now--

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:51.840
maybe not by 1969--
among themselves.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.370
It's true that-- but why
hasn't it lead anywhere?

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:58.230
I mean, given that we've got the
technology to go to the moon,

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.567
why has it not been followed up?

00:46:00.567 --> 00:46:02.650
Partly, as you say, because
government has decided

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:04.870
it doesn't want to
keep going to the moon.

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:08.621
It's got better-- or different
priorities for its money.

00:46:08.621 --> 00:46:10.370
And partly, because
we haven't figured out

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:12.050
a use for going to the moon yet.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:14.600
I think that's the really
big, big difference.

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:21.820
I think, yeah, I mean, I'm
perfectly happy to say, yes,

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.940
occasionally, we should
do top down things,

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.014
and to heck with
evolution, as it were.

00:46:28.014 --> 00:46:29.680
It doesn't matter
that evolution doesn't

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.960
want us to go to the moon.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.930
Let's try and go there anyway.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:37.280
I just think that
we need to recognize

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:42.580
that an awful lot of the time we
solve our problems by allowing

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.460
the evolution of the solution
rather than the imposition

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.950
of the solution.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:51.390
And a really nice
example for me of that

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:54.160
is China's one
child policy, which

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:58.420
is a very top down solution
to a problem of population.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:01.520
It literally came about because
a rocket engineer called

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:05.435
[INAUDIBLE] went to a
conference in Helsinki

00:47:05.435 --> 00:47:08.630
in 1978 on control
systems theory,

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:15.380
and there he came across a lot
of the population movement's

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.120
concerns about
population explosion

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.270
and a lot of the writing
in the West, which

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.610
was talking about the need
to compulsorily control

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:23.810
populations.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:25.960
And he went back and
translated that into a policy,

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.580
became very powerful, and
the whole policy took off.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.920
And we now know that it
wasn't a great success.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.590
It was probably a failure
because the population growth

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:37.570
rate in China had fallen faster
without coercion before it

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:39.290
was brought in than afterwards.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:41.754
So it was a failure in
terms of its outcome.

00:47:41.754 --> 00:47:43.170
But it was also a
failure in terms

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:45.040
of being a very inhumane policy.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.690
So that's an
example of something

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:50.960
where the bottom up solution,
the demographic transition

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.060
whereby as soon as people get
a bit wealthier and healthier

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.060
and better educated, they
will lower their birth

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:59.640
rate because people like to
invest in quality of children

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.400
rather than quantity--
that the bottom up solution

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.130
would be better than
the top down one.

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:05.680
But you're right.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.721
There are other examples,
like the Apollo program

00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:08.505
is a good one.

00:48:08.505 --> 00:48:09.455
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.640
AUDIENCE: In your theory
of general evolution here,

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.430
have you formulated
any views on meaning

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.800
and whether any
meaning can be left

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.240
if everything is just
goalless evolution

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.990
toward some unknown end?

00:48:31.584 --> 00:48:33.250
MATT RIDLEY: What's
the meaning of life?

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.650
42 is the answer, isn't it?

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:37.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:40.330
MATT RIDLEY: I was a great
friend of Douglas Adams.

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:45.190
So you know, I think a lot
of his "Hitchhiker's Guide

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:46.160
to the Galaxy."

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.924
The computer comes up
with the answer 42.

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:55.620
I, personally-- and this
is where it's up to you

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:59.770
as a person-- I, personally,
have no problem with the idea

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.940
that life is in the
end meaningless,

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:08.740
you know, that I'm the
product of a natural process.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.720
I find that actually
much more magnificent

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:16.180
that for four billion years,
living creatures have gradually

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:21.080
changed to produce
me-- silly little me.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.656
You know, none of my
ancestors died young.

00:49:23.656 --> 00:49:25.000
It's a weird thought, isn't it?

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:25.690
But it's true.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.052
Most creatures die
before they get to breed,

00:49:28.052 --> 00:49:29.260
but none of my ancestors did.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.010
None of your
ancestors did, either.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:34.260
Because otherwise, they
wouldn't have bred, et cetera.

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:38.370
You know, I think there's
true-- as Charles Darwin put it,

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:41.020
there is grandeur
in this view of life

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.300
that gives it much more
meaning than any idea

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:46.680
that we're here with a purpose.

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.810
So I'm quite happy to
abandon purpose and still

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:52.770
find meaning in life.

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:55.688
That's not, I know, the way
everyone reacts to this.

00:50:02.606 --> 00:50:03.230
One more, good.

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:09.170
AUDIENCE: So I
haven't read the book.

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:13.030
But you talk about sort
of the rate of evolution

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:17.190
perhaps being connected to the
interconnectedness of people

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:21.820
and as well as simply just
like the number of people,

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:26.370
and perhaps how the
internet has certainly

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:31.430
fueled innovation in that way--
but perhaps plans on, like,

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.850
expanding.

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:37.820
For example, going to Mars
and colonizing that as a path

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:44.134
toward accelerating our
evolution essentially.

00:50:44.134 --> 00:50:45.550
MATT RIDLEY: Well
I really enjoyed

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:47.020
that book, "The Martian."

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.580
And I enjoyed the
movie, too, but I

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:52.440
suspect that's a long way
off in terms of helping

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:55.930
our evolution as a society.

00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:59.231
I certainly think
that, I mean, I

00:50:59.231 --> 00:51:00.980
argue that the meeting
and mating of ideas

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.210
is what produces innovation.

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:07.500
And that's why
you get innovation

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:11.160
in places with a lot of trade
throughout history, Renaissance

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:17.115
Italy, [INAUDIBLE] China,
Fuji and Chinese people,

00:51:17.115 --> 00:51:18.240
Gujarat in India, you know.

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.300
Wherever there's
been a lot of trade,

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.710
you tend to get a
lot of innovation.

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:26.200
Victorian England, Holland in
the Golden Age, California,

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.280
today-- you know, et cetera.

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:33.750
And so places where people
can meet other people freely

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:37.570
and invest and be free to do
what they want and then change

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:40.200
ideas are terribly important.

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:43.010
And we've just created a
virtual one of those that's

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:45.070
global-- or very nearly global.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:47.060
Almost everybody
is involved in it.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.090
And that has to be accelerating
the rate of evolution

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:52.550
because a man in
Shanghai can swap ideas

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:54.720
with a man in San
Francisco today-- or sorry,

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.590
a woman in San
Francisco can swap ideas

00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:04.760
with a woman in Shanghai today
just as in a millisecond.

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.360
They don't have to
catch a-- get on a ship

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.690
and go and meet each
other, et cetera.

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:11.690
And even compared
with 20 years ago,

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:13.960
the rate at which ideas
are meeting other ideas

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.220
must be accelerating.

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.590
And that's why I'm slightly
puzzled we're not yet

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.530
seeing what my friends
at Singularity University

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:24.460
say is going to happen,
this incredible acceleration

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.850
of technology.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:27.574
And part of the
problem is we run up

00:52:27.574 --> 00:52:29.740
against diminishing returns
in certain technologies.

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:31.990
So transport has changed
very little in my lifetime,

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:35.040
whereas communication
has changed enormously.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.655
Opposite in my grandparents'
time, communication

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:41.030
changed very little in the
first half of the 20th century

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:42.779
but transport changed
pretty dramatically.

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:52.144
So yes, I think we are
generating possibilities.

00:52:52.144 --> 00:52:53.560
I certainly don't
think innovation

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:54.690
is going to slow down.

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:57.150
And if you look at the
growth of world GDP,

00:52:57.150 --> 00:53:00.130
it's unbelievably steady.

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:01.720
There's one year
since Second World

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:05.920
War when it was negative--
2009, by less than 1%.

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.380
It grew by 5% the next year.

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.290
So it was back on track.

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:12.277
It's just like
this straight line.

00:53:12.277 --> 00:53:13.860
But actually, when
you think about it,

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.960
because it's a percentage
thing, that straight line

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.430
means it's an exponential thing.

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:21.230
Means it's accelerating
all the time.

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:24.100
And you extrapolate that
to the end of this century,

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:27.380
and the average person on the
planet will be about 15 times

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:27.930
as rich.

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:29.430
No, sorry, will be
about three times

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:32.340
as rich as the average
American is today.

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:36.270
Those are unbelievable numbers
when you think about it.

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:38.340
And sure, there's a
lot could go wrong.

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:40.580
And we could hit some
brick walls along the way.

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:44.000
But if that doesn't
happen, the potential

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.680
for what we can do with
innovation for the human race

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:52.124
is truly amazing I
think-- which might

00:53:52.124 --> 00:53:54.040
be a good moment on which
to end because we've

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.165
got three minutes left.

00:53:56.165 --> 00:53:57.490
And anybody else want to--

00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:58.765
AUDIENCE: You have
time for one more?

00:53:58.765 --> 00:53:59.190
MATT RIDLEY: One more.

00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.690
Go for it.

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.950
AUDIENCE: OK, so the
question of hierarchy

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:04.380
keeps coming up as a strategy.

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.730
It's clear that you--
correct me if I'm

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:09.040
wrong-- that you
think you're saying

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.690
we overestimate hierarchy.

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:15.380
We see hierarchies in everything
because it's a natural tendency

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:17.310
to do so.

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:20.670
Evolution has selected
hierarchical behavior

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:23.590
as a strategy because it's
successful, especially

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:24.462
in social animals.

00:54:24.462 --> 00:54:25.170
MATT RIDLEY: Yes.

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:25.680
AUDIENCE: So--

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.260
MATT RIDLEY: Alpha males
in primates, particularly,

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:27.850
yep, yep.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:29.600
AUDIENCE: Just as an
organizing principle

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.300
so that you can mobilize
resources and actually

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.570
accomplish things.

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:38.600
So I'm curious to hear your, you
know-- where you see actually

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:42.880
these hierarchies being useful
as opposed to being encumbering

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.120
things, like, for example,
they did make efforts

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.500
to sort of standardize language
so that we can actually speak

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.420
a common language,
even though that

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:53.250
might have been a natural
process that it came from.

00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:56.500
There seems to be these
two forces of top down,

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.080
us trying to organize
things, and then bottom up,

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.130
things kind of happening.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.519
So my question is, how do you
kind of reconcile the two?

00:55:02.519 --> 00:55:04.810
MATT RIDLEY: Is there anything
top down about language?

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:05.010
I'm--

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:07.170
AUDIENCE: Sure, yeah, I mean,
there are opposing forces

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:07.961
in language, right.

00:55:07.961 --> 00:55:10.730
There's the natural linguistic
laws that shape language

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:13.230
but then there are groups of
people coming together, saying,

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:15.688
like, we're all going to agree
to call this a chair and not

00:55:15.688 --> 00:55:16.900
a fafafa, you know, whatever.

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.840
Because you guys over there call
it one way, we call it another.

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.790
We have to agree-- we agree
implicitly but also explicitly

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:25.069
through, like, standardization
of how to call things.

00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:26.860
MATT RIDLEY: That's
still pretty bottom up.

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:30.190
That's still ordinary people
kind of voting among themselves

00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:33.680
rather than any
hierarchical body.

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.510
Now, it's true
the French set out

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:39.520
to standardize French
language and to extinguish

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.770
non French speakers
within their territory,

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:44.440
you know-- force them, as it
were, to switch to French,

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:44.940
as it were.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.356
And they still
have this committee

00:55:46.356 --> 00:55:48.170
that tries to decide
whether you're allowed

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:51.774
to stay "le weekend" or not.

00:55:51.774 --> 00:55:52.940
But it doesn't get very far.

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:56.550
And look at Esperanto,
that's a top down attempt

00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:59.440
to create a language--
didn't get very far.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.630
So I would challenge
you that there

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:05.881
is really anything very top down
or hierarchical about language.

00:56:05.881 --> 00:56:07.130
AUDIENCE: Couldn't it be both?

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:09.700
Because it doesn't have to be
the government or a large body.

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.200
It could be a group of people
getting together and agreeing,

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.905
though, saying that this is--

00:56:13.905 --> 00:56:14.800
MATT RIDLEY: Is that
really happening?

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.430
I mean, when did
this meeting happen?

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:17.940
AUDIENCE: Internet
standards, for example.

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.439
You know, the
internet wouldn't work

00:56:19.439 --> 00:56:21.920
if we didn't all get together
and agree on certain ways

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.170
that things were going to
communicate with each other.

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:27.306
And that had to happen with
the organized group of people

00:56:27.306 --> 00:56:28.680
saying, like, this
is now-- we're

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.850
going to agree on the truth.

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:31.652
And this is going to go forward.

00:56:31.652 --> 00:56:33.860
MATT RIDLEY: Yeah, but I
would argue that even that--

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:35.460
and correct me if
I'm wrong here--

00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:39.890
was some group of programmers
sort of putting out

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:42.539
their standard and
either being rejected

00:56:42.539 --> 00:56:44.080
by the community at
large or accepted

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.550
by the community at large--
much more than-- I mean,

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:47.890
ICANN, is it called?

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:50.750
The Internet Committee for the--

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:52.350
AUDIENCE: Assigned
Names and Numbers.

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:54.740
MATT RIDLEY: Assigned Names
and Numbers, thank you.

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:56.670
It likes to kind of
pretend it's in charge,

00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:58.120
but I'm not sure it really is.

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.410
In other words, I'm
sort of slightly

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:05.090
saying to you that
I think you're still

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:08.720
falling for a top
down view, which

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.180
isn't correct of these things.

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:12.489
But yes, standards
do have to emerge.

00:57:12.489 --> 00:57:13.780
There's no question about that.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.350
But I think that the internet
standards have emerged

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:17.435
rather than being imposed.

00:57:17.435 --> 00:57:18.310
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:18.806
MATT RIDLEY: Correct
me if I'm wrong.

00:57:18.806 --> 00:57:21.014
AUDIENCE: We could say that
all top down systems have

00:57:21.014 --> 00:57:23.380
emerged because of
bottom up things, right.

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:25.044
Like, governments have come--

00:57:25.044 --> 00:57:26.710
MATT RIDLEY: Yeah,
the one child policy.

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:27.850
AUDIENCE: Because there's
the ones that actually,

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:28.790
like, survive, right.

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:29.090
MATT RIDLEY: Yeah.

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:30.060
AUDIENCE: Some
governments make it.

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:30.910
Some don't.

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:31.950
Some systems make it.

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:32.480
Some don't.

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.980
So my question is
kind of how do we,

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:36.480
like, can we reconcile
these two views

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.310
and say, like, well,
sometimes, hierarchies

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:40.344
are useful if we
choose them wisely.

00:57:40.344 --> 00:57:42.760
MATT RIDLEY: Yeah, of course,
and you're absolutely right.

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.010
And you know, I'm not
suggesting we sack the president

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:48.790
tomorrow-- although you do
do that in next November,

00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:50.650
don't you, and
appoint a new one.

00:57:53.355 --> 00:57:57.120
But I am suggesting we just
err a little too much or quite

00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.760
a lot too much in the
direction of thinking

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.500
hierarchy is needed
when it's not.

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.424
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:02.424 --> 00:58:04.007
MATT RIDLEY: You
know, and it probably

00:58:04.007 --> 00:58:09.950
wouldn't be much fun trying to
fight a war with an army which

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:11.923
voted on whether to attack.

00:58:11.923 --> 00:58:12.909
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:13.224 --> 00:58:15.640
MATT RIDLEY: But then, I don't
think we should be fighting

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.498
wars, so that's-- that's
a way out of that one.

00:58:18.498 --> 00:58:19.962
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:19.962 --> 00:58:21.086
MATT RIDLEY: Oh, is it?

00:58:21.086 --> 00:58:21.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.310
MATT RIDLEY: Well, they were
quite good at it, weren't they?

00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:24.268
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:24.268 --> 00:58:24.768
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:27.184 --> 00:58:28.142
MATT RIDLEY: All right.

00:58:28.142 --> 00:58:29.058
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:29.864 --> 00:58:30.780
MATT RIDLEY: Yes, yes.

00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:31.696
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:32.739 --> 00:58:33.530
MATT RIDLEY: Right.

00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:34.446
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:35.206 --> 00:58:35.997
MATT RIDLEY: Right.

00:58:35.997 --> 00:58:36.913
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:38.392 --> 00:58:39.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:42.390
MATT RIDLEY: Yes.

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:43.973
I like this, the way
this conversation

00:58:43.973 --> 00:58:46.530
has gone into some
interesting directions.

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:47.759
Thank you all very much.

00:58:47.759 --> 00:58:49.800
Was one o'clock the time
I was suppose to finish?

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.300
I don't know, but anyway.

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:53.450
[APPLAUSE]
