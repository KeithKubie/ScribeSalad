00:00:00.063 --> 00:00:02.361
- [Voiceover] So we
have an example exercise

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:04.183
from our Khan Academy exercises.

00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:05.867
This is the decomposed fractions.

00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:07.725
with denominators of 100.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:10.719
Use the following number line
to complete the equation.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.030
The equation says 26-hundredths

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.478
is equal to star-tenths

00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:17.777
plus six-hundredths.

00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:19.240
And they give us this number line

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.633
and on this number line--

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:22.491
Let's see, this is zero right over here,

00:00:22.491 --> 00:00:24.558
zero-tenths, which is
the same thing as zero,

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:27.715
and it goes all the way to 26-hundredths.

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:29.492
Let's see if that makes sense.

00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:32.139
Well, you see between
zero-tenth and one-tenth,

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:34.019
they split into 10 equal sections.

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.271
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:38.558
seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:00:38.558 --> 00:00:41.670
So if you divide a tenth into tenths,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.457
each of these is going to be 100.

00:00:43.457 --> 00:00:45.861
A hundredth is one-tenth of a tenth.

00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:48.135
So that's 100, 200, 300, 400,

00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:51.644
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10-hundredths,

00:00:52.214 --> 00:00:57.133
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.133
20-hundredths.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.604
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26-hundredths.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:04.541
So that's exactly what they wrote there.

00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:06.364
So they say 26-hundredths,

00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:07.908
which is this thing right over here,

00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:10.367
is equal to star-tenths,

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:12.980
which is really what's
being depicted in magenta,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.466
plus six-hundredths.

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.324
The six-hundredths is this
green right over here.

00:01:16.324 --> 00:01:17.148
Adding the six-hundredths.

00:01:17.148 --> 00:01:21.106
Adding one, two, three,
four, five, six-hundredths.

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:23.312
So what is this right over here?

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:26.667
This magenta or this pink arrow?

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:28.804
Well we could say that's 20-hundredths.

00:01:28.804 --> 00:01:31.462
If you count it that's 10, 20-hundredths.

00:01:31.462 --> 00:01:33.830
Or, you could see, well
that's just two-tenths.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.823
So 26-hundredths is the same thing

00:01:36.823 --> 00:01:39.679
as two-tenths plus six-hundredths.

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.280
And it gets you right over there.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.689
So this right over here
is going to be two-tenths.
