00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.880
We've got several tiki torches.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.260
We've got methanol for fuel,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.940
and we've got a
whole host of chemicals

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.100
that we're gonna mix in,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.540
and see if we can get a
nice display of colored tiki torches.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.760
[Music]

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.330
A while ago, we had a video showing how
to make several different colors of flame.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.920
I thought that worked out pretty well.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.560
On that video, YouTube user
redvsbluefanful wanted to know

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.400
if we can use the same ideas
to make colored-burning tiki torches

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.500
rather than just burning the fuel
in the little candle receptacles.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.140
Let's look at some of the
things we're gonna try burning.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.000
We've got lithium inside
of our lithium batteries,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.820
which as we've seen before can
make a really cool bright magenta flame.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.440
The boric acid in this roach killer
has done a pretty good job

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.480
of making it very bright green.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.020
We've had mixed results
using potassium chloride,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.290
which is a salt substitute
trying to get a purple flame.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.760
It kind of works,
although it's not great.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.239
So, normal isopropyl alcohol
gives us a very bright yellow color.

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.800
And in fact, it's so bright
that can often wash out other colors

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.500
that we get from burning the methanol.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.980
So, I might try using just
a little bit of this mixed in

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.840
with the methanol to get
a smaller yellow flame.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.880
I've done a couple
of experiments recently

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.040
mixing calcium carbonate
with the methanol,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.040
and I think that might
give us another option

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.080
as we try and go
for a purple flame.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.779
The copper sulfate that makes up
this root killer chemical

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:19.939
does an okay job of
making a bluish green flame.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.340
We had some mixed results.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.119
And in fact,
we had some mixed colors,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.220
we had sort of blueish green
with orange mixed into it.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.780
We'll see if we get the same thing
when it's burning in a tiki torch,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.819
and then of course,
the methanol by itself

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.760
does a pretty good job
of burning blue

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.740
although it's a fairly faint blue,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.140
so if there's a lot of light,
you can't see it very well.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.960
That's one of the reasons
we're doing this at night.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.179
I've also got this
large bag of driveway salt,

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.140
which is made of calcium chloride,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.760
and that's what we tried
to use to make an orange flame.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.620
It did an okay job,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.159
and sometimes I thought that
crushing it up into a powder worked better

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.909
and sometimes it seemed like
just leaving it as pellets worked better.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.300
So, we'll try using the pellets,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.139
and see if we can get an orange flame...
more orange than the yellow color

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.480
of other types of fuel.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.540
Here's the basic idea.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.300
We've got some tiki torches
and some methanol for fuel.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.320
We've got several different
chemicals that we can use

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.760
to try and change
the color of the flame.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.399
Will it work in the tiki torches

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.820
the same way it did
in the little candles?

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.700
The two that I'm most
confident will work out

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.989
are the red and green colors

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.989
given to us by the lithium
and the boric acid, respectively.

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.439
I'm so confident those are gonna work.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.680
I'm just gonna fill
one of these pots each

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.820
with some of our methanol,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.560
and then add our lithium
and our boric acid to that,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.640
and see if it burns out through the torch.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.620
I bought these tiki torches at Walmart,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.430
where they were two dollars
and fifty cents each.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.880
So, really not breaking
the bank if you wanna try this.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.260
[Music]

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.160
That is like a perfect amount.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.940
12 ounces.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.840
I guess this is designed
to hold about 12 ounces.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:03:02.300
[Music]

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.840
Well, that was unexpected.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.700
[Music]

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.480
Guess let that be a warning
that there is a reason

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.440
we often say don't try this at home.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.660
Apparently, there is a chance of
spontaneous combustion with batteries,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.680
so be careful.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:46.040
[Music]

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.680
This one I suspect
will be less exciting.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.719
The boric acid, while doing
a great job of turning the flame green

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.940
doesn't typically you know,
react quite so violently as the lithium.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:07.980
[Music]

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.640
Now, for these tiki torches to really work,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.760
the wick needs to take the methanol,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.240
and lift it up through the wick to the top,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.540
so it will light and so
actually be burning the fuel,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.130
rather than just burning your
melting the wick self.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.580
It's a little hard to tell
once it's done that,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.140
but the easiest way is
if the wick feels kind of cold.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.740
You might be able to tell that
it's wet too if it's properly wicking.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.820
You can see that it
will bring some moisture up.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.240
of course, methanol
evaporates so quickly,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.740
but nothing stays wet for long.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.280
[Music]

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.360
Boom!

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.140
Right there.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.460
I would say we've got a
magenta flame and a green flame

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.980
going quite nicely.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.320
The magenta one you can see does have
a little bit of blue down at the bottom,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.080
and a little bit of orange up at the top,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.980
but overall that's a pretty reddish flame.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.460
As a color comparison,

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.400
here's a tiki torch with
some regular torch oil.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.100
[Music]

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.820
You can see how much more red,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.640
and obviously, how much
more green our flame is here.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.980
Those are the two I most
suspected we're going to work,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.340
and so I just put them directly into
the tiki torches and it does work.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.020
Some of the chemicals are going
up the wick with the methanol fuel,

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.320
and we're getting some
great color out of them.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.520
For the rest of the tests,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.760
I think we're going to try
some smaller scale things

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.120
before moving on to the full-size burns.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.860
We've got a red.
Let's see if we can get a nice yellow.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.180
I know we can get a nice yellow
by just burning the regular Tiki oil,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.360
but I want to try and get
a smaller yellow flame

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.680
so it's not drowning out
the others the same way.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.250
I'm going to have mostly methanol
and a little bit of isopropyl alcohol,

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.960
See if we can get a nice yellow
color, but smaller yellow color.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.340
[Music]

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.440
Hey, that's a yellow flame.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.600
Oh, where did it go?

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.020
This is safe.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.300
[Music]

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.800
That's a yellow flame on the top.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.080
Let's see if we can get
ourselves a nice orange

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.540
by adding some of the
calcium chloride pellets.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.830
[Music]

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.480
We've got quite a bit of our
calcium chloride inside this container.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.500
Let's fill it up with our fuel,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.400
and see if we can get
a nice color out of it.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.020
[Music]

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.360
That's got some orange to it.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.680
It's also almost got
a little bit of purple to it.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.440
It's not too different from some
of the purple tests we've seen before.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.760
Question is whether
it will keep that same color

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.980
when we've got it
coming up through a wick.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.520
Screw on the lid,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.560
and try and gently encourage some
of that liquid to go up through the wick.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.120
See how this looks.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.120
[Music]

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.380
Well it's got some color.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.540
[Music]

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.320
Not bad.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.380
I think that's an okay orange.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.440
It's not a super vibrant
traffic cone kind of orange,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.780
but it's certainly more
orange than pure methanol.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.900
We got some of this salt substitute,

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.200
which as I said before
is the potassium chloride

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.500
trying to get a purple,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.540
and this is one that's always
giving us sort of shaky, iffy results.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.080
Let's see what happens
if we try and burn it through a wick.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:25.800
[Music]

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.140
Now with this we are hoping for purple.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.740
To me this is looking
pretty yellowish-orangey.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.260
Not too different
from the calcium chloride.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.220
Don't know if I can call that purple.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.680
We got sort of a middling response
using the potassium chloride.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.600
Let's see what will we get
using the calcium carbonate.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:08:06.640
[Music]

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.360
Gotta say that mostly just
looks blue like plain methanol.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.920
So maybe this test isn't going to
work out so great after all.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.340
We'll try it through a wick
and see if it's any different.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.140
Here is our calcium carbonate
next to our potassium chloride,

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.780
and both of them have maybe little
hints of purple down at the bottom.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.720
But for the most part they're
kind of just orangey yellow.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.600
These colors were already sort of iffy,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.280
getting it to show through with a wick,

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.180
makes it a little worse I'd say.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.560
It's just not very purple.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.640
One final color test.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.880
Let's see if we can get anything worth
mentioning out of this copper sulfate.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:53.780
[Music

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.540
]That is just the color
of methanol right there.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.600
Little bits of green jump out
in these tiny little spurts.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.080
There you go.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.600
So, if it's constantly being agitated,

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.560
we can get some cool green in there.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.720
Agitation and air.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:23.060
[Music]

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.300
Some of it splashed.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.720
Kind of a cool effect
and some kind of cool colors

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.800
but really not something that's
gonna work very well through a wick.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.140
We've got five torches set up here,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.100
and I'm not 100% convinced
that all of them are gonna work.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.800
This is a bit of a final test
rather than a final exhibition.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.360
But let's light them up and see
if we can get some good colors.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.400
I'm hoping for red,
orange, yellow, green, blue.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.820
The blue is pure methanol,

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.760
which through a wick
might not burn the same color.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:59.840
[Music]

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.240
Our calcium chloride looks almost
identical to our pure methanol at this point,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.420
which makes me think
that the calcium chloride

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.040
isn't really doing too much
to change the color.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040
Maybe it is changing color,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.500
but only the same amount that the wick
is changing the color for the methanol.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.480
Honestly that might be...

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.180
That might be a better blue than
the one that's supposed to be blue.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.280
Maybe we should switch
our blue and our orange

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.400
for better blue and orange.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.940
[Music]

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.780
The green works excellently.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.600
The magenta is not too bad.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.580
It's not the strongest color.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.800
Not compared to the green at least,

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.800
but it's pretty good.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.780
The yellow works pretty well by
adding quite a bit of isopropyl alcohol,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.560
and you can probably
burn pure isopropyl alcohol,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.540
and get a similar result.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.100
Although in my experience, that
does make a little bit bigger of a flame.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.720
Not necessarily a bad thing.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.500
But if you're going for a
bigger flame in this color,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.240
then you can just use
the normal tiki torch fuel.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.380
Getting the orange, and the blue,
and the purple didn't work out so well,

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.220
so I would say, you probably want
to stick to the green or the magenta.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:06.960
One other thing,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.700
they did have this much larger
tiki torch available as well.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.280
I've got some green tinted fuel in this one.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.180
We're gonna see how much
bigger we can really get this going.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.660
[Music]

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.400
The idea with this one I believe

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.960
is that it's supposed to
have the fuel vent up to the top,

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.760
and you can get a much larger flame

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.860
because it'll come out
all the way around the wick.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:38.700
