00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.450
Crossing the gulf of execution, and the

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.120
gulf of evaluation, involves users asking themselves

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.771
a series of questions. For each of

00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:13.290
the seven questions, indicate whether the question occurs

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.083
at the users goal. The action done to the world. The Gulf of Executiuon. Or

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:25.103
the Gulf of Evaluation. What do I want to accomplish? Or what is my goal?

00:00:25.103 --> 00:00:31.086
What action can I do now? How do I do it? And after I've taken action, what just

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:33.993
happened? What does what just happened, mean? Am I

00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:36.960
okay with what just happened? Have I accomplished my

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.850
goal? It's important to note that typical behavior, is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
not about going through all stages in a linear

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.130
fashion. We tend to weave back and forth when

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.390
trying to accomplish a goal. And not all of

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.520
the activity In the seven stages of action, is conscious. Goals tend to be

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.520
conscious. But even they may be subconscious.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.290
The seven stages of action that are made

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.960
up of the Gulfs of Execution and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.820
Evaluation. Provide a helpful checklist for designers to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.840
use when creating something. And next, Don

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.410
introduces important design rules, that are linked to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.710
the seven stages of action.
