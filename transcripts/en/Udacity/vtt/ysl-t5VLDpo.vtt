Let's give you practice with one more example.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want you to define for me the function all_ints,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which generates the infinite stream of integers in the order of 0 first,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
then +1, -1, +2, -2, +3, -3, and so on.

00:00:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Put in your definition.
