00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:12.000
The house system is here to make
whatever you want to do at Harvard possible.

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:14.867
There are 12 residential Harvard houses.

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.500
[ Female Student ] Each house has
its own dining hall, its own community...

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:19.533
its own population of students.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.567
After freshman year, you are randomly
sorted into one of those houses.

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:27.133
Not only is the house a center
for non-classroom learning...

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.267
but it’s also a hub for social activity.

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.133
[ Female Student #2 ]
You all live together and eat together...

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.833
and participate in events together.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.733
[ Female Student #3 ]
There are people from every country...

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100
every religion,
and that’s where you really learn.

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:39.033
A lot of the opportunities that you have...

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.600
to have those
close one-on-one conversations...

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:45.933
with a professor, with someone
who’s visiting from another university–

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.233
The place where you really get to engage
with those people is in your house.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.033
[ Man ] Our job’s really
to try and help this house...

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.500
be as vibrant and intellectual
and fun as possible.

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:58.200
[ Lowell Housemaster ] Lowell House
is a place that has a lot of traditions...

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:01.033
like having tea on Thursdays at 5:00.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.833
- [ Female Student #4 ]
There’s an opera every year.
- [ Male Student ] Dances in the house.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.433
It’s a good time to get to know
other people in the house...

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.233
to see your friends,
catch up on the week.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.867
It’s a place where you can be who you are
and discover who you want to become.

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:16.233
I think coming back home
is a very comfortable space.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.600
[ Lowell Housemaster ] This is really an attempt
to create a community within a college.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:24.833
This is what makes a Harvard education
very distinctive.
