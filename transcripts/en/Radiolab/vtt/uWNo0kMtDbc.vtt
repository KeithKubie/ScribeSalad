00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.990
Okay. Ready? Yeah. Hey, I'm Jetta. Boom, rod. And I remember Colbert.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.830
This is Radiolab, our fun drive addition, when we're trying to prevail upon you,

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:11.460
give you all the reasons we can think of to support public radio and radio lab

4
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:13.990
in particular. You know what Robert, why,

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.180
why should we even say anything when I think it's more powerful when somebody

6
00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:22.900
who uses radio lab who uses public radio can say it for us. Well,

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.490
you have someone in mind. I do. I have a story here that came into our inbox.

8
00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:32.410
This is a true story where public radio, you ready for this? Okay.

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.390
Literally saved a boy's life. What? All right, so I'm exaggerating a little,

10
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.140
but it helped out in a pretty dire situation. And if saving lives,

11
00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:45.250
healing wounds doesn't make you want to support this service, then well,

12
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:46.420
frankly I don't know what will.

13
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.130
<v 1>So anyhow, um, the woman who wrote,</v>

14
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.290
<v 0>we're just going to call her right now. Her name is Jennifer Bab and how,</v>

15
00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:54.220
how would we be spelling [inaudible]

16
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.280
<v 1>bad baptism. Yes sir.</v>

17
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.390
<v 0>Jennifer Bab as MBA. Yes.</v>

18
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.870
<v 1>That will be via the B.</v>

19
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.570
<v 0>Yup. And it involves her and</v>

20
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.170
<v 1>her son. Like</v>

21
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.320
<v 0>hello. Hi, is this Jennifer? Yes. Hey,</v>

22
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:12.640
this is Jad and this is Robert here on the other microphone. Hi Guys.

23
00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:15.800
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you telephonically. Now Jennifer,

24
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.640
I understand you have a, you have a son, right?

25
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.870
<v 2>Yes, I have two children you might send is my oldest. He's seven and a half lake</v>

26
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.430
<v 0>blink. And so can you set the scene for the story you're gonna tell it?</v>

27
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.170
<v 2>Well, let's see. So Blake, um, he says when he grows up,</v>

28
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:31.670
he's going to be an inventor.

29
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.740
<v 3>What do you like to build most of all is airplane airplanes and helicopters.</v>

30
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.190
Okay. So the first one, the belt were just, you know,

31
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:46.820
he'd take a couple of pieces of Tupperware and lay them out on the floor in the

32
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:48.040
shape of the plane.

33
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.830
But lately he's been trying to build planes that actually fly.

34
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.200
<v 2>So he made this airplane.</v>

35
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.040
He's sitting next to me now and he's telling me it's more like a helicopter.

36
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.723
<v 0>It's okay.</v>

37
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.500
<v 2>40 bucks cut out too long.</v>

38
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.540
Propeller blades that he duct taped together in the shape of an egg.

39
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.200
And the propeller, I have to say the propeller is really cool.

40
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:14.520
The propeller actually flies.

41
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.900
So we have kind of a balcony on our house and he stood up on the balcony and

42
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.980
like flung it off and then hovered in there

43
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.670
<v 3>really? Oh Wow. Moment</v>

44
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.720
<v 2>before falling to the ground.</v>

45
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.520
<v 0>Okay. So, so you, you, you've done a bunch of tests with this propeller,</v>

46
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:41.970
you see that it can fly and then I'm assuming at a certain point, um,

47
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.510
he takes it to the next step.

48
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.433
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.980
So He's been learning about electricity and about motors and things and he's got

50
00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:53.030
a couple of toys that have motors on them.

51
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:57.920
So He's been trying to build an airplane that'll hook up to the motor and he

52
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:01.570
tried to attach his pillar and it just fell over.

53
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.440
<v 0>Yeah. See the motor wasn't powerful enough.</v>

54
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.821
<v 2>Right.</v>

55
00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:10.560
And so there's only one thing that we've got that strong enough to power a

56
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.720
propellor of this size and IP human beings.

57
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.560
<v 0>Oh yes.</v>

58
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.900
<v 2>So what he did was, since the motor didn't work,</v>

59
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:21.901
he made out of duct tape a harness system so that he could kind of climb inside

60
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:26.140
the harness and hold on to the propeller.

61
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.330
<v 0>And he's, is he going to twist the propellors himself while he's flying?</v>

62
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.480
<v 2>Exactly. Grabbed my do it with his hands in this kinda like spin to make it fly.</v>

63
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.020
And so, you know, we have this rock wall that's about, I dunno,

64
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.240
three feet high. And so he climbed up on the rock wall

65
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.970
<v 3>and jumped and he said, you have retraced back.</v>

66
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.590
Really? He felt it. He felt that.

67
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.120
So all kind of weird.

68
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.920
<v 0>Hi. Hi Blake. Hi. So you felt like, uh,</v>

69
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.290
so where did you jump from? You jumped from the wall.

70
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.590
<v 4>Hello? Hello</v>

71
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.560
<v 0>Blake, are you there? Blake is, um, he's not a really big talker.</v>

72
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.250
And did you mom know any of this was happening at this point? Yeah,

73
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.200
I made a movie of it.

74
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.580
So you are aware of his experiments in flight?

75
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.960
<v 3>Yeah, well, it's fascinating to watch, you know, to see how his mind works.</v>

76
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:34.670
He's learning. Like I said, you know, every time, every iteration,

77
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.980
you learn something from the weight of one before fail.

78
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.650
<v 4>Whoa.</v>

79
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.830
<v 2>So that was, um, that was in the evening.</v>

80
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.250
That was like eight o'clock at night and the next day he's was a Saturday or

81
00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:50.850
Sunday and he's fussing around in the garage. And, um,

82
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.730
my husband and I were in the kitchen talking about whatever.

83
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:58.731
And Blake comes walking past with his harness system on and he walks through the

84
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.610
doors to go into the backyard.

85
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.410
<v 0>Just walks right through, right? There's something slightly Calvin and Hobbes,</v>

86
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.710
he about this pill for whatever reason,

87
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.870
<v 2>not arouse our suspicion as it should have, you know,</v>

88
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:17.610
I don't know what we were talking about. And then, you know, two,

89
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.940
three minutes later we hear the cry.

90
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.400
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

91
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.040
<v 2>you know, the kind of cry that's not,</v>

92
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.990
I'm scared or wham hungry. It's the cry. That means I'm hurt.

93
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.903
<v 4>Now just to jump in here.</v>

94
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.280
Jennifer Warren's outside to the backyard where there's this maple tree and she

95
00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:47.090
looks up and she sees her son

96
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.950
<v 2>weakly entangled in the tree,</v>

97
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.821
<v 4>look to her,</v>

98
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:54.480
like he'd climbed up to the top branch with the harness of Dumont and then

99
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:59.090
jumped and got twisted and he was really, really bloody.

100
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.400
<v 2>He had scraped the whole back of his leg,</v>

101
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.270
this big like foot long gash and are just like, oh my God. Oh my God.

102
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.820
Just bleeding all down his leg. And,

103
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.930
and how my husband had to like push him up so that I could untangle the,

104
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.240
like ropey bits of the duct tape harness system to get him off and pull him

105
00:06:18.241 --> 00:06:20.130
down. So I, you know,

106
00:06:20.131 --> 00:06:24.990
carried him through through the kitchen and put 'em on the couch in the living

107
00:06:24.991 --> 00:06:25.610
room

108
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.760
<v 4>and she says she tried to turn him over so she could get a look at the cut.</v>

109
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:30.710
But he kept squirming and wouldn't let her see it.

110
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.990
<v 2>And that was the moment it occurred to me to put on radio lab.</v>

111
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.473
<v 4>Oh,</v>

112
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.890
<v 2>capture his imagination. So he buys,</v>

113
00:06:41.891 --> 00:06:46.891
still forget that his leg hurt him and then I could look at it while he was

114
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:47.974
distracted.

115
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.290
<v 4>What gave you that idea?</v>

116
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.850
<v 2>I don't know. That iPod was kind of sitting there and I was like, okay,</v>

117
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.000
I'll put on Radiolab and he can listen to the bit about parasites.

118
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.320
<v 4>So when you press go or, or begin on your, on your iPod, what happened?</v>

119
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.250
<v 2>Oh, he was instantly fascinated. He listened to the whole entire podcast,</v>

120
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.970
the whole 45 minutes or whatever it is and yeah, and I was able,

121
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.360
I got his, uh, wound cleaned off to get a child like that to stop moving,

122
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:24.090
to stop twitching in some degree. Like you should see him right now.

123
00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:27.640
He's sitting here like tapping his feet and playing with this spork. Um,

124
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.070
and you had his attention from the first moment,

125
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.580
<v 4>but it goes beyond that. According to Jennifer,</v>

126
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.040
after she'd been playing him the show for a few minutes,

127
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:42.000
she paused it just shortly after a segment we made about a parasitic wasp.

128
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.350
What it does is it flies around and it looks for a cockroach.

129
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.490
That's the one. And she asked him, did you understand any of that?

130
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.300
<v 2>And he repeated it back to me. Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.560
<v 4>Almost word for word. Maybe we should put Blake on. Yeah.</v>

132
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.760
<v 2>Okay. Let me go get them. They are ready to talk to you.</v>

133
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.180
Hi.

134
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.200
<v 4>Hi. So we want to hear like what can you remember about the radio show?</v>

135
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.340
<v 2>The one that parishes was um,</v>

136
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.510
the parish wast is flying around.

137
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.210
Then it finds cockroach

138
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.190
<v 4>that finds that cockroach.</v>

139
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.170
They tumbled back and forth around.

140
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:28.150
<v 2>Patricia Gwas mentioned this, stab it in the stomach, right in the belly,</v>

141
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.280
the cockroach, which is for a second.

142
00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:35.281
And then it this fault go and it's stings it.

143
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.500
<v 4>The Stinger actually started threads its way</v>

144
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.090
to a particular spot in the brain

145
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.090
<v 2>in a way they can control the clock colors.</v>

146
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:48.583
This stands up.

147
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.800
And so now the hall sits by the end,

148
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.740
the cockroaches contento

149
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.480
<v 3>and start pulling out, down, down,</v>

150
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.010
down, down.

151
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.720
<v 2>He lays eggs and say the cockroach. And then the eggs hatch.</v>

152
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.010
<v 0>You remember the entire story? Yes. Jennifer too is flabbergasted.</v>

153
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.270
And she says she turned to him and was like, wow, Blake, what?

154
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:23.040
Excellent listening comprehension. You have, you do understand what you hear.

155
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.310
<v 2>And he said yes,</v>

156
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.990
but I don't understand when people are talking to me.

157
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:36.010
<v 6>You mean like he doesn't understand that when people talk at him or lecture him?</v>

158
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.163
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

159
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.820
like when I'm in trouble I never understand what you're talking about.

160
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.260
And so I did have the thought that if only I had the means I could record some

161
00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:52.790
of my lectures so that I could play them back.

162
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.580
You know with the right sound effects,

163
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.460
that's the baby you would have that the same like it tends to be of listening to

164
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:03.540
what I was trying to say. Those two mothers everywhere,

165
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.780
mothers across America,

166
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.000
<v 2>we were paying millions of dollars for these lectures.</v>

167
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.140
<v 6>Which brings me to a really quick pitch.</v>

168
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.990
Public radio is all about making stories stick.

169
00:10:13.991 --> 00:10:17.170
That's what we try and do at radio lab and all the shows. Try and do,

170
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.840
do you have um, lecturers off the top of your head?

171
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.880
Because if you give them to us we could give them back to you.

172
00:10:21.881 --> 00:10:24.250
And in that radio lab five version.

173
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.850
<v 2>See there, I guess there is, there's one thing, and this is, you know,</v>

174
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:32.520
this kind of gets at the whole climbing up into a tree with propellers.

175
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.580
Like you have to think things all the way through to the end.

176
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.560
<v 0>Hmm. Jennifer says she said that to Blake millions of times.</v>

177
00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:44.420
She's not sure if it ever gets through

178
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.880
<v 2>things through to the end.</v>

179
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.020
<v 0>So we thought we would try and give her a new spin on it.</v>

180
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.300
I don't know if this is going to work, but hey, let's give it a shot.

181
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.270
Here is our, uh, attempt to make a sticky lecture for Blake.

182
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.930
<v 3>Have to think things all the way through</v>

183
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.413
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

184
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.840
thing all the way. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

185
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.960
Thanks all the way through.

186
00:11:22.961 --> 00:11:25.650
I think saying all the way,

187
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.490
all the way,

188
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.930
<v 6>like what your mom is saying is that when you want to have an adventure or</v>

189
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.263
prevent something,

190
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:39.130
don't just think about the beginning of it or what you think might happen in the

191
00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:42.430
middle, in your mind. Take it all the way through.

192
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.950
<v 3>You know, it's okay to test your theories. You know,</v>

193
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.100
I encourage experimentation. The only way you're

194
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.780
<v 4>going to learn is if you fail.</v>

195
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.740
<v 6>She's not just saying that. I mean, Take Thomas Edison, the king inventor,</v>

196
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.580
he tried to invent a battery and he failed 10,000 times,

197
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.880
<v 2>but he needed to think about,</v>

198
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.880
so you have to kind of consider what kind of the best outcome,

199
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.190
the worst outcome, and imagine that both of those things have happened.

200
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.440
Like imagine the scenario in your mind and what you include.

201
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.700
<v 0>Okay, let's do that. Scenario one, you're in the tree, this is the good one.</v>

202
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.400
And you see

203
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.300
<v 8>being on the blade round, round,</v>

204
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.540
round and round and round and round and round in.

205
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.953
It works.

206
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.230
<v 0>You're, you're flying all through the neighborhood.</v>

207
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.210
So here's the question. You've got to answer. What happens next?

208
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.370
<v 2>What he hasn't thought is, for example, how is he going to land?</v>

209
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.790
<v 0>Hmm. So you gotta take it all the way through to the landing part.</v>

210
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.870
Now let's play out the other scenario. The one where things don't go well.

211
00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:01.550
Let's say you jump out of the tree and you crash and you really hurt yourself.

212
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.300
Well think of how sad your mom would be and your dad

213
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:08.943
and your sister

214
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:16.010
<v 6>cases where you make up a little movie in your head and you play it all the way</v>

215
00:13:16.011 --> 00:13:19.460
through and hopefully the good one will happen, the best outcome.

216
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.310
But just in case you'll now be prepared

217
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.480
<v 2>so that you can mitigate the effects. Worst outcome.</v>

218
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.030
And I probably wouldn't say mitigate to my child,

219
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.190
<v 0>so we're going to do something with this lecture and send it to you.</v>

220
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:33.610
<v 2>Uh Huh.</v>

221
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:38.560
<v 4>No, seriously. Well thanks you guys. I'll talk to you. Yes.</v>

222
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.920
And we have no absolutely no connection to any kind of further experimentation

223
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:48.931
of this kind of love yourself and responsibility on his own.

224
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.590
Okay. Alright. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Right, bye.

225
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:56.973
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

226
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.630
<v 6>no, I don't exactly know what to say here,</v>

227
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:04.300
but there is something about this story that just kind of like gets to the whole

228
00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:06.370
point of why we do this. Yeah.

229
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.160
And here you've got this kid who's obviously in a lot of pain,

230
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.090
and he just sits still and listens to a story about parasites.

231
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.900
You know what we're trying to do here is tell stories that move you.
