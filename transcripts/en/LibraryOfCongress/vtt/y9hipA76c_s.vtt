00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington DC.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.480
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.780
My name is Steve Winnick.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.090
I'm the writer at the
American Folk Life Center.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.320
And I'm here with Sheila Kay Adams
who is a fantastic ballad singer

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.560
and banjo player and
storyteller from North Carolina.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.860
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Thank you.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: And she's going

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.460
to tell us a little
bit about her life.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.760
We're going to have an oral
history interview here.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.290
So let's just start with you know,
general setting of the scene.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.480
What is the Madison County and
Sodham Laurel Tradition like?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Well when Cecil
Sharp came through 100 years ago,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.170
he visited different people
in the Southern Appalachians

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.490
and somehow found his way to
this little community I grew

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.670
up in which is called Sodham.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.450
The Laurel was added
later, I'm not sure by who.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.610
But anyway, it was just
called Sodham back then.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.540
And there were eight
traditional ballad singers

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.190
that were still singing
when I came along in 1953.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.710
And I didn't start out really
seeking to learn the songs.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.660
What I started out doing was
hanging out with the older people.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.140
Because my real grandmother
died in February of 1958.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.240
And right up the road from her
lived my relatively young --

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.670
although at that time I would
have thought she was ancient --

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.410
you know, she was probably
40, my great aunt.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.950
And so when my grandmother
passed I went up the road

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.870
and adopted Dellie Chandler Norton.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.140 position:56%
And she turned out to be one of the
biggest influences on my whole life.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.200
She was a wild crafter and
knew every plant in the woods,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.160
medicinal value or not
so medicinal value.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.680
She could point out
three little plants

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.470 position:56%
in a small area five foot square
that would kill you if you ate part.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.630
You know, so she knew her business.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.000
But she was also a singer and
came from a family of singers.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.700
The Chandler's have
always been singers.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.980
Wallin's, they were always singers.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.160
And the Ray's and the Norton's.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.920 position:56%
And she was from all those families.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.470
And so the singing
was they just sang.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.960
They sang all the time, literally.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.520
You know, when they were in
the field working, they sang.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.110
When they were up in the morning,
they were singing, washing dishes.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.760
And before they'd go to bed they'd
all sit out on the porch and sing.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.620
So that's what the
singing was kind of like.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.310
And it didn't matter
what kind of song.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.110
Anything from you know, Black is
the Color, a traditional ballad

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.680
from across the big
pond, to Carter Family.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.280
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
From sacred songs to,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.430
"I see the moon, the moon sees me."

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.920
You know, anything that had
a tune, they could sing it.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Well you
mentioned there briefly Cecil sharp

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.840
who came through, as you
say, just 100 years ago.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.140
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.440
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: And
recorded stuff in the community.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.020
And you've mentioned before
a connection that you have

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.000
to one particular song
by Dearest Dear

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.300
that has to do with Cecil Sharp.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.610
Tell us about that.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.910
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yes.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.110
Well, I had always heard
Granny and Berzil talk

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.870
about this English speaking
fellow, which I wondered about.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.110
Because we spoke English
too, you know.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.380
But I didn't realize mountain
English was different from English.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.140
But as I got older, they told me
that this man came from England

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.400
to collect their songs because
he felt they were special.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.890
And he put them in this big book.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.340
And so that went along and I
went off to -- I went off, right.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.290
I went to Mars Hill College
which is in Madison County.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.890
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
And in the library,

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.030
in the little index file
box, I found Sharp, Cecil.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.280
You know, Folk Songs from
the Southern Appalachians.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.450
And I got the book, looked at it
and it was both volume one and two.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.290
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And there was
my great, great aunt, Mary Sands,

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.280
who would have been a Wallin,

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.210
recorded by Cecil Sharp
on August 5th, 1916.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.060
And my great, great aunt had sung
a song called My Dearest Dear.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.310 position:56%
And right over the ridge, her niece,

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.570
the next morning, gave
birth to my mother.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.080
So she was in labor while my great,
great aunt Mary Sands was singing

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.740
for Sharp My Dearest Dear.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: And
now you sing that song?

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.610
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.350 position:56%
And that's my mama's song, you know.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.950
Well tell us about Dellie.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.660
So you said you adopted her
as your grandmother basically.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.960
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: I did.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.300
And she used to laugh and
tell people, "She adopted me

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.600
and I didn't have no choice.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.400
Its little brain is
pretty determined

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.100
when she takes a mind,
has it that way."

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.840
And so I just -- but you know,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.100
I think they appreciated
it, the older people did.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.140
Because I was so interested
in everything they were doing.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.760
But Granny was -- gosh.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.490
She was I think ahead of her
time because she was born

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.940
in 1898, October the 3rd.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.860
And the man that she was in love
with went off to World War I

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.520
and wound up -- he
made it back home,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.020
but he died of the
flu epidemic in 1918.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.080
Right, 1918.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.950
And so she said that she
was an old maid at 21.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.350
Barely turned 21 when my great
Uncle Ross asked her to marry him.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.530
And he had four children of his
own, and then she had five of hers.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.100
And she raised all nine of them.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.520
And then he died in the '60's

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.640
and she was basically free
from that point forward.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.600
And I asked her one time,
"Why didn't you marry again?"

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.330
She said, "Because I went
from being my daddy's daughter

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.920
to being my sister's handmaiden."

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.910
That would have been
Berzil when she married Lee.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.510
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
"To being my own person.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.490
And there wasn't no man
going to tell me what to do.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.060
Absolutely not.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.230
After Ross died, I was done."

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.530
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.360
And what were her favorite
kinds of songs to sing?

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.530
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Granny
loved all manners of songs.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.750
She loved the Carter
family and she used

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.000
to sing Flowers After -- let's see.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.550
Don't Give Me Flowers after I Die.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Okay.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.650
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
After the Soul is Gone.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.250
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: That
was one of her favorites.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:53.260
And then she would drag out
a love song or an old ballad

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.350
that was hundreds of
years old and sing it.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.190
And she loved Herman's Hermit.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: That's great.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.790
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Yes, we used to dance

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.350
on the porch to Herman's Hermit.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.640
There's a kind of hush.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.240
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.540
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All right.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.840
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: So she
loved all kind of music.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.140
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Great.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.440
Well you also mentioned
Berzil Wallin.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.740
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Berzil, yeah.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
What were her big songs?

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.650
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Well now,
Granny had Little Farmer Boy

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:26.010
that she was kind of -- you know,
she considered that her song.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.520 position:56%
But now Berzil had one at almost the
same story, a little bit different.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.080
But she called it House Carpenter.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.700
Now they were sisters.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.830
But Berzil's brother-in-law,
Chaz Wallin,

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.490
had one called The Demon Lover.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.090
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And
they're all three the same song.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:48.240
But Berzil had a way of singing
that was almost like conversation.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.610 position:56%
You know, The Girl I Left Behind Me.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.910
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.680
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Boy, she
could sing that and just --

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.980
but she had a great line.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.610
And Johnny Dole, that was
one of her favorite ones.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.740
She called it Johnny Doll.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:07.880
And she said, "My ear bobs, they
buzz deep and fell to the floor."

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.670
And I always thought, "Golly,
what could call your ear bobs

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.650
to bust and fall to the floor?"

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:19.430
And Berzil was good at -- Daddy
said when they were young,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.900
that Berzil was the one
that had such a sweet voice.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.760
And she was the oldest one.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.060
She lived up into her nineties.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.900
I think she was like 97,
almost 98 when she died.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.200
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.420
You know, I remember seeing
her in the John Cohen film.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.720
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Right.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Where she sings.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.320
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: She
looks ancient, doesn't she?

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.120
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: She looked
ancient and she sang with depth.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.420
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: She did.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.660
It's going to get you.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.000
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: It's
very, very spooky, yep.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.300
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.600
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.080
So I have kind of a weirdly
specific question about that film.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.610
Because I understand you were
there when The Dance was filmed.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.910
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: I was.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: As a child.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.510
So there's one thing that
I noticed in that film,

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.350
which is Doral Chandler is --

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.920
there's a scene where he's
in a diner with a couple

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.780
of his male friends and
they're just sitting around.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.640
And then later at the dance
one of those guys is there,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.000
but he's wearing women's clothing.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.300
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Right.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.600
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
Was that a tradition?

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.900
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: No.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.200
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
What was that about?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.500
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: It was a dare.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.800
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
It was a dare, I see.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.100
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: It was a dare.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.400
They dared Doral.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.700
His name was Doral Chandler.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.000
He was a nephew of
Granny's and Berzil's.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.970
He was the son of their brother
Lloyd who first sang A Conversation

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.390
with Death actually, for
John Cohen I believe.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.360
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And so
Doral, they dared him to do that.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.870
And you just can't dare a
mountain man to do anything.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.430
You know, they'll step
right up to the plate.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.150
And so he showed up
and danced a little bit

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.620
with Peter Gaud if I remember.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.220
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yep.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: He
was brave to do that.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Well, you know,

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.220
a lot of mountain men are not too
concerned about their masculinity.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.060
You know, they don't
have any doubt about it.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.560
So I don't think it
bothered Doral at all.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.430
It might have been a little much
on him when the camera was rolling.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.730
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.960
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
But he still did it.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.260
Yep. We were proud of him.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.560
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: That
was interesting, yeah.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.860
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So it's
funny because you know,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.590
the way John Cohen makes his films,
he doesn't comment on anything.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.550
So it's just there but
nobody knows what it's about.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.850
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.650
Doral appears and it's
very obvious he's a man.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.250
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Big
hairy legs you know sticking

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.550
out from under a dress.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.150
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And if I
remember, he had on a head scarf.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: I think
so, yeah, that's right.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.750
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah,
but that also brings

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.350
up Dillard Chandler himself

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.690
who would have been another
influence and great singer.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.990
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah, he was.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.430
He was a fabulous singer.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:41.040
And Dillard I think was being
of my parents' generation.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.970
He would have had -- he was the
one that literally had one foot

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.250
in one world and one
foot in another.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.550
Because he talks about it.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.670
You know, he says, "If I
have to make a little money

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.790
or make a living, I have
to go off from home."

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.090
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Because there's
no money here except in farming.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.640
And the land's wore out.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.020
That's what he said.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.440 position:56%
And so he would go into Ashville and
do landscaping for them rich folks

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.460
up there as he called it.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.760
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.510
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: But yet he
would come back home, you know,

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.500
and participate in
whatever was going on there

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.060
around home, and still sing.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.750
And he had a fabulous voice, I
thought, for singing ballads.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.300
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah,
that Soldier Travelling

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.700
from the North, the
way he does that.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.000
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Wow.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.520
And he had another one that
was A Sailor Being Tired.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.120
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.420
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
Yeah, great singing.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.720
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yep.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.320
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Yeah, fabulous singing.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So you're
a girl and you're in this film

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.420
because the whole film crew
and John Cohen himself --

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.230
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And the
one person on the film crew.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah, that comes

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.770
and is filming your
family and filming Dillard.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.810
Did that make an impression
on you at that age?

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.190
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: It
did, but at the same time --

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.300
see I've heard all the
stories about Sharp coming.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.600
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.120
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: You
know, and being in that area.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.400
So he was not surprised -- and
Allan Lomax actually had come

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.090
through there briefly in the
'60's if I'm not mistaken.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.390
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right,
I think that's right.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.370
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: He came
through Ashville and wandered

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.520
over into Madison County a bit.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.640
But anyhow, so yeah, it did.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.740
It really influenced.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.040
I forgot what the question was.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.340
I'm sorry.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Whether
it made an impression on you.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.020
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yes.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:28.460
Yeah, and what it did was
give me a boot in the backside

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.280
to get busy and learn these songs.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.120
Because people from outside
thought they were important.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.450
Yeah. And I mean, Granny
always said,

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.090
"There's a song for everything."

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.390
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.480
Yeah, that's great.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.570 position:56%
You know, one of the things that you
mentioned was Lomax coming through,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.550
and coming through
Ashville specifically.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.040
And that sort of sparked
in my mind the question

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.490
of Bascom Lamar Lunsford, and
what his influence would have been

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.790
on you.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.490
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Well, Bascom
was an interesting character.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.820
He was many things.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.120
He was a lawyer.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.920
He was a folklorist.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.880
You know, a collector.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.620
And he was also a bit of
a fancy dresser, you know.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:17.950
He wore white suits and ties and
vests, you know, the whole thing.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.740
And shiny shoes and the kids
thought he was kind of odd,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.370
because he would get up on
stage and sing these old songs

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.880
without any accompaniment,
or just his banjo.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.480
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: You know,

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.470
they'd have like a little
30-minute program of him singing.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.760
And it was only later that I
understood how important Bascom was

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.660
to our area, because
he was Madison County.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.260
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And
he actually went around all

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.810
over you know the western counties

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.440
of North Carolina and
collected songs.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.620
And do you know, he
wrote Mountain Dew?

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
Yeah, that's right.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.220
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.520
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: He did,
and he found himself in Chicago

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.820
without money to get home.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:01.050 position:56%
And he sold the song to somebody
for the fare back to North Carolina.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.650
That's great, yeah.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.950
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yep.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah, and
you know, it was also interesting

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.330
because he was one of the
people who had been recorded

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.400
in those early days of
recording in the '20's and '30's

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.450
and then was still around for
quite a long time after that.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.360
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: He was
definitely around in the '50's.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.920
He was around in the '60's
because I took Granny and the crowd

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.280
up to the Ashville festival,

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.110 position:56%
which I think is the longest-running
folk festival in the world.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: I
think that's true, yeah.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.160
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: It didn't
even break during the wars.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.570
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And
so I took them up there

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.880
and he would have people
come and sit on the stage

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.860
and then get up and perform.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.300
And I can remember that.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:48.850
And his son, Lunsford Jr.
was the agriculture teacher

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.150 position:56%
at the high school I graduated from.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All right.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.300
So did Bascom encourage you?

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.600
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: He did.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.430
As a matter of fact, he gave
me -- if I remember right,

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:03.640
it was a nickel, because I
sang Little Margaret for him.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So was that the
first time you got paid as a singer?

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.880
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All right.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.480
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: So
I would have been third

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.780
or fourth grade maybe,
there somewhere abouts.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.820 position:56%
And he just came in and asked if any

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:18.140
of our family members sang
songs without like a piano.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.610
Because he said if
you didn't clarify it,

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.280 position:56%
then people would sing sacred songs.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.880
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: All day long.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.480
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: But he asked
and I said, "Yeah, mine do."

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.730
And so I think that's --
I think he collected --

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.180
I know he did from Obray Ramsey

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.610
which was not Mama's
first sweetheart.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.910
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:46.560
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: But yeah, that
was my first interaction with him,

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.460
was when he asked me if I
knew any of the old songs.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.170
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah, we
have several collections here

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.620
of Bascom's, one of which
he came here in I think 1959

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.620
and recorded his whole repertoire.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.920
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Wow.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.220
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
But we also have one

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.890
which has some really good
footage of him with Obray Ramsey.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.190
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah, so --

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.790
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Obray
Ramsey I think is one

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.250
of the best banjo players
that's ever been.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Well let's
talk about the banjo a little bit.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.360
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Okay.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: You know,
you're playing the banjo,

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.700
so how did you start in
that part of your tradition?

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.840
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Well,
you know, there was a lot

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.580 position:56%
of family members that played music.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.230
You know, and a lot of them
started out on the guitar

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.110
which Granny said didn't
even come into that part

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.900
of the world until about 1910.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.980
And people just made up
ways to play it, she said,

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.280
because they didn't
know how to play it.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.060
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Which I think
would have been right after --

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.690
was it the Spanish-American War
with Cuba and we had some guys

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.680
that went down there and --

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: That's one way
it could have come through, yeah.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:53.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And so she said
that it was -- the guitar was --

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.040
I'm sorry, I've lost
the question again.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Oh, I
was just asking how you got

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.550
into playing the banjo, yeah.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.520
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: I was
when I was eight years old,

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:09.780
my cousin Jerry Adams said, "You
know, Sheila, I think it's time

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.260
that you learned how
to pick the banjo."

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.110
Because I had gotten
under Granny's --

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:20.260 position:56%
well I got on Granny's bed after she
had drug it out from under the bed,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.700
and put it up in the middle of
the quilt on her bed and said,

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:27.640
"Do not touch that banjo.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.660
I'm going down to the
barn to gather eggs,

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.220
and so don't put your
hands on that banjo."

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.520
And when she came back,

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.640
I was playing Cripple Creek,
at least a type of it.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
Did she say that to --

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.980
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Oh honey,
it was reverse psychology.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: To
make sure you picked it up?

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.790
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Absolutely.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.430
She knew. She said,
"Do not touch that,"

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.390
and I would be right
up on the bed with it.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:48.810
Yep, a little reverse psychology.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All
right, that was very smart.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.690
That worked very well.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.990
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yep.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.290
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So you were
able to pick it up pretty quick.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.590
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: I was.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.180
And Jerry, I mean all he
basically did was show me the style

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.170
with what they call the pinch
picking or the two-finger style.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.770
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And then
when I heard Dwight Miller

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.530
when I was a teenager, then
I started playing clawhammer

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.220
and it's been on ever since.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.680
I was about eight years
old when I started playing.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So
did you learn from Dwight?

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.280
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: I did.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.680
I learned tunes from him.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.280
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: You know,

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.580
because I already could
play the banjo somewhat.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Sure.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.180
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And
all it took was just getting

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.480
that lick that Dwight does.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.080
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And he
said, "Oh, you'll get it.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.380
Don't worry about it.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.680
And then it will take a
year and half to get it

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.850
out to where you can stand it."

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.180
He was right, because it overpowers
everything at top, top sound does.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.980
But yeah, I've been playing.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.280
It is hard to believe.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.710
At 64 now, I've been playing
since I was eight years old

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.770 position:56%
and singing since I was five or six.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.070
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.720
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
That's a long time.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
That is a long time.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:55.350
Now how did you first sort of
realize that these songs were going

00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:00.030
to be very important to your life?

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:07.950
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Inez
Chandler passed away in 1981.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.260
And she was really
special to my heart.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.420
And she was hysterically funny.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.940
She's one of the funniest people I
think I've ever known in my life.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:22.020
And she called me out to the
hospital when she was dying.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.290
And she said, "Now, I want
you to take care of things."

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.760
And I said, "What things?"

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.060
Now this was in '81.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.000
You know, I was raising babies,
doing all that kind of thing.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.070
And she said, "You make sure that
all these songs get sung, somehow."

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.050
And I said, "Well, I will."

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.350
And I was telling Granny about it.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.650
And she said, "Well, Lord, yeah,

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.380
that's why we've been
learning them to you."

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.110
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And so it
was in the early '80's I guess.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:55.620
And my youngest son Andrew, he
loved to hear the story songs.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.580
He wanted me at night instead
of telling him a bedtime story,

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.680
Andrew would say, "Sing one of
them old songs that tells a story."

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:08.060
Or he would say, "Tell one of them
stories about your Oldham times,

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.890
when you were a young girl."

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:16.060
And so that was where the book
came from, Come Go Home With Me.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.970
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So your first
book was stories that you --

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.270
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: A
collection of stories

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.570
that I told the kids
when they were little.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:21.970
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All right.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.180
Well you mentioned Inez
and there's another person

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.370
that you talk about a lot.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.180
And that there's some
funny stories about her.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.590
So what more can you
tell us about her?

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:37.030
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Oh, there's
lots of funny stories about Inez.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:42.530
She moved like a ship in full
sail everywhere she went,

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:48.860
with all this flowing brown and
dark green double-knit polyester.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.300 position:56%
And she would say, "You know, this
is the best material there ever was.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.890
Because all you have to do is
wash it, hang it on the line

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.400
and you don't have to iron it."

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.700
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.000
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: She
says, "As a matter of fact,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.330
it will melt if you iron it."

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.690
And she said, "It's what they
make them parachute cords out of,

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.460
and it won't break for nothing.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.250
I mean, you can wear it forever and
it won't break, wear out, nothing."

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:14.590
Of course she said, "It ain't warm
in the wintertime, and it burns you

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.810
up in the summertime, but
you don't have to iron it."

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:24.020
You know, and she -- Inez
shared a lot of the stuff

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.700
that kids I think miss
about their people.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.370
Because she didn't mind telling
me stories that were a little off.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.920
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: You know,
kind of off on the other side.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.360
You know, about who was
married to who really.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:45.890
And her and Daddy both would say,
"You see them Hagins over there?

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:47.190
They weren't the Hagins's.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.520
They were all Cooks."

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:53.250
And so you knew everybody's
legitimacy and illegitimacy,

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.350
walking through a graveyard
with them.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:01.850
And she was also the one that said,
when Granny went in the hospital,

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.290
I guess she was in her late '80's.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:08.440
I went down to see Inez after
that because she had called me

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.110
and by then we had phones.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:15.450
She'd called me and said,
"If you go in to see Dellie,

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.220
then let me know how she's doing."

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.520
So I went down there
and she said, "Oh,

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.570
I already heard she's
doing all right.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.400
She'll be home before
the end of the week."

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.260
And I said, "Well they had
her in intensive care."

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.630
And she said, "I know that.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.900
They put everybody in intensive
care to see if they're going

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.400
to die or not, you know."

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.650
And I said, "Well God,
that's awful."

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.110
But Inez was that way, real blunt.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.080
And she said, "And I hear
you said you was never going

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.800
to cut your hair again too."

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.100
I said, "Yeah."

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.760
She said, "Well she don't want you
to cut your hair again, right?"

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.060
And I said no.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.790
She said, "Oh, you'll
cut that hair."

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:54.040
And I said, "No, I promised Granny
I would never cut my hair again."

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.860
She said, "Oh, you'll
cut that hair."

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.160
So back and forth.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.640
And I finally said, "So are
you a fortune teller now?

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.050
You got your crystal ball
back in the bedroom there?

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.610
You're going to go look?"

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.350
She said no.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.560
And I said, "So you can see
the future then somehow?"

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.580 position:56%
No. "My past, honey, is your future.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.380
That's what you've got
to look forward to."

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:21.240 position:56%
And she said, "And you will cut that
hair when you get the mini-paws."

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.310
And at that age, I
thought, "Mini-paws?

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:29.400
Get the mini-paws?"

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.060
And I saw in my mind all
these little creatures coming

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.820
out of the woods, like
little rabbits

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.840
and raccoons with the mini-paws.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.690
They're going to put
them on your body

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.440
and put little marks and mini-paws.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.710
And then finally I said, "Are you
talking about the change of life?"

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.530
And she said, "No, I'm
talking about the mini-paws."

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:51.850
And I said, "And why exactly
would the mini-paws cause me

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.150
to cut my hair."

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.250 position:56%
She said, "Because you'll get them
hot flashes and they'll just run all

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.180
over you like a dose of salt,

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.040
or like the Lord itself had laid
its hand right on top of your head.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.860
And it will just run through you.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.990
It starts right there and it
will just run all over you,

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.500
rips your head all
over, just wringing wet.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.160
And you'll cut that hair."

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.460
And I said, "Well, we'll see."

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.030
And she said, "But you won't
have to worry about it, honey,

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.510
because you won't lose
no time working that hair

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.590
because you'll be too
busy working on your beard

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:23.260
and mustache after the mini-paws."

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.770
And I always said, well I told
my daughter the same thing.

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.490
And I said, "You know what's
awful is they're always right.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:29.910
They were always right.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.730
It never failed."

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.530
So working on your
beard and mustache.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:35.830
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All right.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.190
Well that was -- yeah, like
you said, you mentioned before

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:39.920
that she had sort of no filter.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.630
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: No filter
between her brain and mouth at all.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.320 position:56%
She would say whatever came to mind.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.760
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: And that
also made her your primary source

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.270
for dirtier songs, wasn't she?

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.570
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.870
Dirtier, filthy.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: I was
shocked when I heard some

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.670
of the songs that she sang for you.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:58.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: I know, I know.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.270
That came out of my mouth.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.850
And if you remember, I didn't
really want to do them, but I did,

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.980
because of Branson mainly,
you know, my fiddle player.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.460
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: But boy, they
were -- a friend of mine said,

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.030
"There's a difference
in vulgar and raunchy.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:17.180
And these are raunchy."

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Well I think
it's interesting for people to know

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.970
that that was actually
part of this tradition too.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.270
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:23.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: But it
didn't get collected very much

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.180
because you wouldn't sing those in
front of people you didn't know.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.480
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: That's right.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.560
And you know, Cecil Sharp
collected a bunch of them

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.390
because Aunt Zip herself, who
lived to be 112, told me that,

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.510
"Well you know, I didn't just
sing four nights for him.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.430
I sang all seven of them."

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:40.730
He left them out.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.030
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.330
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
The raunchy verses.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:44.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:45.930
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And
the other thing was that,

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:50.020
I just think the raunchy songs
were taught a lot to the boys.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:54.390
And when they finally got
a girl that was interested,

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.470
Granny and Berzil knew too.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:58.930
They just didn't say much.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.450
Boy, Inez, it didn't
bother her a bit.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:02.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All right.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.770
Well that sort of brings up
another part of the tradition

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:10.520 position:56%
that you mentioned briefly that's
also big, which is the sacred songs.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.820
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So you sung
those as a kid as well, didn't you?

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.250
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Oh yeah.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.550
And you know, we had every flavor

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.370
of Baptist style that
you could imagine.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.550
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Hard shell
Baptist, free will Baptist,

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:27.010
missionary Baptist, regular
Baptist, plain old Baptist.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:31.010
Born in the shadow of
the cross, again Baptist.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.160
Primitive Baptist,
progressive primitive Baptist,

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.220
foot washing Baptist, holy rolling
Baptist and buzzard Baptist.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.400
And the buzzard Baptists were
those how only went to church

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.630 position:56%
when there was a funeral, so that's
why we called them buzzard Baptists.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:51.730
But Daddy used to say the Baptist
churches were about to swarm there

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.460
around home like a beehive.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.500
Go down the road before they'd
cut down three and build

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.800
yet another Baptist church.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.090
So we had plenty of
Baptist churches.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:06.070
And I can remember as a girl
going from one Baptist church

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.950
to another and sitting outside.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:12.130
You know, because if you were
missionary Baptist, you couldn't go

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.670
to no hard shell Baptist.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.890
That might lead you
down the road, you know,

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.080
where you didn't want to go.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.830
But I would sit on the bank
and listen to them sing.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.620
And regular Baptists were
kind of boring I thought

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.570
because they all sung
in this same --

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.540
there was no harmony because that
was ornamentation to the song.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:34.940
But boy, some of the rest of those
Baptists -- southern Baptists,

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.030
the harmony was just spot on.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.000
And then they'd have the
shape note singings, yeah.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.440
Sacred songs was a big part of it.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.100
And I think one influenced
the other, Steve.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.590
And I've not figured
out how it went.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:56.660
If the balanced singing, kind
of those pauses in size and all,

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.710
influenced the scene
of the sacred songs,

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.010
or if it was the other way around:

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.960
the sacred songs influenced
what was being sung about.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right,
and it could have been both

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.910
and you'd never be able
to really pry it apart.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.410
You did learn to sing
harmony, didn't you?

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.710
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: I did.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.010
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
Singing school, right?

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.310
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: With Chaz.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.510
He would do a couple of
weeks in the summertime.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.470
And he would have what
he called singing school.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:21.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.770
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And
everybody had a shape note book.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:29.150
And we did the Christian
harmony, you know, which is based

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:33.440
on the seven shapes as opposed
to the four like the sacred art.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:40.920
And he would teach us the
shapes because you know,

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.180
soul, round, like the sun.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.630
Do, you know, looks like you sat

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.210
down on something pointed
and made it flat.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:55.620
No little trapezoid.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.920
And "Do."

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.220
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
That's a good one.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.520
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Mi, you know.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.820
Mi loves diamonds.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.710
And so that's how he
taught all of us.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:04.010
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Interesting.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.700
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Yeah, it was really cool.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.310
So yeah, we did just about a
little bit of every kind of music.

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:14.160
The Carter Family, oh everybody
loved the Carter Family.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.290
And Jimmy Rogers.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.520
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And
they listened to the radio.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.920
I mean, it wasn't that isolated.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.190
Except you know, in the 30's
we didn't have any except

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.860
for Irving Ramsey.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.020
And Irving Ramsey had
dental work done.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.320
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Gotcha.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.670
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And the
radio waves were conducting

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:41.790
through his dental work and they
would prop his mouth open, Steve,

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.210
put him on the store
porch in a chair.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:46.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Really?

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yes, with ice
cream sticks to prop his mouth open,

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.760
and listen to John Brinkley
down in Del Rio, you know,

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.480
south of the border, live, 7:00
at night on Saturday nights.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
Right, the Mexican radio.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.080
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: That's right.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.020
Biggest one ever in the
northern hemisphere.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.150
And the Carter Family would sing.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:07.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: That's right.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:11.320
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
On the sunny side.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.070
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Amazing.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.510
So yeah, so now we've talked
about some of the songs,

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.540
but you also have a
career as a storyteller,

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.150
and that's another
interesting part of what you do.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.610
So how did that begin?

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:26.680
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: You know, I'm
not really sure how that began,

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.150
because I had been
touring and doing music

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.530
since the early '90's full time,
you know, because I taught school

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.040
of 18 years in the
public school system.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:42.650
And then I went out on
the road playing music.

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:46.150
And in 1997 I got invited
to Jonesburough

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.910
which is the big international
storytelling festival that goes

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.670
on the first week in October.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.380 position:56%
And if you ain't been, you ought to.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.970
Because you'd love it.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.270
It's fabulous.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.880
And thousands and thousands
of people go now.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.500
But see, I always looked
at it as just conversation.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.800
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.740
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Because
my daddy and his brothers --

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:14.810
I think I've told you, daddy's
mother and father had 13 children,

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.620
all of them boys except for
two twin girls born right

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.370
in the middle of them.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:21.850
But you want to talk about a job

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:25.080
that I would not apply for,
but that's one of them.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.950
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And they
just kind of roamed about

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.600
and did what they wanted
to, but they would sit

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.630
at the family reunion
and get started talking.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:37.820
And it was like this brother, Uncle
Nolan, would have one version.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.280
Daddy would have another
version, and Uncle Wayne

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.060
and Uncle Garlan would chime in
and Uncle Andy would say something.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.890
And it was phenomenal to
listen to them talk about.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.990
But I got some great stories.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.590
My daddy and Uncle Wayne went out
and gathered up two tow sacks full

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.440
of possums one night, alive.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:02.760
And brought them back and right
before daylight they opened --

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:07.940
because nobody in Sodham
kept their doors locked.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:17.030 position:56%
They opened Granny Bear's door and
just threw both open bags of possums

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.960
into her cabin and closed the door.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:25.630
And she said, "I'm going
to tell your mommy on you,

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.440
because I have gathered
possums out of every crook

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.390
and cranny of this whole cabin.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.700
And I am wore slap out."

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.000
And that was two days later.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.680
So Daddy said there must have been
150 possums in those two bags.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:45.660
So they were natural
born storytellers.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.350
And if they couldn't find one
to tell, they'd just create one.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.320
Well, it's interesting, because
you know, when I was young,

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.020
if you heard the term storyteller

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.910
and when there was a
storytelling festival,

00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:00.070
it was mostly people telling
old traditional folktales.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:03.070
And nowadays it's much more common
for this kind of family story

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.160
to be the story that gets told.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:11.460
So I guess that's part of how
your stories would become part

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.760
of this scene.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.060
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Right.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:18.220
Because unlike Ray Hicks and Rose
and Stanley Hicks and that crowd

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.820
down around Beach Mountain, my
family did not tell jack tales

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.120
or the grandfather tales.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.970
Granny had one story she told
about Big and Little Nippy,

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.970
which would have been Big
Jack, Little Jack, same story.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.540
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: But they
were more into singing the songs

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:36.750
and playing music and
frolicking and dancing.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:41.330
And so they were not
those kind of stories.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:45.790
But they had all these family
stories that they passed down,

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.690
and some of them will
just curl your eyebrows

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:55.310
at the stuff those people did
back in the 1800's and 1700's.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Well
yeah, as a homeowner,

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:00.360 position:56%
the thought of someone throwing two
large bags of possums into my house,

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.780
you know, that would
be unusual these days.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.080
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Right.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.590
And the fact that she
was named Granny Bear.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:08.890
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:10.190
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: See,
now therein is another story.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: That's right.

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:15.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Her husband had
killed a sal bear as they called it.

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.040
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.340
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
And was skinning it out

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:21.110
and there was a bear cub
crying out in the weeds.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.930
Went and got it, took it home to
Granny Bear, whose name was Martha.

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:29.490
And she had just had a baby.

00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:34.160
And she nursed that bear cub right
alongside that baby like twins

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.970
and it followed her around
like a durn big dog, you know.

00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:40.270
Everywhere she went,
that bear was with her.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.520
And it got to be a rather big bear.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.400
And the circus came through and
her husband sold it to the circus.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.890
She said, "It's just like
losing one of my young'ins."

00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:50.330
And poor old thing, I guess it was.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah,
but it would be hard

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.940
to keep supporting a full
grown bear I suppose.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.590
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
And it's still a bear.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah,
it's still a bear, exactly.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.240
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: That's how
she got her name, Granny Bear.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.540
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.160
Well one thing that we're
very happy to have here

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.170
at the American Folk Life
Center is the collection

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:09.470
of the national storytelling
festival.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.770
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Absolutely.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:13.310
I thought that was a
fabulous move on both parties.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:14.700
Yeah, that was great.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.400
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
So your performances

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.250
from that festival will be
here in the library as well.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.550
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yep,
and I'm going back this year.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:21.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All right.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.320
So there's one festival performance
that was sort of big in your life.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.050
And because I asked
about storytelling,

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.350
we kind of jumped over it.

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:32.400
So let's jump back to the
Smithsonian Folk Life Festival

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.700
when you first went there.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.000
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.990
that would have been the
bicentennial celebration of 1976.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:41.670
And I would have been
23 at that time.

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:44.210
And you know how you are at 23.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.510
You're just fresh out of
college and you know everything.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:49.370
I mean, gosh, you learned
everything.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.910
There's nothing else
that's going to --

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.750
I mean, when we went
to Washington that year

00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:00.390
for the bicentennial
celebration for the Smithsonian,

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:04.840
I don't think I've
ever worked as hard

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.750
for so little money
in my entire life.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:10.350
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Because
they worked me to death.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:13.510
It was something all the
time, but it was good stuff.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So you
came up with your whole family?

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.660
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: I did.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.720
I came up with them as a
singer, as one of the singers.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.460
And it was really weird
because you had Evan Ramsey

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:25.770
who was probably 20,
30, maybe even 40.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:29.700
Not quite 40 years older
than me, and then me.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.620
So people would come up
at the festival and ask

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.240
if I was a volunteer, knew
where the first aid tent was.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.540
Uh-uh. No.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.840
Gosh, I don't know.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.840
"Oh my God, she's one of
them," and would point

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.190
at the old gals over here.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:47.490
And Chaz was -- I just left
him up to Bobby McMillan.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.180
You know, Bobby was up
here at that time too

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.730
and started hanging out with us.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:58.550
They got to know my family and they
adored Bobby and he adored them.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:06.290
And so it was just a real
interesting festival to be --

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:10.080
and that was like I said,
one of the first big events

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.220
that we'd ever gone anywhere
together with each other.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.880
But I drove the Station Wagon
from Ashville to Raleigh,

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.710
and then we flew on
the plane from Raleigh

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.440
after they had to take a gun.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.610
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Snub-nosed .38 from Granny,

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:29.060
all six chambers loaded
and ready to go.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.340
They had to take it away from her

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.220
down at the airport
in Raleigh-Durham.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.600
Because you know, it
wasn't as bad as it is now,

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.300
but you could still get on a plane
in Raleigh and wind up in Libya.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:47.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And so, yeah,
it took me 30 minutes to convince --

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.340
I didn't think she could
find Libya on the globe

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.160
if her literal life depended on it.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.230
And so they finally
said, "Well, all right."

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:00.210
And she said, "What about my gun?"

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.930
They sent it up to the pilot,

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:05.860
which gives me great you know
comfort now to think of that.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.470
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: But yeah,
they sent it up with the pilots

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.870
in two separate sandwich bags.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:12.170
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All right.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:13.580
So the ammunition came
out, I take it.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.950
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And they
took the bullets from her.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:16.250
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right, yeah.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:17.550
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Which she complained

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:18.850
about the rest of her life.

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:20.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:21.450
Also they never gave
those back, just the gun.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:22.750
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Nope, just the gun.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: That was
probably sensible though.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:26.180
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: I would say
in DC, probably really sensible.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:29.800
There's no telling what
she'd have done up there.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:36.970
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: But it
was a very -- they had a ball.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.690
You know, it was one
of the few times --

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.680
the only time I guess that most

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.340
of them had been here
to the nation's capital.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.640
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Sure.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.880
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And you know,
me being the great world traveler,

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:54.120
having flown from home to
Philadelphia once one way,

00:38:54.120 --> 00:39:01.260
but at the same time we were
housed at Georgetown University

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.630
and Barzil got lost down in
the works as she called it,

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.580
trying to find the bathroom.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.990
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Which was
four doors down on the right

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.710
on the hall we were staying at.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.490
But she had been downstairs in like
the furnace room in the basement,

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:20.040
wandering around looking for
a bathroom for two hours.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.610
And she said, "Well
I just feel foolish.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.100
You showed us where
that bathroom was

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.940
and I've been down in the works."

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.890
And immediately red flag, red flag.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:30.580
"Uh, what works?"

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.140
And she said, "You know, down there

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.780
where they keep the
suitcases and stuff."

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.880
And I said, "Suitcases?"

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.470
"Well you have to go
down all these steps."

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:43.560
And I said to myself, "Okay, an
86-year-old woman is wandering

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:50.620
around down in the works
while you are out singing

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.340
and raising cane with
Bobby McMillan?"

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.470
And then as soon as
I get back, you know,

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:57.770
the knocks started on the door.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:03.590
They got up at 4:00, 4:30
in the morning every day.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:06.140
I remember Granny saying,
"Yep, time to get up.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.860
Gosh it's quarter to 5:00.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.380
Half a day is done gone."

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.220
That would be 5:00 AM.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.800
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: But that
festival was a real eye opener I

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.720
think for me because I don't
think I've ever laughed

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.670
as much in my entire life.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:29.600
Because these were grown-up people.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.740
And they did exactly what they
wanted to and did not care

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.400
who heard them, saw them.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.880
They didn't even notice all these
other people wandering around.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.580
They'd just get cussed
out and everything else,

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.880
walking down the sidewalks.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.180
People would gather around you.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.420
Or one of them would
just bust into song.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.980
I remember Evelyn Ramsey singing --

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.150
ooh, it gives me cold
chills right now --

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.860
Black is the Color of
my True Love's Hair,

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:58.180
standing on some corner
you know in Georgetown.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.350
She just got happy, wanted to sing.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.180
And sung Black is the Color.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.360
And she must have had 300 people

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.370
around her standing
there on that corner.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:08.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Sure.

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:09.970
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yep.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: At the
festival, like you said,

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.980
you had seen the whole
mall full of people.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.280
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Oh yeah,
and they would follow us

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.630 position:56%
around after Inez did her little do.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.090
You know, she told dirty
jokes from the big stage.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:21.390
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:24.040
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And so I
thought, "Nobody will ever come

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.480
to your concert or
see us ever again."

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: She
knew what she was doing.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.860
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: It was packed.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.230
Everywhere we went there
was standing room only

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:38.010
and they were having to roll the
tents all up and do all that stuff,

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:40.890
because -- well I think, yeah,

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:42.340
she probably did know
what she was doing.

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.640
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.940
Well it's interesting because
you know, you were joking

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.390
that she had no filter at all.

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:47.690
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yep.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:50.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: But then you
told the story and sang the song

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.970
that she did at the festival.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.270
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Right.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:54.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: And
although it's a tease song,

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.250
it wasn't really a dirty song given
the songs that she could have sung.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.500
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: She said,
"You know what, it's only dirty

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.500
in somebody else's mind."

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.800
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.100
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Wherever
their mind takes them.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.400
I ain't got no charge over that.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.110
But you're right, she didn't
sing Crawling and Creeping,

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:10.290 position:56%
and she didn't sing Sweet Betsy,
and she didn't sing a bunch of those

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.720
that she could have
sung, thankfully.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.810
Yeah, so I mean in a
way she had a filter.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:20.830
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: There
was a wee bit of a filter.

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:24.250
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: As I said,
she knew what she was doing.

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.550
Yeah.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.000
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And you
know, when she was talking to me

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.870
in the hospital and she
said, "You see about things.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.650
Take care of things,"
she said, "I didn't mean

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:34.950
to embarrass you up there.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:36.250
I hope I didn't."

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:38.730
And I said, "Up where?"

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.450
And she said, "Up yonder
in Washington."

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.530
And I said, "Honey, you
didn't embarrass me."

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.790
And she said, "Well
damn, I meant to.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:48.230
I really did mean to."

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.420
And she said, "You just
needed straightening out

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.730
and reminding where you came from.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:53.910
Don't you get above your raising.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:55.740
Don't ever get above your raising.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.340
You're fine just like you are."

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:01.240
And that was one of the things that
they gave me, was a certain kind

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.840
of confidence, a strength.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.110
And recognizing that strength.

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:07.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.180
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Which
has gotten me through a lot.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.420
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: It's gotten
you through a lot and I mean,

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.650
first of all, a performance
career isn't easy.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:15.950
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: No.

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:17.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: And
so it's gotten you that.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:18.570
But other things as well.

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:21.760
I mean, let's talk a little
bit about your film work,

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.160
the consulting you
did for Song Catcher.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.030
What was that like?

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:28.330
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Well
it was really interesting.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:33.140
I got a phone call and I'm not
even sure what the exact date was,

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:38.380
but it was something like
-- I don't know -- '94, '95.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:43.950
From this woman who said she was
a film director from New York.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:50.750
And immediately I went to
attention and red flag, red flag.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:55.190
And she said, "And my husband and
I, David Mansfield, we're thinking

00:43:55.190 --> 00:44:00.260
about doing a film based loosely
on the life of Ollie Dane Campbell.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.900
And would you be interested
in helping us

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:06.170
with the songs and the singers?"

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:10.950
Because Cecil Sharp
had a huge influence

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:14.370
on what eventually happened
concerning Ollie Dane Campbell.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:19.320
And I said, "Well, let
me think about it."

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:24.700
And so I made some phone calls
because I seriously at that point

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:30.540
in the '90's took my
role in keeping this --

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:35.180
because you know, Granny had
just died in '93 and Chaz in '91.

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.480
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.780
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
I mean it was just

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.620
like dominoes since Inez had died.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:45.210
So at that point I was taking
it really serious about the love

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:48.780
and passion I have and that they
have and that my family has had

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:52.010
for a long time about these
songs that are ancient.

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:57.900
I mean, some of them are -- I know
one about Eleanor's Confessions --

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.250
and who was she married to?

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.200
Henry III or something
like that, wasn't it, or V?

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.500
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
I think it was early.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.800
It might have been Henry II.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.550
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Henry II, that's right.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:11.570
And then when the Normans
invaded the Saxons.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:14.410
And so these songs go back forever.

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:15.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:17.980
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And somebody
had carried them over here

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:23.010
in their heart and then passed them
down into Granny's and Berzil's

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:25.480
and Inez's heart and
they shared them with me.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.120
And their main goal was to get
them into the next century.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:37.390
And so it became you know,
obvious that I was going to have

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.210
to be prepared to do that too.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:43.640
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: And so
that influenced your sort

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.040
of decision on that film?

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.340
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah, it did.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:50.780
As a matter of fact, I don't mind
telling you, it was Wayne Martin

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.660
in North Carolina who
is now our wonderful,

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:56.700
fabulous head of the arts
council in North Carolina.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.000
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.300
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And he's done

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.120
so much good work down
there for the arts.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.810
He said, "Well, you know, Sheila,
somebody's going to do it."

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:07.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:10.790
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: "And why
not make sure it's done right?"

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:15.230
They called me from Sundance,
Maggie and David did.

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.670
And Aiden Quinn.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:18.250
They were all three at Sundance.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:22.970
And they were going to fly me
out to Sundance because the music

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.760
in the film, Song Catcher,
was winning so many awards.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.950
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
And I couldn't go.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:34.790
But it was all right, because
that's what I hoped would happen.

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:38.880
You know, the authenticity
of the songs and the music.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.250
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: And you
had some people in the film

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:43.880
who were traditional singers,
and others who weren't,

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.400
who you had to teach how to do it.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.700
What was that like?

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:51.050
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Emmy Rossum
was a child prodigy opera star.

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:52.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:55.030
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
As a matter of fact,

00:46:55.030 --> 00:47:02.760
she was the latest female character
cast for Phantom of the Opera.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.870
Yeah. And so she was
very, very talented.

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:08.050
Beautiful young gal.

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:11.360
And boy, I didn't realize
at the time

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:15.180
that an opera singer
basically mimics the sounds.

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.140
They don't really learn
all those languages.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.440
Right.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And so what she
was catching was every inflection

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.880
that came from my accent.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.770
And boy she would sing those
dadgum things back to me.

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.200
And it was almost like
listening to me sing.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.500
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:36.280
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And Jim my
husband then came back and said,

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.880
"I thought you didn't
sing in Song Catcher."

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.180
I said, "I didn't."

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.870
He said, "Well I just
heard you on the radio.

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:43.360
I heard you on NPR singing."

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.200
And I said, "Jim, that
was Emmy Rossum."

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.500
"No, it was not.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.800
We've been married a long time.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.680
And I think I would know when."

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.240
And I said, "Jim, it
was Emmy Rossum."

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.590
And it was.

00:47:54.590 --> 00:48:00.570
And then there was Bobby
McMillan, sang with Hazel Dickens.

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:04.770
And one of the actors
sang Beth O Death.

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:08.160
And then there was Phil Jamison.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.050
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: You know,
local history professor that danced

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:17.010
with the big long legs that looked
like that stick that you pack.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.550
But gosh, he can dance.

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:27.910 position:56%
And so there were regular actors
and then there were homegrown folks.

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:29.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:32.610
And I'll mention just for the
people who might watch this video

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:36.160
that Bobby McMillan and Phil
Jamison are both scholars

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.530
of this tradition as well.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:39.870
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yes, they are.

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:41.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
Phil mostly in dance.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.680
That there's a certain crossover

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.820
between the performers
and scholars as well.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.250
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
And Hazel Dickens.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:48.770
And Hazel, you know.

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:51.340
She sang a verse in it as well.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:54.840
And Iris Demen was
in it if I remember.

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:56.140
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: That's right.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:57.440
I think you're right.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:03.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yep, and she
sang Chaz's version of Pretty Sarah.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:07.120
Yep. And Josh Goforth, a
cousin of mine, played fiddle.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.420
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.720
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
For their soiree.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.400
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So
you were able to sort

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.860
of put together an
authentic music for this film?

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.400
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Well
I worked close with David.

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.590
David Mansfield is a
genius when it comes to --

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:22.970
I mean, he can play every
instrument, write music,

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:24.510
you know, do all that stuff.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:28.270
And he is a fabulous composer,

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:32.180
done a lot of soundtracks,
that kind of thing.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:36.480
But he loved the music
in Song Catcher.

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:40.380
You know, he's a great fiddle
player and banjo player too.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.930
And we've kept in touch.

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:46.590
I mean, I thought that David did
such a great job with the music

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:50.550
in that film that I
will forever be indebted

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.380
to Maggie and to David Mansfield.

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:55.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Well
you did a great job.

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.980
They're indebted to you.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.280
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Thank you.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.600
And they really appreciated it
too and they made it obvious.

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: That's great.

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:06.680
So the other thing that you've
been doing lately is writing books,

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:07.980
right?

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.280
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yes.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So
tell us about your writing.

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.470
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Well,
like we talked about earlier,

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:16.130
the first book was a book of
storytelling, or just stories

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:19.860
that I had heard or been a
part of you know in my growing

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:21.810
up over there around home.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:26.640
And then the second one
was based on a story --

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:30.030
and the short story
collection was published

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:32.700
by the University of
North Carolina press.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.890
And my favorite Appalachian
writer, Lee Smith,

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:38.190
had a lot to do with that.

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:42.870
Lee has written several
books about mountain women.

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:46.010
And she wrote one called
fair and tender ladies

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:50.900
that is just the best one I've
ever read about a mountain woman.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:55.060
And so she was very
influential with that.

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:59.590
And then I wrote a novel based
on a story that Daddy told me

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:04.100
about two cousins that
went off to the Civil War

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:07.770
and they left their womenfolk
and families behind them,

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.400
and what happened to the
women while they were gone.

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.200
It's pretty gruesome in the
mountains, southern Appalachians.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.500
It really was.

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.930
Especially North Carolina.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:20.750
Because western North Carolina
voted to stay in the union.

00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:24.030
And the rest of the state
voted to leave the union.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:25.330
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:28.310
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And so it was
a little iffy there for a while

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:30.090
as to whether the mountains
would say

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:33.080
in the state of North
Carolina, yeah.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.480
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.790
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: And both
books did you know fairly well.

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:43.420
I was really pleased
with how well they did.

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.440
The novel was first published
by Al Gonkwin of Chapel Hill,

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.980
and then it got picked
up by Random House.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:52.110
So you know, it's paper back
so I thought, "Well shoot."

00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:54.390
But I've got one more
book in me I think.

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:55.690
Actually I've got several.

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:57.950
I'm working on one now called
The Hanging of Peter Smith.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:59.250
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All right.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:00.940
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: So
you already know then,

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.220
Peter Smith's going to get hung.

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:08.240
But it's told from the perspective
of four women, different women

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:12.550
who tell different stories about
Peter Smith but they all lead

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:13.850
to the gallows, you know.

00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:15.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:17.400
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
And that's a true story.

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:21.590
Because Peter Smith was
the last man legally hung

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:22.950
in the state of North Carolina.

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:24.430
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All right.

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:25.730
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yep.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:33.640
But I've got one I want to write
about my family's take or you know,

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:39.340
the way they looked at
outsider folklorists coming in

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.340
and collecting their songs.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:46.840
And how it went form Cecil Sharp
to -- gosh, who was the last.

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:53.190
I guess Alan Lomax is the last one
in the '80's, early '80's, '83.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:55.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So was he
with a video crew at that time?

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.660
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.530
And he had a crew of
more than one, yeah.

00:52:58.530 --> 00:52:59.830
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:01.290
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: He had a
larger crew than John Cohen did.

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:02.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:06.620
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: But I would
really love to write that story

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:11.200
about some of the things
that they said happened.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.160
And some things I witnessed myself,

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.810
like Doral Chandler
dressing up like a woman.

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:17.220
That really happened.

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.520
And it was on a dare.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:19.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.570
I think it's funny because I think
a lot of people watched the film

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:23.440 position:56%
and they don't actually notice that.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.940
You know, it just kind
of goes over their heads.

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.240
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Gosh, I don't know how.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.640
Because you know, his
shoulders are this broad,

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.610
big hairy legs hanging down.

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:33.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: I know, but
I've mentioned it to several people

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:37.040
and they've said, "I
don't remember that part."

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.340
So whatever.

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:39.640
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.400
Well so in your community
now, in Madison County,

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.890
there's sort of a revival
of the ballads.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.620
I mean, a lot of kids are
collecting them and singing them.

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:54.550
What part did you play in
that, and how is that going?

00:53:54.550 --> 00:54:01.220
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Well it's
really interesting because when --

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:05.050
and you know, now that I think
about it, Song Catcher back

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:10.520
in the late '90's kind of you know
boosted some of my cousins along.

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:16.470
Donna Ray Norton, one of the best
ballad singers I've ever heard --

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:22.630
she's about 35 maybe now.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:28.100
And she's absolutely
stunningly authentic.

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:30.410
My daughter is a great
singer, Melanie.

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:34.750
And it was kind of that Song
Catcher, just like John Cohen did

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:38.140
for me and Cecil Sharp did
for Granny and that crowd.

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:40.400
You know, kind of gave
them a little lift.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:44.990
And then there were these kids
that started coming to me.

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:49.040
Elizabeth Laprel, who is I think
one of the best ballad singers

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.060
that ever stood upright and walked.

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.110
Sam Gleaves, same thing.

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:55.040
One of the best ones
I've ever heard.

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.730
And around home we've
got Ash Devine,

00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:59.460
who is such a great ballad singer.

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.040
She's from southwestern Virginia.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:03.670
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Right
around where Doc Watson is from.

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:09.500 position:56%
Sarah Lynch Thompson who is a
fabulous activist and ballad singer.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:13.030
And Branson Raines, my
little fiddle player.

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:18.110
His voice has gotten -- it's just
cream of the crop now, you know.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:19.650
So there's a bunch.

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:25.570
And my grandson Ezra
who will be 11 in May.

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:32.130
About a month ago he was spending
the night with me and I was talking

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.260
to him while he was you know
getting settled in his bed.

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:36.970
He said, "You know them
old songs we sing?"

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:38.820
and I said, "Yeah."

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:44.130
He said, "You know any about
people killing anybody?"

00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:46.170 position:56%
I didn't ask you know if he'd gotten

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:49.600
into like harming animals
or anything.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.260
But he just said, "No, mama
put in one of your CD's

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.780
and I really liked one of them."

00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.190
And I said, "Oh really?

00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:58.490
Which one did you like?"

00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:59.790
He said, "It's about a drunk man."

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:02.910
And I thought, "Okay,
Four Nights Drunk.

00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:04.210
Here we go."

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:07.980
But he can sing Four Nights
Drunk and Jerusalem Morn.

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:10.970
But it's my granddaughter
who's coming along too.

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:15.030
She's missing her two
front teeth right now

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:16.760
and she's embarrassed
to sing right now.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:20.520
But Carlie Rose can sing.

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:26.400
And with a name like that,
Carlie Rose, oh yeah.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:30.630
She loves the old songs and loves
to -- she doesn't know the words.

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:33.030
She'll be seven this year.

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:36.630
But she doesn't know all the words,

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:40.700
but she'll make them
up, tell the same story.

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.000
Yeah.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.300
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So a lot of
these singers that you're talking

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.570
about are relatives of yours.

00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:46.870
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yes.

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.170
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
Some of them not.

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:52.160
But another thing you've been doing
is going to places like Augusta

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:56.200
and teaching in a more
kind of almost academic way

00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.140
where people come to you from all
over the country to learn ballads.

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.440
So how does that differ?

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.740
What is that like?

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:04.040
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: If there's
a young person in that crowd,

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.340
I can guarantee you they'll be

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.510
at my house spending the
night within six months.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:11.990
Because I'll bore in
on the young folks.

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:14.210
Because you know, that's
where it is.

00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:17.070
That's what it's all about.

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:23.530
It's about handing -- well nobody
said it better than Cecil Sharp.

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:30.050
He said, "From birth we are
given this right to these songs.

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:32.100
They belong to us."

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.380
And so that's what
I tell these kids.

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.520
And boy, they come just
like shots, you know.

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:42.410
And they'll spend -- Sam spent a
whole summer at my house, you know.

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:44.480
And it's just wonderful.

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.670
Branson was there for two years.

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:47.970
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:51.340
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yeah, so
that's what it's all about.

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:55.760
It's about passing it
down, passing it on.

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: All right,
that's a great sentiment to have.

00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:01.310
We love to hear that because
we're involved on the other end

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:02.610
in collecting these things

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:05.330
and keeping the collections
for future generations.

00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:09.150
And the fact that you're doing
the same thing just as a person,

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:11.390
you're an archive,
teaching it to them.

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:12.690
So that's wonderful.

00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:15.520
One other thing I wanted
to mention is the fact

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.630
that you're the recipient of
a National Heritage Fellowship

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:20.520
from the National Endowment
for the Arts.

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:26.850 position:56%
So tell us about what that was like.

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:29.580
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Well, as you know, Steve,

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:34.940
my husband Jim committed
suicide in 2009 in March.

00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:41.920 position:56%
And I felt -- I didn't know if I was
going to make it through it or not.

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.710
But the funniest thing happened.

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:51.980
I started to remember these
songs that came from Granny.

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:55.140
Because she would say, "You know,
laugh or cry, honey, sing a song.

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:59.540
Laugh or cry, sing a song.

00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:00.840
That's what's going
to make you better.

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.570
That's what's going to heal you."

00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:06.250
And so it was like I just
forgot about the here and now

00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:10.100
and I just leaned back, closed my
eyes and fell back into the arms

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:16.160
of all those loving women
with all those songs.

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:21.020
And Jeff Warner who's the son
of Frank and Ann Warner --

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:24.100
another great team of collector
all over North Carolina, you know.

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:25.400
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: We've
got their collection to.

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.700
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yes, you do.

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:28.920
And I'm going to look
at it tomorrow too.

00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:34.590
He came to me and Jeff is such a
fine and nice and wonderful person.

00:59:34.590 --> 00:59:38.040
And he said, "Sheila, I'm
so sorry to hear about Jim.

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.530
And I want to teach you a song."

00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:48.040
And I thought to myself, "I do not
believe that he just said he wants

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.000
to teach me a song now, three
months after Jim's death."

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.620
And he said, "No, this
is one, Sheila,

00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:56.490
I promise you've got
to learn this song."

00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:58.300
And he taught it to me.

00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.860
He sat down and I learned
it the old style.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.720
He'd sing it, I'd sing
it back to him.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:07.040
He'd sing it, I'd sing
it back to him.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.340
And that's how I learned it.

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:12.840
And it was Her Bright Smile Haunts
Me Still, that was collected

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.490
out on the outer banks
by his parents.

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:18.520
And isn't that amazing?

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.120
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: It looped
around the world, you know.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:28.000
Because that song that she sang
was the song that they sang

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.250
on New Year's Eve when the guy
went around and checked the gates

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.310
for all these little
pounds in Scotland.

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:36.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Okay.

01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:38.900
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: That
was the one that he sang

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.620
in this little place I
think called Iverness.

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:42.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Okay.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.220
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Or Iberness.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:49.210
And so it went from
there to the outer banks

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.110
to -- is it New Hampshire?

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:52.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: I think
it was New Hampshire, yeah.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.040
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
To New Hampshire,

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.890
back to western North Carolina
and then I took it back to England

01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:01.160
and sang it this past summer.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Very nice.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:03.760
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Nice.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So Her
Bright Smile Haunts Me Still.

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.360
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yep.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:10.000
Only I changed the words to His
Bright Smile Haunts Me Still.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.300
Yeah.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.600
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.380
So I mean, that experience
is sort of one

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:19.330
of the universal experiences I
think that people who perform

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:22.860
or who have traditional songs
in their background have.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:26.740
Which is you know, these tragedies
happen to us and then we realize

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:29.630
that well, these tragedies
have happened before

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:30.930
to generations of people.

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:32.230
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: For
thousands of years, that's right.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:33.530
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: And
here it is in the songs

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:35.200
that I already know and
that I already sing.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.500
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Yep.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.540
And you know, that's a gift
to be given those songs.

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:42.000
And to be given that knowledge
that it ain't just you, honey.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.900
And somehow they made it through.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick:
Yeah, but then a couple

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:48.380
of years later, to
get that recognition.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:53.700
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: To get the
NEA award, that was in 2013.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.350
And Jim died in 2009.

01:01:56.350 --> 01:02:03.510
And so when Barrie Burgett got
ahold of me, you know to tell me

01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:07.000
that I'd gotten it, I
thought he was calling me

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.180
to ask me to MC the event.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:12.220
Because I thought maybe something
had happened to Nick, you know.

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.950
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Nick
Spister who usually does it.

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:17.090
And he said, "No, no.

01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:18.880
I want you to come up here
and get yours and take it back

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.480
to North Carolina with you."

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.840
And I just started bawling.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.250
I was mowing the grass.

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:25.850
It's one of those I'll
always remember where I was

01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:27.580
when I got the news from that.

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:33.850
And then I found out George Hold
had worked so hard and tirelessly

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:36.640
to get all the material and
all that stuff together.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.430
He and Wayne Martin.

01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:43.550
And I mean, getting
that award, Steve,

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:48.630
really lifted me out of that hole.

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:51.150 position:56%
You know, and gave me the incentive.

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:55.540
Because when you get an award
for keeping alive something

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:59.710
that was given to you,
what are you going to do?

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:01.050
Go home and sit down?

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:02.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:03.650
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: No.

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:05.990
You're going to keep going and
working with these young people.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.640
Because that's why
you were recognized.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.140
And it saved my life.

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:15.230
It absolutely saved my
life, getting that award.

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:19.640
And I am so appreciative of the
National Endowment for the Arts.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:23.090
It has done so much
for so many people.

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:26.430
Two of my family members
received that award.

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:27.730
Doug Lawler and me.

01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:29.030
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: That's right.

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:30.740 position:56%
So we didn't talk about Doug at all.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.040
We talked about Chaz.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.410
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Doug and I were cousins.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:38.820 position:56%
And for that to happen in one little
tiny community is pretty impressive.

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:43.570
And you know, to have gotten the
North Carolina Heritage award

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:44.920
in '16.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.330
But it's not about the awards.

01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:50.680
It's about getting the recognition
for having done something you love

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.880
and have a passion for,
and them saying, "Good job.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.180
Good job."

01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:59.090
You know. And that means a lot.

01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:01.580
And I'll be forever grateful.

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.770
Because they saved my life.

01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:06.310
The NEA saved my life.

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Well another
thing that that sort of prompted you

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.150
to do I think is do more
touring in the last few years.

01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:13.450
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Absolutely.

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:16.270
Well, let's put it this
way, it's enabled me.

01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:17.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:18.870
Sure.

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:20.170
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: It
encouraged me and enabled me.

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:23.360 position:56%
Because when they hear that National
Endowment for the Arts Fellowship,

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.930
you know, then they're
more interested

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:26.230
in having you come and do.

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:27.530
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Right.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:29.450
So you've been pretty
much everywhere.

01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:30.750
You've been to Australia.

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:33.250
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Australia this time last year.

01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:39.070
In August I was in
England for five weeks,

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:42.080
all over England doing
those big festivals and all.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:47.320
And then I was in France, in
Paris and Normandy in December.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.220
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: So how does
it differ, taking these songs

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:52.980
to audiences from other
countries which aren't so local

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.000
and so aware of the tradition?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.160
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Do you know
that in Australia I had people come

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:04.260 position:56%
up after concerts crying and saying,
"I have not thought of that song

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:06.570
in 60 years, since my
grandmother sang it."

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:11.490
Because you know, we're
all the same.

01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:12.820
I mean, all over the world.

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.550
It doesn't matter whether
we're English speaking.

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:15.850
It doesn't matter.

01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:18.280
In France, you know, they
would come up, "Merci, merci."

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.410
Because if you have something

01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:28.230
that you have spent a
lifetime -- you know, 64 years.

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:33.170 position:56%
Let's face it, that's a lot of time.

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:35.620
That's six and a half
decades, right?

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:36.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.350
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: So if
you're that interested in it,

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:41.650
it must be worth something.

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:44.530
And if you can ever get people
to sit still long enough --

01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:47.760
and there was one man who came
up and said, "Same versions,

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.890
same songs here, sung in French."

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:54.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Yeah,
there are some of those too.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.490
Isn't that interesting?

01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:59.110
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
Very interesting, yes.

01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:01.710
[Inaudible] we have here.

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:03.010
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Very good.

01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:08.410
Well I just want to thank you for
the concert and this interview

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:10.920
and all the things that you've
told us about your tradition.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.830 position:56%
We really appreciate having you here
and having this in our collections.

01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:16.130
It's a treasure.

01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:17.920
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: Well it
has been my honor to be here.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.310
And y'all do good work.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.610
Keep it up.

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:22.910
Don't quit.

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:24.210
Don't quit.

01:06:24.210 --> 01:06:25.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: We'll try.

01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:26.810
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams:
All right, all right.

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:28.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Thank you.

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:29.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sheila Kay Adams: You're welcome.

01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:30.710
Thank you.

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:32.010
