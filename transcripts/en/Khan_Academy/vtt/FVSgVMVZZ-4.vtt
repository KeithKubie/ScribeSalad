00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.200
All right.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.890
We're on problem 17.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.450
It says, which of the following
best describes the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.505
triangles shown below?

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.955
OK, they want to know,
are the similar?

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:12.550
Are they congruent?

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.800
Et cetera.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.590
They tell us that this
is a 60 degree angle.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.190
This is a 90 degree angle, they
do this little square

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.390
thing there.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.390
The angles in a triangle
have to add up to 180.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.190
So if this is 90, this is
60, that adds up to 150.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.420
So this has to be
180 minus 150.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.080
So this has to be a
30 degree angle.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.460
So that has to be 30 degrees
right there.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.200
Fair enough.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.460
Now let's get this one.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.280
That's 30, that's 90.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.450
Well, by the same argument,
this has got to be 60.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.960
Because they all have
to add up to 180.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.430
All right.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.770
So just there we know that all
of the angles in both of the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.400
triangles are congruent.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.320
Or that their measures
are equal.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.230
So we know already that
these are definitely

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.480
both similar triangles.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.300
Now, a similar triangle also
tells us that the ratio of all

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.600
of the sides are equal.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.450
So.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.530
if you just sort of eyeball it,
if you said, OK, the side

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.100
opposite the 90 degree, these
are the corresponding sides,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.170
the ratios are equal.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.080
But we see that they give
us the actual lengths.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.290
So the hypotenuse of both
of these triangles is 8.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.350
So the ratio is actually 1:1.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.740
And when the ratio of the sides
is 1:1, when the sides

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.400
are actually congruent, and if
you're just given one side,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.040
that's enough.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.770
Then you could actually figure
out the rest of them using a

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.430
little trigonometry or
something like that.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.120
We're not going to go
there just yet.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.630
But in geometry class, you
learned that if something is

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.300
similar and and at least one of
the corresponding sides is

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.370
congruent, then the whole thing

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.250
is going to be congruent.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.495
So these are both similar
and congruent triangles.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.410
Both similar and congruent,
that's A.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.580
Problem 18.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.140
OK, let me cut and paste it.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.500
Which of the following
statements must be true if

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.070
triangle GHI is similar.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.570
So if they write this that
means congruent.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.020
If they just write that,
that means similar.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.130
Which of the following
statements must be true if

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.540
triangle GHI is similar
to triangle JKL?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.410
So even before looking at the
choices, that means that the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.200
ratio of all the sides are
the same, or all of the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.620
angles are the same.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.140
Let's see what they give us.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.660
The two triangles
must be scalene.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.990
Now, you have similar triangles
that are isosceles

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.670
or equilateral.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.440
That's not right.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.320
The two triangles must have
exactly one acute angle.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.210
No, they could have
two acute angles.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.570
They could have three
acute angles.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.370
The way that they've drawn
it here, actually

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.440
all of them are acute.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.120
None of these angles are greater
than 90 degrees just

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.840
the way they've drawn.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.530
So that's not right.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.620
Some of these statements
are so crazy that

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.590
they're hard to process.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.050
Anyway, C, at least one of the
sides of the two triangles

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.530
must be parallel.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.780
I don't care how they're
oriented.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.630
You don't care about the
orientation of the triangles.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.540
The corresponding sides of
the triangles must be

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.300
proportional.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.040
Yeah, that's one of the ways
that you know that something

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.500
is similar.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.290
That the corresponding sides
are proportional.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.790
So that is, D.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.600
So this is almost, do you
know the definition

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.380
of a similar triangle?

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.860
Question 19.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.010
Let me erase this.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.480
OK.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.120
I have copied it.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.760
Now I am pasting it.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.490
In the figure below, AC
is congruent to DF.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.240
OK, so they're equal
to each other.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.300
AC and DF are congruent.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.185
And angle A is congruent
to angle D.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.480
Fair enough.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.900
That's angle A, that's
angle D.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.000
That's what they tell us.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.120
Which additional information
would be enough to prove that

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.070
triangle ABC is congruent
to DEF?

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.520
So they just gave us one
side and one angle.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.000
If they gave us another side,
if they said that DE is

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.130
congruent to AB, that'd
be pretty cool.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.410
If they gave us this angle, if
they said angle F is congruent

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.720
to angle C, that'd be good.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.360
Let's see what they give us.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.610
AB is congruent to DE.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.940
Yeah, sure.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.420
If AB is congruent to DE
then we definitely

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.260
have congruent triangles.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.090
And you know the theorem that
you would have to say in your

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.270
geometry class is, I have a
side, an angle, and a side.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.180
So you would say by SAS, by
side, angle, side, I know that

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.390
these two triangles
are congruent.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.520
So AB is congruent to DE.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.410
Let's look at the other
ones to make sure

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.390
we didn't miss anything.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.640
AB is congruent to BC.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.560
Well, that's fine.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.180
But that doesn't tell us
how AB relates to DE.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.730
So that's a useless statement.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.420
BC is congruent to EF.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.130
Well, see, this is another
time that I have a slight

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.870
problem with the way they're
going with this.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.580
Because if BC were
congruent to EF.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.360
Let me think about that.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.680
Could I draw this triangle
in a way where

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.530
they're still not congruent.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.950
Because I have this angle
here constraining it.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.090
They told us that.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.100
So it's not like I can
draw this line,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.920
FE, coming out here.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.920
Because if it came out here,
then DE would have

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.680
to come like that.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.990
And then this angle couldn't
be what they said it was.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.590
So I'm just trying to think, I
actually think that would be

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.840
sufficient.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.970
If you're given that this side
is congruent to that side.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.420
I think you could make a
trigonometric argument very

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.440
easily to show that these two
triangles have equal sides.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.960
But anyway, I'm not going
to bother with that.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.360
Let's see.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.490
Let's look at choice D.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.000
BC is congruent to DE.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.070
Well, these aren't even
corresponding sides.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.890
So that's clearly useless.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.620
I have a suspicion that
this would have also

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.800
been enough to prove.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:02.500
But anyway, I don't want
to insult anyone in the

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.770
California Department of
Education, but I'm slightly

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.250
disappointed by some
of these questions.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.270
Because I feel like they
really aren't testing

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.060
intuition, they're just testing
to see whether you

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.910
know the definitions of some of
these geometric terms. And

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.780
whether you can spout out, side,
angle, side, and angle,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.370
side, angle.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.450
And things like that.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.230
And you're going to forget those
about three hours after

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.910
you take the test. That's
pretty useless.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.490
What's useful is if you know
something that gives you an

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.740
intuition about triangles.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.830
That's going to be useful for
you on the SAT, that's going

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.690
to be useful for you when
you take trigonometry.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.500
And I'll tell you
a dirty secret.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.620
You will never use ASA theorem
or SAS theorem or anything

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.560
like that again in your
mathematical careers.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.350
Your 9th or 10th grade geometry
class is the first

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.180
and the last time that
you'll ever see them.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.530
So I have a slight problem
where they want you to

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.980
memorize these theorems
and all of that.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.770
And even some of this notation
never shows up again in your

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.980
mathematical careers.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.120
Even if you do a PhD
in mathematics.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.990
The only time you'll probably
see it again is if you become

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.320
a geometry math teacher.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.980
Anyway, but it's good.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.710
I mean you should know how to do
this stuff at minimum just

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.740
to jump through that
loop that society

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.150
makes us all jump through.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.560
So problem 20.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.700
You don't want someone else to
get paid more just because

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.600
they were willing
to say SAS, ASA.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.660
Anyway, all right, problem 20.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.290
Given AB and CD intersect
at point E.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.240
And just another aside, I think
you can even tell from

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.669
my tone that I enjoy the SAT
problems a lot more.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:43.510
Because in some ways, in fact,
in every way, the SAT problems

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.070
really test your understanding
of geometry, but never do they

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:52.180
mention the words similar,
congruent, SAS, ASA.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.220
They never mention all these
things that you essentially

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.960
memorize in your
geometry class.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.860
And I know tons of people who
get A's in geometry and then

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.310
they don't do well on the SAT.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.050
And I know people who
do the other way.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.700
And frankly, I'd rather
hire the person who

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.590
does well on the SAT.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.710
Because that's the person who
I think has the intuition.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.950
But anyway, we have
to do this.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.490
And I probably shouldn't
rant like that.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.666
Given AB and CD intersect
at point E.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.570
Fair enough.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:27.100
And they tell us that angle
1 is congruent to angle 2.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.330
So that and that are equal.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.990
All right, so already
those look like

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.940
alternate interior angles.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.010
If this line were parallel.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.940
In fact, I think that's enough
to show that this line is

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.190
parallel to this line.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.620
Because, if you view this as a
transversal, if you view DC as

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.310
a transversal, then you see
that's a transversal between

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.530
these two lines.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.600
And because the alternate
interior angles are the same,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.540
or they're congruent, you know
that those are going to be

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.650
parallel lines.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.210
But anyway, I don't know if
that's at all useful.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.350
What are they going to ask us?

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:09.190
Which theorem or postulate can
be used to prove that AED is

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.480
similar to BEC.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.000
OK.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.470
So let's see, so I didn't
have to even say those

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.495
are parallel lines.

00:10:18.495 --> 00:10:22.390
So what do they tell us?

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:27.040
First of all, we know that 3
and 4 are congruent angles,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.990
because they're opposite
angles.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.120
Once again, I don't like the
word vertical angles, because

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.060
these angles are clearly
not vertical.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.270
They're more side by side.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.470
But they're definitely
opposite.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.890
So those two angles
are the same.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.560
1 and 2 are the same, 3
and 4 are the same.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.250
If you know two of the
angles in a triangle,

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.910
you know the third.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.670
So this angle and that angle
have to be the same.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.070
But in general, if you know that
two angles of a triangle

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.890
are the same, the third
has to be the same.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.130
So, that tells you that it's
a similar triangle.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.350
So we could use angle, angle.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.140
We know that two angles are the
same as two other angles.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.430
So we know we're dealing
with similar triangles.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.520
Anyway, all out of time
because of my rant.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.500
See you in the next video.
