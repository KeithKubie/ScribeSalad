00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:02.288
Female: ... week in the NBC family.

00:00:02.288 --> 00:00:03.462
And here at CNBC,

00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:06.343
we want to give our viewers the
chance to learn more about finance,

00:00:06.343 --> 00:00:09.234
hoping you understand where
exactly your money is going.

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:10.943
Joining us now in the studio is Sal Khan,

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:11.422
(music)

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:13.837
founder and executive
director of the Khan Academy.

00:00:13.837 --> 00:00:17.689
He is also the mind behind dozens
of videos featured on CNBC.com,

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.872
and he'll explain financial concepts.

00:00:19.872 --> 00:00:20.917
So what exactly are you doing?

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:22.217
What's your initiative?

00:00:22.217 --> 00:00:23.370
Sal: Khan Academy itself,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.190
it literally just started with
me trying to tutor cousins,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.282
and I put my videos on
YouTube, and they got popular,

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:30.766
and so I quit my old job,

00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.649
and I started doing videos on algebra
and calculus and all the rest.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.331
And I even did a few on
economics and finance.

00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:38.671
CNBC contacted me and said,

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.829
"Hey, we want you to do more of that

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.730
"and explain what is a credit default swap

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.911
"or what is the difference between
preferred equity and regular equity,

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:48.160
"and what is the present
value of something?"

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.528
Female: Is it true anecdotally
that you got letters from bankers

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:52.790
who said that you saved
them from getting fired

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.910
so they can learn more
about [unintelligible]

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.376
Sal: Yeah, that happened again last week.

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:55.951
I was at a ...

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:56.667
Female: ... confidence-building.

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:57.980
Sal: It is not very confidence-building,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.656
but at least they had that (laughs).

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:00.341
(laughter)

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:01.401
At least they had ...

00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:03.805
No, I had someone who worked
in mortgage-backed securities

00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:04.997
during the financial crisis.
Male Isn't it that the truth

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:06.718
that people out there who,

00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:08.499
people think they know.

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:10.118
They think they're supposed
to know these things,

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:11.542
and most people really don't.

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:13.130
Sal: No.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.741
And what I say is the
more jargon someone uses,

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:18.297
the less likely they actually
know the underpinnings of what.

00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:20.387
And so yeah, I mean I think
there are a lot of people

00:01:20.387 --> 00:01:21.964
that say the mortgage-backed
security industry

00:01:21.964 --> 00:01:25.065
who are signing the documents, getting
them stamped by their rating agency,

00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:26.330
Male: Obviously, yeah.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.024
Sal: No one knew what was
going on in the big picture.

00:01:28.024 --> 00:01:29.391
Female: Last week, you were talking about

00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:32.329
how there is the need for more
understanding and education about ETFs.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.995
How much interest do you see in people
educating themselves about ETFs?

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:37.820
Sal: Yeah, ETF is one of them.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.530
I didn't do a video on that,
but it's one of those things.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.155
A lot of people will say,

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:43.546
Male: They don't really
understand what it is.

00:01:43.546 --> 00:01:44.340
Sal: "But how does that it work?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.054
"Is it a mutual fund?

00:01:45.054 --> 00:01:45.713
"Is it close-ended?

00:01:45.713 --> 00:01:46.408
"Is it open-ended?

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:47.323
"Is it something in between?"

00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:48.426
and so that's what I try to do,

00:01:48.426 --> 00:01:50.766
is just to break it down,
draw it out, and explain it.

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.945
Male: So your site is ad-free?

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:53.375
Khan: It is ad-free.

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:54.692
We're not for-profit,

00:01:54.692 --> 00:01:58.617
and so we get the Gates
Foundation, Google have funded us,

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:00.922
and so yeah, kids can
learn algebra without ads.

00:02:00.922 --> 00:02:03.056
Male: And the economics
of a cupcake factory.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.880
Sal: And the economics of a cupcake ... 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.382
Sal: Yes.

00:02:05.382 --> 00:02:08.063
Male: But how do you get the ideas then?

00:02:08.063 --> 00:02:08.739
if somebody comes and say,

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.265
"I want to open a cup cake factory,

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:12.996
"but i have no idea what the
economics of said factory would be,"

00:02:12.996 --> 00:02:14.476
and therefore, you make a video?

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:16.107
Female: What's the [unintelligible]

00:02:16.107 --> 00:02:18.322
Sal: Some of those things,
like the cupcake factory,

00:02:18.322 --> 00:02:21.230
my old job as an analyst at a hedge fund,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.118
I had another company in mind,
but I just changed their industry

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:26.388
when I talked about
predatory prices and cupcakes

00:02:26.388 --> 00:02:28.801
because it seemed much
more benign (laughs)

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:30.180
Male: It's very mysterious.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.636
Male: Very mysterious.

00:02:30.636 --> 00:02:31.544
Sal: Very mysterious.

00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:33.027
Female: Well, thank
you for coming on, Sal.

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:33.478
Sal: Yeah.

00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:34.082
Thanks for having me.

00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:36.711
Male: khanacademy.org, you have
some crazy classes on here.

00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:37.953
Sal: Indeed, yes.

00:02:37.953 --> 00:02:39.346
Female: What's the craziest?

00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:40.130
Male: Yeah, very cool stuff.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.243
Sal: Photosynthesis, in
case you're interested. 

00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:44.457
(laughter)

00:02:44.457 --> 00:02:46.129
Male: We wouldn't know about that
because we don't have any sunlight.

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.807
Sal: No, no.

00:02:46.807 --> 00:02:47.713
(laughter)

00:02:47.713 --> 00:02:48.413
Male: No skylight here.

00:02:48.413 --> 00:02:50.897
Female: I'll get my plants
to watch it (laughs).

00:02:50.897 --> 00:02:51.743
Male: Sal, thank you very much.

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:52.822
Sal: Yeah, yeah, thank you.

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:53.990
All right, learning a lot.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.003
Sue: Rockefeller Plaza has been
transformed for the summit,

00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:58.983
and that's where we find
Michelle Caruso-Cabrera

00:02:58.983 --> 00:03:00.670
along with two leading innovators
(music)

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.710
in their respective fields.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.318
Take it away, Michelle.

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:02.851
(music)

00:03:02.851 --> 00:03:03.761
Michelle: Here are some of the coolest

00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:06.340
and most interesting people
I've met in a really long time

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.734
joining me here at Education
Nation down here at 30 Rock.

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:13.433
Nt Etuk is the founder of DimensionU.

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:17.107
This is an educational video
game company that he started.

00:03:17.107 --> 00:03:18.633
He used to be at Citigroup,

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:20.616
and he is rolling out a
lot of exciting things.

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:22.392
And Sal Khan joins us as well.

00:03:22.392 --> 00:03:23.983
He is the founder of the Khan Academy.

00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:26.906
This is an educational video and ...

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.584
so not video games but
videos and software company.

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:29.918
Sal: Yes, yes, yeah.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.683
Michelle: You both have the same idea,

00:03:31.683 --> 00:03:33.786
which is that you want to
go directly to the customer,

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:35.603
so you're not selling to schools.

00:03:35.603 --> 00:03:37.928
You're not selling to
parents necessarily, right?

00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:41.339
Nt: Well, actually, we do have a
component that we sell to schools,

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:42.645
and it's been proven ...

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:44.607
well, first of all, we do
multiplayer educational video games,

00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:46.577
so imagine Halo minus the violence

00:03:46.577 --> 00:03:49.323
but allowing a kid in Seoul, Korea to
play against a kid in New York City

00:03:49.323 --> 00:03:51.723
while they're learning math,
literacy, science, history.

00:03:51.723 --> 00:03:53.641
And so we started out selling to schools.

00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:56.400
We have large portions of New York
City Public Schools, et cetera.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.662
And now, we're going to the consumer side.

00:03:58.662 --> 00:04:00.317
Michelle: I guess my
thought was, what I mean,

00:04:00.317 --> 00:04:01.944
Nt: Yes.

00:04:01.944 --> 00:04:04.615
Michelle: Because historically,
educational video games have been ...  

00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:06.458
Michelle: ... boring, right? 

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:08.031
And textbooks and so are workbooks.

00:04:08.031 --> 00:04:10.151
So if you can do video games,
then they're, like, "Hey!"

00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:11.110
Michelle: That they really want to play.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.930
Nt: That they want to play.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.677
You can incentivize them to
learn, and it's fantastic.

00:04:13.677 --> 00:04:14.159
Michelle: Wow.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.238
Sal: Yeah, it's the same idea.

00:04:16.238 --> 00:04:17.229
One thing, we're not selling.

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.649
We're not for profit, so that's why
we're a little bit small (laughs).

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:20.956
Michelle: OK.

00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:24.937
Sal: But our target is the
students and at any age.

00:04:24.937 --> 00:04:25.960
We have six-year-olds.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.924
We have homeschoolers.

00:04:26.924 --> 00:04:28.030
We have people using supplement tools ...

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.384
Michelle: And they're
getting them where, YouTube?

00:04:29.384 --> 00:04:30.530
Or how are they getting the product?

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.617
Sal: It's off of YouTube, khanacademy.org.

00:04:32.617 --> 00:04:33.933
YouTube, it's just the videos.

00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:36.551
Most of our resources are on
making a software platform.

00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:38.078
It has a little bit of games in there,

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:40.747
but so students can practice everything
that they might learn in the videos too,

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:42.012
and it goes all the way to calculus.

00:04:42.012 --> 00:04:42.723
Nt: Yeah.

00:04:42.723 --> 00:04:44.741
Michelle: Does it matter if
it's profit, not for profit?

00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:45.958
Does it?

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.315
Nt: From my perspective, for profit
is how you keep sustainability going.

00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:51.327
I think that there is a
great way to actually make

00:04:51.327 --> 00:04:53.426
a tremendous amount of money
while doing good at the same time,

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:55.394
and so that's what we do.

00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:57.648
Michelle: How is rollout going?

00:04:57.648 --> 00:04:59.109
You are now selling to schools.

00:04:59.109 --> 00:05:00.369
Are you getting schools involved?

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:03.611
And is it easier to sell to charter
schools and things like that?

00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.830
Are they more adaptable as
opposed to public schools

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.339
that have a longer purchase cycle?

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:11.510
Sal: Most of our users, we have
2.5 million students a month,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.387
those are mostly just
independently using it,

00:05:13.387 --> 00:05:14.680
but we have started pilots.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.969
The Los Altos School District in Silicon
Valley, they're district-wide with it.

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:19.792
They're public school.

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:21.514
They're not a charter school
or anything like that.

00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:24.384
We are piloting with some charter
schools, some private schools, public,

00:05:24.384 --> 00:05:25.872
and we're just trying to see
how we can use this thing

00:05:25.872 --> 00:05:27.364
that's fundamentally
for independent learners

00:05:27.364 --> 00:05:28.845
but how we can use it
in the classrooms too.

00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:31.200
Michelle: Are either one of you
providing backbone analytics ...

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.585
Nt: Yes.

00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:33.031
Michelle: ... to the schools so
that you know that it works? 

00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:33.830
Very, very important.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.261
So how long are the students playing?

00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:37.379
What are they getting right and wrong?

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:38.675
But we actually can go even deeper.

00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:41.726
We can understand if a student
plays primarily by themselves

00:05:41.726 --> 00:05:42.685
or whether they play with others,

00:05:42.685 --> 00:05:45.619
so are they a social learner or
are they an individual learner?

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:47.995
And then you know how you can
help by tutoring or whatever else,

00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:50.335
so a whole bunch of
analyticals that gets it right.

00:05:50.335 --> 00:05:51.182
Michelle: Sal, is there ...?

00:05:51.182 --> 00:05:51.856
Sal: Yeah, I know.

00:05:51.856 --> 00:05:53.331
The model that we're
trying in the classrooms,

00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:55.859
the teachers aren't
giving lectures anymore.

00:05:55.859 --> 00:05:56.997
They're not grading homework.

00:05:56.997 --> 00:05:58.369
The students are all
working at their own pace,

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:01.347
and the teacher gets a dashboard and
highlights the students that are stuck.

00:06:01.347 --> 00:06:03.402
So the teachers not able to do
these one-on-one interventions,

00:06:03.402 --> 00:06:04.754
we get the peers to teach each other.

00:06:04.754 --> 00:06:06.014
Nt: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:06.014 --> 00:06:06.705
Sal: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:06.705 --> 00:06:09.574
Michelle: But what about schools
that don't have resources?

00:06:09.574 --> 00:06:12.205
Are they less likely to get this stuff?

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:12.848
Nt: From our perspective,

00:06:12.848 --> 00:06:14.796
that's one of the reasons why
we went to the consumer side,

00:06:14.796 --> 00:06:17.386
much like we're doing a free model ...

00:06:17.386 --> 00:06:17.890
Michelle: For the consumer.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.208
Nt: For the consumer side.

00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:21.823
Nt: But the kids at home
can get it for free.

00:06:21.823 --> 00:06:24.030
Then we actually make money
through micro-transactions,

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.749
somewhat like Zynga, et cetera,

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:27.924
so that sort of thing as we roll that out.

00:06:27.924 --> 00:06:29.551
It's been very interesting.

00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:30.537
Michelle: How about you, Sal?

00:06:30.537 --> 00:06:32.384
Sal: Yeah, it's a ...

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:34.481
It's, it's ....

00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:35.234
Yeah, we do ...

00:06:35.234 --> 00:06:35.772
We ...

00:06:35.772 --> 00:06:36.504
I'm sorry if I ...

00:06:36.504 --> 00:06:38.339
Michelle: Don't worry about it (laughs).

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:39.675
Don't worry about it.

00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:41.365
Should people be hopeful about education?

00:06:41.365 --> 00:06:42.009
Is there ...?

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:42.457
Sal: Yes.

00:06:42.457 --> 00:06:46.208
Michelle: We've talked so long
about how we've been failing
for years in this country. 

00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:47.154
Michelle: You're optimistic?

00:06:47.154 --> 00:06:47.685
Nt: Very.

00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:48.139
Here's the problem.

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.304
The problem right now with the innovation
conversation education is it's tiring.

00:06:51.304 --> 00:06:53.268
We could have had this
conversation 300 years ago.

00:06:53.268 --> 00:06:54.107
Michelle: Yeah.

00:06:54.876 --> 00:06:57.386
Nt: What we have is
Google, iPod, iPod, iPad,

00:06:57.386 --> 00:06:59.327
all of these sorts of
technology to come in,

00:06:59.327 --> 00:07:02.817
and we can get rid of the
traditional distribution structures,

00:07:02.817 --> 00:07:05.472
go directly to the kids or
go directly to the teachers

00:07:05.472 --> 00:07:07.608
Michelle: A real product
that they want to use.

00:07:07.608 --> 00:07:08.679
Male: Yeah. 

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:09.385
Sal: Yeah, same thing,

00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:11.025
and I just remembered your
question was about technology,

00:07:11.025 --> 00:07:11.645
(laughter)

00:07:11.645 --> 00:07:13.386
And I think right now, there
is a healthy skepticism

00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:15.462
of why do you use
technology in the classroom?

00:07:15.462 --> 00:07:17.975
And I think what we're talking about
is now you have a reason to use it.

00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:19.021
And once you have a good reason,

00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:20.645
it's actually not that expensive anymore.

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:21.867
You have a $300 laptop.

00:07:21.867 --> 00:07:23.903
You could use it for
five years at $60 a year.

00:07:23.903 --> 00:07:25.423
Michelle: As opposed to ...

00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:26.162
And 10 kids could use it.

00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:27.345
Michelle: As opposed to

00:07:27.345 --> 00:07:28.700
textbooks, which could
be far more expensive.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.790
Sal: Far more, far more expensive.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:30.701
Michelle: Guys, thank you so much ...

00:07:30.701 --> 00:07:31.053
Nt: Thank you.

00:07:31.053 --> 00:07:32.311
Michelle: ... for this wonderful
conversation I had with you.

00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:32.955
Sal: All right, great.

00:07:32.955 --> 23:59:59.999
Tyler, back to you.
