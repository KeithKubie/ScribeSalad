Announcer: It's time
for Would You Rather? Live,

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.171
with your host, Daniel Tosh,

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:07.741
or would you rather
Dave Chappelle?

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.776
Audience: Dave Chappelle!

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.411
It's not gonna happen!

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.981
One of my favorite games to play
in the workplace

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.148
is "Would You Rather."

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.651
But after 10 seasons,
everyone on my staff

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:20.053
has agreed
to [bleep] their mom by now.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:23.757
So that's why I'm gonna play it
with my studio audience live!

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.626
Reboot!

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:27.861
Feel free to play along at home,
too.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.529
First audience member,
where are you from?

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.531
-Alabama. [ Laughs ]
-Alabama, nice.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.966
Did you go
to the University of Alabama?

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:33.967
Oh, of course.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.502
-Oh, Roll Tide, huh?
-Roll Tide.

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.371
Sorry, UCF.
-Don't apologize to UCF.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.972
Uh, we were undefeated,
we beat Auburn.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:39.940
Who did you guys lose to?

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.109
[ Audience groans ]

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.177
All right, would you rather

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:45.946
never have any dessert

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.781
or never have any bread?

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.583
Oh.
[ Inhales sharply ]
[ Audience murmuring ]

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:50.584
Thank you.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:51.618
[ Laughter ]

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:53.186
That's the way
I react to that one.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.922
Um, I guess dessert.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.957
Do you consider candy
a dessert?

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:58.358
-No. No.
-I don't either.

00:00:58.358 --> 00:00:59.793
So you can still have candy,

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:00.961
'cause I've never been
to a restaurant

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.597
and under dessert,
it says, like, "candy."

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:06.767
Would you rather take
17 years off your life

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:09.369
or be 9 inches shorter?

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.605
[ Laughter ]

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:13.006
17 years off my life.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.841
I mean,
I'm not gonna argue with you.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.145
Would you rather wrestle
an alligator

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:21.048
or wrestle your dad naked?

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:22.849
[ Audience groans ]
Oh.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.217
Aw, damn.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.786
Wrestle my dad naked.

Don't judge Angela!

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:32.225
Would you rather eat
every meal from 7-Eleven...

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.760
[ Laughter ]

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.196
...or only speak

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:39.599
using an offensive,
stereotypical Indian accent?

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.002
[ Laughs ]

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:43.337
I'm gonna go
with the accent.

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:45.372
[ Laughter ]

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:50.243
Would you rather get a nosebleed
during every lovemaking session,

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:53.480
or, every Christmas,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.184
an extended family member
gets murdered?

Which would you rather?

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.358
Uh, I would go
with the nosebleed.

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:05.659
How much --
How much sex do you have?

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.294
No.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.563
Yeah, sure, one of you guys.
You guys know each other?

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:12.532
-Yeah. [ Speaks indistinctly ]
-You're roommates next year?

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.434

to celebrate that?

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.802
[ Laughter ]

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.472
Hey. No, we're --
we're in college.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.140
You know what?
Give that -- Give that mic --

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.575
I would rather your friend.

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:23.844
Ouch.

-Would you rather...
-Okay.

...go deaf for three years

or share floss one time

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:34.554

who probably has AIDS?

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:35.989
[ Audience groans ]

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.024
I'd go with his floss,
I mean --

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:38.959
I agree with you,
because I said,

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.227
"probably has AIDS,"

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:41.561
so that's not definitively.
-Yeah, there we go.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.363
And I wouldn't floss, like,
aggressive.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.098
I would be ramming it up there
like --

a throbbing erection
