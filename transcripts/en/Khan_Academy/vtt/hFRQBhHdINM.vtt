00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.150
- [Instructor] Two cars are driving

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.290
towards an intersection from
perpendicular directions.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.370
The first car's velocity is 50 km/h

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.100
and the second car's velocity is 90 km/h.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.330
At a certain instant, T sub zero,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.080
the first car is a
distance, X sub T sub zero

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.490
or X of T sub zero, of half a kilometer

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.220
from the intersection and the second car

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.080
is a distance, Y of T sub zero,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.970
of 1.2 kilometers from the intersection.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.330
What is the rate of
change of the distance,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.220
D of T, between the cars at that instant?

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.930
So, T sub zero.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.940
Which equation should be
used to solve the problem?

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.150
And they give us a
choice of four equations,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.530
right over here, so you
could pause the video

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.100
and try to work through it on your own

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.790
but I'm about to do it, as well.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.440
So, let's just draw what's going on.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.100
That's always a healthy thing to do.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.040
So, two cars are driving towards

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.710
an intersection from
perpendicular directions.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.280
So, let's say that this
is one car right over here

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.100
and it is moving in the X direction

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.760
towards that intersection,
which is right over there.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.130
And then you have another car

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.150
that is moving in the Y direction.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.470
So, let's say it's moving like this.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.150
So, this is the other car.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300
I should have maybe done a top view.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.580
Well, here we go.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.250
This square represents the car

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.020
and it is moving in that direction.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.220
Now, they say at a certain instance.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.430
T sub zero, so let's draw that instant.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.750
So, the first car is a distance,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.960
X of T sub zero, of 0.5 kilometers.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.690
So, this distance, right over here,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.360
let's just call this X of T and let's call

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.830
this distance, right over here, Y of T.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.160
Now, how does the distance between the

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.840
cars relate to X of T and Y of T?

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.830
Well, we could just use
the distance formula,

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.240
which is essentially just
the Pythagorean theorem,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.110
to say, well, the
distance between the cars

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.180
would be the hypotenuse
of this right triangle.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.040
Remember, they're traveling
from perpendicular directions.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.760
So, that's a right triangle, there.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.760
So, this distance, right over
here, would be X of T squared

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.300
plus Y of T squared, and
the square root of that,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.070
and that's just the Pythagorean
theorem, right over here.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.170
This would be D of T, or we could say

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.240
that D of T squared is equal to

00:02:29.273 --> 00:02:34.273
X of T squared plus Y,
too many parentheses.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.300
Plus Y of T squared.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.610
So, that's the relationship between

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.870
D of T, X of T, and Y
of T, and it's useful

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.740
for solving this problem because, now,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.680
we can take the derivative of both sides

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.510
of this equation with respect to T.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.000
We'd be using various derivative rules,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.400
including the chain
rule, in order to do it,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.610
and then that would give us a relationship

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.620
between the rate of change of D of T,

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.370
which would be D prime of T,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.480
and the rate of change of X of T, Y of T,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.450
and X of T and Y of T, themselves.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.423
And so, if we look at these
choices, right over here,

00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:14.830
we indeed see that D sets up that exact

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.940
same relationship that
we just did, ourselves.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.230
That it shows that the distance

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.430
squared between the cars is equal to

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.370
that X distance from the
intersection squared,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.880
plus the Y distance from
the intersection squared,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.440
and then we can take the
derivative of both sides

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.383
to actually figure out this
related, rates question.
