00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.400
We're on problem 226.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.450
In the figure above-- let me
draw the figure above.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.200
So I have a line there, then I
have another line that's like

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.030
that, and then this is a
triangle like that, and then

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.470
they draw another line that goes
straight down like that.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.500
And they call this right here z
degrees, this is y degrees,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.440
this is x degrees.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.350
They tell us that these
are right angles.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.370
Fair enough.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.260
In the figure above, if z is
equal to 50, so that is equal

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.570
to 50 degreeS, then x plus
y is equal to what?

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.430
Well if z is 50-- well, first
of all, we know since these

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.380
are both right angles, both of
these lines are going to be

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.140
parallel, right?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.710
Both of those lines
are parallel.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.300
And so you can view this
green line as a

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.140
transversal of the parallel.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.330
And so, z and y are
corresponding angles, so y is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.260
also going to be 50.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.250
That should make a little
intuitive sense, but you could

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.510
watch the Khan Academy geometry
videos if that

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.150
doesn't make sense.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.230
But just eyeballing it looks
right, too, but that's a

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.170
property of transversals
and parallel lines.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.560
And if that's true, then what
is this angle right here?

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.150
Well, 50 plus 90 plus this angle
is equal to 180, right?

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.740
So we could say 50 plus 90 plus
theta is equal to 180.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.040
So you get 140 plus theta
is equal to 180.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.460
Subtract 140 from both
sides, so theta

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.430
is equal to 40 degrees.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.960
So this angle right here
is 40 degrees.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.300
What's x?

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.300
Well, they're supplementary.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.820
They have to add up.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.610
They have to add up
to be 180, right?

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.260
This whole angle's 180.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.040
So that whole angle is 180, this
is 40, then x has to be

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.580
140 degrees.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.180
So they wanted to know
what x plus y is?

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.750
Well x is 140, y is 50, so 140
plus 50 is 190 degrees.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.330
And that is not one
of the choices.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.080
So I must have -- oh,
I see my mistake.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.020
This angle right here,
actually, we're still

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.780
completely fine.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.870
This angle right here isn't y.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.730
This angle right here is y.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.780
But everything we did
so far still holds.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.950
If this angle is 50, this angle
is still 50 since it's a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.750
corresponding angle, right?

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.590
And if that's 50, this is 90,
then this is 40, x is 140.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.840
Now we just have to figure
out what y is.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.820
Well, y is supplementary with
this angle right here, right?

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.650
So y plus this angle that I used
to think was y until I

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.350
looked closely at the drawing,
y plus 50 has to be equal to

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.970
180 degrees, right?

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.240
Because it's complementary with
this 50 degree angle.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.330
So y is equal to 130.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.880
So x plus y is equal to 140 plus
130, which is equal to

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.670
270 degrees, and that's
choice D.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.968
Problem 227.

00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:14.840
Looks like they've drawn
another coordinate

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.790
axis, which I'll draw.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.620
Nope, that's not what
I want to draw with.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.790
I'll draw with that.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.160
OK, and then they have a
line that comes down

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.380
something like that.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.160
And they mark it off.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.140
They say that this is-- let me
see how they mark it off.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.220
They say that this is the point
1, this is the point 2.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.560
They don't write the 2 there.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.720
They call this line l.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.350
This is the origin.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.720
This is the x-axis and
that is the y-axis.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.250
And they say in the coordinate
system above, which of the

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.100
following is the equation
of line l?

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.810
Well, if we just eyeball it--
I mean, they don't say it

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.450
explicitly, but it looks like
this is intersecting at y is

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.890
equal to 2, and this
is intersecting at

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.800
y is equal to 3.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.740
I guess that's a safe
assumption.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.330
So how do we set up
this equation?

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.920
Well, you just have to figure
out the slope of the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.209
y-intercept.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.220
We already know the y-intercept,
right?

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.330
It intersects-- when
x is 0-- so y of 0.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.470
When x is 0, y is equal to 2, so
that's the y-intercept, and

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.930
now we just have to figure
out the slope.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.370
Well, let's think
about the slope.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.940
If we take this point--
well, I'll do it

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.850
the formal way, right?

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.570
The slope is equal to change
in y over change in x.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.830
So let's take this
as the end point.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.310
This is 3 comma 0,
[PHONE RINGS]

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.660
and let's see who's
on the phone.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.310
If it's someone-- oh,
I'll take that call.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.750
I'll continue this in
the next video.
