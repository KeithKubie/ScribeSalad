00:00:00.246 --> 00:00:02.117
Voiceover:We have this
girl right over here

00:00:02.117 --> 00:00:04.448
and she is 1.7 meters tall

00:00:04.448 --> 00:00:06.114
and she's standing in the sun.

00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:13.058
The sun's at an angle with
respect to the ground.

00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:15.345
Given where the sun is right now,

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:18.900
her shadow is 3.1 meters long.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.743
What I want you to do is pause this video

00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:25.124
and try to figure that angle of the sun

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.529
relative to the ground

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.955
or another way, let me be
a little bit more specific.

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:31.753
Pause the video and try to
figure out what this angle is

00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:34.956
and figure it out in terms of radiance.

00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:38.429
As you might imagine this,

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:39.797
we have an angle

00:00:39.797 --> 00:00:41.796
and then we have the length of two sides

00:00:41.796 --> 00:00:44.261
and we could figure out the
ratios of the lengths of sides.

00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:48.458
This might be involving a
little bit of trigonometry.

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.107
Which of our trig functions

00:00:50.107 --> 00:00:52.000
if we're talking about
this angle right over here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.437
Which of our trig functions
deal with the opposite

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:56.471
and the adjacent?

00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:58.667
Or we could remind of ourselves

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.089
with a little bit of sohcahtoa.

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.429
Sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.145
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:01:05.145 --> 00:01:09.763
Tangent is opposite over adjacent.

00:01:09.763 --> 00:01:12.064
Tangent is what we would use,

00:01:12.064 --> 00:01:14.285
it's dealing with opposite and adjacent.

00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:19.414
We could say that the tangent of theta

00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:29.418
is equal to 1.7 meters over 3.1 meters.

00:01:29.418 --> 00:01:33.012
We have to figure out some
angle theta in radiance

00:01:33.012 --> 00:01:34.408
where if I take the tangent of it,

00:01:34.408 --> 00:01:36.923
I'm going to get 1.7 over 3.1.

00:01:36.923 --> 00:01:38.515
Or another way we could think about it,

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:41.774
we could take the inverse tan
function, or tangent function

00:01:41.774 --> 00:01:46.723
of both sides of this sometimes
called the arctangent.

00:01:46.723 --> 00:01:49.934
If we take the inverse
tangent of both sides of this

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:52.527
we are going to be left with theta

00:01:52.527 --> 00:02:03.797
is equal to the inverse
tangent of 1.7 over 3.1.

00:02:03.797 --> 00:02:05.319
This isn't something that's very easy

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.857
to kind of look at the unit circle

00:02:06.857 --> 00:02:09.450
and try to figure out
what this is going to be.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.374
Let's just use our
calculator for this one.

00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:17.745
Let's see we want to
take the inverse tangent.

00:02:18.914 --> 00:02:22.330
Give me the angle whose tangent
is the number that I'm ...

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.597
The argument that I'm going to give

00:02:23.597 --> 00:02:25.038
to this inverse tangent function.

00:02:25.038 --> 00:02:30.906
The inverse tangent of 1.7 over 3.1

00:02:30.906 --> 00:02:33.948
and before I even press enter here.

00:02:33.948 --> 00:02:35.636
Let me make sure I'm in the right mode.

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:38.203
No, I'm not in the right mode.

00:02:38.203 --> 00:02:39.292
I was in degree mode,

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.253
let me go into radian mode.

00:02:41.253 --> 00:02:43.934
We said that we wanted
the answer in radiance

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:46.428
so let's exit from this.

00:02:46.428 --> 00:02:51.125
Now we are going to get
our answer in radiance.

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:54.039
If we would round to the nearest hundreds

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:58.296
this would give us about
pretty close to 0.50.

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:04.703
This is approximately equal to 0.50

00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:07.076
if we round to the nearest hundreds.

00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:09.770
That's the measure of
this angle in radiance.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.206
I could write 0.50 radiance.
