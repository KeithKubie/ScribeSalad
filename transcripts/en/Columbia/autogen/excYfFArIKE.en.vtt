to do world history is that you're not

starting at a with a single point and

the world so I think they took their
 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.960

more about about other animals

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:13.169
more about about other animals
 

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:17.330

people wanted to make images of animals

are looked at anthropologists and

animals there's very little evidence of

this case so to say images of an animal

carved into pieces those are extremely
 

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.920
carved into pieces those are extremely
rare images whereas you may have many

rare images whereas you may have many
 

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.710

many many more images that show the

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720
many many more images that show the
 

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.220
many many more images that show the
animal in motion and usually in a very

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:58.230
animal in motion and usually in a very
 

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.370
animal in motion and usually in a very
majestic fashion so we don't know

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:02.380
majestic fashion so we don't know
 

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.230

whether these were food images but by

whether these were food images but by

it's fairly clear that there is an

it's fairly clear that there is an
 

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.240
it's fairly clear that there is an

identification of some animals with
 

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:25.769
identification of some animals with
supernatural beings so if you say at the

supernatural beings so if you say at the

that are domestic animals so there's a

once you have domestic cats then they

once you have cats then you spread the
cats why because they eat the mice and

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:53.730
cats why because they eat the mice and
 

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.750
cats why because they eat the mice and
the rats so when you look at say the

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760
the rats so when you look at say the
 

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.070

would appear to indicate that cats
 

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.590
would appear to indicate that cats
appeared in East Asia because they were

of course we don't know we we can say

of course we don't know we we can say
that the humans hunted but we don't

indication is in Australia where you had

indication is in Australia where you had
 

00:31:35.309 --> 00:31:38.369
indication is in Australia where you had
Aboriginal peoples who arrived in

Aboriginal peoples who arrived in
 

00:31:38.379 --> 00:31:42.600

Australia 40,000 years ago dogs arrived
 

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.869
Australia 40,000 years ago dogs arrived
somewhere around 12,000 years ago we

00:31:45.869 --> 00:31:45.879
somewhere around 12,000 years ago we
 

00:31:45.879 --> 00:31:49.169
somewhere around 12,000 years ago we
don't know how and so you had dogs in

00:31:49.169 --> 00:31:49.179
don't know how and so you had dogs in
 

00:31:49.179 --> 00:31:51.450
don't know how and so you had dogs in
Australia that were the only species

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:51.460
Australia that were the only species
 

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.950

that of mammals because the others were
were marsupials all the native fauna so

00:31:59.249 --> 00:31:59.259
were marsupials all the native fauna so
 

00:31:59.259 --> 00:32:02.759
were marsupials all the native fauna so
here you have one full mammalian species

00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:02.769
here you have one full mammalian species
 

00:32:02.769 --> 00:32:08.940
here you have one full mammalian species
and in the Australian language this

and in the Australian language this
 

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:14.519
and in the Australian language this
becomes the dingo which is a dog that

00:32:14.519 --> 00:32:14.529
becomes the dingo which is a dog that
 

00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:19.799
becomes the dingo which is a dog that
lives with humans but also is feral and

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:19.809
lives with humans but also is feral and
 

00:32:19.809 --> 00:32:25.580
lives with humans but also is feral and
to say it it runs wild in many occasions

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:25.590
to say it it runs wild in many occasions
 

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:29.249

Aborigines who were there before without
 

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.720
Aborigines who were there before without

dogs did the Aborigines draw the dogs
 

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:55.350
dogs did the Aborigines draw the dogs
into their hunting environment and the

into their hunting environment and the
 

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.220
into their hunting environment and the
answer appears to be no that the dogs

00:32:59.220 --> 00:32:59.230
answer appears to be no that the dogs
 

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.630
answer appears to be no that the dogs
would go with the

would go with the
 

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.420
would go with the
original hunters so that if something

original hunters so that if something
 

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.920
original hunters so that if something
was killed the dogs would have something

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:04.930
was killed the dogs would have something
 

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.050
was killed the dogs would have something
to eat but they weren't used for

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:07.060
to eat but they weren't used for
 

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.240

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:28.130
one specific that was rather surprising

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140
one specific that was rather surprising
 

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:32.490
one specific that was rather surprising
was that you have aboriginal groups that

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:32.500
was that you have aboriginal groups that
 

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.550
was that you have aboriginal groups that
will break the legs of young dogs so

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:35.560
will break the legs of young dogs so
 

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.800
will break the legs of young dogs so
that they will be lame and unable to run

have chased an antelope down and you've
 

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.609
have chased an antelope down and you've
killed it then you can't sacrifice it

00:40:42.609 --> 00:40:42.619
killed it then you can't sacrifice it
 

00:40:42.619 --> 00:40:45.760
killed it then you can't sacrifice it
because you've already killed it the

because you've already killed it the
 

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.319
because you've already killed it the
alternative is to chase down the end of

alternative is to chase down the end of
 

00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:52.059
alternative is to chase down the end of
the antelope kidnap it drag it home and

the antelope kidnap it drag it home and
then sacrifice it when you get home

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:54.230
then sacrifice it when you get home
 

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:55.690
then sacrifice it when you get home
well the antelope may really disagree
