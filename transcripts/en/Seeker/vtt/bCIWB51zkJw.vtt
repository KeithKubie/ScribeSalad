00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.630
Good friends are basically family, right?

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.110
Um YES.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.529
Because science.

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.230
Hello folks, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.230
Friends are great.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.730
You share so much with them: interests, crushes,
perhaps even your latest bowel movement!

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.849
But now scientists are finding that besties
even share GENES!

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.359
Scientists at Yale and UC San Diego have found
that we share a huge amount of genetic material

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.759
with our friends - that huge amount being
1%.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.410
OK, sounds kinda small, but to geneticists,
it’s off the charts!

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.660
For some perspective, you also share 1% of
your genetic code with your fourth cousins,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.230
which is when you share a great-great-great-grandparent.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.840
It’s kind of crazy, it’s like we seek
out close friends who resemble our family.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.140
Just don’t make out with friends, cuz that’s
basically incest now.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.810
To figure this crazy factoid out, scientists
examined around 2000 people in a racially

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.960
and ethnically homogenous area - which is
usually not good for scientific studies, but

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.000
in this case IS good because this rules out
a tendency to befriend people who share our

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
race.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.759
Then they looked at around 1300 pairs of friends
and examined 1.5 million markers of gene variation.

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.630
The highest genetic correlate we share with
our friends is a thing pertaining to your

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.530
sense of smell (which explains why my friends
love my impeccable taste in fragrances).

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.850
The lead researchers say that it could be
the sense of smell that brings people together

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.060
into the same environment.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.659
On the opposite end of things, friends are
more dissimilar than strangers on genetic

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.420
protection from diseases.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.740
Which is amazing because it’s a sort of
person-to-person protection against the spread

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.740
of disease.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.280
What the researchers find the MOST interesting
though, is the fact that those genes you share

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.360
with your friends are evolving more quickly
than other genes.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.990
Could our social environment speed up evolution?

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.670
I dunnoooo….that’s kind of what it looks
like.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.810
We’ll need more studies to test that theory,
though it could be one possible explanation

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.240
for WHY and HOW we manage to share more genes
with our friends.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.259
Right now the scientists say they’re not
quite sure why this happens.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.939
BUT, say we have a shared skill in our genes
-- that brings us together, in which case

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.500
it could be evolutionarily advantageous to
have each other to develop that skill, thus

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.320
the faster evolution of the genes.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.909
I guess we’ll just have to wait and see
what else they find - and we’ll keep you

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:05.969
updated here on DNews.

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.259
Thanks for joining me, what do you have MOST
in common with your friends?

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.590
Tell me bout it down below and we’ll catcha
next time!
