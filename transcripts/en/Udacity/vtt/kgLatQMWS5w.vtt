00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.260
Once you finish running that, you will see another table.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.350
This table shows the actual data that has been loaded to memory.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:17.380
The top row gives you the names of various columns in the pandas data frame.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.164
Each column consists of an npi array.

00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:25.696
If you're not familiar with pandas data frames,

00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:29.985
we have linked to a lesson in the intro to data science where it

00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:35.136
will teach you the high level concepts and about pandas and data frames.

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:40.609
If you scroll further down, you will see it shows five rows and

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.722
twenty eight columns.

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:49.190
The 28 columns indicate there are 28 vectors in the Pandas Data Frame.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.943
Use the box below to write a python code that uses the file for

00:00:53.943 --> 00:00:58.930
California included in your instructor's notes.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.569
Load it to memory as a Pandas Data Frame and print a summary of the data.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.180
Once you have finished writing your code in this box provided here,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.400
