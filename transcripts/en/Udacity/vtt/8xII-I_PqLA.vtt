00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What we're going to discuss today is how errors propagate in a program,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that is, from one variable to another,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because these very dependencies then help us in reasoning backwards.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And this is our second topic:

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
how we can trace back these dependencies from an observable failure

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to an earlier infection

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then to a defect in the code.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And for this we're going to use the Sherlock Holmes method

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which, of course, is: "Elementary, my dear Watson."

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But first, a quiz. Do you like Sherlock Holmes?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Here are your options.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Is it more like: "I'm his greatest fan!"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Or: "Isn't he, like, outdated?"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Or: "Actually, I find him annoying."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Or: "Sherlock who?"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Hint: The answer to this quiz will neither determine your grading

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
nor will it determine the next step. Enjoy.
