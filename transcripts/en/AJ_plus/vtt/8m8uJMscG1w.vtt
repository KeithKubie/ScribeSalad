00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
The one thing my son can do on his own,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.560
without any help from his parents,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.460
is breathe.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.600
To have medical professionals make the judgment

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.560
that Matthew does not need any medical services,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.840
it was outrageous.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.560
It’s just unthinkable.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.380
Who should take care of our nation's sick?

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.060
And what happens when an entire public health program gets handed over to private companies?

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.520
The privatization of Medicaid has really hurt people who most rely on that program.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.660
And it's very heart wrenching for me.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.860
They're focused on money,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880
and we're focused on the health of our son.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.980
Welcome to Iowa,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.440
a state that recently privatized Medicaid,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.620
handing control of the entire public health program to for-profit companies.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.020
Iowa's Medicaid system is beginning to collapse.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.060
It's collapsing under the weight of greed.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.440
It raises serious questions about our own humanity.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.800
Hey guys, I’m Kate, and this Sunday we’re in Iowa

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.020
to put a face to the people who rely on Medicaid,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.760
and find out what happens when a state puts a crucial social safety net

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.820
in the hands of for-profit companies.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.200
Before we get into it, remember, Medicaid’s that federal program established back in 1965

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.240
that gives health insurance to our country’s poor, elderly and disabled population.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.940
It’s objectively been a saving grace for millions of Americans.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.720
In Iowa, about 600,000 people are on it,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.160
or about one out of every five people in the state.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.080
One of those people receiving Medicaid is Matthew Hudson,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.680
who had tragic brain bleed which left him completely paralyzed when he was 16.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.180
He’s now profoundly disabled and his parents take care of him.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.660
We have to feed him all his meals, we bathe him,

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.400
we have to clothe him. We do all his toileting.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.320
Since the injury 14 years ago, Dave Hudson and his wife have used the Medicaid money

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.040
to treat Matthew at their home.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.620
This way, he doesn’t have to go to an institution, which Dave thinks would be more expensive and impersonal.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:14.520
DAVE: I think I made the decision that Matthew deserved to live the best life possible.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.400
I'm OK with putting my life aside

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.700
so that he can have the best possible life.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.660
And that’s how it was for the Hudsons for more than a decade.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.360
But then in 2016, the governor of Iowa at the time,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.240
without any legislative input,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.180
transferred every Iowa Medicaid patient onto plans run by managed care organizations,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.860
or what you’ll hear referred to as MCOs.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.820
The governor said having these for-profit companies handle the state’s $5 billion Medicaid program

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.540
would save taxpayers money and ultimately would lead to better care.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.120
But a few months later, the Hudsons got a letter from their new MCO

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.760
announcing they were cutting all of Matthew’s care.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.200
Right here: “The reason for the decision is that the information reviewed

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.980
fails to establish medical necessity for the requested service.”

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.420
When I read that, I couldn't believe it.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.100
You can't be a medical professional and tell me my son does not need any medical services.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.420
What message are these companies sending?

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.620
I think the message primarily is,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.860
“We don't care enough about Matt

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.160
to pay for the services he needs.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.080
If we're gonna make any money in Iowa, then people like your son

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.260
who are expensive and chronically ill,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.760
he's going to be a drain on our profits for as long as he's alive.”

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.000
Dave eventually fought the cuts and won. But his struggle isn’t unique.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.620
After the state handed Medicaid over to the health companies,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.840
there have been hundreds of stories of Iowans suddenly being denied crucial coverage,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.340
and then getting stuck in an endless cycle of appeals to get it back.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.660
Every single week,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.400
I get calls from people saying I was denied service of this or that nature.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.400
It's overwhelming, as a reporter.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.560
That’s Jason Clayworth.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.800
He’s an investigative reporter at the Des Moines Register

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.540
and has written dozens of stories about the fallout of Medicaid privatization.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.420
One woman even claims that the privatization led to her husband’s death.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.820
JASON: His wife is convinced that had he been receiving the same care that he had received for decades,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.560
that her husband would still be alive.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.400
JASON: These are people that, many times, they can't literally speak for themselves.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.120
Many of these folks are children. They don't understand their rights.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.900
For many of these people, it is a matter of life and death.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.880
These are serious, serious issues.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.540
But here’s the thing: Iowa’s not the only place where this is happening.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.960
In fact, you probably live in a state that’s privatized Medicaid too.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.920
Since the 1980s, 39 states have done so in order to save a buck.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.960
And then what do critics say happens next?

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.200
When you get into profit motive, well,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.320
that's your first goal, is to turn a profit.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.960
And if it means you turn a profit at the expense of other people,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.160
you do it.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.560
And by the way, privatization hasn't just meant that patients are worse off.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.860
It’s been a crisis for service providers, too –

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.240
places like nursing homes, dental clinics and rehab centers.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.840
Many service providers say they aren’t getting reimbursed from the MCOs,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.420
which means they have to cut back on staff and services.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.760
I've had medical doctors who have called me

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.560
who have actually said,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.900
“Up until this point, I always felt it was part of my duty as a doctor to take Medicaid and to serve them.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.440
But I am to the point with frustration with the managed care organizations

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.540
where I’m on the edge and ready to just stop taking Medicaid altogether.”

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:49.940
When that happens, families are left with no one to go to for their child’s medical care.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.860
Give it back to the state.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.600
They didn't have problems when the state took care of it.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.020
That’s Joann Facenda.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.380
Her son, Louis, is a 26 year-old with cerebral palsy.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.160
Joann told me that a few months after Louis’s Medicaid was moved to an MCO,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.820
all his care was cut, including his medication.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.160
It was a nightmare.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.460
It was literally a nightmare.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.440
What am I gonna do? I can't afford all that medication.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.240
Also cut were his daily nurse visits.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.800
So for six weeks, Louis went without the in-home bathing and diaper changing he had had for years.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:30.140
He wasn't getting changed like he would normally get changed, two or three times or more a day.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.760
So he was in a dirty brief from like in the morning til 7 at night.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.780
And all this just because some company decided he didn't need these services.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.260
It wasn't just the services, it was

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.060
the mental part of his state of mind –

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.780
not understanding why all this was happening.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.780
And I would cry. For him. Because I felt so bad.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.120
At this point, you’re probably wondering how these private companies

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.140
have responded to these horrible stories.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.940
Well, listen to how one doctor at one of the MCOs

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.960
justified denying diaper changing services.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.900
What would you say to him if he was here?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.020
I would spit in his face, to be honest.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.360
[Louis makes a spit sound]

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.320
Yeah. Right, Louis, you like to be clean.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.140
I think it's horrible. I don't have words for that.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.040
I reached out to several people for this video, including the current Republican governor

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.300
and the health companies.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.720
No one agreed to speak to me camera.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.740
They also didn’t respond to written questions in an email, either,

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.860
but I did get template statements back, extolling the virtues of managed care.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.980
I also tried to reach out to Iowa Medicaid Director Mike Randol – and, by the way,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.320
he’s the same guy responsible for a similar privatization fiasco in Kansas,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.140
which the federal government recently denounced as being “substantively out of compliance" with U.S. law.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:07.060
Randol explicitly avoided me at a public meeting, but his press department told me in an email:

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.200
They also referred me to a study that ranks Iowa’s healthcare system second in the nation

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.480
for patient satisfaction,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.160
but Jason told me that study is dubious.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.800
They will cite surveys that they can't provide the specific questions

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.580
that were asked or the number of recipients that they asked the question to.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.360
So for all we know, they asked seven people.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.040
We don't know.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:49.040
No politician will say that they are out to harm the elderly or the poor.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.100
But their actions speak louder than words.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.000
And what about this idea that the state will eventually save money?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.740
Well, in Iowa the estimates of savings have varied wildly, without much explanation.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.220
And a national report on privatized Medicaid showed that, yeah,

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.560
some states with managed care did save some money, but that

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.580
"the weight of the evidence suggests any potential savings will not be significant.”

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.220
And people like Dave Hudson say, even if money is being saved,

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.620
on the backs of who?

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.920
It doesn't bother me if the number is 1 dollar or 200 million dollars. That doesn't bother me.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.820
What concerns me is where'd the savings come from?

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:31.820
What had to be reduced in order for the state to save $141 million?

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:37.980
My supposition is that the savings came from considerable reductions in Medicaid services.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.920
Everyone should care about Medicaid because every one of us

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.680
is an illness or an accident away from needing it someday.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.640
None of us know what our future holds.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.400
But what I do know is that, if that happens to you,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.760
that you have a safety net in place called Medicaid.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.160
My experience with Medicaid in Iowa has only reinforced my belief

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.480
that our nation needs to move toward a single-payer, universal system.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.680
I'm not certain that my son is safe

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.840
with a Republican governor and a Republican legislator.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.320
The MCOs –

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.400
And I say that as a lifelong Republican.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.000
They're focused on money, and we're focused on the health of our son.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.640
Hey everyone, thank you so much for watching Because Facts.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.920
I hope you appreciated this deep dive we did into a pretty complicated topic.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.320
Please remember to like, share and subscribe for more videos like this.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.560
And hey, while you’re at it,

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.700
check out some of the coverage that the Des Moines register did around this topic –

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.700
it really helped us understand this issue.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.980
You can check a link to their coverage in the description below.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.840
Thank you so much for watching, and we’ll see you next week.
