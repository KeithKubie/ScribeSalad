WITH YOUR HOST,
RALPH HENDERSON.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.677
HELLO,
I'M RALPH HENDERSON.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.246
AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING
THIS VIDEO,

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.081
THAT MEANS YOU'VE
JUST BEEN HIRED TO WORK HERE

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:16.416
AT "POPULAR COPY".

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.084
ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE
GONNA SHOW YOU THE BASICS

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.719
OF WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO WORK HERE.

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.187
YOU GUYS READY ?

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.822 align:start size:28% position:72% line:92%

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:24.190
GREAT.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.728
FIRST OF ALL,
NEVER SHOW UP ON TIME,

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.164
AND IF A SUPERVISOR HAPPENS
TO ASK YOU WHERE YOU WERE,

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.866
YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD
SOUND SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.436 align:start position:0%
MANUEL,
WHY WERE YOU LATE ?

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.438 align:start size:53% position:47%

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.046
PERFECT !

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.615
OCCASIONALLY,
YOU MAY GET SNAGGED

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.284
BY ONE OF THESE
CUSTOMER PEOPLE.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.686
JUST REMEMBER, YOUR JOB
IS TO FRUSTRATE THEM

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.321
AND MAKE THEM FEEL UNWANTED.

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:57.757
IF YOU CAN,
WRAP UP A STORY

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.659
THAT WILL MAKE THEM FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:00.993
FOR INSTANCE...

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:02.595 align:start position:0%
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
I'M SAYING, RIGHT ?

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:03.996 align:start position:0%
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
MY REPUTATION.

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:05.231 align:start size:63% position:38%

I'LL GO TO<i> RIKERS</i>
 FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:08.835 align:start size:72% position:28%
JUST TO PROVE MY POINT,
I DON'T PLAY THAT SHIT.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.837 align:start size:56% position:44%
CAN I HELP YOU ?

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.405

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:21.948 align:start position:0%

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.586
CAN I HELP YOU ?

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.290
IF A CUSTOMER
HAS A COMPUTER DISK,

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.392
THEN LOOK AT IT AND TELL THEM
IT'S THE WRONG FORMAT.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.862 line:0%
IF THEY USE<i> APPLE,</i>
 TELL THEM WE'RE P.C.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.064 line:0%
IF THEY USE P.C., TELL THEM
WE'RE<i> APPLE.</i>

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.933 line:0%
AND IF THEY GOT BOTH,
THEN TELL THEM WE USE<i> LINUX.</i>

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.936 line:0%
AND IF THEY GOT THAT, TELL THEM
THE COMPUTERS ARE DOWN.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.838
THEY SHOULD BE, ANYHOW.

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:48.074
YOU SEE, THE WHOLE SYSTEM
ACTUALLY WENT DOWN.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:49.976
IT'S GONNA BE SHUT DOWN
FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.410 align:start position:0%
HOURS ?

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:52.945
IT HAPPENS.

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:54.447 align:start size:56% position:44%
THE WHOLE SYSTEM ?

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.315 align:start position:0%
BUT THIS IS A BIG PLACE,
HOW CAN--

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:57.850
LISTEN, SISTER,
I GOTTA GO TAKE A SHIT.

00:01:57.883 --> 00:01:59.953 align:start position:0%
I DON'T BELIEVE
HE SAID THAT !

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:04.624
SHOULD A CUSTOMER GET ALL UPPITY
AND ASK TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER,

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:06.292
THEN TELL THEM,
"GUESS WHAT ?

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.194
I AM THE MANAGER."

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:09.562 align:start size:75% position:25%
I WANNA SEE THE MANAGER.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:11.130 align:start position:0%
NO, SEE,

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:12.431 align:start size:66% position:34%
YOU ARE THE MANAGER ?

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:13.699 align:start position:0%
THAT'S RIGHT,
MY FRIEND.

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.034
I'M THE ONLY MANAGER HERE.

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:17.136
UNLESS YOU WANT TO TALK
TO THE "POPCOPY" PRESIDENT

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.372
AND I DON'T KNOW HIM, YOU MIGHT
COULD HELP ME OUT WITH THAT.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.207

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?!

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:36.722
Y'KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE
ASK, "WHY ?"

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:37.423
"WHY TREAT
THE CUSTOMER THIS WAY ?"

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:38.791
WHY ?

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:40.894
'CAUSE FUCK 'EM,
THAT'S WHY.

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.265
BATHROOM UPKEEP IS IMPORTANT
TO US HERE AT "POPCOPY".

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:49.502
BE SURE TO SPRAY CHOCOLATE SAUCE
ON THE WALL NEAR THE TOILET

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:51.704
TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE
OF ERRANT FECES.

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:54.006
THIS WILL ENSURE THAT ANY
CUSTOMER WHO USES OUR RESTROOM

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.243
WILL NEVER, EVER RETURN
TO ONE OF OUR STORES.

00:02:57.276 --> 00:03:00.079
WE ASK THAT YOU SIGN A SHEET
TO VERIFY THIS GETS DONE

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:03.216
ONCE AN HOUR,
24 TIMES A DAY.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.285
UH-OH, TONY,
YOU MISSED A SPOT.

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:08.120
WHOA...

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:09.855
NOW THAT LOOKS POOPY.

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:11.857
I HOPE YOU FOUND
THIS TAPE INFORMATIVE.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.559
AND SHOULD YOU EVER
DOUBT YOURSELF

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:15.461
AND CONSIDER TREATING
A CUSTOMER WITH RESPECT,

00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:16.896
JUST REMEMBER THIS:

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.598
YOU GRADUATED FROM
GRADE SCHOOL,

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.933

TAKE SHIT FROM ANYONE.
