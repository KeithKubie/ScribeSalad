00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.610
The idea of absolute hot springs from its
better-known cousin, absolute zero, which,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:25.730
as you may recall, is 0 K, -273.15° C or
-459.67° F. And although abridged definitions

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.450
of the lowest temperature will frequently
state it is the point at which matter stops

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.570
moving, this is technically incorrect.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.230
Absolute zero is actually the point where
molecular motion no longer produces heat (but

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.370
does have zero-point energy).

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.890
Conversely, absolute hot, then, could be defined
as the point where molecular motion couldn’t

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.320
produce any more heat, no matter what the
circumstances.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.420
In the Standard Model of the universe, the
hottest possible temperature ever reached

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.490
occurred a fraction of a second (10-43) after
the Big Bang.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.160
During that minuscule period of time (called
one Planck time), the universe is thought

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.920
to have only been one tiny Planck length (10-35
meters) and have reached absolute hot at 1032

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.800
K (called Planck temperature).

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:22.410
For comparison, our Sun is a measly 1.571
x 107 K at its center and the highest temperature

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.299
ever created by man is currently 5.5 X 1012
K.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.170
Beyond Planck temperature being the hottest
temperature ever theoretically reached in

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.331
our universe, physicists hypothesize that
at any temperature higher than Planck, the

00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:40.960
gravitational forces of the affected particles
would become equally as strong as the other

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.410
fundamental forces (electromagnetic and weak
and strong nuclear), resulting in all four

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.380
becoming unified as one force.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.450
What happens then?

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.429
Nobody knows as currently accepted conventional
models of physics break down after that point.

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.140
Of course, all of this is theoretical, since
no one has yet to come up with an accepted

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.180
quantum theory of gravity.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.739
As Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg described
it, whatever happens at temperatures above

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:11.360
1032 K remains obscured by a “veil.”

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.920
It should be noted that not all physicists
follow the Standard Model, and some prefer,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.040
for instance, String Theory, which attempts
to describe all four fundamental forces as

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.380
different manifestations of a single basic
object (a string).

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.640
For string theorists, the highest possible
temperature is far lower than that postulated

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.390
by the Standard Model; called the Hagedorn
temperature, it is the point at which ordinary

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.890
matter is no longer stable and either “evaporates”
or changes into quark matter.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.710
Under this theory, the point at which that
happens, or absolute hot, is thought to be

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:58.120
just 1030 K, or about 1% Planck temperature.
