00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:09.534
If you're ever walking down the street

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:13.384
and come across an oddly stretched out
image, like this,

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:17.004
you'll have an opportunity
to see something remarkable,

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:20.494
but only if you stand in exactly
the right spot.

00:00:20.494 --> 00:00:25.493
That happens because these works
employ a technique called anamorphosis.

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:28.765
Anamorphosis is a special case
of perspective art,

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:31.794
where artists represent realistic
three-dimensional views

00:00:31.794 --> 00:00:34.115
on two-dimensional surfaces.

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:35.395
Though it's common today,

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:40.126
this kind of perspective drawing has only
been around since the Italian Renaissance.

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:43.396
Ancient art often showed all figures
on the same plane,

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:47.145
varying in size by symbolic importance.

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:51.304
Classical Greek and Roman artists realized
they could make objects seem further

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:53.155
by drawing them smaller,

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:58.535
but many early attempts at perspective
were inconsistent or incorrect.

00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:00.536
In 15th century Florence,

00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:02.819
artists realized the illusion 
of perspective

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:05.954
could be achieved with higher degrees
of sophistication

00:01:05.954 --> 00:01:08.946
by applying mathematical principles.

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:13.415
In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci 
manipulated the mathematics

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:17.576
to create the first known 
anamorphic drawing.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:20.848
A number of other artists later
picked up the technique,

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:25.526
including Hans Holbein 
in "The Ambassadors."

00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:29.416
This painting features a distorted
shape that forms into a skull

00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:32.665
as the viewer approaches from the side.

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:35.756
In order to understand how artists
achieve that effect,

00:01:35.756 --> 00:01:39.836
we first have to understand how 
perspective drawings work in general.

00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:41.726
Imagine looking out a window.

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:44.697
Light bounces off objects 
and into your eye,

00:01:44.697 --> 00:01:47.197
intersecting the window along the way.

00:01:47.197 --> 00:01:51.437
Now, imagine you could paint the image
you see directly onto the window

00:01:51.437 --> 00:01:55.734
while standing still and keeping
only one eye open.

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:59.425
The result would be nearly
indistinguishable from the actual view

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:02.457
with your brain adding depth
to the 2-D picture,

00:02:02.457 --> 00:02:04.457
but only from that one spot.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.627
Standing even just a bit off
to the side

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:10.384
would make the drawing 
lose its 3-D effect.

00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:12.307
Artists understand that 
a perspective drawing

00:02:12.307 --> 00:02:16.098
is just a projection
onto a 2-D plane.

00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:20.529
This allows them to use math to come up
with basic rules of perspective

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.971
that allow them to draw without a window.

00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:26.498
One is that parallel lines, like these,

00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:33.118
can only be drawn as parallel if they're
parallel to the plane of the canvas.

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:36.779
Otherwise, they need to be drawn
converging to a common point

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:40.263
known as the vanishing point.

00:02:40.263 --> 00:02:43.009
So that's a standard perspective drawing.

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.891
With an anamorphic drawing,
like "The Ambassadors,"

00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:50.498
directly facing the canvas makes the image
look stretched and distorted,

00:02:50.498 --> 00:02:54.069
but put your eye in exactly the right spot
way off to the side,

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.917
and the skull materializes.

00:02:56.917 --> 00:02:58.530
Going back to the window analogy,

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.079
it's as if the artist painted 
onto a window positioned at an angle

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.669
instead of straight on,

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.809
though that's not how Renaissance artists
actually created anamorphic drawings.

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:12.209
Typically, they draw a normal image 
onto one surface,

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.229
then use a light,

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:15.470
a grid,

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.123
or even strings to project it
onto a canvas at an angle.

00:03:20.123 --> 00:03:23.563
Now let's say you want to make
an anamorphic sidewalk drawing.

00:03:23.563 --> 00:03:25.999
In this case, you want to create
the illusion

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:30.430
that a 3-D image has been added
seamlessly into an existing scene.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.250
You can first put a window
in front of the sidewalk

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.990
and draw what you want to add 
onto the window.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.141
It should be in the same perspective
as the rest of the scene,

00:03:39.141 --> 00:03:43.132
which might require the use of those
basic rules of perspective.

00:03:43.132 --> 00:03:44.541
Once the drawing's complete,

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:46.979
you can use a projector placed 
where your eye was

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.581
to project your drawing down 
onto the sidewalk,

00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:51.560
then chalk over it.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.010
The sidewalk drawing 
and the drawing on the window

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.702
will be nearly indistinguishable
from that point of view,

00:03:57.702 --> 00:04:00.090
so viewers' brains will again be tricked

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.291
into believing that the drawing
on the ground is three-dimensional.

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:08.061
And you don't have to project onto
a flat surface to create this illusion.

00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:10.321
You can project onto multiple surfaces,

00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:14.002
or assemble a jumble of objects,
that from the right point of view,

00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:17.901
appears to be something else entirely.

00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:20.363
All over the planet, you can find
solid surfaces

00:04:20.363 --> 00:04:23.732
giving way to strange, wonderful,
or terrifying visions.

00:04:23.732 --> 00:04:27.372
From your sidewalk 
to your computer screen,

00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:30.982
these are just some of the ways
that math and perspective

00:04:30.982 --> 00:04:33.432
can open up whole new worlds.
