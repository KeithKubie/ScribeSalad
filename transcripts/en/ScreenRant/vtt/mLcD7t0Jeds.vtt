00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.290
Fans often expect to see entertainers promoting
their work with enthusiasm and pride.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.690
But the days during press junkets are long.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.430
And after 12 hours of being asked the same
questions, it can be hard for even the best

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.800
actors to feign enthusiasm.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.910
But occasionally things don’t go as planned,
and performers don’t respond in the way

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.910
we expect.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.640
Sometimes, that means turning their backs
on their own work.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.460
These are Screen Rant’s 10 Famous Actors
Who Refused To Promote Their Own Movies.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.350
George Clooney
At this point, everyone agrees that Batman

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.309
&amp; Robin was the worst film in the character’s
history.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.559
Cartoonishly over-the-top, this is the movie
that gave the world something it never needed:

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:43.559
bat-nipples.

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.920
And while it’s no surprise the movie got
raked over the coals by fans, what is interesting

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.220
is how bad George Clooney feels about it.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.289
Make no mistake, the actor hates the film,
and doesn’t mince words about it.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.980
But what seems to stings him the most, is
how badly it wounded the franchise.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.829
Apparently, he even personally apologized
to Adam West for it.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.210
In interviews, Clooney’s called Batman &amp; Robin
“a waste of money”.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.159
It seems like he hates it more than any of
us could, and that’s earned him a lot of

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.159
forgiveness.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.229
Johnny Depp
More than once, we’ve heard celebrities

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.860
bemoaning the loss of privacy that comes with
fame.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.640
But, lots of people argue that it’s just
part of the job.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.909
If people are interested in reading about
an actor, that should be a good thing… right?

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.979
Johnny Depp doesn’t hold back when talking
about how much he hates being famous.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.659
Arguing that performing should be treated
like any other job you can leave behind at

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:32.659
the end of the day.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.220
And this outlook extends to interviews as
well, so it’s not easy to get the actor

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.649
to sign on for press events.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:46.289
But, given how bankable he’s proven to be,
his popularity doesn’t seem to be suffering.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.490
Jim Carrey
When funnymen turn serious it has a jarring

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.950
effect on audiences.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.090
And because of that, very few comedians have
found success in non-comedic roles.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.689
And while some of his dramatic attempts have
received mixed reviews, Jim Carrey proved

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.430
to be one of the few performers who’s ultimately
held his own in both genres.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.980
When he decided to return to comedy for 2013’s
Kick-Ass 2, audiences were pumped, and so

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.980
was he.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.320
But shortly after the tragedy in Sandy Hook,
the actor’s enthusiasm for the film disappeared

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.440
completely.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.750
After reflecting on the project, the actor
took to twitter where he explained that he

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.780
could no longer support anything related to
child violence.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.099
And in good conscience, could not do press
for a film in which kids are violent.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.950
Some followers suggested he donate his Kick-Ass
2 paycheck to a charity with a similar outlook.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.750
But on that point, Carrey had no opinion.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.390
Shia LaBeouf
If you thought the most recent installment

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.340
in the Indiana Jones franchise was an insult
to it’s legacy, you’re not alone! 2008’s

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.430
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal
Skull has caught flack from almost everyone

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.430
who's seen it.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.200
And thanks to the reliably unreliable Shia
LaBeouf, we know that the actors hated it

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200
too.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.379
He stated that the movie “dropped the ball,”
and told multiple interviewers how much he

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.440
despised it.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.940
But, it wouldn’t be dramatic enough if only
cast member was disappointed.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.100
So LaBeouf was sure to mention that Harrison
Ford didn’t like it either.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.540
Which kind of feels a little like tattletaling.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.610
Edward Norton
Edward Norton has a very particular approach

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.489
to his craft, and if he feels like the content
can’t match his ability as a performer,

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.600
then it’s not worth his time to talk about
it.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.530
During the junket for 2008’s The Incredible
Hulk, that’s exactly what happened.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.640
Norton was allegedly very adamant about changes
being made to the script during filming.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.900
Arguing for constant rewrites made him hard
to work with, and even harder to stay on track.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.760
The actor maintains that he simply had high
hopes for the movie.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.060
And once he realized they wouldn’t be met,
spoke up about it.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.080
Thanks to a creative marketing strategy, he
didn’t have to do much talking after that,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.230
and his promotional tour was considerably
shortened.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.349
Chris Evans
Thanks to the massive success of the MCU,

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.880
it might be hard to remember a time before
Chris Evans was Captain America.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.939
And that’s probably because he’s so perfectly
cast as the star-spangled Avenger.

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.750
But during one interview where the actor was
looking back at his body of work, he revealed

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.680
something that surprised fans.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.450
After reminiscing, he stated that out of the
roughly 20 films he’s been a part of, he’s

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.900
only proud of about 3.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.980
Ever the classy gentleman, Evans left the
conversation at that, and allowed the specifics

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.159
to remain a mystery.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:26.340
Still, we really hope Scott Pilgrim vs. the
World is among his favorites.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.570
Robin Williams
Robin Williams’ voice work for the character

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.250
of Genie was top-notch.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.220
Even though some audiences think the sequels
left a lot to be desired, Williams as Genie

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.290
in the first and third installments of Aladdin
proved to be reliably enjoyable.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.830
But around the time of the original’s release
in 1992, it wasn’t the only movie he was

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.830
promoting.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.310
In order to boost promotion for his other
film, Toys, the actor requested that the marketing

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.190
team behind Aladdin not focus too much on
Genie.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.880
It must be an odd feeling to compete with
yourself.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:02.020
And thankfully for audiences, he did a lot
of great work because of it.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.020
Daniel Craig
In case you haven’t heard, Daniel Craig

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.500
is really over the whole James Bond thing.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.470
And when talking about it in an interview,
mentioned he’d rather “slash his wrists”

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.949
than think about reprising his role as 007.

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.440
Thanks to the rigorous rounds of press he
was required to do for 2015’s Spectre, the

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.320
actor had more than a few opportunities to
voice his distain for the classic character.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.520
Misogynistic and flighty, Craig argues that
Bond is part of the problem with how Hollywood

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.090
handles depictions of masculinity.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.460
And a lot of people definitely agree.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.289
But since audiences are so used to being told
what an honor it is to play the legendary

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.790
spy, the actor’s candidness threw a lot
of people for a loop.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.190
Including the movie’s PR team.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.090
Burt Reynolds
Burt Reynolds hated Boogie Nights so much

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.860
that he fired his agent for recommending him
the role.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.000
Reynolds reportedly hated the pacing of the
movie, arguing it didn’t flow coherently.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.660
Which got him in trouble a couple of times
on set.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.220
Leading up to the release, Reynolds wasn’t
really included in any promotions.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.250
It might have something to do with what co-star
Mark Wahlberg referred to as a “piss-poor

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.020
attitude”, which affected his outlook during
filming.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.490
Still, when given the opportunity, Reynolds
takes shots at the film.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.120
And reminds everyone just how much he loathed
the experience.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:18.560
And Boogie Nights went on to be successful
anyway.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.069
Bill Murray
There are a handful of people in Hollywood

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:22.319
who have very similar names.

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:25.400
And when those people get mixed up, some super
weird movies get made.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.620
So when a script by Joel Cohen landed in front
of Bill Murray, he jumped at the opportunity

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.060
to work with the great comedic mind responsible
for movies like The Big Lebowski, No Country

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.820
For Old Men, and Burn After Reading.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.729
Murray admits he was a little worried about
wether or not a cat named Garfield could carry

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:40.970
an entire movie.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.250
And when he learned that the story wasn’t
actually written by the Coen brothers, it

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.259
was too late.

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.110
He’d signed on to work with the Joel Cohen
behind Daddy Day Camp, and Cheaper by the

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.110
Dozen.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.690
Murray reportedly scrambled to make the script
funnier once he realized he was locked in,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.139
but was overruled at every turn.

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:57.610
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.139
Did we miss any actors who refused to promote
their own movies?
