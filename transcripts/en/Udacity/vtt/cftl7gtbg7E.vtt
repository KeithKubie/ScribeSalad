00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.690
All right, based on the map you see here,

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.844
anyone who's lactase persistent. If I tell you I'm

00:00:03.844 --> 00:00:07.490
lactase persistent, you would expect me to not share

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.610
ancestry, or genetic information, from Africa, East Asia, or

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.330
the Central and South Americas. Now of course this

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.630
is only one possible allele that relates to lactase

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.400
persistence. And to examine my long-term ancestry, we really

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.454
need to look at far more than just one SNV.
