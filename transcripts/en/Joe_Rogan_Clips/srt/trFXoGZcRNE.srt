1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,600
The Joe Rogan experience.
Remember going to watch,

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:07,310
I remember watching fights on Hbo.
I just remember that,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,980
that let HBO boxing being
such like a emblematic thing
for, you know what I mean?

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:14,070
Like it's so recognizable.
So like pay per view, Hbo,

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,020
so them get out of the game is so strange.

6
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:18,150
It's kind of like the
revolution that's happening now.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,100
The last fight I went to with you at
UFC, now their ESPN, what does it plus?

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,340
ESPN plus. That's what it
is. Private paid service.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,690
It's a subscription service.
Right. Look on Netflix for sports,

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,070
but it's not just UFC fights.
It's a bunch of other stuff. Wow.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,880
All kinds of shit stuff. They just
won't show on ESPN at all though. No,

12
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:43,710
they sometimes show you mean
it's ESPN content? I guess.

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,770
So you could watch some fights that
were on ESPN plus later they'll probably

14
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:53,230
show them on the ESPN. Sort of like the
same thing with Hbo pay per view. Yeah.

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,320
You know, but, um, I think
what HBO did with Paper View,

16
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:58,560
it was brilliant where you
would have the paper view,

17
00:00:58,561 --> 00:00:59,880
but then let people watch it for free.

18
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:01,710
A week later you're just
going to make more fans. Yeah.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,690
It's like you're not going to
lose money on the paper view.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,780
I'm just going to make more fans.
Well that's the whole idea of like a,

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,290
that's why this, this, this
is funny. I was going to talk
to you about this anyway,

22
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:14,040
I just moved and I cancelled my
directv. I'm done. I canceled them.

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,270
I cut the wire and I'm just doing
like a Hulu live TV, Internet shit.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,000
All the years of hearing people being
like cutting the court caught in the car

25
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:24,210
and I'm like, I don't know man.
I like it now. Fuck it. I love,

26
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:25,950
I love what I'm doing now.
And I gotta Tell Ya,

27
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,220
I can get all the shit that I want
for cheaper than I had it before.

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,430
And it's just way more convenient now.
I used to be so tethered to being like,

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,880
I'll never give up cable now. I'm like,
fuck it. I don't want it anymore. I don't,

30
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:38,030
I don't want it.
This has been the best version.

31
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,270
I'll always have a blockbuster
card. Oh yeah. It'll never go away.

32
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,150
It'll never Hollywood
video, dude, I want to rent.

33
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,830
If you put all your money in that he
like I'm telling you in 20 years this is

34
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:54,690
going to amount to $15 million.
I got fucking plan.

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,340
Do you think people invested in Netflix
when it was the DVD subscription service

36
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:02,380
and that, you know what I mean, like early
on and now they're still getting the,

37
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,000
the revenue dividends of what Netflix
is now. I wonder about that. Oh yeah.

38
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:06,750
I'm sure you do.

39
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,330
Like that's gotta be the best money
cause it was worth nothing back then.

40
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,690
It was just another subscription
video service and they had,

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,040
there was a ton of them.
I mean red box.

42
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,040
I did my first Netflix special in
2005 Oh my God, there's one left.

43
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,050
Oh, I think I've seen this.
Yeah, there you go. Yes. In
Oregon, Oregon, bend, Oregon.

44
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,350
That's so weird to last.
Blockbuster.

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,500
They went from 4,855 stores in 2008 to
one store in 2018 that is the craziest

46
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,590
demolition of a business I've ever heard.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,700
I wouldn't have ever heard of what other
business in our lifetimes vanish like

48
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,640
that. Like A, like I've
come like a storefront.

49
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:51,200
I can't think of something that that
went away that quickly. Industry gone.

50
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,950
It was just, it was a part
of our huge weekend. Yeah.
You go to plot buster. Huge.

51
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:59,590
What do they got right? You anything
about this? He'd look the cover.

52
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,950
I don't know that. I never even
heard of this one. Ever saw it.

53
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:05,770
Maybe it's good watching like obscure
Dolph Lundgren movies that were made in

54
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:10,390
Italy. Yeah, you would. You'd get to
pick out shit that you're like, ah,

55
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,300
this looks Kinda dope. We'll see.
Back then the gamble was fun.

56
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,790
The name meant a lot.
Yeah.

57
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,080
Like it was like this guy from dances with
wolves. Oh, okay. I remember that guy.

58
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,630
I can that. Cool. You'll take
a chance. Yeah, you will.

59
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,520
But I think that's happening
again now with Netflix.

60
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,520
I'll take a chance with shit now that
I've never heard of because Netflix,

61
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,490
you pop up all these different
titles and you'll go, hmm,

62
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,520
I'll try this fucking shit. I just
started a new show I just tried to show,

63
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:34,570
okay.
