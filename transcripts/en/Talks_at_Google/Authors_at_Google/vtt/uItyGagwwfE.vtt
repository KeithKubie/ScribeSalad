FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.660
Welcome to Talks
at Mountain View.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.520
We're excited today to be having
Anne-Marie Slaughter come,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.700
with Kristen Gil moderating.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.180
A little bit about Anne-Marie.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.520
She's president and CEO of
New America, and the professor

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.280
emeritus at Princeton,
along with being

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.230
the former dean of the Woodrow
Wilson School of International

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.980
Affairs.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.660
Most of us know her from
her "Atlantic" article, "Why

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.330
Women Still Can't Have It All."

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.710
And today she's come
in because she recently

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.000
published a book called
"Unfinished Business: Women,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.990
Men, Work, Family."

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.170
And I think most
of us are pretty

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.330
familiar with Kristen Gil.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.130
She's our vice president
of business operations,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.370
and she's the former head
emeritus of woman at Google.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.840
So welcome, both.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.540
KRISTEN GIL: Thank
you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.022
Welcome, Anne-Marie.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.480
I think I speak
for a lot of people

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.647
when I say we are so excited
to host you here today.

00:00:59.647 --> 00:01:00.979
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Thank you.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.900
KRISTEN GIL: Congratulations
on your new book.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.233
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Thank you.

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:07.878
I still like to see
it, kind of pat it.

00:01:07.878 --> 00:01:09.297
KRISTEN GIL: Exactly.

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:10.880
So I thought we could
start, actually,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.460
by taking you back to when
you wrote the article "Why

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.409
Women Still Can't Have It All."

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.700
Could you tell us a little
bit about the personal story

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.060
of what was going on when
you decided to write that?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.200
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Yes.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.110
So I'm thrilled to be here.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.990
And, yes.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.910
I'm trying to go back.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.040
So while I was working
in the State Department,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.130
I was-- my husband
and my two sons,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.370
who were 10 and 12 when I left--
or no, 8 and 10 when I left.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.530
I would leave first
thing Monday morning,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.430
and I would come back
very late Friday night.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.900
So I really saw my kids
only two days a week.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.860
And from the
beginning, it was hard,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.310
but I didn't expect it
was going to be easy.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.630
But it was harder than I
expected, because I'd always

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.160
traveled a lot.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.820
So I was always gone a lot.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.640
And in the book, I actually say
that my youngest son drew me

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.780
as a laptop once
when he was drawing.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.610
He was asked to draw his family.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.350
And he didn't-- not a woman
at a laptop, a laptop.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.070
And then he drew
my husband cooking,

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.040
because my husband is the cook.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.040
And he drew his brother.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.060
So it wasn't like
I had ever been--

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.820
I was never completely focused
on raising them, anything

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.440
but-- but it was
much harder than I

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.880
expected to be gone that much.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.580
So all the way through,
I really was like, wow,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.270
I'm getting tugged in
ways I never expected.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.142
And I had never felt
guilty about working.

00:02:35.142 --> 00:02:37.350
I'd always had the view that
I'm a much better mother

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.080
because I work, because I'm
passionate about my work.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.410
That makes me happy.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.160
That makes me a better parent.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.280
But this was tough.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.370
And as my 10-year-old
turned into a 12-year-old,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.350
he was middle school.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.430
And middle school was
rocky, as it often is.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.690
And I started
getting calls where,

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.246
OK, so he's getting bad grades.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.620
Well, that's not
such a big deal.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.720
Well, he's skipping class.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.960
Well, you know.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.920
By the time he got
suspended from school,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.720
that was a different thing.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.380
And he's in public school.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.850
So this was not-- it wasn't
like he was in a private school

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.183
and we put him in public school.

00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:14.790
This was really an issue.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.220
And so that's when
I started realizing,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.980
wow, I'm not going to
be able to do this.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.070
I really do have to go
home, and I am not in a job

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.340
that I can do from home.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.340
You cannot be an Assistant
Secretary of State from

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.500
Princeton, New Jersey.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.310
You just can't.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.960
It's like the world
does not wait on you.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.060
Got to be there.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.210
So I sort of played
with this idea of, wow--

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.780
and I said, as I
said in the article,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.920
that I told a friend-- I've
told women all my life,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.900
women can have it all.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.970
You can make it happen.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.250
And, wow, I really can't.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.290
So then I go home, and I was
more focused on being home

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.310
and, as I say in the book,
cooking massive breakfasts

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.810
for my sons every morning.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.310
I'd get up at 6:00 every
morning and make fresh muffins

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.466
or fresh hash browns.

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:03.340
And finally my kids are
like, enough already.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.140
It's fine.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.930
And then I sat down-- well,
a couple things happened.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.820
One was I really noticed
that when I told people

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.730
that I'd left government
after two years

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.934
because my tenure was
up-- in other words,

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:19.600
you get a two-year
public service leave,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.200
so if you stay another
year, you no longer

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.930
have a lifetime position.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.660
That was fine.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.820
Everybody gets that.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.710
You don't want to give
up a tenured position

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.220
at a great university.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.820
When I told people
I had come home

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.640
because we had two teenagers
who for the last four years

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.830
they were going to be at
home, or the last six years,

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.780
I got a completely
different reaction.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.840
I got essentially
the reaction that

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.370
told me very quickly
the person I was talking

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.960
to was revaluing me downward.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.980
They were thinking, she's not
the player I thought she was.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.090
And that just wasn't true.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.830
My reaction was, no, I
am doing what I consider

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.930
to be the right thing to do.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.610
Partly, my kid needed me.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.180
But equally, I'm doing
what I want to do,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.330
which is to be there
while they're home.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.340
And they won't be home forever.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.000
And why on earth am I
getting judged this way?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.470
And that's when
I really thought,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.580
OK, I have been not only telling
people they could have it

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.180
all if they just
tried hard enough,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.910
I have also been
part of the women who

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.470
have made those judgments.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.460
And now I'm on the
other side, and I think

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.130
it's important to speak out.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.160
Now, I never anticipated
that the article I wrote

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.320
would have the
impact it did, but I

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.440
did feel like I've
had a great career.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.890
I'm high enough up
that if I say this,

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.380
it will have more of an
impact than if I'd been home

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.493
all the time or if my career
was around women's issues.

00:05:50.493 --> 00:05:51.260
KRISTEN GIL: Yeah.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.270
So, if you can then,
tell us a little bit

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.620
about-- in your book, you
talk about half truths.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.870
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Yep.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.245
KRISTEN GIL: So I want to
actually get into to your point

00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:03.182
about, why is it that people
judged you as stepping back?

00:06:03.182 --> 00:06:04.890
And I want to get into
that a little bit,

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.620
but first I think we should
lay the foundation for what

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.160
you talk about are the
half truths out there.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.340
You list, if you commit enough
to your career, which you just

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.120
said, if you marry
the right person,

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.534
and also if you
planned your career--

00:06:19.534 --> 00:06:21.450
ANNE MARIE SLAUGHTER:
Sequence it right, yeah.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.620
KRISTEN GIL: Yeah, if you
sequence everything right

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.920
from child rearing, et cetera.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.920
Can you talk about why
those are half truths?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.270
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Yes.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.670
So the first one is the
lean-in proposition.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.160
The first one is, if you go hard
enough, you can make it work.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.770
And I will say, and let
me just start by saying--

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.820
and I say in the book-- I
have enormous respect for what

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.480
Sheryl Sandberg has done.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.060
I have personally
been on the other side

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.280
of women asking for raises
because they've read the book.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.080
And I say in the book that
when that happens-- of course,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.570
as a feminist, I'm thrilled.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.100
As a boss, you know, I
don't always say yes,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.720
but I respect the
person for asking.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.260
So I say in the book, when
that happens I smile and I

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.780
tip my hat to Sheryl Sandberg.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.440
And I really feel that strongly.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.400
So this is not either
or, regardless of

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.770
what the media may say.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.200
And I go out of my
way to say how much I

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.340
respect what she's doing.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.380
But it's one piece
of a larger puzzle.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.310
Because it is what I
always told people,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.710
but I hit a tipping point.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.540
And there is nobody more
committed to their career

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.220
than I am.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.610
My family would
have said, no way.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.260
If she had the chance to
be promoted in the State

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.910
Department and go higher-- there
are only a few jobs above me,

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.440
like Deputy Secretary of State,
Under Secretary of State.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.120
They're all good jobs.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.832
And nobody would
have thought that I

00:07:43.832 --> 00:07:45.290
would have made a
different choice,

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.130
but I hit a tipping point.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.110
I just hit a point at
which it couldn't happen.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.610
And so the reason I say
it's a half truth-- it's

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.490
really important to go hard.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.280
All the stuff in lean in
is right, but many of us--

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.010
and I was super privileged.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.180
I had everything else
going for me-- do hit

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.950
an unanticipated tipping point.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.320
You can have a child
with special needs.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.590
You can get divorced.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.970
You can move away,
if you're depending

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.330
on your extended family.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.370
You can have a teenager who
turns into an alien, even

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.610
more than most teenagers.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:27.290
So my point is, when that
happens, it's not your fault.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.080
And it's not because
you're not ambitious.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.730
It's because life happens.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.480
And so that's why I
say it's a half truth.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.870
And the same is true
with who you marry.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.380
It's incredibly important.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.650
Sheryl's right.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.710
That's a really
important choice.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.740
But I had a lead-parent husband.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.870
I had a husband who was
there, and still, our kids

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.490
needed both of us, hands on.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.430
And he's my second husband.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.970
I love him.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.100
He's my final husband.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.190
Let me say it here.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.420
But I didn't expect to get
divorced the first time.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.840
Nobody expects to get
divorced when you get married.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.700
But we didn't have kids
when I got divorced,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:12.220
but if we had-- you can't
just always make that choice,

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.150
and even when you choose
a great husband, or wife,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.310
and whether a man or a
woman, again, things happen.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.080
And finally, the sequencing--
this should be a whole truth.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.990
It should be the
old thing that says,

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.230
you can have it all but
not all at the same time.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.130
And that's what
lots of people say.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.624
And I say, that's terrific
and ought to be true,

00:09:33.624 --> 00:09:35.290
because we ought to
be able to make room

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.850
for care and for going hard.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.020
And you should be able to
be considered for leadership

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.280
positions whenever you're
ready as long as the work is

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.160
good enough.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.490
In fact, lots and lots and lots
of women who have stepped out,

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.760
or work part time, or
work from home when

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.270
they have caregiving
obligations, or men, actually

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.260
can't get back in.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.010
Or they can get back
in, but they're never

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.884
going to be in the same
place that they were.

00:10:00.884 --> 00:10:04.140
So there again,
it's true in theory,

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.520
and it's true for some
women, but for many and many,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.291
it's not.

00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:09.790
KRISTEN GIL: I think
that's so true,

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.998
and what I love is I think
you have some great policy

00:10:11.998 --> 00:10:13.900
ideas on how to
solve some of those.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.055
But if we could,
I'd like to hear,

00:10:16.055 --> 00:10:18.490
because you also talk
about, a bit of the way

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.320
it is today is you either
lean in, or you get out,

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.510
or you're pushed out.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.480
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Or
you're shut out, yeah.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.646
KRISTEN GIL: But you also
talk about this vision of,

00:10:25.646 --> 00:10:28.380
we should be able to lean
in and lean back a bit,

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.514
and think about our careers.

00:10:30.514 --> 00:10:32.680
What I love is you take the
long view of the career.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.107
We should think about our
careers as a portfolio.

00:10:35.107 --> 00:10:36.940
Can you talk a little
bit about that vision?

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.565
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:38.565 --> 00:10:41.690
So there's two metaphors in the
book that I use for careers,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.300
and the first is absolutely
that we think about our careers

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.080
like interval training.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.320
So if you're an athlete, you
know, if you go really hard,

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.470
then you slow down.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.820
You don't go hard all the time.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.810
You'll burn out.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.010
You'll injure yourself.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.640
The whole point is to
give yourself rest,

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.840
and then you go hard again.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.050
And that's how I've thought
about my own career.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.030
I've changed jobs roughly
every five to seven years.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.670
And there have been periods
where I've gone all out,

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.310
and there have been areas
where I'm always working,

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.540
but I'm more focused on having
kids, on being with my kids,

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.000
or on other things that
I want to do in my life.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.380
This isn't just about kids.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.170
It's about other
things you want to do.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.690
So I suggest you think
about your career

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.930
as a series of
intervals, some of which

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.370
you're really going
to go all out.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.744
And that may be
when you're young

00:11:26.744 --> 00:11:28.580
and you don't have
caregiving obligations.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.910
That may be at a period when
your kids, actually, you either

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.970
have a spouse is going
to be a lead parent,

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.010
or your kids are just
in a really good place

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:37.920
and you can do it.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.362
But you think about that
over your lifetime, which

00:11:41.362 --> 00:11:43.570
it actually means you're
going to have much more time

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.500
for other stuff you want to do.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.750
A lot of you are going to
live to your 80s, 90s, older,

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.900
out here, the end of
death and all that.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.670
But we won't go there.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.420
Let's assume we haven't
gotten to the end of death.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.540
We still do have
long lives, and you

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.830
don't want to achieve everything
by the time you're 60.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.470
What are you going to do?

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.600
You sit around for 30 years.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.110
This is not an
attractive proposition.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.910
And your kids are
only young once,

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.120
and your parents
are only old once.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.280
So why not take that
time to enjoy it and live

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.120
that period of life
to your fullest

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.700
and then have time
to go hard again?

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.070
And the second is, I
think about careers

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.570
as a portfolio of
skills and experiences.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.290
So let's say you
wanted to be me.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.289
You'd look at not
the title I hold--

00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:35.580
I've had many different titles.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.920
But you'd look and you'd
say, well, I speak, I write,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.940
I manage, I strategize,
I fund-raise.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.420
There's a whole
portfolio of skills,

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.244
and I've worked in
the private-- well,

00:12:48.244 --> 00:12:50.410
not really the private
sector, but the public sector

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:54.150
government, universities,
and now the nonprofit sector.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.180
And really running New America
is like being an entrepreneur

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.640
but just in a nonprofit world
rather than a for-profit world.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.670
You can get those
skills and experiences

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.490
many different ways.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.280
You can step out of
where you are now

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.450
and run an NGO for
two or three years

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.810
while you want to have more
time and be your own boss,

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.960
and learn how to fund-raise
and learn how to be a speaker.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.340
You can go back to school.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.850
You can try your
hand at writing.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.190
So if you think about it as
intervals and a whole portfolio

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.410
of skills and experiences, you
can actually equip yourself

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.350
for the bigger jobs later
in life without thinking,

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:36.000
I have to follow a prescribed
set of progressions.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.884
KRISTEN GIL: And I was able to
recently-- you were actually

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:40.550
speaking at the
Computer History Museum,

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.570
and I heard you talk
about some of the skills

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.120
that you learn as a parent being
quite applicable to actually

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.460
being a leader and a manager.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:48.650
ANNE MARIE SLAUGHTER:
Absolutely.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.250
KRISTEN GIL: In fact,
comparing some of the trainings

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:50.760
that you had.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.100
One was around
parenting, and one was

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.240
around new manager training.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.490
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Exactly.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.820
Exactly.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.930
The thing that I absolutely
did not believe three years ago

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.030
that I now believe
is that the skills

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:12.330
of caregiving help you grow and
develop as much as competition

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.520
does.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.900
And I actually got this
from a male philosopher

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.490
who wrote a book called
"On Caring" in the '70s.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.140
He's a man.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.200
He was a father.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.030
And he talks about what
caring does for you.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.110
And it's entirely
written in a male voice.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.540
This has nothing to do
with work and family.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.450
It's not a
rationalization of time

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.330
spent parenting is going
to be good for your career.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.080
It was talking about
what investing in others

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.990
teaches you.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.010
So when we compete, we
invest in ourselves.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.210
We get education.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.670
We work really long hours.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.710
We acquire a set of skills.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.470
But when we invest in
others, we actually

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:53.780
enable them to grow and to
achieve their full potential.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:59.730
And to do that, it's a
combination of, you shape them,

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.990
you guide them,
you support them.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.930
But you also let them go and let
them make their own mistakes.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.740
Because if you don't,
they won't grow.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.920
You have to let them
make their own mistakes.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.400
Well, that description
I could give

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.250
to you in countless
management manuals.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.840
There's tons of--
empower your team.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.430
Particularly now, where
you can't plan everything.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.480
You support your team,
empower your team.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.390
Let them reach their
full potential.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.180
That is the definition
of parenting.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.180
Good parenting is, you teach
your kids a lot of stuff.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.650
You guide them.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.860
You support them.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.010
You're there when
they have problems.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.270
But if you're a good parent,
you do not do for them.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.110
You let them make
their own mistakes.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.160
Otherwise, they don't grow.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.050
And so, that process--
and it's hard.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.110
It's really hard.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.030
And none of us have a
manual as to how to parent.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.830
We generally look at
how we were parented,

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.130
or sometimes we look at how
we were parented and say,

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.300
we don't want to do that.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.440
We'll do something else.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.960
My husband read tons of books.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.530
I figured I'd figured it out.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:07.310
But those skills are completely
transferable to being a manager

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.530
and to being a
leader, so much so

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.600
that I would look for people
with caregiving experience

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.510
as managers.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:17.130
Because I think it
forces you to do this

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.667
in a very immediate context.

00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:20.125
KRISTEN GIL: We
have something here

00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:23.140
at Google, where we really value
in our leaders people who have

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.950
an adaptive leadership style.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:25.380
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER:
That's the other one, yes.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.796
KRISTEN GIL: They know how to
adapt based on the situation

00:16:27.796 --> 00:16:29.702
or based on the
needs of the people

00:16:29.702 --> 00:16:30.785
that they're working with.

00:16:30.785 --> 00:16:34.990
Somebody needs more help
here, needs more runway there.

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.120
Really, what a
tougher place, where

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.377
you're having to
adapt year after year.

00:16:39.377 --> 00:16:41.710
I always talk about how I hit
these moments with my kids

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.070
where suddenly I screw up
because I was absolutely

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.779
not expecting that they could
do something now they can do.

00:16:47.779 --> 00:16:49.070
But that's a whole other story.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.850
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: But
no, that's-- adaptability

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.160
to changing rhythms is
definitely another thing that

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.470
caregiver teaches you.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.710
KRISTEN GIL: That's right.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.200
But let's follow
this thread on care,

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.720
because I think
what's so insightful

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.630
is that you note
that, as a society,

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:07.560
we undervalue care,
to the extent it's not

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.069
counted in our GDP.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:14.740
In the fields that are
generally caring fields

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.730
and often have
traditionally more women,

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.489
significantly more women
than men-- eds and meds,

00:17:20.489 --> 00:17:23.050
you call it-- education
and the medical field,

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.589
particularly nursing.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:28.291
Can you talk a little
bit about the fact

00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:29.790
that we undervalue
care and what you

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.220
think we should be doing
about that to change that?

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.470
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: So
this was the great revelation

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.990
of the book that I
started it by saying,

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.760
this is a women's issue.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.130
And then I kept looking at, we
have too few women at the top,

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.100
but we also have far too
many women at the bottom.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.100
I call it an unlovely symmetry.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.460
So too few at the top.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.980
Enormously, the poorest
members of our society

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.461
are women-- the majority of
minimum-wage workers, the shift

00:17:54.461 --> 00:17:54.960
workers.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.900
And why?

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.270
Because they're exactly the
people who are trying to be

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.990
breadwinners and
caregivers together,

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.210
and we're not
supporting their care.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.830
So that was one piece of it.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.740
And the middle part,
in the middle class,

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.580
you are looking at all
the caring professions.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.630
Which, if you're a
doctor, that's different.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.750
Although, even there,
general practitioners,

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.280
who are the doctors who
do the most caring of you,

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.180
rather than the slicing of
you or the very specialized

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:27.080
reading of charts, et cetera--
the more the profession

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.290
involves care,
the less well paid

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.170
it is and the less valued it is.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.840
So nurses, teachers,
obviously-- we

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.430
do not value teaching in
this country, and it shows.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.180
When Finland went
from a terrible record

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.820
as an educational system
to the best in Europe,

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:44.600
what did they do?

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.350
They made teachers' colleges
look like the Ivy League

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.230
so that the best people
wanted to be teachers.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.360
It's not that hard to do.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.730
We value technologists, we get
great people as technologists.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.687
So I really then started
thinking about this.

00:18:56.687 --> 00:18:57.520
Well, wait a minute.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.550
We don't value the
caring professions.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.170
We don't value care.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.060
If you're somebody at the top
and you take time out for care,

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.935
you have a really hard time
getting taken seriously again

00:19:06.935 --> 00:19:08.100
and getting back in.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.782
And if you're at the bottom,
you get no support for care.

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.240
So you could say,
well, that's just

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.940
because this was women's work.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.890
Men were always ahead
of women, and men

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.380
did competitive things and
women did nurturing things.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.200
So we devalue it that way.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.840
I think it's deeper than that.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.830
I think part of it is American.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:31.260
Other societies value
caring for their elders--

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.670
let's start with that-- which
we don't value very much at all,

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.440
much more than we do.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.100
And many other societies
with extended families

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.560
value the taking care of the
parents and the children,

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.310
and the children
and the parents.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.770
So I think there's some of that.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.650
I think we are a deeply
competitive society.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.700
And I should just say,
if my brothers were here

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.460
or my husband were here,
I'm really competitive.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.440
I don't like to lose.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.810
And I play tennis every weekend,
and it's ritual humiliation

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.170
because my husband
beats me so badly.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:09.330
But I do think there's
something in our society

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.780
and the kind of embrace of work.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.390
And again, I love to work.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:18.840
But I call it the
competitive mystique.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.450
We're sports fanatics, and
that's all about competition.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.890
And so I think there's
something more to it

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.240
than that it was women's work,
but I think as a society,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.320
we are really suffering
from not valuing care.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.850
Take education as
the best example,

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:38.930
but also for middle-class
jobs, those eds and meds.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.490
Those are fast-growing sectors,
but those are not sectors

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.080
that we value and pay well.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.320
But if we want a
strong middle class,

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.350
we have to value them
and pay them well,

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.780
and we have to have men in them.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.180
You've got a chronic
shortage of nurses,

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.580
but male nurses still face
a lot of discrimination,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.440
even though in the military
men have been nurses forever.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.710
We call them core men.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:04.820
We don't call them nurses.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.890
OK, so let's change the term.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.190
But obviously, men can
take care of other men.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.520
They've been doing it forever.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.980
So I do think we need to
break open this conversation

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.390
about, what is it that we're
all about investing in ourselves

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.430
and we don't value the
people who invest in others?

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.630
KRISTEN GIL: So you
mentioned, for example,

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.447
what Finland did to try to
change the talent that they

00:21:26.447 --> 00:21:28.530
were attracting and the
value that the society was

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.411
putting on teachers.

00:21:30.411 --> 00:21:32.660
Do you think that something
like that would work here?

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.910
Do you have other policy
ideas around this space

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:35.740
to change this?

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.930
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Yeah.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:37.430
I do.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:42.020
Actually, for education, it's
easy to say and hard to do.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.950
New America does a ton
of work in education.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.510
And what you've
got to do then is

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.760
you've got to take on
the teachers' colleges.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.900
And the accreditation
of teachers' colleges

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.560
is not so easy.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.800
But we could start
by valuing teaching.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.340
So one of the things
I say in the book

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.340
is that I've stopped
asking people,

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.241
what do you do, as the first
thing that I ask anybody.

00:22:03.241 --> 00:22:05.490
I actually try to ask them,
have you read a good book?

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.830
Have you seen a good movie?

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.180
Something that implies that
there is something to life

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.850
beyond work and that
you can actually

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:15.070
be a multidimensional person,
not a unidimensional person.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.580
And I do think when people say
they're a teacher-- I actually

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.390
cite this.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:22.800
I think she's from one
of the Nordic countries.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.780
She may be Finnish.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.060
And she describes coming here.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.110
In Finland when she
says, I'm a teacher,

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.160
people treat her
with real respect.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.932
Here, if you say
you're a teacher,

00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:33.140
people look over your shoulder
and find somebody else

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:33.720
to talk to.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.190
It is not a valued profession.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.790
So we can, in fact, change that.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:41.010
And I think Teach for America
has helped change that.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.780
Top schools, a lot
of competition.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.410
But the deeper
questions are, we have

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:51.580
to see this as a social
and economic issue.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.990
And I say that the one
place that really gets this

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.630
is the military.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.200
The military has
on-site daycare.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.870
They pay early
education teachers.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.770
That means the people who are
taking care of babies, one-,

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.730
two-, and three-year-olds-- they
pay them the same as they pay

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:12.210
high school teachers, based on
education levels and experience

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:12.910
levels.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:18.580
And they understand that if we
do not invest in our children--

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.920
and we now know, and many
of you probably know,

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.890
the neuroscience shows
that you're not just

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.740
teaching kids stuff for
those first five years.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.380
You are shaping
that child's brain.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.840
You are determining
how much that child

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.150
can learn for the rest
of his or her life.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.760
And there's plenty of empirical
studies on what happens

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.360
to children who get good
care and get the right kind

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.480
of stimulation versus
kids who don't.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.690
You're baking in
the achievement gap.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:48.670
You're baking in inequality by
not valuing those first five

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:49.310
years.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.060
So if we think of it as
a national security issue

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.990
and as a competitiveness
issue, how on earth

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:58.250
are we going to
compete if we are not

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.390
taking those jobs seriously?

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.290
And I had my kids in
daycare at three months,

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.620
and I thought they got
better care than my husband

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.730
and I would give them.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.710
But alternatively, I now
think about it and think,

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.850
maybe I could have
taken a couple years

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.030
where I worked part
time, because, boy, I

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.550
know I'd be investing
more even than the best

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.490
daycare in my child.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.800
I'd be taking them to
all sorts of things.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.150
And now I look and I think, if
I'd known then what I know now,

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.712
I might have actually
retooled that.

00:24:28.712 --> 00:24:30.920
So I think that's the way
we've got to talk about it,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.290
because it is not
a women's issue.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.040
KRISTEN GIL: Yeah.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.940
I think that's exactly right.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.317
In fact, when I think about
some of the policies--

00:24:38.317 --> 00:24:40.400
I'll try to pivot us now
to what companies can do.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:40.760
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Sure.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.500
KRISTEN GIL: Let's think
a little bit about Google.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.083
But one of things
I'll share with you,

00:24:44.083 --> 00:24:46.060
which you may know
already, but we recently

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:50.060
instituted parental leave that
was the same for men and women.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:50.200
ANNE MARIE SLAUGHTER:
Yep, which is great.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.190
KRISTEN GIL: Now, there
are some differences

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.315
for women for the medical
leave portion of actually

00:24:53.315 --> 00:24:56.440
physically delivering the
baby, but after that it's

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.190
exactly the same.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.180
And it's quite generous
by American standards,

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.770
certainly not by European
standards, but very generous.

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:06.010
And I remember when
I heard about this,

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:11.370
and it was touted as
extending paternity leave, so

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.100
that it was parental leave.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.596
And I thought, well, this
is the biggest win for women

00:25:15.596 --> 00:25:17.470
everywhere, because it
isn't a women's issue.

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:21.406
And what we are as a society
assuming at the very beginning

00:25:21.406 --> 00:25:23.030
by having the notion
of maternity leave

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.670
and not a paternity leave is
that the primary caregiving

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:29.930
responsibilities are the
responsibility of the mom.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.409
So maybe we should come back
to what companies can do,

00:25:32.409 --> 00:25:34.950
but in that vein, I'd actually
like to hear a little bit more

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.860
of your personal stories
around your husband

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.830
and how he has taken that
lead-parent role, as you

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.340
both call it.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.060
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: So we
started out as co-parents,

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:49.980
and we were in
paradise for parents.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.310
Ivy League universities, wealthy
universities, are very liberal.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.680
And just as we started
having children,

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.210
they started equal paternity
and maternity leave.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.870
On top of that, you
teach in a semester.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:07.730
So I had one child in October
and the other in January.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.940
You don't teach for
that whole semester,

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.420
because that's the way it works.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.300
So we each got a semester.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.000
And we also had daycare.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.860
But it meant that one of us
was in charge for the first six

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.490
months and the second
six months of our son's

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.120
life for both kids.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.490
And what that meant was
we were really equal.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:31.280
And as I said, Andy
read all the books.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.620
He knew a lot of the research.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.230
I was more kind
of, figure it out.

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:38.160
But we were equally
competent parents.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.440
And there's no question.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.940
He could get Edward to sleep
just as well as I could.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.550
Even with breastfeeding,
still, the guy can do a lot.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:52.270
And we actually mixed it up
with breastfeeding and bottles.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.350
That was enormously important.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.490
So from the beginning,
we were co-parents.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.610
And then I became a dean.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:02.360
And Andy, at that point,
started doing more.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.377
As he wrote, I got a job that
required me to travel more

00:27:05.377 --> 00:27:06.960
and to be on other
people's schedules.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.430
So he was already the flexible
parent, but I was still there.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.400
I worked only about
a half a mile away

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.494
and I was still there.

00:27:14.494 --> 00:27:16.410
Although I would get
treated as a war criminal

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.680
when I showed up always late
for parent-teacher conferences.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.140
And Andy would always be there.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.440
And he would be what
I called the halo dad.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.470
We're doing the same
thing, but he gets the halo

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.630
because he's the dad and I
get, why aren't you hear?

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.647
Like, what's the
matter with you?

00:27:34.647 --> 00:27:36.730
But then I went into
government, and of course, he

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.940
was completely raising them.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.210
He was there five days a week.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.980
I was only there on weekends.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.770
I came home, and
then ironically,

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.490
because of the article,
I got invitations

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.320
to go all over the
country to speak.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.620
So I felt like I should go
in with hypocrite in chief.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.550
Here I am.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.480
Yes, I am in California.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.830
And yes, I left the
State Department

00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:59.910
to be home with my kids.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.690
And believe me, they know
how to push those buttons.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:03.750
They would tease me.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.520
But Andy, at that
point, became what

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.970
we describe as lead parent.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.730
And what it means is, really,
the parent who may be working

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.320
may be working full time.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.320
If you're flexible,
you can do that.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.490
But it's the parent who's there
when the unexpected happens.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:21.880
Because that is
what caregiving is.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.520
It is constantly dealing
with the unexpected.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.980
The unexpected getting sick.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:30.160
And when they start in daycare,
they're just sick all the time.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.680
The unexpected is some
problem at school,

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.090
some problem they have as
teenagers, where they really

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.310
need you to be there
to talk it out.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.290
The field trips, just all these
things that happen-- somebody

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:45.450
has to be available.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.330
And that somebody cannot be
somebody who always has to be

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.380
on a plane, or somebody who
has to beat deadlines where

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.160
there's just no give in them.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.470
So he has been the lead parent.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:56.570
And he wrote this
article in the Atlantic

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.030
called "Why I Put My
Wife's Career First."

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.010
But what he says,
and this is what

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:05.590
I think men really don't
get, or should get more,

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.740
is what he's gotten out of it.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.640
On the one hand, when our
second son goes to college,

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.660
he is going to go full
throttle on his career again.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:18.480
But he would say, he has this
extraordinary relationship

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.450
with them, much deeper than
his father had with him.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:23.900
Because in the end,
investing that much time,

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.780
even when you're
yelling at your kids

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.010
and forcing them to do
things they don't want to do,

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.690
they do grow up
and they gradually

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.150
appreciate the
fact that you were

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.960
willing to make them do that.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.140
And when we travel,
they text him.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.557
They know Dad's
going to be there.

00:29:39.557 --> 00:29:42.098
And then I text them back and
say, what's the matter with me,

00:29:42.098 --> 00:29:43.380
and why didn't you text me?

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.500
I'm very competitive.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.000
But the way I think
about it is men

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.220
are really missing
out, that this is one

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.880
of the great things about life.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.560
It's meaning and purpose, and
you're investing in your kid.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.460
And it's not always fun,
but it's totally worth it.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.980
And men at the end of
their lives look back,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.910
and their first top
regret is, I didn't

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.380
live the life I wanted
to lead but the life

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.385
that people expected me to lead.

00:30:11.385 --> 00:30:13.260
And the second is, I
didn't spend enough time

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.150
with my family.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.776
KRISTEN GIL: That's right.

00:30:15.776 --> 00:30:17.400
Can you talk just a
little bit, though,

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:23.200
about how the either
half truth or myth,

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.990
or whatever you want
to call it, of how,

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.060
but it's the mother's job?

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.310
And you make a good point
about how we actually

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.857
have to step back a little bit
and let them play their part.

00:30:33.857 --> 00:30:34.940
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Yes.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.890
So a couple of the
other half truths

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:41.510
that I try to explode, one
is, a child needs its mother,

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.700
which you hear all the time.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.630
And I say, my taxi driver
used to say it to me.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.240
And he meant it as a compliment.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.800
He meant it as, mothers
are just fabulous.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.290
I, of course, as I'm
heading to Washington,

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.380
do not necessarily hear
it as a compliment.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:00.970
But my point was, woah,
you can't get to equality

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.810
if you think a child
needs its mother more

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.010
than it needs its father.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:08.110
And my view is children
need adults who love them.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.220
Ideally, two
mothers two fathers,

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.170
one mother, one father.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.030
Preferably a whole
constructed family.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.010
We have lots of
people who we consider

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.680
to be like uncles
and aunts, who are

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.480
friends and former students.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.720
And so that's one.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.690
And the other is, a
man's job is to provide.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:27.520
It's biblical.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.940
It's in the Koran, as well.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.850
But who says that's
providing cash?

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.620
Why can't that be
providing care?

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.500
Because I provide both, and
my husband provides both.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.320
And why shouldn't we
think about it that way?

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.290
But here's the kicker.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:46.230
So this is a book that I
expect women will probably

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:47.187
pick up first.

00:31:47.187 --> 00:31:48.645
Even the most
enlightened man, this

00:31:48.645 --> 00:31:52.000
is probably not the first
book he is going to go to.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.400
I hope that the women
will read it and hand it

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.410
to the men in their
lives, very much so.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.000
But when the men
read it, there's

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.700
this one chapter
they'll hand back

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.600
to the women in their lives,
because there's a chapter that

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.870
talks about female sexism.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:09.900
And it says,
essentially, most of us

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.940
think that we really
know how to do-- we

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.120
women-- know what we're
doing at home much

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.420
more than the guy does.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.870
And I say that if you
walked into your office

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:23.990
and a guy said to you, I'm
biologically better at this,

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:29.840
but I think you can do it
if I micromanage you enough,

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.440
you would sue him.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.050
But that is the way many of
us-- and I'll include myself

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.350
until my husband just
put his foot down--

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.040
that's the way we treat our
husbands or our partners,

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.180
because we really don't
think they can do it.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.640
And when I give this speech,
in lots of audiences,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.030
people laugh, as you all just
laughed, but then somebody

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.980
raises their hand and says, but,
come on, he really can't do it.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.690
And I'm like, no, no, no.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.930
What you're saying is he's
going to do it differently

00:32:58.930 --> 00:32:59.900
than you do.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.760
And the example I
use is my husband

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.350
thought it would be a great
idea for our kids to watch

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.020
all the Marx Brothers movies.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.270
He thought this was part of
their cultural education.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.680
And so for I don't
know how many weekends,

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.877
they watched all the mark
Marx Brothers movies.

00:33:14.877 --> 00:33:16.710
And he thought it was
critical to teach them

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.790
poker and every other
game known to man.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.710
And I wouldn't have done
any of those things.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:28.290
On the other hand, let's just
say his tolerance for clutter

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:31.360
vastly exceeds mine.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.910
His notion of what they
should eat is not always mine.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.130
Although he is a much
better cook than I am.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:38.660
He has different views.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.730
And essentially, he
finally said to me, look,

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.520
I'm going to run this
household my way.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.620
If you want to do it your way,
you can come home and do it.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.170
But if I'm doing it, you're not
going to tell me how to do it.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:52.680
And at that point
I realized that I

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.840
thought that I knew
what to do because I

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.940
was raised by my mother, and
she was raised by her mother.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.890
But the flip side is business
was always done by men,

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.200
and most women I know do not
think that's automatically

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.260
the right way to do it.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.960
We think we know
how to do it, too,

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.360
and we think our way
is sometimes better.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.810
So if we're really going to do
this, women have got to let go

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:18.010
and women have really got to
examine our own, not even so

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:19.330
subconscious, bias.

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:21.652
I think a lot of times
it's conscious bias.

00:34:21.652 --> 00:34:22.610
KRISTEN GIL: It's true.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.840
It's societally programed.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.325
As you were talking, it
made me-- the first instance

00:34:28.325 --> 00:34:30.040
that I really
recall understanding

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.370
that my husband was going to
be super involved with our kids

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:34.920
was when I was pregnant.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.340
So I hadn't even had
the first child yet.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.095
And I was starting to figure out
the decorations for the baby's

00:34:40.095 --> 00:34:40.800
room.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.530
And he actually was, like, can
I actually have a say in this?

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:46.159
And it never occurred to
me that he would want to.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:49.281
I actually thought I was taking
a burden off of his plate

00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:50.530
and that I would just do this.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:52.405
And I got to tell you,
that was the beginning

00:34:52.405 --> 00:34:54.540
of many, many instances
where I realized

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.190
he wanted to be an active
and very involved parent.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.600
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: That
can create some friction.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.200
KRISTEN GIL: It definitely can.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.810
We were sharing stories
earlier about our husbands are

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:07.190
a bit more of the
disciplinarians in the family,

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:10.410
and we're perhaps
more the soft ones.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:13.080
Now, I want to get
back to companies

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.574
and what companies could do
to foster better policies.

00:35:16.574 --> 00:35:18.240
But there's a great
quote from your book

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.700
where you talk about reading
a company's flexible work

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:27.520
programs reminded you of reading
the constitution of an iron

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.390
curtain country that boast
all kinds of liberties that

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.835
are really just for show you.

00:35:32.835 --> 00:35:33.960
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: Yeah.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.335
Yes, that's one
of the few places

00:35:35.335 --> 00:35:37.830
I could get my foreign policy
background into the book.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.610
There are not a lot of
references to foreign policy.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:41.820
But exactly.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.280
Because I grew up in the Cold
War, and I was a law professor.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.970
And all these former
communist countries

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:51.560
had every right under the sun
on the books, and none of them

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.240
were practiced.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:57.160
And what you see in many
companies are liberal policies,

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.210
but if you take advantage of
them, you are stigmatized.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.250
And that is not
real flexibility.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.830
That is not real work life
accommodation in any way.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:10.330
That is saying, here
it is, and anybody

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.830
who doesn't want to be a player
can take advantage of it.

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:17.730
So that means when women
do, they are stigmatized,

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:21.320
and most men don't, for the same
reason, because then they're

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.160
knocked out.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.110
So really doing this is not
just having these policies.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:30.070
It's having senior
people, women and men,

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:34.000
take them, and really emphasize
that this is important.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.800
And I'll give you an example
from New America where

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.560
I do this.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.380
It's not maternity
or paternity leave,

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.050
although we have equal
maternity and paternity leave.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:45.490
But we have six weeks
of paid time off a year,

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:47.360
and you can use it for whatever.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.901
You can extend your
a family leave.

00:36:49.901 --> 00:36:51.400
You can use it on
whatever you want.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.150
You can go around the world.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.900
I don't care.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.150
But what I care
about is you only

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:57.920
get two weeks of
that that rolls over.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.710
So four weeks so that, if
you don't take that vacation,

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:01.730
you lose it.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.190
So you cannot just roll over
balances and cash it out.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:09.420
Because I think you will
be far better at your job

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.510
if you take four
weeks off a year.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:13.350
And I walk that walk.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:15.980
I take four to six
weeks off a year.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.530
I take four weeks in the summer.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.490
I take two weeks
certainly in the holidays.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:22.950
And I will take long
weekends frequently,

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:24.910
because I'm a very
creative person

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.570
and I've read all the
literature on creativity.

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:30.490
And I know that if
you recharge your mind

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:36.200
and expose yourself to different
sites, stimuli of all kinds,

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.720
you will be more creative.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.460
You will be better at your job.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.840
But if I just put those
six weeks out there

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.390
and didn't do it myself,
nobody's going to believe that.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:49.880
They're going to follow what
is modeled, not what is said.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.949
What are the real rules?

00:37:50.949 --> 00:37:52.490
So if you're really
going to do this,

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.540
you've got to have men,
as well as women, who say,

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.040
yep, I'm taking my
leave, and this is great,

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.310
and I'm bonding with
my kid, and I expect

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:03.850
everybody else to do the same.
