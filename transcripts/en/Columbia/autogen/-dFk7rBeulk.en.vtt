00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.940
Eliason and vishakha that we're in a
world where we're going to have to take

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:54.950
world where we're going to have to take
 

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:56.950
world where we're going to have to take
into consideration some new ways of

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960
into consideration some new ways of
 

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.330
into consideration some new ways of
doing things that doesn't mean we can't

00:47:58.330 --> 00:47:58.340
doing things that doesn't mean we can't
 

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:01.080
doing things that doesn't mean we can't
learn from Jana Larson's experience but

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:01.090
learn from Jana Larson's experience but
 

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:03.040
learn from Jana Larson's experience but
we're going to be learning more from the

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.050
we're going to be learning more from the
 

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.050
we're going to be learning more from the
future perhaps than from the past as we

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:05.060
future perhaps than from the past as we
 

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:08.800

Eliason global leaders are really a

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:13.610
Eliason global leaders are really a
 

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:15.670
Eliason global leaders are really a
remarkable group of people and I want to

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680
remarkable group of people and I want to
 

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.050
remarkable group of people and I want to
get them up on the stage very very

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:17.060
get them up on the stage very very
 

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.200
get them up on the stage very very
quickly here I think that what's

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:20.210
quickly here I think that what's
 

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:22.060
quickly here I think that what's
characteristic of me for them is that

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:22.070
characteristic of me for them is that
 

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:24.280
characteristic of me for them is that
they're not only changing our

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:24.290
they're not only changing our
 

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:28.000
they're not only changing our
perspective on how we look at some of

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:28.010
perspective on how we look at some of
 

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:30.010
perspective on how we look at some of
the most challenging issues that we face

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:30.020
the most challenging issues that we face
 

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.410
the most challenging issues that we face
as Alan Stoeger said but they're

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:32.420
as Alan Stoeger said but they're
 

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:37.150
as Alan Stoeger said but they're
changing our conception of what we need

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160
changing our conception of what we need
 

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.910
changing our conception of what we need
to be doing and that that difference is

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920
to be doing and that that difference is
 

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.610
to be doing and that that difference is
subtle but important it's also

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:41.620
subtle but important it's also
 

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.470
subtle but important it's also
interesting to see that the selection of

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480
interesting to see that the selection of
 

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.290
interesting to see that the selection of
this group of people starts with their

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:47.300
this group of people starts with their
 

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.080
this group of people starts with their
significance in their work I don't know

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:50.090
significance in their work I don't know
 

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:51.700
significance in their work I don't know
if you know and in in my life

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:51.710
if you know and in in my life
 

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:54.160

the world seems to have been divided

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:54.170
the world seems to have been divided
 

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:56.710
the world seems to have been divided
over the years from people either saying

00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720
over the years from people either saying
 

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:02.740
over the years from people either saying
oh or oh and when they say oh then I

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:02.750
oh or oh and when they say oh then I
 

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:04.510

really know that something is shifted

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:06.620
really know that something is shifted
 

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.960
really know that something is shifted
and each of these people in their own

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:07.970
and each of these people in their own
 

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:08.349

has broken through on our conception of
 

00:49:12.289 --> 00:49:14.710
has broken through on our conception of
what it is that we need to do in

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720
what it is that we need to do in
 

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.519

different fields in different

different fields in different
perspectives I think it's important that

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:19.460
perspectives I think it's important that
 

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:23.499

they all are known for their certain
 

00:49:23.509 --> 00:49:25.839
they all are known for their certain
significance but our hope is that they

like I said it was a lot of anger and
 

01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:37.250
like I said it was a lot of anger and
that was the drive anger was the drive

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.260
that was the drive anger was the drive
 

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:40.020

it's quite crazy that you walk into a

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:40.030
it's quite crazy that you walk into a
 

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:42.270

01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:42.280
pharmacy to buy medicine for your your
 

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.690

getting something that could kill the
 

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.710
getting something that could kill the
child and so anger was enough to get it

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:49.720
child and so anger was enough to get it
 

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.200

going the truth though is that anger is
 

01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:55.410
going the truth though is that anger is
not enough over the medium term and you

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:55.420
not enough over the medium term and you
 

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.180
not enough over the medium term and you
have to find other values that are

so what I found works in a decade of

01:06:41.579 --> 01:06:41.589
so what I found works in a decade of
 

01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:43.950
so what I found works in a decade of
doing this work now two things one is

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:43.960
doing this work now two things one is
 

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.070
doing this work now two things one is
very much how you leave

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:46.080

that you've been through refracted
through the lens of other people that

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720
through the lens of other people that
 

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.990
through the lens of other people that
are on the same journey and how that

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000
are on the same journey and how that
 

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.390

region is your energy the second thing

01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400
region is your energy the second thing
 

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.430
region is your energy the second thing
is also obviously the fact that we can't

01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440
is also obviously the fact that we can't
 

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.380
is also obviously the fact that we can't
have this one course no matter how

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:03.390

particular course it helps to have some
other course as well and that is why I

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:11.010
other course as well and that is why I
 

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:14.140
other course as well and that is why I
have not only done this technology work

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:14.150
have not only done this technology work
 

01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:17.450
have not only done this technology work
and to the exclusion of other way but I

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:17.460
and to the exclusion of other way but I

shape so you kind of break the form and
 

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.410
shape so you kind of break the form and
function of the object and so you can

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:49.420
function of the object and so you can
 

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:52.260

seems to me that the sort of mission of

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:45.530
seems to me that the sort of mission of
 

01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:49.920
seems to me that the sort of mission of
tall burg and the mission of of Columbia

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:49.930
tall burg and the mission of of Columbia
 

01:22:49.930 --> 01:22:53.500
tall burg and the mission of of Columbia
is sort of a paradoxical one and that is

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:53.510
is sort of a paradoxical one and that is
 

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:56.170
is sort of a paradoxical one and that is
to institutionalize progress it seems to

01:22:56.170 --> 01:22:56.180
to institutionalize progress it seems to
 

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.730
to institutionalize progress it seems to
be something that you four are trying to

01:22:57.730 --> 01:22:57.740
be something that you four are trying to
 

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:02.590
be something that you four are trying to
do in sort of disparate fields and and

and but I think that the institutions at
 

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.380
and but I think that the institutions at
work are also very tired she pointed out

01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:14.390

your question please my my question is
what are the institutions that you are

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760
what are the institutions that you are
 

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.150
what are the institutions that you are
trying to change in the fields in which

01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:22.160

initiatives institutions of progress how

01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:32.180
initiatives institutions of progress how
 

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:34.210
initiatives institutions of progress how
do you ensure that they are going to

01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:34.220
do you ensure that they are going to
 

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:35.890

continue to change
 

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:37.720
continue to change
so institutions you are changing through

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:37.730
so institutions you are changing through
 

01:23:37.730 --> 01:23:40.360
so institutions you are changing through
the work they're doing I think the

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:40.370
the work they're doing I think the
 

01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:43.000
the work they're doing I think the
biggest weakness in the global model for

biggest weakness in the global model for
 

01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:45.370
biggest weakness in the global model for
problem solving right now is that local

01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:45.380
problem solving right now is that local

amplification that is the biggest

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:51.620

problem the people that are close to the
 

01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:55.020
problem the people that are close to the
problems really know what the problem is

01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:55.030
problems really know what the problem is
 

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:57.700
problems really know what the problem is
somehow some of the solutions can only

somehow some of the solutions can only
 

01:23:57.710 --> 01:23:59.170
somehow some of the solutions can only
really make science if they operate at

made of people so I can't believe we
 

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:56.359
made of people so I can't believe we
can't change institutions like that's

01:24:56.359 --> 01:24:56.369
can't change institutions like that's
 

01:24:56.369 --> 01:24:59.870

it's especially important in this kind
 

01:25:26.639 --> 01:25:29.030
it's especially important in this kind
of political climate so just and any

01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040
of political climate so just and any
 

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.410
of political climate so just and any
like major strategies you guys have been

01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:30.420
like major strategies you guys have been
 

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:33.260
like major strategies you guys have been
doing I think the question is what works

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:33.270
doing I think the question is what works
 

01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:34.490
doing I think the question is what works
I mean one of the reasons that we're all

01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:34.500
I mean one of the reasons that we're all
 

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.979
I mean one of the reasons that we're all
here tonight is is really to take this

01:25:36.979 --> 01:25:36.989
here tonight is is really to take this
 

01:25:36.989 --> 01:25:38.180
here tonight is is really to take this
up to another level in terms of

01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:38.190
up to another level in terms of
 

01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:40.879
up to another level in terms of
visibility and understanding I'm hoping

01:25:40.879 --> 01:25:40.889
visibility and understanding I'm hoping
 

01:25:40.889 --> 01:25:42.649
visibility and understanding I'm hoping
that you'll be tweeting the minute you

01:25:42.649 --> 01:25:42.659
that you'll be tweeting the minute you
 

01:25:42.659 --> 01:25:44.540
that you'll be tweeting the minute you
get away from the microphone and that

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:44.550
get away from the microphone and that
 

01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:45.770
get away from the microphone and that
other people will be so there's

01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780
other people will be so there's
 

01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:47.660
other people will be so there's
something that we can all do to say

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:47.670
something that we can all do to say
 

01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:50.209
something that we can all do to say

let's put folks like this in the
headlines rather than other leaders that

01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:52.710
headlines rather than other leaders that
 

01:25:52.710 --> 01:25:55.220

is that
 

01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:31.270
is that
of globalization of the compression of

01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280
of globalization of the compression of
 

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.250
of globalization of the compression of
time and space but nowadays about a

01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:33.260
time and space but nowadays about a
 

01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:35.470
time and space but nowadays about a
compression of ideas sites and so it

01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:35.480
compression of ideas sites and so it
 

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.510
compression of ideas sites and so it
straight eyes TED talk things like that

01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520
straight eyes TED talk things like that
 

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.270
straight eyes TED talk things like that
I think what we have to do is get better

01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:40.280
I think what we have to do is get better
 

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.880
I think what we have to do is get better
at compressing our ideas because

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:42.890
at compressing our ideas because
 

01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:44.050
at compressing our ideas because
otherwise our gonna get a transmission

01:26:44.050 --> 01:26:44.060
otherwise our gonna get a transmission
 

01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:46.810
otherwise our gonna get a transmission
you can't keep on having you know

you can't keep on having you know
general length interactions with the

01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480
general length interactions with the
 

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.970
general length interactions with the
rest of the world and still hope to get

01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:51.980

01:29:20.469 --> 01:29:20.479
avenues in which you know fake drugs can
 

01:29:20.479 --> 01:29:23.679
avenues in which you know fake drugs can
be put into the market and can we take

01:29:23.679 --> 01:29:23.689
be put into the market and can we take
 

01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:25.089
be put into the market and can we take
