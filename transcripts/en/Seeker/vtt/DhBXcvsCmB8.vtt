00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.830
Scientist have bred new yeast strains to brew
new beers?

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.070
I’ll drink to that!

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.509
Hey all you adults of legal drinking age,
Julian here for DNews.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.230
I’m fond of beer, particularly lagers.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.860
But they’re all kind of samey, like the
difference between vanilla and french vanilla.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.200
Ales, on the other hand, come in every color
of a gold to brown rainbow and they have a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.730
big variety of flavors.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.730
Why is that?

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.020
Well to find out, first you need to know a
little history.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.980
Ale has been around for about 7,000 years
and probably started as a happy accident.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.210
Leave some barley and water out in the sun,
some airborne fungus gets in there and goes

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.210
to town on the barley’s sugars, converting
it to energy through a process called fermentation,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.360
and the waste product is alcohol.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.860
I wonder who the first guy was that was willing
to drink nasty fermented warm barley water.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.770
Probably the same guy who got the first hangover.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.560
Lagers though are much newer to the scene.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.890
They only started popping up in europe in
the 1500s, right around the time Europeans

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.769
started making trips to the new world.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.550
It’s not a coincidence: the fungus used
for fermenting lager is a hybrid of the yeast

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.000
used for ales, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and
another yeast indigenous to Argentina, Saccharomyces

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
eubayanus.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.020
It wasn’t intentional, but somehow the S.
eubayanus must have hitched a ride back to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.210
europe and mixed with the local fungus.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.650
The new yeast species, called Saccharomyces
pastorianus, needs colder temperatures to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.720
ferment sugar and at the end of fermentation
it sinks to the bottom of the mix instead

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.880
of rising to the top.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.710
Oh and it’s got 4 sets of chromosomes, making
it allotetraploid.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.810
Not necessary to know, but still pretty cool.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.189
Getting those parent species to rumble in
the fungal jungle and still make baby yeast

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.980
that are good for brewing isn’t easy though,
and it needs human help to keep propagating.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.170
The result is we’ve been making the same
strains of S. pastorianus over and over and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.670
using them for our lagers, and that’s why
most of them taste pretty much the same.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.310
So knowing this, what if we bred new yeast
for new lagers?

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.490
Researchers at the University of Leuven in
Belgium did just that.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.119
They did the microbial equivalent of putting
S. eubayanus and S. cerevisiae in a room,

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.650
lighting some candles, putting on some Marvin
Gaye, and letting nature do its thang.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.750
And do its thang they did.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.120
To quote the researcher Dr. Kevin Verstrepen,
"We were able to get some serious sexual action

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.650
between our yeasts, which resulted in hundreds
of new lager yeast strains."

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.030
Serious sexual action.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.650
Those are a PhD’s words, not mine.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.900
They tested 31 of the strains on a small scale,
and while some of them were terrible, 10 of

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.510
them performed well in terms of flavor and
fermentation speed.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.120
Verstrepen claims, “Two were magnificent.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.810
They fermented more quickly than the commercially
used reference lager yeast that we compared

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.660
them to, and they produced really nice flavors.”

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.209
I’d like to see this taken to the next logical
step.

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.550
Instead of breeding the yeast and hoping for
the best combination of genes, skip the middle

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.130
man altogether and genetically modify the
yeast.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.560
Select your favorite flavor and aroma elements
and splice them right in, why not?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.989
I’m picturing a future a hundred years from
now where hobbyists can custom make yeast

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.220
in their garage.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.400
Craft microbrewing?

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.360
Try craft microorganism brewing.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.270
I know as soon as you bring up genetically
modified food, some people freak right the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.270
geek out.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:24.769
Laci Green talks about the deal with GMOs
here.

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.670
Would you drink a beer that had been made
with genetically modified yeast?

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.739
I mean, there’s no actual yeast in it and
we’re just combining genes from yeast species

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.190
we’re already breeding together.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.430
I’d take a swig!…

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.030
But I’d do that for most beers.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.690
Anyway let me know in the comments, subscribe
for more, and I’ll see you next time on

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.230
