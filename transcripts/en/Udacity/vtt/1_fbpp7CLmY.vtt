00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now if you have paid attention so far,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I hope you have noticed that I forgotten to mention

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
one detail about the satisfiability problem so far,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and I would like you to tell me what that is.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So what do we still need to talk about?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The length of the Boolean formula that we're given as an input to SAT?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The number of variables or the number of times each variable occurs?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So only one of them is true,

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and I would like you to check the one which is true.
