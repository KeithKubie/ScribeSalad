00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
Today, we're going
to be learning

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.500
how to recycle some pallets

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.900
into a decorative wall
and some floating shelves.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:14.360
[Music]

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.600
Guys, there's a good chance
that in the past,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.300
you've seen some interesting
projects done with the wood

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.400
from shipping pallets.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.200
These things are everywhere.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.900
Pretty much anything
that's getting shipped

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.170
in large quantities gets shipped
on one of these pallets

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.422
because they're cheap to make,

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:27.780
and they're very sturdy,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.000
and they're designed
in such a way

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.180
that a forklift can manipulate
them really easily.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.200
We are in the middle
of redecorating our studio.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.212
We've got some paint up,

00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:35.900
we're in the middle
of a couple projects,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.038
and now, our next step is
to redo this wall over here.

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:42.000
This wall doesn't show up
in our videos a whole lot

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in the past.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.200
We're hoping it will do
so more in the future

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200
because we're going to try

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.000
and make it a
little more photogenic,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.320
instead of just being
a pale, off-white,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.520
tannish colored wall,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.550
it's going to be a wall made
out of pallet wood,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.932
which has a lot of character,

00:00:55.932 --> 00:00:57.600
and looks really good
in my opinion.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.100
So, we got our hands
on a bunch of these pallets.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.500
We're going to be
doing two things:

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.858
one is covering a big portion
of the wall in the pallet wood.

00:01:04.858 --> 00:01:05.800
But we also need

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.200
a good place to display
our YouTube Play Buttons.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.741
So we're going
to make some shelves,

00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:11.900
and not just shelves
with obvious visible support,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.703
we're going to make
what's called floating shelves.

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:14.363
Those are shelves

00:01:14.363 --> 00:01:16.500
where you can't really see
how it's attached to the wall

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.000
because it looks like just a box
stuck right on to the side.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.600
We're going to show you
how we're building those,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
we're going to attach it all,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.300
and then we're going
to cover that whole wall

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.171
with pallet wood.

00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:26.300
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.888
It only takes a few tools
to turn old pallets

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:29.840
into usable wood.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.045
We're going to be using
that wood to refurbish one

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:33.350
of the walls in our workshop,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.700
and make some shelves
for our YouTube Play Buttons.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.591
First up, let's take a look
at how we've prepped the wall

00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:40.083
before we put anything on it.

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:41.076
So here's the wall.

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.758
It used to be
sort of tan-colored,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.320
now, it's black,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.780
and that's what I mean
by prepping the wall.

00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:47.600
We've painted the
whole wall black.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.300
We filled in a couple of spots.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.900
There were some bullet wounds.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.300
They're not completely gone.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.300
But since we're going

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.555
to be covering this whole thing
in the pallet wood,

00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:57.180
it doesn't need
to be a 100% perfect.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200
We like the black

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.162
because pallet boards
are not perfect.

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:01.700
They don't fit 100% together,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.850
unless you're going to run
everything through a planer

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.400
and a joiner,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.092
and make it all
just finely machined,

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:07.218
and we're not doing that.

00:02:07.218 --> 00:02:08.300
We like the rustic look.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.100
So this way,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.670
when there's tiny little gaps
in the boardms or holes

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.199
or knots or something like that
and we can see through,

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:15.082
it just looks dark.

00:02:15.082 --> 00:02:18.020
You won't see the light colored
wall like shining through it.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.000
So we've gone ahead,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.897
used a fairly matte black,
covered the whole wall,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.100
and it's ready to go.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.352
The first thing we need
to do is to get all

00:02:25.352 --> 00:02:26.873
of the planks off our palates,

00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:28.800
and these planks,
these flat thin ones,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.360
that's what we're going for.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.476
And you can try
and pull them all off,

00:02:32.476 --> 00:02:34.150
but if you do that with a hammer,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.951
you're likely to start
splitting the wood.

00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:37.706
The nails don't always
like to pull out.

00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:38.656
So I actually think

00:02:38.656 --> 00:02:41.138
the best way to do it is to just
cut right down through them.

00:02:41.138 --> 00:02:43.449
I got a reciprocating saw
with a metal blade on it,

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.900
and it should make pretty
quick work of the nails.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:58.960
[Music]

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.800
I've now cut down both sides,
the left and the right,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.700
and so they're just
connected in the middles.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.300
So now I can do one
at a time with those.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.250
If while you're cutting,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.800
you realize that the board
is just really pressed up

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.380
against too hard
to fit the blade in,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.494
you can usually just grab it
and start wiggling it,

00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:17.241
and that'll pull it
away a little bit,

00:03:17.241 --> 00:03:18.800
enough to fit
the blade in better.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.480
[Music]

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.250
We've got our YouTube
Play Buttons here,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.880
and we're going to display
them in this order:

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.500
the Silver, the Gold,
and the Diamond.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.820
The Gold is the biggest
and heaviest to display.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.080
The Diamond currently
doesn't have a display case,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.474
but we're probably going to go
ahead and build one of these.

00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:39.300
It's going to be a box
fairly similar to this.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.100
It won't be as large
as the gold one.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.300
And so, we're just gonna have
some floating shelves,

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.220
one for each these.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.797
It's going to be just
a little bit wider

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.340
than each of these boxes,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.600
should be nice and supported
in studs in the wall.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.600
This one is
actually quite heavy.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.800
So we need a very sturdy shelf
that can hold that up.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.314
We may try and attach it to
the wall a little bit as well,

00:03:58.314 --> 00:04:00.300
just to make sure it's
really in there nicely.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.268
Here's the idea.

00:04:01.268 --> 00:04:03.888
We are going to start off
with this 2x3 board.

00:04:03.888 --> 00:04:07.300
A piece of this is going to
get bolted right into the wall.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.088
We're going to use
some very strong screws,

00:04:09.088 --> 00:04:09.940
going in some studs,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.728
that should give us all
the support we need.

00:04:11.728 --> 00:04:12.782
It will not be this long.

00:04:12.782 --> 00:04:14.200
This is going to be cut shorter.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.100
We're then going to use
some pallet boards,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.400
and build a box

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.600
that fits right
around this 2x3 board.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.700
So we'll have a piece there,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.940
and a piece there.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.280
We're gonna use a table
saw to cut these down

00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:30.174
so it all fits,

00:04:30.174 --> 00:04:32.250
and it is just
the exact right size.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.660
We'll measure all of this,
will take this 2x3 out.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.180
These three pieces
will be attached together

00:04:36.184 --> 00:04:38.200
after they're cut to being
just the right size.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.500
Then, this board, the 2x3,
will get mounted to the wall,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.400
and then we'll fit
this sort of box

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.820
that we've built over the 2x3,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.500
and attach it from
the top and bottom

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.000
so it's secured well.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:13.660
[Music]

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.620
Now, we're gonna use a jigsaw,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.300
and just cut right along the
pencil line that we've drawn in.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.840
[Music]

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.900
I like the depth of this one.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.945
This one's a little too big.

00:05:24.945 --> 00:05:27.000
So we're going to trim this down
so it matches this one.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.660
[Music]

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.700
These two boards do stick out

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.300
from the wall farther
than this piece.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.300
So we're just going
to add a few supports

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.900
to give a little bit
of extra strength.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:55.220
[Music]

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.460
Excellent.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.820
[Music]

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.660
Here we go.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.760
This will mount right here,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.300
got studs in the wall
here and here,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.240
and have screws right there
and right there.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.100
You know what?

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.920
Just to be extra sure,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.600
I think we're going to put two
more right here and right here

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.900
with wall anchors.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:28.420
[Music]

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.690
I've got these two holes
drilled into drywall,

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.640
and there's no stud
behind that part.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.969
This part is going
to be nice and strong,

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:35.199
this parts is not as strong.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.800
So we've got these wall anchors.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.100
They fit down
inside the plaster.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.400
And when a screw goes
inside the plastic,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.899
it actually splits the plastic
apart and deforms it,

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:51.400
making it grip into
the plaster wall a lot stronger.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.517
So each of these is rated
up to 15 pounds of strength.

00:06:54.517 --> 00:06:56.000
Two of them should give me 30,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.300
then added that into
the strength of the screws

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.448
that are going to the studs,

00:06:59.448 --> 00:07:01.500
this should be able to hold
the weight, no problem.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.200
We've got these two
screws lined right up

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.700
with those in the wall.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:35.300
[Music]

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.090
Lovely.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.104
Now, we're just going to use
two fairly small screws

00:07:39.104 --> 00:07:40.400
in through the bottom,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.100
attaching this whole box
onto the support

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.200
that's in the wall.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.426
That should hold it in place.

00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:47.594
All of the weight
gets distributed into the shelf,

00:07:47.594 --> 00:07:48.700
which is nice and strong,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.300
and it's really hard to see
how it's being held up.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.800
That's what makes
it a floating shelf.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.900
Now, to be honest,

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.600
even though we've got
this cool shelf,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600
we are going to add

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.320
a little bit of reinforcement
in the form of hooks

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.500
that attach to these things.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.200
Because while I am confident

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.800
that the shelf
can take the weight,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.539
this is a little bit top-heavy,

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:09.400
so if anything bumped it,
it could fall off forward.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.700
So, not so much to hold it up.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.860
As to hold it back,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.758
we are going to
have hooks attached.

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:17.890
Once we've got
the whole pallet wall up,

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.057
we'll attach a couple of those,

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.300
and that will stop
it from ever...

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.320
diving off.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.400
With our shelves in place,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.834
it's time to actually start
putting in the pallet boards

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:27.071
all the way over this wall.

00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:28.400
This is actually pretty easy.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.135
We've got a nail gun
with 18 gauge finishing nails.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.200
We're just going to be using
those right into the boards.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.160
We place these in a row.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.320
We're going to do a full row
of boards all the way across.

00:08:38.325 --> 00:08:39.800
Before we start going up at all.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.200
That way, we can make sure
that the entire row is

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.041
the same width of board.

00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:44.930
That's gonna make it
a lot easier to get everything

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:45.800
to fit together nicely.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:09:09.020
[Music]

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.200
Guys, our wall is complete.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.339
It's looking great.

00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:14.800
We got the whole pallet
wall all built up.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.100
We've got the floating shelves.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.101
We've got the YouTube Play
Buttons on the shelves.

00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:21.000
I'm loving how this is looking.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.600
It turned out super good,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.300
and it's going to be really nice
to have this sort of contrast

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.590
to the look of everything
else we've got in the studio.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.800
Pallet walls is a pretty easy
and fast to build,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.077
relative to a lot
of other things.

00:09:31.077 --> 00:09:32.509
There are some things
you should know.

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:33.600
You probably don't want

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.979
to put them in like
any kids bedrooms or stuff.

00:09:35.979 --> 00:09:37.168
So, this is a workshop.

00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:39.625
Not a lot of reckless kids
going to be down here

00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:41.936
trying to climb on the walls
and licking stuff.

00:09:41.936 --> 00:09:44.600
So, it's a good place
in my opinion for a pallet wall,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.500
and I'm really happy
with how this turned out.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.853
This has been
a super fun project,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.500
and I'm so glad you got
to watch this with us.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.700
If you do end up making
any of these shelves,

00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:53.843
or especially the pallet wall,
we want to see it.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:54.600
So take pictures,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.580
and tag us on Instagram
and Twitter @TheKingofRandom.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.500
Guys, that's not all.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.734
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.500

is going to take you directly

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.194
to our last video.

00:10:03.194 --> 00:10:04.279
You should go check that out.

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:05.199
The other box shows you

00:10:05.199 --> 00:10:07.070
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.756
And you've got this bomb
here in the middle.

subscribed to the channel,

00:10:10.473 --> 00:10:12.700
and that way, you're never going
to miss out on a cool video.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.746

notified about it,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.122
and we'll see you
