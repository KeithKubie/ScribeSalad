00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.779
&gt;&gt; I think the 2010 World Cup in South Africa
is all about economic participation for Africans

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.719
and that's why we at CNBC Africa view the
2010 World Cup in South Africa as an important

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.480
moment on this continent that shows that economic
participation is a right it's not just a priviledge.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.180
And Africans can show on the global scale
that they can present it and they will host

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.910
it properly and efficiently and professionally.
And Africans will win at the end of the day

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.510
economically.
