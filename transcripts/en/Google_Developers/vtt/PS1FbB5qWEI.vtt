JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
This is how users

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.450
search the web on the desktop.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.810
And this is how many users
search on mobile, OK, Google.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.880
In fact, a recent study
shows that 55% of teens,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.129
and 41% of adults, already use
Voice Search more than once

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.120
per day.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.750
At Google we always
look for innovative ways

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.900
to help you improve
mobile search

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.660
and drive user engagement
back to your app.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.400
Let's see a few examples.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.210
When I'm ready to
plan a Hawaii trip

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.480
I can say, OK Google, search for
hotels in Maui on TripAdvisor.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.230
That's right, the search took me
directly to the app on my phone

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.130
rather than the website.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.750
To get in the vacation mood,
let's try ordering some pizza.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.580
OK Google, search for
Hawaiian pizza on Eat24.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.070
That's pretty yummy.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.650
All I need now is
some Hawaiian tunes.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.200
OK Google, search for
Hawaiian music on TuneIn.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.260
As you can see,
TripAdvisor, Eat24, TuneIn,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.210
and many other apps allow their
users to search using voice.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.860
They have integrated
a feature called

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.880
Google Now actions
and so can you.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.580
Google Now actions allow
you to take advantage

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.050
of Google's speech
recognition technology

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.610
to understand natural
language and turn it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.930
into Android intents
delivered to your app.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.600
In order to enable voice
search in your app,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.360
declare an intent filter
in your AndroidManifest.xml

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.030
with a Google Now search action,
as shown in this example.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.140
Once you make these
changes to your manifest,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.940
you'll search activity, we'll
receive the search action

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.950
intent.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.660
The intent will contain
a search manager

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.770
query extra with
the exact search

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.184
expression spoken by the user.

00:01:40.184 --> 00:01:42.600
It's up to you to provide the
actual search implementation

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.320
in your app.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.180
For example, using the on
device SQLite and FTS3.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.270
A few simple changes to your
app will let your users search

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.960
using voice, using
Google Now actions.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.600
