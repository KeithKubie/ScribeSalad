00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.430
 
I think the general principles of

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
I think the general principles of
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.720
I think the general principles of
philanthropy are that giving the money

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730
philanthropy are that giving the money
 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.840
philanthropy are that giving the money
is not what's important it's actually

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850
is not what's important it's actually
 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.420
is not what's important it's actually
what the money enables you to do and the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430
what the money enables you to do and the
 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.759
what the money enables you to do and the
idea is that the money stimulates

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
idea is that the money stimulates
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.189
idea is that the money stimulates
development so what what we have to do

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
development so what what we have to do
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.230
development so what what we have to do
is we have to invest these resources in

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240
is we have to invest these resources in
 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.500
is we have to invest these resources in
in solutions to these very difficult

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510
in solutions to these very difficult
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.990
in solutions to these very difficult
social problems that are first of all

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
social problems that are first of all
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.270
social problems that are first of all
that are implementable and scalable so

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280
that are implementable and scalable so
 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.840
that are implementable and scalable so
you know we don't want to create little

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850
you know we don't want to create little
 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.400
you know we don't want to create little
projects that are wildly successful but

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
projects that are wildly successful but
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.229
projects that are wildly successful but
they cost you know one hundred thousand

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239
they cost you know one hundred thousand
 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.290
they cost you know one hundred thousand
dollars per person benefited we've got

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
dollars per person benefited we've got
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.200
dollars per person benefited we've got
it we've got to find ways of doing

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
it we've got to find ways of doing
 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.600
it we've got to find ways of doing
things that are scalable we've got to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
things that are scalable we've got to
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.520
things that are scalable we've got to
find ways of doing things that can be

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
find ways of doing things that can be
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.619
find ways of doing things that can be
implemented and I also believe that that

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
implemented and I also believe that that
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.649
implemented and I also believe that that
that that the best philanthropy that

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
that that the best philanthropy that
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.080
that that the best philanthropy that
could be invested is philanthropy that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
could be invested is philanthropy that
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.240
could be invested is philanthropy that
starts to work out and prove some of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
starts to work out and prove some of
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.250
starts to work out and prove some of
these models of value that I was that I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260
these models of value that I was that I
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.120
these models of value that I was that I
was talking about so again when enough

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
was talking about so again when enough
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.070
was talking about so again when enough
for sources you can solve almost

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
for sources you can solve almost
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.719
for sources you can solve almost
anybody's problem you can give them all

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
anybody's problem you can give them all
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.399
anybody's problem you can give them all
the food they need you give them housing

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
the food they need you give them housing
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.859
the food they need you give them housing
you can give them you know how you can

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
you can give them you know how you can
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.109
you can give them you know how you can
you pay for the health care you can

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
you pay for the health care you can
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.840
you pay for the health care you can
provide free medicine you can but but

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
provide free medicine you can but but
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.030
provide free medicine you can but but
that's not sustainable yeah what you've

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
that's not sustainable yeah what you've
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740
that's not sustainable yeah what you've
got to do is you've got to find ways of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
got to do is you've got to find ways of
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.219
got to do is you've got to find ways of
equipping people with the skills and the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
equipping people with the skills and the
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.200

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
and the access to to you create their
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.190
and the access to to you create their
own solutions to their own problem and

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200
own solutions to their own problem and
 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.830
own solutions to their own problem and
that that sometimes that means some some

different kind of investments so I worry

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
different kind of investments so I worry
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.420
different kind of investments so I worry
that i worry about philanthropist who

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
that i worry about philanthropist who
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.700
that i worry about philanthropist who
who are 22 caring and 22 focused on

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
who are 22 caring and 22 focused on

Gates Foundation i think is starting

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920
Gates Foundation i think is starting
 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.680
Gates Foundation i think is starting
to come into its own in terms of

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690
to come into its own in terms of
 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.570
to come into its own in terms of
understanding that its greatest

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580
understanding that its greatest
 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.089
understanding that its greatest
contribution is is about ideas it's not

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099
contribution is is about ideas it's not
 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.309
contribution is is about ideas it's not
the money it's the ideas it's it's

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319

sustainable models that then they can

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030
sustainable models that then they can
 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.420
sustainable models that then they can
they can scale but others can't get can

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430
they can scale but others can't get can
 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.729
they can scale but others can't get can
join so I don't know if that answers

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739
join so I don't know if that answers
 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.920
join so I don't know if that answers
exactly your the question of how you

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930
exactly your the question of how you
 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.680
exactly your the question of how you
would give this kind of a vast resource

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690
would give this kind of a vast resource
 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.590
would give this kind of a vast resource
but it's it's certainly the answer that

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600
but it's it's certainly the answer that
 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.170
but it's it's certainly the answer that
that i would i would give i would also

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180
that i would i would give i would also
 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.670
that i would i would give i would also
say that there's a tremendous tennessee

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680
say that there's a tremendous tennessee
 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.650
say that there's a tremendous tennessee
and flan to be for example in health

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660
and flan to be for example in health
 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.820
and flan to be for example in health
care to give the money for the science

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830
care to give the money for the science
 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.130
care to give the money for the science
you know to fund that researcher who's

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
you know to fund that researcher who's
 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.270
you know to fund that researcher who's
going to come up with that cure for

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280
going to come up with that cure for
 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.210
going to come up with that cure for
cancer but i think we equally we have to

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220
cancer but i think we equally we have to
 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.789
cancer but i think we equally we have to
understand that that that that some of

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799
understand that that that that some of
 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.190
understand that that that that some of
the most important problems of human

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200
the most important problems of human
 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.780
the most important problems of human
society are not so much about the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790
society are not so much about the
 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.850
society are not so much about the
scientific where the technical or the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860
scientific where the technical or the
 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.100
scientific where the technical or the
tools but they're about the application

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110
tools but they're about the application
 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.710
tools but they're about the application
and and so i guess i'd like to see more

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720
and and so i guess i'd like to see more
 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.440
and and so i guess i'd like to see more
i would put more if i had it of

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450
i would put more if i had it of
 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.410
i would put more if i had it of
resources into those areas
