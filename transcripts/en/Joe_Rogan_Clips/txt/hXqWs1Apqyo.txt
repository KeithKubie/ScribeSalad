Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. I think it's like that with the anything where you're moving your body is a unit martial arts stuff or anything you better as you, as you get older in particular, you'd better be really aware of all the moving parts. When you're a kid, you could just fucking hit the gas. When you hit 50 you better be, you know you're swinging a tennis racket or something like that. You better be aware of your shoulders and your knees. He got where have all these moving parts. How old are you? 51 51 well, why wait for 62 I'm not waiting. What's up? Here's Tiger Tiger's back injury or back surgeries. Oh No. He had another one. I, this isn't like yesterday or anything, but it's from a year or two. Why is announced that he had undergone anterior Lumbar interbody fusion? Oh, that's fusing his Dick's. Many thought. Many thought his disc, excuse me.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Hello Roy in jail. Many thought that is competitive golf career was over and his fourth surgery since March of 2014 which involved removing the l five s one intervertebral disc fusion material to connect the l five and s one vertebral. What? Oh my God. All those apparently recovered quite well from the operation. That surgery is quite rare amongst professional golfers. One of the PGA player deadly heart had also had, had a fusion in the same location as woods fucking fusions. Rough man, that means there's no disk left. Right. And he won the uh, uh, uh, the whatever they call the Fedex Cup, the last tournament of the year, last year, tiger wanted. And so he came back from that and that's incredible. Oh, it is amazing. And I was there, uh, is it East Lake and Atlanta and uh, and I do all their, uh, all their charity stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:51          That's the footage of him going up the 18th green. He's about to win this thing. And this is the, the top 30 golfers in the, on the PGA tour, which is the toughest tour. There is all these people, Jazz. And now it's a major in sport that everybody gets some run on the field and follow him. Right. Walk right next to them. There's no crowd control there. Have No, I was right up there that was right up there above this green. Uh, cause I, I walked with him cause I get to go inside the ropes so, and uh, and I followed it. A couple of choked. It didn't matter. This is the one who needs right here, the Shortland. Yup. Yeah. They get a two shot lead going into that and that's it. And they won and he won the whole thing. Yeah. And that was the comeback.

Speaker 1:          02:33          You know, that was the comeback that people said would never happen that you would never, not, especially at this level. That's a hard tournament to win. I mean that's uh, that's tough. Tufts up tiger's back tiger's back. I love it. The require a lot from people. You know, if, if they get some strange along the way that guys, he's, he, he got it rough after his whole divorce and the sex scandal. Me, he had it rough for long time. People were coming after him. But the thing is about those back surgeries is a wonder why they did the fusion. Cause I think they do articulate and discs now. It seemed to be very effective at I, you know, I think he tried, we have to get yet, well he had four so cause people are uh, I know a few people that are doing those.

Speaker 1:          03:25          Um, they've got those discs down. They put like a titanium movable disk basically takes the place of the disk that's in your back. Eddie Bravo had that done. What is it that, you know, I play all these um, okay. Pro Ams increasing golfers performance via via and anterial approach is that it spares the large muscles of the back that are critical to golf swing, which potentially makes the recovery for athletes athletes a bit easier. Huh. I would imagine whoever was looking at Tiger's back was about the best person in the world to be looking at it. So I'm sure they would have, he had a pretty big budget for it. Yeah. I mean you would want, I mean they must've like really calculated it. That was the best move was maybe, um, if they put an artificial disc, you would, he would move funny. I'm good. I don't know, man. That whole the back things were rough. One, you ever had any back problems? I don't have a lot of any kind of problems except that little alcohol thing that I got going that little squeaker and uh, and, but I play golf with guys in these pro am's and most of them are, you know, football, basketball players, and most of them are around my age and most of them are in pain. You know, it what? It turns out, smoking pot, watching cartoons. Good for your knees.
