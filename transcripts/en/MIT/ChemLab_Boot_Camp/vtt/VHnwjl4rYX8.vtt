00:00:01.428 --> 00:00:02.380
HANSOL: Hey!

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.810
Time for lab.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.125
PHIL: This is probably the
hardest experiment, so--

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:38.040
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.550
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.740
NARRATOR: So far in 5.301, the
students have learned many of

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.000
the techniques that organic
chemists use every day.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.720
Today they'll learn column
chromatography.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.430
It's the last technique before
their original research

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.460
project next week.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.900
They are growing more
comfortable in the lab, but

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.824
Phil puts their new-found
confidence in perspective.

00:01:00.824 --> 00:01:03.200
PHIL: On an average
day in my life,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.340
I'll set up two reactions.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.720
I'll do two extractions
and run two columns.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.000
So when you think about all the
things that you've done

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.550
over the past two weeks, the
goal is, essentially, to be

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.940
able to do all of
that in one day.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.276
5.301 CLASS: One,
two,three, chem!

00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:22.924
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:24.790
NARRATOR: And so it begins.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.805
But packing and running
a column is not easy.

00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:31.370
PHIL: Yeah, ideally for this
experiment, you would have one

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.810
mentor mentoring each student.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.710
TENGFEI: I'm so nervous
for them.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.790
DAN: Feifei made me
feel like this lab

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.330
is much more difficult.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.090
IKE: Hopefully, it's not as bad
as they say it will be.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.970
NARRATOR: Column chromatography
is another way

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.610
to separate mixtures.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.110
The students first pack the
column with a special powder.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.830
Then, they load the
mixture on top.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.480
The target molecule is
benzylacetone, and it's

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.690
contaminated with guaiazulene,
a dark blue impurity.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.790
As the mixture is washed down
the column, the target sticks

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.950
to the solid powder more
strongly than the contaminant,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.110
so the mixture separates into
two narrow bands which come

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.930
out of the column at
different times.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.540
As the TAs thought, everyone
is stumbling over the first

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.010
simple step.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.330
And the problems just
keep coming.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.505
FRED: The sand staticed itself
all the way up my column, blew

00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:23.161
it out the top and
into my face.

00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:24.604
TENGFEI: Yeah, this is better.

00:02:24.604 --> 00:02:24.844
[Inaudible]

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:26.050
is on the ball.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.420
ANTHONY: I should have turned
off the air, but it keeps

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.070
going down.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.210
So the air's not on?

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.900
ROO-RA: Yeah.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.440
PROFESSOR: That's not good.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.810
If there's bubbles in there,
you're in trouble.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.760
ROO-RA: It's barbaric.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.130
TENGFEI: You're really bad.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.430
NARRATOR: How do the students
deal with the pressure?

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.234
PHIL: And so the silica
gel does not...

00:02:44.234 --> 00:02:45.230
[Glass breaking].

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.847
NARRATOR: They break stuff,
lots of stuff.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.920
How do the TAs deal
with the pressure?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.840
Feifei gets giddy.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.286
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:57.990
TENGFEI: Like in Chinese
tradition--

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.380
ANTHONY: If we pour together?

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.670
TENGFEI: Yeah.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.250
ANTHONY: What does it mean?

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.900
TENGFEI: When you are
getting married.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.090
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.000
ANTHONY: I'm getting married,
apparently.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.330
Take two cups and pour them into
each other-- you wait.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.440
Thank you, finally.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.710
Are you sure that was
10 mililiters?

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.210
ROO-RA: Yes.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.840
ANTHONY: Don't steal my--

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.020
(SINGING) The whole day
through, just an old--

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.250
I'm not going to do
that right now.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.870
No.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.401
She keeps me grounded.

00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:30.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.130
NARRATOR: And Phil?

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.320
Phil just goes rogue.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.255
PHIL: You could, like...There
are some people I

00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:38.814
would love to [BLEEP]

00:03:38.814 --> 00:03:39.808
poke with this.

00:03:39.808 --> 00:03:42.790
Just like poke the [BLEEP]

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.772
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:45.772 --> 00:03:47.760
ANTHONY: This is exactly
what I want, right?

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.180
PHIL: Yeah.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.130
FRED: I'm finally finished.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.230
IKE: Yeah, this collected
my stuff.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.500
NARRATOR: But in end, everyone
runs a great column and

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.080
purifies their product.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.560
ANTHONY: My sample is pure.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.175
There are no other peaks where
there shouldn't be peaks.

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:03.820
LINA: Actually, I think my
favorite experiment was the

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.400
flash chromatography.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.270
ANTHONY: Even though it was
hard, I felt like, I don't

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.510
know, like a chemist, almost.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.730
HANSOL: I liked watching the
column and putting the air

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.190
pressure down.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.670
And I loved switching
the tubes.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.620
It was so fun.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.040
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.880
ANTHONY: Oh, I'm not
wearing my goggles.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.910
That's bad.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.960
I really should have been
wearing my goggles that day.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.500
There's no excuse.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:40.875
