the same kinds of problems and started
to think about the risk that was

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
to think about the risk that was
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.730

started talking about that and we
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.160
started talking about that and we
decided that we would try to do

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
decided that we would try to do
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630

Africa that probably doesn't begin with
 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.290
Africa that probably doesn't begin with
a number as a target but it begins with

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300
a number as a target but it begins with
 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.180
a number as a target but it begins with
a mindset and sort of thinking about

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190
a mindset and sort of thinking about
 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.830
a mindset and sort of thinking about
what do you have to get people to start

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840
what do you have to get people to start
 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.190
what do you have to get people to start
feeling and thinking and doing to move

feeling and thinking and doing to move
 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.540
feeling and thinking and doing to move
in the direction of saying there should

in the direction of saying there should
 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.450
in the direction of saying there should
be a target and so helping people to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460
be a target and so helping people to
 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.820
be a target and so helping people to
understand how these weapons play a role

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830
understand how these weapons play a role
 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.820
understand how these weapons play a role
in Africa's problems how they enable a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830
in Africa's problems how they enable a
 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.150
in Africa's problems how they enable a
lot of the fear they enable things like

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160
lot of the fear they enable things like
 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.060
lot of the fear they enable things like
poaching grape they enable genocide they

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070
poaching grape they enable genocide they
 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.400
poaching grape they enable genocide they
enable conflict at a scale that's much

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410
enable conflict at a scale that's much
 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.170
enable conflict at a scale that's much
greater than Africa knew before they

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180
greater than Africa knew before they
 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.780
greater than Africa knew before they
were present and I think if we can draw

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790
were present and I think if we can draw
 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.699
were present and I think if we can draw
down some of the numbers and demonstrate

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709
down some of the numbers and demonstrate
 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.710
down some of the numbers and demonstrate
that it's possible and show people what

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720
that it's possible and show people what
 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.270
that it's possible and show people what
kind of difference it makes and in

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280
kind of difference it makes and in
 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.270
kind of difference it makes and in
someone's life that weapons are being

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280
someone's life that weapons are being
 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.550
someone's life that weapons are being
removed then we can start to attract

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.949
