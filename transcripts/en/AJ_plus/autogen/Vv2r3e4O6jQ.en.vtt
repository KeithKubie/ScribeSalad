professional training and it was like

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
professional training and it was like
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.930

hey I'm coding with a bunch of my

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940

this area and credibility was a function
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.229
this area and credibility was a function
of how well do I know this person and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
of how well do I know this person and
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.420
of how well do I know this person and
you know that's one of the reasons

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
you know that's one of the reasons
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670
you know that's one of the reasons
that's contributing to this very slanted

well there are women coders there are

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
well there are women coders there are
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.410
well there are women coders there are
women in the industry but I think a lot

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
women in the industry but I think a lot
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.490
women in the industry but I think a lot
of them get overlooked because you know

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
of them get overlooked because you know

again it's this it's this old boys club

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
again it's this it's this old boys club
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.580
again it's this it's this old boys club
right but there's also this you know

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
right but there's also this you know
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.749
right but there's also this you know
there's this idea in the tech industry

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
there's this idea in the tech industry
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.850
there's this idea in the tech industry
that a lot of what the tech industry

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
that a lot of what the tech industry
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100
that a lot of what the tech industry
does is based on this meritocracy right

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
does is based on this meritocracy right
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.740
does is based on this meritocracy right
like like it's you know what you do not

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
like like it's you know what you do not
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.899
like like it's you know what you do not
necessarily like what you present but

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
necessarily like what you present but
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.520
necessarily like what you present but
the reality of it is is like that that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
the reality of it is is like that that
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.980
the reality of it is is like that that
meritocracy it still has this set of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
meritocracy it still has this set of
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.319
meritocracy it still has this set of
rules that's like that's based on what

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
rules that's like that's based on what
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.679
rules that's like that's based on what
people perceive of you and the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
people perceive of you and the
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.140
