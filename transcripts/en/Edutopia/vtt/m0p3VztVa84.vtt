00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:03.724
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: Throughout the next month,
you're going to practice one paragraph.

00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:07.097
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: Motivation
has a great deal to do

00:00:07.097 --> 00:00:09.902
with the belief that
we can be successful.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.678
So what does a grade do to motivation?
It can shut it down pretty quickly,

00:00:17.577 --> 00:00:20.671
especially when children
are learning something new.

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:28.076
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: Okay, so we're
going to take five minutes

00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:30.741
to workshop and organize our writing.

00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:33.017
I'm not going to grade anything.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:36.899
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: When a grade is
issued, a decision has been made.

00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:40.512
The grade becomes definitive.

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:44.015
So a lot of the teachers at King
Middle School use delayed grading.

00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:48.437
If you were teaching someone to
swim, you might not throw them

00:00:48.437 --> 00:00:50.413
in the deep end and have them swim.

00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:52.938
You would start in the shallow end

00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:55.253
and you would practice
and practice and practice.

00:00:55.373 --> 00:00:57.499
It is a great way to
just give them fluency

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.200
and comfort with the writing process.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.700
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: I am not assessing
your spelling, capitalization,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.380
grammar or punctuation at this point.

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.204
I'm waiting until the end of the unit.

00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:17.390
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: I'll say, "I'm
just worried about your mind,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.486
heart and your gut. Put
it on the paper."

00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:23.748
I can then get to the thinking
and the ideas and the details

00:01:23.748 --> 00:01:26.093
that they're trying to
practice using in their writing.

00:01:26.782 --> 00:01:31.932
&gt;&gt;Masoumeh: It's real and true
that some people die in Syria.

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:34.956
&gt;&gt;Masoumeh: Sometimes, when I
write something, it's, like,

00:01:34.956 --> 00:01:37.701
"Is this right? Is this right?"
It makes me nervous about it.

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:41.224
It's good when she says,
"Don't worry about spelling."

00:01:41.513 --> 00:01:44.897
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: The teacher is
both allowing these English learners

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.460
to feel that they can be
competent because they're writing

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.174
about themselves, which is
something they know well,

00:01:51.574 --> 00:01:56.763
and she's also reducing their anxiety
and their fearfulness about the use

00:01:56.763 --> 00:02:01.514
of the language by putting grading
aside and really enabling them

00:02:01.614 --> 00:02:06.594
to just become fluent before they
learn all of the conventions.

00:02:06.864 --> 00:02:11.694
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: At the end of the unit, I
need to see the entire writing process.

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:15.098
We're going to be handing it back and
forth as you continue to make progress

00:02:15.098 --> 00:02:18.341
in your academic writing until
we're ready to make it into poetry.

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:23.322
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: In the practice
and in the problem solving

00:02:23.322 --> 00:02:26.056
and in the troubleshooting,
they get a chance to look

00:02:26.056 --> 00:02:30.468
at where their work didn't go well
or where they didn't meet the target.

00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:34.540
Then they get to rework
it and revise it.

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:39.580
&gt;&gt;Masoumeh: She says, "I love your
mistakes. It's okay to make mistakes.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.975
By mistake, you can learn more."

00:02:42.404 --> 00:02:43.323
She's a good teacher.

00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:47.824
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: This teacher wants
children to embrace the process

00:02:48.183 --> 00:02:52.146
of figuring something out and
making it better, and to enjoy that.

00:02:52.724 --> 00:02:56.487
So these kids, had they been
graded early, it would've shut

00:02:56.557 --> 00:02:59.491
down that effort instead
of opening it up.
