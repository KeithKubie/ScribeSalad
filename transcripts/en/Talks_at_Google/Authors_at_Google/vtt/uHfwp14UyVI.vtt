SUSAN JANE GILMAN: Hi.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.830
I'm Susan Jane Gilman.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.510
Thank you for coming to "The Ice
Cream Queen of Orchard Street."

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.970
I'm going to speak today a
bit about the creative process

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.010
because "The Ice Cream
Queen of Orchard Street"

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.990
is my fourth book, but
it's my first novel.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.880
I always intended
to be a novelist,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.260
but it took me about
30 years to get here.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.600
My first books were
nonfiction, and they came out

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.980
of a very different
place than "The Ice Cream

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.380
Queen" I've wanted to
be a novelist since I

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.690
was eight years old.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.700
I used to buy little
notebooks at the dime store

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.440
and divide them in half
and write the story on top

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.670
and illustrate
them on the bottom.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.030
And I wrote my first
novel at age nine.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.490
It was called "Bunny House."

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.987
It was about Bobby
and Bonnie Bunny

00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:49.820
and how they wanted to
convince their mother

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.360
to buy them chocolate
covered carrots.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.510
And I was so sure
the way you can

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.140
when you are only nine years
old that the world might believe

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.420
there were these
anthropomorphized rabbits

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.600
running around that I wrote
at the beginning of the book,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.330
"This is fiction.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.800
I made this up.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.070
None of it is real."

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.080
I find myself now into my fourth
book having to tell people,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.310
"This is fiction.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.480
I made this up.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.080
It's not real."

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.540
It's an immigrant story
and historic story,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.830
and people have tended
to think of it as fact.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.790
I've been getting angry emails.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.930
That this woman does
not exist, that they

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.050
have googled Dunkle's
Ice Cream and they

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.640
can't find it anywhere.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.446
I am a liar.

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:32.820
So I want to go
back a little bit

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.290
and tell you how this came
about, because ironically

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.140
my other books were nonfiction.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.570
I always assumed that
I would write stories,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.000
that I would make up stories the
way I loved to do as a child.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.040
But as I grew up
and became a writer,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.920
I kept getting distracted
by things in our culture.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.730
I set out to write
the Great American

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.200
Novel-- or the mediocre
American novel.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.470
I would just be
happy with a novel--

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.560
when I broke up with a
young man I was living with

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.380
and did not want to marry.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.970
And somebody sent
me a book called

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.710
"The Rules: Time-Tested Tips
for Capturing the Heart of Mr.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.800
Right."

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.390
And the rules essentially
urge young women

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.120
to act like diet soda.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.010
Be artificially sweet and bubbly
for the rest of your life,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.360
and you can trick a
man into marrying you.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.020
And I said to some
friends of mine,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.870
there out to be a book about
catching a life, not a husband.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.200
Something that helps us
deal with all the messages

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.050
we get as women, such
as the fact that people

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.604
say that our bodies are more
important than our brains.

00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:36.020
How do you deal
with relatives who

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.240
are putting pressure
on you to get married?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.750
How do you treat your friends?

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.810
How do you gain political
power, negotiate a salary,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.460
all the things that
are important to us

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.000
as young women that
will empower us.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.930
But it has to be
funny, and it has

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.380
to be short because we're busy.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.400
And they looked at me and they
said, well, you're the writer.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.170
You go ahead and write it.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.790
And I'd been working on a
precious book of short stories.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.030
I'd been working on the novel.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.150
But this was the book that sort
of resonated with publishers.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.920
And before I knew it,
I had a best seller.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.110
It was called
"Kiss My Tiara: How

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.850
to Rule the World as
a SmartMouth Goddess."

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.230
So then, OK, I sat down.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.780
I'm going to write the novel,
and September 11 happened.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.040
I'm a native New Yorker.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.950
My whole family was here except
my husband and I at that time

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.250
were in Washington, DC.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.350
And it was a very bad day.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.590
And afterwards, the only
thing I wanted to read

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.650
were true stories but funny
stories, light stories,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.580
something that kept me
from having to take Xanax

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.700
and that gave me
hope in humanity.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.620
And yet when I read the books
that young women were writing,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.455
all these memoirs were about
being single or going shopping.

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:47.700
And I thought, my god,
there's so much more

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.610
to our lives than that.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.090
And so I got the genesis
for my next book, which

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.740
was called "Hypocrite in
a Pouffy White Dress."

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.710
I wrote all of my
misadventures growing up.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.000
I was raised by urban hippies in
New York City, where I grew up

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.560
sort of the one white kid in an
all Puerto Rican neighborhood.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.330
We had to follow a
Maharishi under my parents.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.270
I then chased the Rolling
Stones and dined with them.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.600
And of course all of this led to
my working for the US Congress.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.990
And I put all of these
stories in a book.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.600
And when that became a best
seller, I said, OK, now.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.030
Now I'm going to
write the novel.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.590
I'd actually had an idea,
which was based, again,

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.490
on something that I had
lived through myself.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.175
When I was 21 years old
and I got out of college,

00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:34.750
a friend of mine and
I in a drunken night

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.600
at a pancake house
came up with a plan

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.220
that only two drunk
21-year-olds at an IHOP

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.790
could come up with, which
was to travel the world based

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.880
on the placemat at
the International

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.520
House of Pancakes.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.230
And we thought, we're going
to plan this epic trip,

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.400
and we're going to start
where nobody we know

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.110
has gone before, in the
People's Republic of China.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.430
Now, China at that time--
this was in the late '80s--

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.110
would be the
equivalent of deciding

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.260
to go to backpack through
North Korea today.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.980
It was a country
that up until then

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.930
had really been in lock down.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.290
There were no direct flights.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.740
There were no
direct phone lines.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.820
It was a great mystery
to most people.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.680
But we decided we were young.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.270
We were educated.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.380
How hard could this be?

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.820
And we found out.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.560
We arrived in China not
speaking any Mandarin.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.170
We hadn't even looked at a map.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.660
And we found ourselves
quickly over our heads.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.080
We were under government
surveillance most of the time.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.070
Every time we stopped on the
street, they hadn't seen us.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.120
Chinese people had not seen
Westerners tromping through,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.080
and me in an '80s cut-off sweat
shirt with rhinestone earrings.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.910
And we were the freak show.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.505
And so whenever we would just
stoop down to tie our shoe

00:05:52.505 --> 00:05:54.130
or to get something
out of our pockets,

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.540
we'd get crowds of
people around us.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.910
So we're constantly watched.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.870
And we were hungry,
because unbeknownst to us,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.120
there were not a lot of
restaurants in Communist China

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.870
back then.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.720
And if they were, their
menus were all in Chinese,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.470
and they didn't have pictures.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.530
And this is so immensely
naive, but we were surprised.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.870
And so we were hungry, and
we started to fall apart.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.840
I got very sick, physically,
from the pollution

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.180
and the stress.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.440
And my friend started to
become mentally unhinged.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.510
It got so bad we almost
did not make it out

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.040
of the People's
Republic of China.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.870
And it became sort of
our "Heart of Darkness."

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.120
So this is what I had planned.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.010
It was such spectacular
and unbelievable story.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.930
This would be the novel.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.220
This was the book I
was meant to write.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.040
Except there was a problem.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.340
At that time, we had just
gone to-- we being the United

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.150
States-- had just gone to war
in Iraq for the second time.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.840
And I overheard our president--
well overheard on television--

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.505
saying that the invasion of
Iraq would be a cakewalk.

00:07:04.505 --> 00:07:06.830
And I turned to my
husband, and I said,

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.810
that sounds like something
stupid I would've

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.980
said at 21 in the IHOP,
idea that we could just

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.930
go into another country
and it would be easy.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.280
And at the same time,
there were a whole slew

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.620
of books that came out
around then about people who,

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.950
having a midlife crisis,
went to an ashram in India

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.850
or decided to help mend
their broken heart by eating

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.500
a lot of pasta in Italy or by
fixing up a house in Tuscany.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.870
There was a general
feeling politically,

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.690
socially, culturally
in the United States

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.535
that all these other
countries in the world

00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:41.800
were really there
for our enrichment,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.660
for our own personal makeover,
or for our national gain.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.160
And I had gone through
a situation where

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.900
traveling abroad was
not about conquering.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.540
It was about surrender
and humility.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.130
And so I realized I had to
tell the story of what happened

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:04.050
to me in China as the truth
and talk about what it's

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.360
like to be humiliated,
to behave badly and have

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.630
bad things happen to you.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.350
And also the unexpected
things and the goodness

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.640
of people from many different
cultures who really just

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.320
saved us.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.980
And so that became
my third book,

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.810
"Undress Me in the
Temple of Heaven."

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.690
And it's a true story.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.910
People never think
that it's true.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.100
They think it's a novel.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:32.070
So then I could turn finally--
finally-- to writing the novel.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.500
"The Ice Cream Queen
of Orchard Street,"

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.289
the inspiration for
this was born out

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.620
of my being a New Yorker
and obsessed with ice cream.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.510
I am the founder of the
Susan Jane Gilman Institute

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.680
of Advanced Gelato Studies.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.740
The research is
extensive, ongoing.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.600
If anybody here wants to
help be a research fellow,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.510
see me afterwards.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.910
I'll hook you up.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.290
As such, I used to love
a local brand here.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.840
It was all along the Northeast.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.030
I don't know who here remembers
it, but it was called Carvel.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.770
And Tom Carvel was the owner,
and he did his own commercials.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.240
And you can probably, I mean
if you're watching YouTube,

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.400
google it.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.340
They would have ice cream
cakes, novelty ice cream cakes,

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.872
Fudgie the Whale, Cookie Puss.

00:09:13.872 --> 00:09:14.830
I'm not making that up.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.580
I don't know who came
up with Cookie Puss.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.280
And he would get on, and
he'd say, "Have a nice Fudgie

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.220
the Whale cake for a whale
of a dad on Father's Day."

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.640
And he was so gravelly and
these ads were so homespun

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.200
that you felt you had
to eat Carvel ice cream

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.570
or he might have a heart attack.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.210
So one night I was playing
this for my husband on YouTube,

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.480
and I googled Tom Carvel
to read about him.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.640
His name was Tom Carvelas.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.480
He was a Greek immigrant who
arrived in the United States

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.060
with nothing.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.000
And slowly he built this
empire of ice cream franchises.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.240
And it struck a chord in me.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.790
I said, that would make a
really interesting story.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.650
Then I read about
Haagen-Dazs, another one

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.590
of my personal
favorites, which is

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:03.170
this luxury Scandinavian
brand of ice cream.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.884
It was created by two Jewish
immigrants in the Bronx.

00:10:06.884 --> 00:10:08.550
Their parents had
come over from Russia.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.720
They too were poor,
and they wanted

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.130
to create a luxury ice cream.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.950
And they created this sort
of fake Danish feel and name

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.150
to it because they felt
the Danes had been really

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.800
good to the Jews
during the Holocaust.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.450
When I read their story
too, rags to riches,

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.350
again I had to write about this.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.070
But there was a problem.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.340
All these real-life ice cream
makers-- Tom Carvel, Rose

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.720
and Reuben Mattus, the
founders of Haagen-Dazs--

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.500
they were all
genuinely good people.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.160
They had their dreams come true
in America making something

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.280
sweet that everybody loved.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.300
They were generous.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.220
They loved children.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.980
They had foundations.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.230
This is not interesting
as a novelist.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.890
I have had an impulse
for a long time

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:59.250
to write a really delicious,
difficult female antihero.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.230
I feel like we haven't
had a lot of them

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.470
in modern American
literature, not really

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.790
since Scarlett O'Hara.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.500
We've had some psychopaths.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.490
We've had some people start
off bad but wind up good.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.200
But I wanted somebody whose
own bravado and chutzpa

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.800
and sheer tenacity, even though
she's difficult and unlikable,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.770
makes her rise.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.920
And then I thought,
oh, what if somebody

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.360
who was like Leona
Helmsley or Martha Stewart

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.200
created an ice cream empire?

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.970
What if somebody like
that-- what if Paul Deen had

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.240
a children's kiddie
show on Sunday morning?

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.180
What would that look like?

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.700
That got interesting.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.050
And so "The Ice Cream Queen
of Orchard Street" was born.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.760
It is the tale of a little
immigrant girl, Malka

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.930
Treynovsky, who arrives
in New York City in 1913,

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.210
where she's immediately
crippled and abandoned

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.630
on the streets of
the Lower East Side.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.680
She's taken in by the man who
accidentally cripples her,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.200
an Italian ices maker,
Salvatore Dinello.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.070
And through her own
tenacity as an orphan,

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.390
as somebody who's handicapped,
as a Jew, a female, a child

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.180
in the middle of a vast city,
through her own tenacity

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.610
and cunning, she rises
over the course of 70 years

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.100
to become a woman who President
Eisenhower himself christens

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.700
the ice cream queen of America.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.670
She is the doyenne
of an ice cream

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.970
empire, along with
her husband, Bert.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.720
She has her own Sunday
morning TV show.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.700
She is a celebrity.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.870
She's a spokeswoman.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.480
She's everybody's
ice cream mama.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.830
She hates kids.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.260
She would rather drink
than eat ice cream.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.940
And she is difficult.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.600
And in the course
of her story, we

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.570
hear her rise and
her spectacular fall.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.480
So I'm going to introduce
you a little bit to her.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.820
I will read you
just the beginning

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.280
where a book should start,
and you will hear her voice

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.730
and who she is.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.790
Just so you know, I record
the audio book of this,

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.850
so I've learned to
channel the character.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:07.190
So you will get to meet
her in the beginning.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.430
"We'd been in America
just three months

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.300
when the horse ran over me.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.020
I don't know exactly how
old I was, six perhaps.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.690
When I was born, they
didn't keep records.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.770
All I remember was running down
Hester Street looking for papa.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.040
Overhead, of bleak
sky was flanked

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.890
by rooftops, iron fire escapes.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.330
Pigeons circled.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.860
Street peddlers shouted.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.320
Chickens squawked.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.340
There was this strange rickety
calliope of the organ grinder.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.930
Great upheavals of dust
swirled around the push carts,

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:43.490
making the shop signs swing
back and forth like flags.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.710
I heard a clop,
then I was tumbling.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.690
There was a split second
flash of hoof, then

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:55.060
a white hot bolt of
pain, then nothing.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.690
The horse that trampled me
was pulling a penny ices cart.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.960
What a peculiar twist of fate
that turned out to be, no?

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.230
If I'd been crippled by, say,
a rag man or a coal vendor,

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.460
I would never have
become Lillian Dunkle

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.710
as the world knows her today.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.830
Certainly I would never
have become a legend at all.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.710
The public, however,
always assumes

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.880
that my fortunes are due
solely to my husband.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.650
Oh, how the media hates its
queens, how it begrudges us.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.950
That horrible photograph the
newspapers keep running now--

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.330
the one that makes me look
like Joan Crawford getting

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.090
an enema-- is all
the proof you need.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.750
So quick they are to judge.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.180
But let me tell you,
darlings, the Wonder Tundra

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.710
with chocolate chips,
rainbow sprinkles,

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.670
or chopped peanuts
mixed in to order.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.720
Our signature novelty
cake, the Nilla Rilla,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.030
molded into the shape of our
trademark cartoon monkey,

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.530
coated in shaved coconut with
the secret cookie crunch layer

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.770
inside.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.790
We'd first marketed it for
birthdays and Father's Day,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.240
but do you realize
how many of you

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.650
ordered versions of
this for your weddings?

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.070
We did one custom cake
out at a reception

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.339
in Syosset that fed 215 people.

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.630
It would have made "The
Guinness Book of World Records"

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.550
if Bert had remembered
the goddamn camera.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:17.940
The Tower of Sprinkles, the
Mint Everest, the Fudgie Puppie.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.900
All of these-- all of these--
millions sold every year,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.140
were my concoctions, my ideas.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.760
President Dwight D.
Eisenhower himself once

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.870
christened me "The Ice
Cream Queen of America."

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.920
I have the signed photograph
of us, in fact, with Mamie,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.640
of course-- all pearls,
bad teeth-- shaking

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.520
hands in the Rose Garden.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.960
I'm wearing my first ever
Chanel suit, too, very nearly

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.900
the color of
strawberry ice cream.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.610
And this was years before
Jackie Kennedy, thank you.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.840
Today I've no fewer
than three dozen

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.440
engraved trophies,
plaques, ribbons,

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.240
plus an entire wall of
certificates from the North

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.650
Carolina Chamber of Commerce,
the American Dairy Association,

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.500
Dow Chemical, even the Institute
of the Maharishi Mahesh

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.720
Yogi in Rishikesh, India.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.480
Yogis love ice
cream, apparently.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.150
Who know?

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.920
Yet when people hear my
name now, all they think of

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.010
are sordid headlines.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.330
A single incident
on live television,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.940
claims of tax evasion
and arrest-- wrongful,

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.880
too, need I remind you?

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.040
Unfunny jokes on Johnny
Carson, that schlemiel.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:26.850
You want funny?

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.260
Please, I know from funny.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.650
Just yesterday my
grandson informed me

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.470
that I'm even an
answer in the latest

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.520
edition of Trivial Pursuit.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.350
'Wow, grandma, how
awesome is that?" he said.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.460
Live long enough, I
suppose, you see everything.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.260
But it's a witch hunt.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.940
It was only a local television
station, for God's sake,

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:53.120
and we aired at 7:00 AM
on a Sunday-- a Sunday.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.850
And maybe I had
had a few drinks.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.310
But darlings, you try
hosting a kiddie show

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.920
for 13 goddamn years.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.650
But oh, I'm getting
ahead of myself."

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.079
And so we meet Lillian Dunkle.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.310
The book begins.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.810
She is 75 years old
and under indictment.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.619
And yet it toggles
back and forth

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:18.390
where she begins to tell us
about her very beginnings

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:22.250
in New York City and her
rise, and then of course we

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.089
learn about her fall.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:27.560
When I started out, this was
just the trajectory I had.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.730
Success, downfall,
and then-- well,

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.960
to find out what happens
you have to read it.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.780
But as I started to
research, I began

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.210
to learn things about
American history.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.634
Because as I first became
obsessed, of course,

00:17:42.634 --> 00:17:45.050
with the ice cream-- this woman
knows everything about it,

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.150
where it came from,
the history of it.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.130
And as I learned
more about what ice

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.580
cream production was like
in 20th century America,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.790
I saw that it was intimately
tied to the biggest events that

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.600
happened in our country.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.340
For example, prohibition
was fantastic for ice cream

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.070
production because had all of
these saloon owners and tavern

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.930
keepers.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.080
What were they going to
do with their properties?

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.340
Not everybody could
make a speakeasy.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.130
And so they turned
all these bars

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.632
into ice cream parlors,
which makes sense

00:18:14.632 --> 00:18:16.840
because the old fashioned
ice cream parlor sometimes,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.189
they would have the stained
glass lamps in them.

00:18:20.189 --> 00:18:21.730
Sometimes they would
have a high bar.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.750
That's because they
probably sold alcohol.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.880
And what people don't realize
is during the Roaring '20s when

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.760
you're reading
about bathtub gin,

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.840
actually more ice cream was
sold than bootleg liquor.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.440
There were more
ice cream parlors

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.770
than there were speakeasies,
so the production really

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.030
took off then.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.200
And of course then comes
the Great Depression

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.030
and with it also the
repeal of prohibition.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:48.790
And ice cream production
plummets, so much so

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.651
that you started having
bootleg ice cream makers.

00:18:51.651 --> 00:18:53.150
And these were
people who would make

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.230
ice cream not up to standard.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.170
They would use milk powder
and less milk fat and sugar,

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.950
and they'd sell
it under the table

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.450
to legitimate producers,
who would pawn it off

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.440
as their own product.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.100
So you had this
whole black market

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.760
of fake ice cream going on.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.400
And then in World War II,
the United States government

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:18.000
became the largest ice
cream producer in history.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.580
And so I'm going to read one
small little section here,

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.390
which shows you how this
impacts Lillian Dunkle's

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:28.240
life, because what happens is
that as an ice cream maker,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.760
she ends up being impacted
by American history

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.210
and also affecting it.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.420
Her fate is entwined with
that of our country itself.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.570
And then after this,
I'll take any questions.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.350
"Imagine a single regiment
of beleaguered men landing

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:49.100
on a tiny island in the
middle of the South Pacific.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.060
As they stumble onto an
empty white scythe of beach,

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.860
a lone Japanese
warplane rips overhead.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.560
Yet just as quickly
it disappears.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.500
The horizon seems to absorb it.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.200
Slowly, the US soldiers
of the 81st Infantry

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.200
realize they are alone.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.170
The Japanese have believed that
the sheer size of the Pacific

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.460
will hobble America's
war efforts.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:17.330
The distances to refuel
are simply too cumbersome.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.570
Yet the islet of Ulithi
is perfectly situated

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.980
between Hawaii, Japan,
and the Philippines.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.020
Its volcanic crags barely
poke above the ocean.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.620
And the Japanese
have relinquished it.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.260
Within a single month
of the autumn of 1944,

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.720
the United States converts
this blip in the ocean

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.780
into the largest secret
Naval base in history.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.260
A port is constructed holding
several hundred vessels.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.880
An airstrip is cleared.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.660
Floating dry docks
are brought in

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.750
to repair enormous battleships.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.150
An entire water
distillation plant

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.680
is anchored beside a
bakery large enough

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.035
to grind out thousands
of loaves of bread, cake,

00:20:59.035 --> 00:21:02.270
and pies every day.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.760
The Second World
War, you want to know

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.020
about Kristallnacht
and Iwo Jima?

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.060
Well, there are books
and movies for that.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.340
Go take yourself to a library.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.890
What I can tell you, darlings,
is that in World War II,

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.940
nearly every nation on Earth
stopped producing ice cream.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.690
Sugar was too scarce.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.930
Equipment had to be
redirected to the war effort.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.420
In Italy, Mussolini
banned ice cream simply

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:31.390
because he woke up one morning
and decided it was decadent.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.240
Only the United
States of America

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.020
decided ice cream
was an essential item

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.810
for troop morale.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.830
And so it alone continued
producing, ordering ice cream

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:44.210
freezers on submarines,
tankers, cargo ships.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.850
Over the course of the war,
the United States military

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.900
became the largest ice cream
manufacturer in the world.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:59.150
And in 1945-- oh-- in
1945, another vessel

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.980
pulled into its port of Ulithi.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.060
This was called simply
the ice cream barge.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.930
It was commissioned to
become the world's biggest

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.990
floating ice cream parlor.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.490
Made of concrete, it
didn't even have an engine.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.510
It was a refrigerated
Leviathan that

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.260
had to be towed
across the Pacific.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.990
And among its crew
of 23 soldiers

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.370
was one civilian who'd been
given a special dispensation

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.750
from the Army
Corps of Engineers.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.110
He alone was in charge of
overseeing the enormous ice

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.380
cream freezer that
churned out 15,000

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.990
gallons of ice cream per day.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.780
For the duration of
the war, he alone

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.530
toiled inside the
concrete hull ensuring

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.010
that the machinery
he helped design

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.830
remain in perfect working order.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:50.360
This man, of course,
was my husband, Bert."

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.610
And so there you have it.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.430
You have the story
of Lillian Dunkle.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.680
You have the story of ice cream.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.500
You have the story of the
United States of America.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.820
And this has
become, what started

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.910
as a small idea googling an
advertisement for the ice

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.710
cream of my childhood and
a beloved gravelly Greek

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.020
immigrant who I didn't
even know was such.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:18.950
And it turned into a 500-page
historic delicious novel.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.104
Thank you for listening.

00:23:21.104 --> 00:23:23.594
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.027
Questions?

00:23:32.027 --> 00:23:32.526
Yes.

00:23:32.526 --> 00:23:34.374
AUDIENCE: Yes, Ms. Gilman.

00:23:34.374 --> 00:23:37.890
You mentioned your other
books were nonfiction.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.120
How different is
the creative process

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.560
versus fiction or nonfiction?

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.230
SUSAN JANE GILMAN:
Oh, good question.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:49.730
Writing a novel is harder
by a power of 10 if not 100.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.840
With nonfiction, the challenge
is you've lived the story,

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.609
so you know how
it's going to end.

00:23:54.609 --> 00:23:56.150
The challenge is,
how do you tell it?

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.040
What do you keep in?

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.760
What do you leave out?

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.850
What can you show and not tell?

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.410
With a novel, the
whole story is open,

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:06.840
so you can make things up.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.630
Anything can go any
which way, so it's

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.094
a chronic
decision-making process.

00:24:11.094 --> 00:24:12.760
What's going to happen
to the character?

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.330
How are they going to get
from point A to point B?

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.990
If you want to move them from
New York to San Francisco,

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.360
do you show them looking
for their car keys?

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.106
Do you just start
them off in the car?

00:24:22.106 --> 00:24:24.105
Do you put them on the
George Washington Bridge?

00:24:24.105 --> 00:24:28.250
Or do you just say, that autumn
we moved to San Francisco?

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.110
So when I was writing this
and coming up with the plot,

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.020
every single day I was trying
to decide where they should go,

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.980
and what they should
do, and how to tell it.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.960
By the time my husband
came home every night,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.260
I was pretty much a mess, and
I couldn't decide anything.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.180
He'd say, do you want
ravioli, or do you

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.190
want regular pasta for dinner?

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.410
And I don't know.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.290
You decide.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.950
I can't-- I can't-- I can't
make another decision.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.190
And I lived it, and I
breathed it in a certain way

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.210
that you don't with
nonfiction because you're

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.670
trying to conjure up these
other people in your head.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.470
What I also found, too,
as I was working on it

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:10.080
is that there were times I
could write 60 or 70 pages only

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.130
to realize I was writing the
wrong story or the wrong part

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:14.170
of the story.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.140
It was as if I wanted to move my
characters from New York to San

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.190
Francisco, and it wasn't
until I got them up to Toronto

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.660
I realized that they'd
taken the wrong turn,

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.190
and I had to scrap that.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:25.060
So there were times.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.120
There were several
scenes, chunks, chapters

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.090
that I just had to jettison
and start over with.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.780
The same time,
there was something

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.430
I just loved about it that's
more fun than nonfiction,

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:39.610
because you get to
explore and create.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.376
Yes.

00:25:40.376 --> 00:25:42.259
AUDIENCE: Now than you've
written your novel,

00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:43.675
did you get it out
of your system?

00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:45.410
And what are you
going to write next?

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.860
SUSAN JANE GILMAN: Oh, I did
not get it out of my system.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.990
I'm not even sick of ice cream.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.050
I guess I'm going to have
to write another novel.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.760
It's a little addictive in a
very masochistic kind of way,

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.250
maybe like mountain climbing.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:57.930
It's painful.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.570
You say, why am I doing this?

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:03.080
And then as soon as it's done,
you just want to do it again.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.210
I have several ideas
buzzing around in my head,

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.930
but I don't know how it is
with people in the room.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.200
But for me, if I'm doing
something creatively,

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.400
if I talk about
it, I essentially

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.610
sort of lose the
momentum behind it.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:16.890
So I'll leave you guessing.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.675
Yes.

00:26:20.675 --> 00:26:23.050
AUDIENCE: Going back to you
talked about your first three

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.425
books and this
one as well, there

00:26:24.425 --> 00:26:28.150
seems to be a little bit
of an undertone-- sometimes

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.870
it's more overt,
sometimes less--

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.886
but in feminine development,
a story of powerful women

00:26:33.886 --> 00:26:36.140
or women becoming powerful.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.879
I'm curious if you
have encountered--

00:26:38.879 --> 00:26:40.420
because it is, as
you've pointed out,

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.536
a hefty book-- with young
women today, with young people

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:46.452
today in general we have
these short attention

00:26:46.452 --> 00:26:48.550
spans and everybody's
bouncing around.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:52.190
Have you encountered challenges
with relating to young women?

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.900
Have you discovered
certain tricks

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.210
to connect more with
young women that

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.310
gets your intentions
across to them?

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.060
SUSAN JANE GILMAN:
That's a good question.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.820
I think because even though
I would no longer fall

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.960
under the rubric of young woman
but I'm perpetually immature,

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.130
I don't have trouble
bonding at all.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.780
I can fit right in
with 15-year-olds or 25

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.440
or 35-year-olds.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.870
I think women really
respond to other women

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.520
when we speak the truth.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.450
We are not sanctimonious.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.130
We have a good sense of humor.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.490
And we just remember
what it was like.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:28.210
I feel like I'm all
ages at all times.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:31.940
And there's so much
dreck that is still

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.320
being geared towards women.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.680
There's this phrase chick lit,
which is really offensive.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.780
There are all kinds of
genres in literature.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.130
There's YA-- Young Adult.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:44.790
There's dystopian lit.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:45.732
There's sci-fi.

00:27:45.732 --> 00:27:46.440
There's thriller.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.900
There's crime.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.030
Only the phrase chick lit
carries this really negative

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.480
connotation, the
idea being that it's

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.940
by young women for young
women, and therefore it's

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.690
stupid and brainless
and it's touchy-feely

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.379
and about emotions.

00:27:59.379 --> 00:28:01.670
And that's not to say that
there aren't books like that

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.560
out there, but it's used
to sort of tar anything

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.420
by women or with women
who might be included

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.130
or even part of the audience.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.350
And I find that
makes it much harder.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.350
And I think my fellow writers,
older and younger than me,

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.780
find that is just
being given legitimacy

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.070
if you're writing
from a point of view

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.040
of your half of the species.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.470
And readers, I get a
lot of email from men.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:30.630
"I didn't think I would like
your book," they start out.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.250
"My wife was reading your
book next to me in bed

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.770
and laughing." "My girlfriend
gave me your book."

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.340
"I saw that my girlfriends
were passing around your book

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.140
and wondered what this was.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.340
And I read it, and it was really
funny, and it was really good,

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.600
and I got a lot out of it."

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.294
And there's this surprise.

00:28:47.294 --> 00:28:48.710
So that's what I
get from the men.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.540
And from the women I
get, "You understand me.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.130
I can't believe it."

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:57.040
I got one, "I'm a 16-year-old
gay woman out in Oklahoma,

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.870
and when I read
'Kiss My Tiara' I

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:01.020
felt like I wasn't alone
for the first time.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.150
Or, "My friends
and I backpacked.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.300
We went backpacking, and
I felt so freaked out

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.050
that something was
wrong with me because I

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.250
wasn't having a good time.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:10.600
I loved 'Undress Me in
the Temple of Heaven.'"

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.580
When you speak to a truth
that is not about girly stuff

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.880
and about hair and makeup and
diet and being decorative,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.240
I think women respond to that.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.650
We're hungry for
it, because so much

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.410
of what is geared towards us,
whether we're seven or 70,

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:27.700
it's pink purple sparkles.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.561
Yes.

00:29:32.561 --> 00:29:34.810
AUDIENCE: Since we are here
at, like you said, Google,

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.700
how have you seen technology
change book reading

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.660
habits or book selling habits?

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.930
SUSAN JANE GILMAN: Oh,
e-books, e-books, e-books.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.375
It's changed the
industry, obviously,

00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:49.500
because people can-- I'll
tell people about a book,

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.410
and they'll say, hang on.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.910
And they'll get on
their technology,

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.180
and they'll download
it instantly.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.480
And for a writer in a certain
way, that's kind of great.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.200
I get a lot of, oh,
where's your book?

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.337
Oh, I'll go pick it
up at the library.

00:30:01.337 --> 00:30:02.920
And there they buy
it in front of you.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.540
That's kind of cool.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.470
The problem is then
you can't see people

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:07.761
reading it in front of you.

00:30:07.761 --> 00:30:09.010
There's something really nice.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:10.884
You know, I was on the
Amtrak, and I look up,

00:30:10.884 --> 00:30:12.880
and somebody's like this.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.040
For a writer, that
makes your heart sing.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.810
It's like, oh my god.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.320
And so the technology
has made it harder

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:25.720
for your book to be anything
but digits, but binary code.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.110
And that's a little
unnerving if you're a writer.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:32.130
Certainly now all of us
writers, I'm on Facebook.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.025
I'm on Twitter.

00:30:33.025 --> 00:30:34.660
I'm on Instagram.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.990
I have a blog.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.610
I don't have time for
Tumblr because I'm actually

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.340
going to try to
write another book.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:45.380
But it does diffuse our own
attention and our own writing.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.030
And then there's
everything that's

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.970
going on right now
with publishers,

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.640
with the pricing of
e-books, with Amazon.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.610
And that's a whole other
mess, which is, in my mind,

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.570
threatening writers.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.770
Because there is
talk about doing away

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.310
with traditional
publishing houses.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.220
And I will say this
since I have a forum.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.280
I read something
yesterday about how

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.661
if Amazon does away with
traditional publishers,

00:31:08.661 --> 00:31:09.410
it's a good thing.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:11.390
Writers don't need editors.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.380
All you need is a good spell
check program and an editing

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.260
program, and you
can do it yourself.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.270
So I would like to say this.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.880
My editors are not middlemen,
and my editors cannot be

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.830
replaced by a program.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:27.675
Anybody who's an athlete
who's had a great coach or who

00:31:27.675 --> 00:31:31.450
is a musician who has a great
teacher or a great producer

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.740
knows that you need somebody
if you are a creative person

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.890
or if you have a talent
to help you be better.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.500
All the editors I've had
have been really spectacular.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.780
They have vision.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.630
They hand hold.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:43.820
They deal with us writers.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.350
We're a little mercurial.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.690
They keep us on track.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:48.170
They help us become better.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.230
They push us, and they
make our products better.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:52.820
I don't want to
work in a day where

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.450
I don't have a publishing house.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.710
Plus there's not
just spell checking.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:02.130
There is figuring out where
a book fits into the world.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.700
Are you just writing something
that's been out there already?

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.850
There's institutional memory.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:08.190
There is copy editing.

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.160
There's fact checking.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.250
There's legal vetting.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:11.990
There's book design.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:13.250
These are important things.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.970
And the writers I know
who are self-publishing

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:19.920
in this world taking advantage
of all the electronica

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.500
are finding they still
want a really good editor.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.640
They want a sounding board.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.480
They need a copy editor.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.550
They need a proofreader.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.110
They need somebody to help
them check their facts.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:31.170
They want a designer.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:32.790
They want it to look good.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.630
Except because they're
self-publishing

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.670
using the technology,
they have to pay

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.110
for this all out of
pocket themselves.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.660
So what the world could look
like is that unless you have

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.950
enough money to fully subsidize
your own virtual publishing

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.350
house, the work
that comes out there

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.660
is going to be either
shoddy and/or just written

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.490
by people of means.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.930
So I see technology on
one hand putting books

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.040
into so many more hands
in a much faster way

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.390
and giving me as an author
a lot of ways including

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.920
this to interact with
people, which is great.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.160
Because usually we authors,
it's not glamorous.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.640
You sit alone in a room
three, four, five years.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.810
That's the writing process.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.757
Nobody's doing a reality
show about authors

00:33:14.757 --> 00:33:16.090
where we're given an assignment.

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:17.798
We write a book each
week, and then we're

00:33:17.798 --> 00:33:21.080
eliminated based on who is the
best book and who is the worst.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.520
It's just this boring,
very limited process.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.030
So to have social media, great.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.770
But the idea that
technology could

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:33.180
replace publishers and editors,
or even just a nice hardcover

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.650
book to hold in your hand or
bop somebody over the head

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.470
with, that I'm going to miss.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.970
Yes.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:40.443
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit

00:33:40.443 --> 00:33:42.898
about how you came up
with the idea for Lillian

00:33:42.898 --> 00:33:44.862
Dunkle the character?

00:33:44.862 --> 00:33:48.299
How do you keep a character
that you've made up,

00:33:48.299 --> 00:33:50.754
how do you make that
character authentic as opposed

00:33:50.754 --> 00:33:52.780
to a caricature?

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.560
SUSAN JANE GILMAN: Oh, how do
you make a character authentic?

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.750
You just keep digging.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.570
Anything that when
I write a character

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.810
that comes a little too easily
or that sounds like somebody

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:05.960
I've heard before,
then I have to check it

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.719
for being, for lack of
a better word, shtick.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:12.820
And the more you immerse
yourself in the world,

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.100
you think about things.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.530
And it's kind of
an acting exercise.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.145
I took some theater classes
when I was really young,

00:34:19.145 --> 00:34:20.770
like in junior high
school, and I still

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.560
call upon that to
get into their heads.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.650
As a writer, I think I'm every
character in the book here.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.469
I'm Spreckels the
Clown, which is

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:33.139
played by a closeted gay man
named Harvey Valentine, who

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:34.590
shows up in the '50s.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:37.039
I'm her 19-year-old
grandson Jason,

00:34:37.039 --> 00:34:39.639
I'm her dyslexic husband Bert.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.840
I am the Dinellos,
the immigrants

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.770
who come and bring her in.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.360
At some point, you have
to get into their head

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.239
and imagine, how
is it going to be?

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:50.760
And what would life be like?

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.190
And how would people see things?

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:55.159
You're constantly shape
shifting as a writer.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.230
And I think all
of us I can speak

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:01.500
are on the lookout for cliche,
for keeping something alive.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.110
And there are also skills
you learn as a writer.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.810
I went to an MFA
program, and there

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:09.580
tends to be an idea
that we writers,

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.079
we're hit with a
bolt of inspiration

00:35:11.079 --> 00:35:12.760
and it just pours out of us.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.510
But there are tools to writing
like there are to playing music

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.010
or playing a sport.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:19.030
You learn how to show, not tell.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:22.780
You learn how to write a
three-dimensional character.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.720
You learn how using a
different point of view

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.020
will create a different tone.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.780
There's just practical stuff.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.976
And the more you do it, one
hopes the better you become.

00:35:32.976 --> 00:35:33.476
Yes.

00:35:33.476 --> 00:35:35.440
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about choosing

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.029
to write a historical novel.

00:35:37.029 --> 00:35:39.570
Because when you're coming from
an all nonfiction background,

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.960
that's all very present.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.710
You were saying all
of your books come out

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:45.190
of immediacy of your experience.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.589
And so I'm wondering
if you had set out

00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:49.547
to write a historical
novel or if that was just

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:51.172
the story that
presented itself to you.

00:35:51.172 --> 00:35:56.222
And then also if you think that
that sort of structure of facts

00:35:56.222 --> 00:35:57.930
that come from the
history you're placing

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.735
your story within helped you
structure your first fiction

00:36:01.735 --> 00:36:02.235
work.

00:36:02.235 --> 00:36:03.610
SUSAN JANE GILMAN:
Yeah, I didn't

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:05.822
realize that this was
going to be so historical.

00:36:05.822 --> 00:36:06.530
And you're right.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:09.510
Most of my work has
been very reactive.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.700
I have to respond to something
that's pissing me off

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.790
in the culture with
an entire book.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.950
This was the first one that
was more of a Valentine

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.160
that came of love.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.520
But I think I was responding
too to the lack of these really

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.040
complicated, yummy, awful,
wonderful antiheroes.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.590
I wanted to do a female,
so there was some of that.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:29.520
This book grew.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.030
I mean, I was
joking about calling

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.070
it "The Moby Dick of
Ice Cream" at one point

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:35.070
because I had so much
about the history of ice

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.410
cream and the chemistry.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:38.760
And it really
revealed itself to me

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.680
as I did the research to
find how much ice cream

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.950
history happened
in the 20th century

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:49.000
and how it became integrated
into my characters' experience.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.680
So the book sort of
mushroomed and became

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:57.200
more-- the history itself
became integral to her story.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.240
As opposed to I first envisioned
it as just a backdrop,

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.670
like, oh, old New York.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.962
That would be really cool.

00:37:02.962 --> 00:37:04.420
Nobody's written
about that before.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.822
But I thought I would do it
a new way, and there we go.

00:37:08.822 --> 00:37:11.780
AUDIENCE: Do you think you
would revisit historical?

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.610
SUSAN JANE GILMAN: I think so.

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:17.250
Probably I would not go back
to the immigrant story again.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:20.790
We're not going to have a
"Liver Queen of Ludlow Street."

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:22.927
But a few of the ideas
I have floating around,

00:37:22.927 --> 00:37:25.010
you hear about these little
nuggets or things that

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:28.640
happened in history, and you
go, nobody told me about that.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.710
Oh my gosh.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:30.435
Ooh.

00:37:30.435 --> 00:37:32.060
And then you want to
pull at the thread

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.600
and see what it leads to.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.120
It's fun.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.160
It's archaeology.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.080
I like the research.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.870
I worked as a journalist
for a few years

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.030
before I went into
writing books.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.570
And there is that
part of me that

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:44.920
just loves to dig and uncover.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.510
I guess I have a feeling
we're pretty much out of time.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:54.240
Thank you.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.930
Thank you for coming.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.360
Thank you for listening to
the story of Lillian Dunkle

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.680
and "The Ice Cream Queen
of Orchard Street."

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.680
If anybody has questions
for me afterwards,

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.770
you can always email me.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.542
My website is
susanjanegilman.com.

00:38:08.542 --> 00:38:12.470
I am on Facebook as-- wait
for it-- Susan Jane Gilman.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.140
I am on Twitter, SusanJGilman.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:19.520
I am on Instagram something or
other, SusanJGillman2, I think,

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.930
SJGilman.

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.070
I'm all over the media.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:23.700
Come visit me.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.370
Talk to me.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:25.630
I'd love to see you.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:26.430
Thank you.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.180
