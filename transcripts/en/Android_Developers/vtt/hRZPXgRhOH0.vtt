00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:07.820
SCOTT LEVINE: Univision
NOW is our direct consumer

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.290
subscription
offering, and the goal

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.600
was to give access to our
audience, wherever they are,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.870
whenever they want.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.340
When we really wanted
to innovative and push

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.540
the boundaries on our
subscription service,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.215
we launched in-app
subscriptions for Google Play.

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:26.560
And we saw it pop immediately,
about three to four

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.190
times the conversion rate by
working with the Google team.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.690
ELIE HABIB: When
we started Anghami,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.985
we said we want to have a music
service which is convenient

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:38.730
and all the music available.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.590
In the Middle East,
it was a region

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.160
which was totally forgotten.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.770
There was no legal alternative.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.455
So you have to pirate or pirate.

00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:48.220
I mean, there was nothing else.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.770
And if we actually
could succeed,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.460
we'd be pirating the pirates.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.810
For us, Google Play is the core.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.870
We have over 81% of our
users today on Android.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.180
Our growth strategy
goes around engaging

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.219
Android users to use the app
more so they can subscribe.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:08.510
AHCENE AMROUZ: We think that
Google Play billing really

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.250
helped the increase of our
subscription conversion rates

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.010
on [? Le Matinal. ?]
And we think

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.580
that one of main explanations
is the better user experience.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.545
Android has become
the main source

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:21.750
for downloads for
[? Le Matinal. ?] Also, we

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.820
see, on subscription conversion,
an increase of 6% on Android

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.412
compared to other platforms.

00:01:27.412 --> 00:01:29.620
KONRADIN BREYER: Freeletics
was started with a vision

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.850
to make everyone the greatest
version of themselves.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.510
And the way we do this is we're
trying to motivate and guide

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.160
them in a variety
of apps to reach

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.969
their physical and mental goals.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.260
The reason why subscriptions
make a lot of sense for us

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.240
is not only from an
economic point of view,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.230
but also because we want to
develop people in the long run.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.607
We want to have a repeated
impact upon their life.

00:01:49.607 --> 00:01:51.190
SCOTT LEVINE: Working
with Google Play

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.250
and figuring out how to launch
a successful subscription

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.880
product, it's been great.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.910
And that kind of
partnership is really

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.940
what we saw that
led to the success.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.216

00:02:09.217 --> 00:02:10.800
TOM GRINSTED: Good
morning, everybody.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.770
So first off, well done for
making it in on Friday morning.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.790
And from me and these
two, thank you very much.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.840
Hello to everyone on
the livestream as well.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.450
I want to dive straight into
it, and I want to dive straight

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.770
into it with all of you.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.881
So can you all put
your hands up, please?

00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:32.880
Every single one of you.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.630
I'm going to shame
anyone who doesn't.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.781
[LAUGHING]

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:36.280
Brilliant.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.613
OK, if you're on the livestream,
could you put them up--

00:02:38.613 --> 00:02:39.407
keep them up.

00:02:39.407 --> 00:02:40.990
If you're on the
livestream, could you

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.750
put your hand up as
well, just so you

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.090
look really odd in your office?

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.780
OK, could you put
your hand down if you

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.474
don't want to make more money?

00:02:51.474 --> 00:02:53.890
Actually, someone just put
their hand up in the front row.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.515
That's amazing.

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:55.656
It's like, "No, me too.

00:02:55.656 --> 00:02:56.530
OK, thanks very much.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.880
You can put your hands down now.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.930
OK, so the good news is, you're
all in the right session,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.310
because this is all about making
more money with subscriptions

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.860
and with Google Play.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.370
Now, why subscriptions?

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.360
Well, basically,
subscriptions are,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.050
we think, the best way
to make more revenue

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.600
more regularly and more
reliably on Google Play.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.170
And who doesn't want
to make more cash more

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.022
reliably and more regularly?

00:03:30.022 --> 00:03:31.480
But all of you guys
are going to be

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.360
at different parts of your
subscription life cycle.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.530
All of you are going to
be at different points

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.600
in integrating with us.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.410
Now, the three of us are really
excited about subscriptions,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.100
but we'd also like to know a
bit more about you as well.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.950
So I want you to get
your hands ready again.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.160
Can you give a thought about
where you are in your app

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.730
development journey?

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.590
And if you've integrated
with Play Billing,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.640
so you're running subscriptions
in your apps right now

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.634
and you're running a
successful business,

00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:05.550
but you want to know how
to take that business

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.035
to the next level, can
you put your hands up?

00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:10.410
So can you put your hands up
if you've integrated with us

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.840
but want to know how to
really drive success?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.180
Great, thanks so much.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.320
Put your hands down.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.434
OK, so next, if you've just
started integrating with us,

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:22.350
maybe you're at the
beginning of your journey,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.210
or you're considering
it, and you

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.410
want to know what tools
we have to help you build

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.430
your successful
subscriptions business,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.000
can you put your
hands up, please?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.230
OK, a few of you.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.770
Thanks very much.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.340
And lastly, if you've
not integrated with us,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.150
if you're maybe considering
subscriptions or considering

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.710
using us, basically, if
you're here because you just

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.960
want to know what all the fuss
is about with subscriptions,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.130
can you put your hands up?

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.020
OK, a few of you.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.340
Hello, and welcome.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.170
So the good news
is that no matter

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.980
when you put your hands up or
if you're on the livestream,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.440
if you thought, that sounds
like me, then Larry, George,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.760
and I have things
to share with you.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.590
So today, we're
going to be talking

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.720
to every single one of
you in the room about how

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.500
Play can help you build
successful subscription

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.710
businesses.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.280
Now, the three of us work
with teams across Google

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.000
to make that happen.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.480
That means that we've been
thinking about subscriptions

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.350
a huge amount.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.380
And when we do, we think
it starts with one thing.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.680
It starts with an
awesome product.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.850
And that's on you guys.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.730
You guys make amazing apps
that bring Android to life.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.840
So you've done that.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.650
You've got a
brilliant app, and you

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.800
want to monetize it
with subscriptions.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.130
What's the next thing you need?

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.430
Well, the next thing you
need is a brilliant market.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.460
You need loads of
people who are really

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.330
interested in your product and
are willing to pay to use it.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.950
But that's not all, either.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.430
The next thing you need is a
best-in-class billing platform

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.090
that gives you guys the
tools and the flexibility

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.920
to be able to get
to that audience

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.790
and successfully monetize them.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.550
Now, once you've
got those, there's

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.650
one more thing you need to
build a truly successful

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.940
subscriptions
business, and that's

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.400
best-in-class insights
and reporting.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.720
Because the better the
insights you guys have,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.770
the better decisions you make.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.740
And when you make
great decisions,

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.970
you build great businesses.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.100
So the good news is
that no matter where

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.340
you put your hands up,
we've got something for you.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.840
If you're wondering what
all the fuss is about,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.120
George is going to be
sharing information

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.776
about the amazing market you
find on Android and via Play.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.400
If you put your hands
up because you're

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.530
really interested in our
tooling, current and new,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.550
Larry's going to be showing
some really exciting information

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.300
about the new capabilities
of our billing platform.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.550
And lastly, if you
put your hands up

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.160
because you want to take your
business to the next level,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.460
you need the insights
to be able to do that,

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.200
and I'll be on at
the end to share

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.830
some really exciting
information about new insights

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.360
and reporting via
the Play console.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.050
So let's get going.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.900
I'd like to welcome George
up to tell us, really,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.990
what all the fuss is about.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.200
GEORGE AUDI: Thanks, Tom.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.040
Hey, everyone.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.860
I'm George, and I'm on the
Play Business Development team,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.470
working with developers like
yourselves on your subscription

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.550
business.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.300
I am very happy to
be here, particularly

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.810
because subscriptions are
seeing a phenomenal growth

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.040
on Androids.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.080
Just in the past two years,
we have doubled the number

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.930
of active subscribers on Play.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.570
So between 2016 and 2017,
we have twice the number

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.830
of people subscribing
to your services,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.560
and this proves that there
is an audience of users

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.820
that is really interested in
engaging with your products.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.670
But that's not all.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.400
That's actually only
the latest in a series

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.810
of positive momentum
we've been seeing.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.570
Subscriptions have been the
fastest growing business

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.710
model on Google Play today.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.150
We've seen a 10 times growth
in the past three years

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.929
in consumer spend.

00:08:05.929 --> 00:08:07.720
So not only are people
using your services,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.510
they are also spending on them.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.740
Now, to validate this,
we actually really

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.670
talked with users
and developers,

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.040
and we know that this
phenomenal growth would not

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.720
happen if users don't
love subscriptions.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.640
Fortunately, they do.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.290
Personally, I love being able
to binge-watch the latest

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.200
season of "Sense8" on
Netflix, or track my workouts

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.130
on Freeletics, or even
swipe as much as I want

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.190
on Tinder without having
to worry about consumption

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.559
charges and extra fees.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.789
And that's why users
love subscriptions.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:45.190
They know that they can
engage in your product

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.380
as much as they want
and know that they

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.480
will be charged that $5, $10,
$15 at the end of the month.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.350
So I mentioned the
consumer research study

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.430
that we did recently
to better understand

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.400
subscribers on Androids.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.830
And the study really validated
this trend, and this growth,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.920
and this excitement
about subscriptions

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.780
that we're seeing.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.150
We realize that the
audience for subscriptions

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.360
is out there and very engaged.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.850
62% of subscribers on Androids
use their subscription service

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.970
at least once a day.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.400
Now, this engagement
translates into money.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.150
We found that there
is a compelling market

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.180
for subscriptions coming
out of these engaged users.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.123
There is a willingness to pay
that ranges anywhere between $5

00:09:35.123 --> 00:09:38.990
and $20 for subscriptions,
and that really varies based

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.440
on the category of the app.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.410
We will be making the results of
this consumers research survey

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.614
available to you
today in a blog post,

00:09:47.614 --> 00:09:49.530
so make sure to check
it out so you can better

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:54.260
understand subscription
trends on Androids.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.500
Now, let's switch sides
to you guys in the room.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.130
We know that developers
also love subscriptions.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:05.210
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
here at 10:00 AM on a Friday.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.570
Developers love subscriptions,
because you can generate

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.610
recurrent revenue from
happy and engaged buyers,

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.330
and who doesn't want that?

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.750
Who doesn't want
the peace of mind

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.365
that your users are
paying you every month?

00:10:18.365 --> 00:10:21.120
It's expected, it's
recurrent, and it's very easy

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.070
to model out.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:27.240
Thousands of developers
use Google Play billing

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.860
for their subscriptions today.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.250
Some of them are
here on the screen.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.090
And some of them have
actually shared with us

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.420
a bunch of their case
studies and stories

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.510
about the success that
they're seeing on Androids.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.010
So throughout this
session, you will

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.930
hear from Tinder, Netflix,
Coffee Meets Bagel, HBO,

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.600
and many others.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.680
So there are loads of great
reasons to choose subscriptions

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.980
and to choose Play
billing for subscriptions.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.760
The first of these is how huge
and addressable the market

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.580
for subscription on
Android is, but also

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.730
how easy it is to
integrate with us.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.650
And Larry will touch a
bit more on this later

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.609
throughout this talk.

00:11:06.609 --> 00:11:08.150
But let me tell you
about the market.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.360
You may have heard
this incredible stat

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.020
from the keynote
a few days ago--

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.900
2 billion monthly active
devices on Android today.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.550
That's pretty good, right?

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.340
These are billions
of users that you

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.660
can reach through
Google Play billing

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.530
with a simple integration.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.920
We enable you to sell your
subscriptions to billions

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.620
of users across the world.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.030
Now, this is pretty cool,
but it's also somewhat scary.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.630
It's pretty complex
to put together

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.190
a subscription business.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.030
Think of it-- you have to
worry about local market

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.436
understanding,
regulations, taxes.

00:11:44.436 --> 00:11:46.310
I mean, who doesn't love
to think about taxes

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.970
across the world, right?

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.600
Refunds, order
management-- so many things

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.660
have to come together to create
a compelling subscription

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.320
product.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.480
Luckily, we take all
of that away from you.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.360
We do a huge amount of that for
you so that all you have to do

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.040
is plug and play,
no pun intended.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.000
So Coffee Meets
Bagel, for example,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.850
is a case study of an app in
the dating space who typically

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.580
had been using in-app
purchases, but wanted

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.357
to get in on the all the
frenzy around subscriptions

00:12:25.357 --> 00:12:26.940
and wanted to introduce
a subscription

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.400
SKU in their product.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.050
By partnering with
Google Play, they

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.990
were able to do so very quickly,
and within a few months,

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.670
they were offering a
subscription SKU globally

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.480
without having to worry about
local payment integrations,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.660
various regulations, et cetera.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.610
All they did is create
a subscription SKU,

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.910
integrate with Play Billing,
and now subscriptions generate

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.000
40% of the revenue for
Coffee Meets Bagel.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.580
All right, so we've
established that the audience

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.960
for subscription
services is out there,

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.930
engaged, and willing to pay.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.310
The Android market is
huge, with billions

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.930
of users that you can
reach, and that it's

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.910
very easy to integrate
with Google Play Billing.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.440
So now, Larry will tell us
about the billing platform

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.470
and how the global reach and
innovative features of Play

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.400
Billing can really help you
propel your subscription

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.290
business to success.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.526
Larry?

00:13:25.526 --> 00:13:27.020
LARRY YANG: Thanks, George.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.450
Good morning, everyone.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.740
My name is Larry Yang.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.700
I'm the product manager for the
Google Play billing platform.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.660
When I think about
subscription success,

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.120
I think it really just comes
down to two key factors--

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.870
acquisition and retention.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.060
Let me walk you through
some of the key features

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.460
that the Play Billing
platform provides

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.135
to help you in these two areas.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.110
First, let's talk
about acquisition.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.610
Play Billing offers
three important tools

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.020
to help you acquire new users.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.580
We bring you our
extensive payment reach,

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.260
we have amazing
introductory features,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.730
and last, but probably
most important,

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.502
we have an amazingly simple
user payment experience.

00:14:13.502 --> 00:14:15.210
Let's talk about our
payment reach first.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:23.110
Google Play Billing is available
in over 130 countries today.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.510
But it's not enough just to
offer any old form of payment.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:30.000
You need to offer the
preferred form of payment.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.430
And it turns out,
payment preferation

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.520
is more a function
of culture than it

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.810
is socioeconomic status.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.960
For example, in North
America, of course,

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.820
credit cards are very popular.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.260
But it turns out Paypal is
super important in Germany

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.950
and other European countries.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.790
In regions where
cash is still king,

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:59.320
our Play credit and gift
cards have been a big hit.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.400
And in the Asia Pacific region
and throughout the Middle East,

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.730
carrier billing is a must-have.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.310
Let me talk a little bit more
about these last two-- gift

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.790
cards and carrier billing.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.320
We've offered our gift
cards for a while now

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.690
to allow users to
purchase Play content,

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.480
and earlier this year,
we extended that ability

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.420
to subscriptions.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.160
In areas where cash
is still very popular,

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.100
we've seen a tremendous
increase in subscriptions spent,

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.610
in some areas, as high as 15%.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.200
So we're super excited to
bring this new form of payment

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.850
to your subscriptions business.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.910
Now, let's talk a bit
about carrier billing.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.330
Earlier this week,
you might have

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.390
heard us announce that we
now have billing partnerships

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.510
with over 140 mobile carriers.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.710
And across all
those partnerships,

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:58.000
we now reach 900
million active devices.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.380
That's 900 million
devices whose users

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.000
can now pay for your content
directly from their phone.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.500
They don't need a credit card.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.010
They don't need a bank account.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.510
They just need their phone.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.410
So those are a few examples
of our payment reach

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.260
and how that helps you
grow your business.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.240
Now, let's talk about some
of our flexible introductory

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.600
capabilities.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.600
We've had free trial
support for a while now.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.220
It's a great way for you
to introduce your content

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.250
to prospective subscribers
without them having

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.670
to make a long-term commitment.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.810
It turns out, when we talk
to users, over 3/4 of them

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.490
started a subscription
offering with some sort

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.690
of free experience.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:49.100
So it's no wonder that almost
all of our top subscription

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.170
apps and partners all offer
some sort of free experience.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.600
Now, in addition to free
trials, last year, we

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.900
offered introductory pricing.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.790
This gives you the ability
to offer a limited time

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.990
discount for your service.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.869
When we talked to
users, we learned

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:12.470
that getting some
sort of a discount

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.810
was the number two
driver for conversion,

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.589
and that was second only
to the desire of wanting

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.470
to get continued and
additional content.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.359
And that makes sense.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.930
After all, who doesn't
love a great deal?

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.890
GEORGE AUDI: Larry,
actually, a great example

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.010
of a developer who ran
an introductory pricing

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:31.860
campaign is Anghami.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.710
Anghami is the leading music
streaming service in the Middle

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.230
East, and they have a
premium access which allows

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.160
you to get unlimited music.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.680
Now, Anghami is usually
priced at $5 a month,

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.950
but they did a weekend promotion
where they offered the service

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.350
for $3 for three months.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.060
So that's about 80% in savings.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.890
The results were impressive.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:56.520
They saw a 400% increase
in daily average orders

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.240
during that weekend compared to
their average daily sign-ups.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.040
That's five times the number of
buyers going in and signing up

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.400
to the service.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.700
And interestingly,
after three months,

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.910
after the promotion was over,
the majority of these users

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.900
actually ended up staying
on the service and recurring

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.415
at full price.

00:18:16.415 --> 00:18:17.540
LARRY YANG: Thanks, George.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.740
That's a great example of
how one of our developers

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.140
is seeing subscription
success with our platform.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.310
So now, let me talk
about our third tool that

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.220
helps you acquire new users--

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.380
our seamless user
payment experience.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.610
Imagine a free-for-all
world where

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:38.184
users have to read multiple
different terms of services.

00:18:38.184 --> 00:18:40.100
They have to enter their
sensitive information

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.050
multiple times--

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.190
sometimes their address,
sometimes their zip code,

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.220
sometimes other
information-- and they

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.290
have to do that over,
and over, and over again.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.810
Well, that nightmare is over.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.350
Play Billing makes it simple.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.230
The user enters their
payment information

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.880
once and never again.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.290
And it turns out that the
majority of our purchases

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:05.190
finish without the user
having to enter their payment

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.610
information.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.080
And besides, as a
developer, do you really

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.720
want to be maintaining
and managing all

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.920
of that sensitive information?

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.660
Of course not.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.540
So instead of entering
their information

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.670
with multiple companies, they
just do it once with Google.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.640
And when we asked
users how felt,

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.530
they told us it just feels safe.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.070
And why does safety
and trust matter?

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.730
It turns out the
more users trust

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.600
the company they work
with, the more likely

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.420
they're going to spend money.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.680
68% of users associate trust
with making a purchase.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.770
That was the number
one correlated factor

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.389
in this survey.

00:19:47.389 --> 00:19:48.930
GEORGE AUDI: Larry,
I'm standing here

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.388
because I have a feeling I'm
going to keep interrupting you

00:19:51.388 --> 00:19:52.846
throughout.

00:19:52.846 --> 00:19:56.640
Actually, I just want to add
that this seamless experience,

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.970
and this trust that developers
put into Google Play,

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.590
and the ease of the
flow delivers results.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.200
We've seen that at the
moment of purchase,

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.720
you really want to
capture this intent

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.900
with as minimal
friction as possible,

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.800
as few steps as possible.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.920
With Google Play Billing, you
can do it with only two steps,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.430
and this is translating into
positive conversion results

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.890
for some of our partners.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.850
For example, the
"New York Times,"

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.600
when they introduce
Google Play Billing,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.850
they saw a 125%
increase in conversions

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.160
just one month after doing so.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.640
Univision NOW, when they
launched their subscription

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.310
service and moved it from
a web-based payment flow

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.710
to Google Play Billing, they
saw a spike of three to four

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.160
times conversion lift.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.570
And you saw on the video
about [? Le Matinal, ?]

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.940
which sees 6% better
conversions on Androids

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.240
than on non-Android platforms.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.410
So if you look at
this all together,

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:57.380
this means that we take the
effort out of implementation,

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.910
but we also deliver results.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.540
And this is why HBO
decided to use and rely

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:07.260
on Google Play Billing for their
subscription service HBO Now,

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.110
because we allow an end-to-end
experience to users where they

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.240
don't have to remove their
credit card from their wallet,

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.670
but we also allow an
end-to-end payment platform

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.510
for HBO, which enables
them to, again,

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.690
just plug and play and
get going immediately.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.140
LARRY YANG: Thanks, George.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.530
So those are some
examples of how

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.710
our payment reach, our
introductory features,

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:32.420
and our payment experience
help you acquire new users.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.236
So now that you have all
these great, happy, new users,

00:21:35.236 --> 00:21:36.610
let me talk about
a couple things

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:41.450
we do to help you keep
them, help you retain them.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.770
So last year, we
launched a feature--

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.310
Grace Period.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:49.040
Grace Period is a way for you to
give your users three or seven

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.330
extra days to correct any
sort of payment issues

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.330
that might have happened
when they were renewing

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.070
their subscription.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.520
Well, it turns
out the developers

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.490
who are using Grace
Period are seeing

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.550
over a 50% improvement
in recovery

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.070
from those sorts of
involuntary cancellations.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.970
So if you're a developer
with subscriptions,

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.840
and you're not already
using Grace Period,

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.670
you really should just get
on the Play console right

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.860
now and turn on that feature.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:20.320
It's literally just
flipping a switch.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.770
But there's still a
problem with Grace Period.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.270
Users are lazy.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.000
It's just too easy for them
to dismiss a notification

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.860
or ignore an email and
keep consuming your content

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.586
without having to pay for it.

00:22:33.586 --> 00:22:35.210
So today, I'm pleased
to announce we're

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.825
rolling out a new feature--

00:22:36.825 --> 00:22:38.900
Account Hold.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.720
With Account Hold, we work
with you to block access

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.110
to your precious content.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.560
So now we've increased
the level of pain

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.300
just enough for the user.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.330
Now they need to
actually go and fix

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:55.900
that form of payment in order to
restore access to your content.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.390
We have over a dozen developers
in Early Access right now using

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.990
Account Hold, and we
plan on bringing that

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.106
out a little later next month.

00:23:05.106 --> 00:23:06.730
GEORGE AUDI: So we
piloted this feature

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.390
with KeepSafe, which is one
of those developers who were

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.090
in the Early Access program.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.080
KeepSafe is an app which
allows you to store your photos

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.500
and videos and protect
them so you can have PIN

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.789
protection around your videos.

00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:21.330
They're very popular on Android,
and they have a subscription

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.770
business which allows
you, as a premium user,

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.880
to access your
photos in the Cloud

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.000
and various other
exciting features.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.614
Now, because their
subscription service

00:23:31.614 --> 00:23:33.030
is really important
for them, they

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:37.870
integrated with Account Hold,
and they saw this 25% increase

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.870
in renewal rates on Androids.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.030
And this is because,
to Larry's point, when

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.860
users get this notification that
their account will be suspended

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.990
unless they change
their form of payment,

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.610
they are much more likely
to go and act on it.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.870
So these are a few examples
of how the Google Play Billing

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.450
platform helps you build
a successful subscription

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.580
business.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.100
And speaking of success,
one of the partners

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.140
that we have worked
with very closely

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.840
is Netflix, which is
the leading subscription

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.460
service in the world.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.150
We've partnered very
closely with them

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.470
to enable them to scale
their app globally,

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.310
but also to make payment
effortless through Google

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:24.460
Play Billing for Netflix
subscribers around the world.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.590
The figures and the acquisition
and the retention numbers

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.750
that Netflix is seeing
through Google Play Billing

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.370
are very promising and are
delivering subscription success

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.386
in over 100 countries.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.100
LARRY YANG: But that's not all.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.270
Our team's been
listening to you,

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.820
and they're hard at work on
a number of new capabilities

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.000
that we'll be rolling out soon.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.670
We're going to give you more
flexibility in how you set up

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.440
and offer your SKUs.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.330
We're going to make it easier
for you to change prices

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.990
on your existing subscriptions.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.010
We're going to give you more
up-to-date information when

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.970
a subscription status changes,
say, when a user cancels

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.960
or they go on hold.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.720
And we're going
to make it easier

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.780
for you to integrate and
test with Play Billing.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.730
So stay tuned over
the next few months.

00:25:14.815 --> 00:25:16.830
So now that you have all
these amazing new tools

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:20.370
at your fingertips, how do
you know which ones to try?

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.010
How do you know what's working?

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.172
How do you know which
ones aren't working?

00:25:24.172 --> 00:25:25.880
Well, in order to
answer those questions,

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.070
you need fantastic
insights and reporting.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.820
Tom, why don't you
share some of the stuff

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.599
that your team is
working on in this area?

00:25:32.599 --> 00:25:33.390
TOM GRINSTED: Cool.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:34.110
Thanks, Larry.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.190
Hello again, everybody.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:40.072
So I work with teams in
Google Play, some of whom

00:25:40.072 --> 00:25:41.280
are actually in the audience.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.000
Hello, everyone.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.960
Now, the huge advantage
of Google Play

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.420
is that we are, for all
intents and purposes,

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.660
the single point of truth
for a number of key events

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.870
in your life cycle.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.530
These are events like people
looking at your Play Store

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:01.550
listing, installing your app,
taking out your free trial,

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:05.090
or every single recurrent
payment for a subscriber.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.210
Now, it's that team's job
to get that information out

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:12.790
to you guys in a way which
is actionable and insightful.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:16.616
Basically, we're dedicated in
getting subscription metrics

00:26:16.616 --> 00:26:18.740
out to all developers who
are running subscriptions

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.210
businesses.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.210
If I'm honest, the Play
console hasn't been fantastic

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.650
at that in the past.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.320
But we know that you need
that information to run

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.470
your businesses
and make decisions,

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.710
which is why I'm really happy
to say that earlier this week,

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.890
we launched a brand-new
part of the Play console--

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.380
the Subscriptions dashboard.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.360
The Subscriptions
dashboard is easily

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.260
found in the Revenue
section on the Play menu,

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.360
and it pulls together key
overarching information

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.020
about your subs.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.540
So, for instance, it easily
plots total subscriptions

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:57.500
and new activations and
cancellations all in one place.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.340
It also pulls together
your bottom line,

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:05.550
so it shows you your daily
and 30-day rolling revenue.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.640
And lastly, it even
easily displays your top

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.810
performing products.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.890
Taken together, this
dashboard is a brilliant place

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.880
to gain insights, to
look at your trends,

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.180
and to spot anomalies.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.450
But when you do
that, you're even

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.060
going to want to
know more, right?

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.130
You're going to see
something, and you're

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.360
going to want to dive into
it and really understand

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.270
what's going on.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.060
Now, when you do
want to know more,

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.330
we have the bottom
half of the dashboard.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.460
This is a super
powerful cohortized view

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:44.030
of new subscribers, And
it looks at the three

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.250
key parts of your
subscription life cycle--

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.270
acquisition, retention,
and cancellation.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.260
So let's take a look at each
one of those nice and quickly.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.770
Now, to start off with,
we've got acquisition--

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:01.810
how you acquire new subscribers,
where they came from,

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.510
and also, which
acquisition channels they

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.820
were coming in from as well.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.290
Now, this card is
lovely, but it's not

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.290
the only information we have.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.970
So the Acquisition Report,
like the other two,

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:17.410
has a really powerful
click-through report as well.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:19.690
So this gives you
much more information

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.000
about your subscriptions
acquisition.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.980
It's built on the really
successful acquisition

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.510
reports you can already
find in the Play console,

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.950
but it's tailored specifically
to your subscriptions business.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:34.050
So you can see not only which
of your acquisition channels

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.890
drove the highest number of
free trialists or installs,

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.830
but also which drove
the largest number

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:45.470
of long-term, recurrent,
high-value subscribers.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.710
Like the current acquisition
channels, we have breakdowns.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:50.220
So you can see it
if you're using

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.030
UTM tagging against every
single one of your campaigns.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.500
You can link to
AdWords to see it

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.670
against your paid-for
campaigns with Google.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.280
Or you can even look at which
Google Search traffic drives

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.740
the highest number of
long-term subscribers.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.690
It's a super
powerful way for you

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.190
to gain insights so you
can decide where you're

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.570
going to focus your
acquisition effort

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.360
and your acquisition
budget to get

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.720
you the highest number
of high-value recurrent

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.920
subscribers.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.050
So what do you do next?

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.560
What do you do when you've
got these subscribers?

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.180
Well, you want to
know what happens

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.570
to them with your subscription.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:31.880
And for that, we've got the
Subscriptions Retention Report.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.080
This is brand-new,
and personally, I

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.580
think it's my favorite report.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.540
It gives you a
cohort of subscribers

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.130
from different subscriptions
so you can plot different subs

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.670
against each other.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.670
It allows you to see key parts
of your subscription life

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:47.650
cycles.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.960
So in this case, this
developer can easily

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.490
see that just after
their free trial,

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:55.400
they see a large
drop-off in subscribers.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.890
This enables you to make really
impactful product decisions.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.320
In this case, the
developer might

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.830
choose to remind
their subscribers just

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.340
before their free trial ends of
what an amazing offer they have

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.330
or how fantastic
all the content is.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:13.090
But that's not the
only thing this does.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.400
This report also allows you
to easily select subscriptions

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.410
to compare to each other.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.230
So if you've got a
brand-new subscription--

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.347
maybe it's a test one;
it's an experiment--

00:30:23.347 --> 00:30:24.930
and you want to see
if it's performing

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:29.560
better or worse than your legacy
subs, you can easily see it.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.370
And this enables you to make
really cool decisions, right?

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.960
In this case, the developer
might say, hey, look,

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.760
my subscription that's
represented by the red line,

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.820
clearly outperforming
the other ones,

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.400
this is the one I'm going to
put front and center in my app.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.030
This is the one I'm going
to push to my users.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.010
The Retention Report
enables you to make

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:52.530
the decisions that lead to
higher-value, longer-term

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:54.645
retained subscribers.

00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:56.770
GEORGE AUDI: We actually
showed some of these mocks

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.300
to some developers
and workshops,

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.430
and the feedback has
been very positive.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.640
So we're really excited for
all of you guys to try it out.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.060
Glu is a developer of
subscription games,

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.940
and they were very excited
about this feature, the SKU

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.070
comparison one.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.710
TOM GRINSTED: Yeah,
they loved it.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:12.980
It was great to see as well.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.950
Thank you.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:18.240
So lastly, we've got
this sad report, right?

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.170
We've got the
Cancellation Report.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.280
Nobody likes people
canceling your subscriptions,

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.240
but it does happen.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.430
And the first step in
making it happen less

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:35.220
is to accept that it
happens and to find out why.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.410
And for that, we've got
the Cancellation Report.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:42.120
Now, for the first time,
the Cancellation Report

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.780
in the Play console allows
you to see the exact day

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.470
that subscribers
choose to cancel.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:49.970
And to make it
really useful for you

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:53.380
guys to be able to work out
why, we helpfully categorize

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.500
these cancellations as well.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.740
So let's take a look
at those categories.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.960
To start off, we've got
voluntary cancellations.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.650
Voluntary
cancellations are where

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:06.610
a user goes into the Play
app, finds your subscription,

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.216
and just taps "Cancel."

00:32:08.216 --> 00:32:10.470
If you've got high
voluntary cancellations,

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.850
you can start doing
things like price testing.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.806
Or maybe you want to
look at what value

00:32:14.806 --> 00:32:16.180
you're offering
as part your sub,

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.430
or simply reminding users about
what a great value subscription

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.310
you really have.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:27.290
Next, we've got Voluntary
Cancellation and Uninstall.

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.030
This is where someone not
only cancels your sub,

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.190
but after 30 days, they've
uninstalled your app

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.483
from every single
one of your devices.

00:32:36.483 --> 00:32:37.844
GEORGE AUDI: That's painful.

00:32:37.844 --> 00:32:39.010
TOM GRINSTED: Yeah, painful.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:41.810
This is not a good cancellation.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:46.230
If you've got high voluntary
and uninstall cancellations

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:47.660
this is the kind
of plan where you

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.820
want to start looking at
the new Android Vitals

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.560
section on the Play console to
take a look at whether you've

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.030
got high crashes, high
NRs, or a janky app.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:58.750
Or maybe you want to take a
look at our new Advanced Reviews

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:02.190
Analysis to see what users
are telling you about your app

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.290
and where you can improve it.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.560
And lastly, we've got
involuntary cancellations.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.580
These are classically associated
with payment failures.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.580
If you've got high
involuntary cancellations,

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.080
then the kind of
features that Larry

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.720
spoke about earlier like
Grace Periods and Account Hold

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.230
are exactly what you
should be looking at.

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.320
And the Cancellation
Report, especially when

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.860
it comes to Account
Hold, enables

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.670
you to build the
business model to be

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.490
able to put your Android
devs onto Account Hold

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:29.650
to build that feature out.

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:31.830
Taken together, this
gives you a view

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:35.580
into cancellations, which you've
never been able to have before.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.340
But sometimes it's hard
to tell what to do,

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.390
so having that insight
is only the first step.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:45.550
So launching with the
Cancellation Report,

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:49.790
then we're also starting to add
more and more active guidance.

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:52.880
This is where our teams
are saying to you, hey,

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.350
we've noticed this anomally.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:55.880
You might want to try this tool.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.350
It will help your
business get better.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:04.720
So that is the dashboard,
a brand-new way

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.050
to look at all of your
subscriptions data on the Play

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:09.860
console, all in one place.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.130
I'm really happy to say
that all of the time series

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.840
trends that you can
see up on the screens

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:18.159
now are available today
in the Play console.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.639
And the second half,
those cohortized views

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:24.810
and click-throughs, will be
launched in the coming weeks.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.710
I'd like to take just a second
to say why I and the teams

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.540
here really care about this.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.469
We really, really care
about getting all of you

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.800
better subscriptions reporting.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.800
And that's because we know that
better reporting allows all

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.159
of you to have better insights.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.650
And the better your
subscriptions insights are,

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:46.400
the better the decisions
you make around them.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.830
And the better decisions
you make around them,

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:52.219
the better businesses you
build, and the more successful

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:55.105
apps you run on Android.

00:34:55.105 --> 00:34:57.480
GEORGE AUDI: Do you know who
really cares about this too,

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.020
Tom?

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:58.320
TOM GRINSTED: Who?

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.377
GEORGE AUDI: Tinder.

00:34:59.377 --> 00:35:01.710
They said they will swipe
right to your new subscription

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:03.350
dashboard, so that's a match.

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.100
TOM GRINSTED: George,
all I've ever wanted

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.850
is someone to swipe right.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:08.590
And I will take
on the dashboard.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:14.400
LARRY YANG: All
right, so to wrap up,

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.220
what's all the fuss about?

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.320
Well, George told
you earlier about

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.750
how subscriptions is one of
the fastest growing businesses

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.570
and how a lot of developers
are already today taking

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.540
advantage of Android and Play
to grow their subscriptions

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.685
business.

00:35:28.685 --> 00:35:30.310
TOM GRINSTED: And
if, at the beginning,

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:32.018
you really wanted to
know about the tools

00:35:32.018 --> 00:35:33.450
that we have to
help you succeed,

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:36.160
Larry shared both existing
and brand-new tools

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.532
to help you really drive our
acquisition and your retention.

00:35:40.532 --> 00:35:42.240
GEORGE AUDI: And across
it all, if you're

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.060
looking to improve
your subscription

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.780
business through
insights and reporting,

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.820
which can power your
decision-making,

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.990
Tom shared the latest in our
powerful new subscriptions

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.620
reporting tools.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.810
So taken together,
all of this means

00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:01.600
that Android is a great platform
to reach users, convert them,

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.790
generate more
revenue out of them,

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:08.060
and do so more regularly and
more reliably than ever before.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.680
So thank you so
much for attending.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.410
We will be here to take any
questions you might have.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:14.790
So there are microphones
on each side of the room.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.748
But before we do so, we
want to thank you again

00:36:16.748 --> 00:36:18.800
for being here on behalf
of all three of us,

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.800
and we hope that you found
this session helpful.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.670
