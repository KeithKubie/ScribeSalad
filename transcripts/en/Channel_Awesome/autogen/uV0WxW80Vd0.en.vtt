you may think it is his voice is very

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.530
distinct and very clear it's nice to
listen to he's over the top moments are

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540
listen to he's over the top moments are
 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.930
listen to he's over the top moments are
much more restrained despite an obvious

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940
much more restrained despite an obvious
 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.120
much more restrained despite an obvious
over-the-top design and I think he can

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130
over-the-top design and I think he can
 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.449
over-the-top design and I think he can
get across the series moments ok that is

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
get across the series moments ok that is
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.090
get across the series moments ok that is

ghosts now don't get me wrong the idea

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299
ghosts now don't get me wrong the idea
 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.910
ghosts now don't get me wrong the idea
of having the actor who plays Scrooge

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920
of having the actor who plays Scrooge
 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.770
of having the actor who plays Scrooge
play the other goes I actually think is

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780
play the other goes I actually think is
 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.770
play the other goes I actually think is
kind of clever like they're all sort of

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780
kind of clever like they're all sort of
 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.509
kind of clever like they're all sort of
representations of him or variations and

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519
representations of him or variations and
 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.219
representations of him or variations and
when they quote his own lines back to

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229
when they quote his own lines back to
 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.469
when they quote his own lines back to
him it's all the more effective if he is

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479
him it's all the more effective if he is
 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.500
him it's all the more effective if he is
to die he had better do it and decrease

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510
to die he had better do it and decrease
 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.029
to die he had better do it and decrease
the surplus population I think that's

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039
the surplus population I think that's
 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.610
the surplus population I think that's
actually kind of a cool idea but yeah

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620
actually kind of a cool idea but yeah
 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.990
actually kind of a cool idea but yeah
they're pretty awkward

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000
they're pretty awkward
 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.370
they're pretty awkward

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.430
to the camera yeah it's pretty annoying
so that's one thing to have the actor

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440
so that's one thing to have the actor
 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.960
so that's one thing to have the actor
who played Scrooge also played the ghost

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970
who played Scrooge also played the ghost
 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.390
who played Scrooge also played the ghost
but why is it a lot of the actors and

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400
but why is it a lot of the actors and
 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.040
but why is it a lot of the actors and
the other parts are playing other roles

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050
the other parts are playing other roles
 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.830
the other parts are playing other roles

I mean okay Gary Oldman and Colin Firth
 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.240
I mean okay Gary Oldman and Colin Firth

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250
I mean they can hide their voices a
 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.940
I mean they can hide their voices a
little bit but I hear Bob Hoskins voice

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950
little bit but I hear Bob Hoskins voice
 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.920
little bit but I hear Bob Hoskins voice
like six or seven times in this thing

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930
like six or seven times in this thing
 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.450
like six or seven times in this thing
and that is one of the most distinct

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460
and that is one of the most distinct
 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.970
and that is one of the most distinct
voices on the planet he's a great actor

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980

voices on the planet he's a great actor
one of my favorites but when you're

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600
one of my favorites but when you're
 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.090
one of my favorites but when you're
trying to play them in an animated film

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100
trying to play them in an animated film
 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.860
trying to play them in an animated film
and trying to pawn off that these are

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870
and trying to pawn off that these are
 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.690
and trying to pawn off that these are
different people when clearly it's

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700
different people when clearly it's
 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.730
different people when clearly it's
always Bob Hoskins it's really

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740
always Bob Hoskins it's really
 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.130
always Bob Hoskins it's really
distracting how about the motion capture

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140
distracting how about the motion capture
 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.950
distracting how about the motion capture
people always have a real love or hate

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960
people always have a real love or hate
 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.990
people always have a real love or hate
feeling towards this because a lot of

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000
feeling towards this because a lot of
 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.210
feeling towards this because a lot of
times they feel like well they feel it's

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220
times they feel like well they feel it's
 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.770
times they feel like well they feel it's
brave for the actors because the actors

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780
brave for the actors because the actors
 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.480
brave for the actors because the actors
can actually a mode and it's their

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490
can actually a mode and it's their
 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.980
can actually a mode and it's their
performance and it works much better

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990
performance and it works much better
 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.960
performance and it works much better
blending them into the CG environment

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970
blending them into the CG environment
 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.700
blending them into the CG environment
because they're already CG themselves

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710
because they're already CG themselves
 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.830
because they're already CG themselves
however a lot of people feel that's a

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840
however a lot of people feel that's a
 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.000
however a lot of people feel that's a
problem because that takes the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010
problem because that takes the
 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.920
problem because that takes the
performance away from the animator so

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930
performance away from the animator so
 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.080
performance away from the animator so
now the animator can't a moat unless he

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090
now the animator can't a moat unless he
 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.730
now the animator can't a moat unless he
just wants to stick to the performance

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740
just wants to stick to the performance
 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.010
just wants to stick to the performance
that while the actor is giving and it

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020
that while the actor is giving and it
 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.480
that while the actor is giving and it
definitely looks weird when you have

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490
definitely looks weird when you have
 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.280
definitely looks weird when you have
some scenes of people that look really

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290
some scenes of people that look really
 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.290
some scenes of people that look really
realistic but then other scenes like

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300
realistic but then other scenes like
 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.540
realistic but then other scenes like
this they're so distinctly cartoony and

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550
this they're so distinctly cartoony and
 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.240
this they're so distinctly cartoony and
really sort of ruin the tone they just

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250
really sort of ruin the tone they just
 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.990
really sort of ruin the tone they just
don't match up

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000
don't match up
 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.909
don't match up
I guess I'm sort of half-and-half but

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919
I guess I'm sort of half-and-half but
 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.980
I guess I'm sort of half-and-half but
yeah I guess I do sort of prefer it

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990
yeah I guess I do sort of prefer it
 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.780
yeah I guess I do sort of prefer it
either being more the actor or more the

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790
either being more the actor or more the
 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.750
either being more the actor or more the
animator so maybe it's best this sort of

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760
animator so maybe it's best this sort of
 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.730
animator so maybe it's best this sort of
face sensor technology isn't being done

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740
face sensor technology isn't being done
 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.130
face sensor technology isn't being done
anymore but who knows maybe somebody can

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140
anymore but who knows maybe somebody can
 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.050
anymore but who knows maybe somebody can
take it to a new dimension I'm open to

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060

like myself is there nothing worth
 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.830
like myself is there nothing worth
recommending in this film actually not

only do I think there is some really
 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.830
only do I think there is some really
good stuff in this film but I think it's

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840
good stuff in this film but I think it's
 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.630
good stuff in this film but I think it's
some of the best I've ever seen in any

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640
some of the best I've ever seen in any
 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.000
some of the best I've ever seen in any
movie but like I said just some certain

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010
movie but like I said just some certain
 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.340
