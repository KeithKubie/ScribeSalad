IAN LAKE: What if you
had a Google engineer

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.474
to support your app
development and they

00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:06.390
dealt with supporting
every version of Android

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.098
or building those
basic components so you

00:00:08.098 --> 00:00:08.960
don't have to?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.100
We've got you covered.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.430
What if you, like me,
had spent ages building

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.650
a great modern UI,
only to find more edge

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.410
cases to handle to get
it great on every device?

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.740
We've got you covered.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.960
What if your boss says you need
to support Google Cast, Ware,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.910
TV, and Auto by tomorrow?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.230
We've got you covered.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.190
The Android Support
Library gives you

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.470
the tools to build apps faster.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.350
We've packaged the
essential components

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.130
you need to build
a great app that

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.936
works on the huge variety of
Android devices out there.

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:37.310
It's like having
Googlers helping

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.010
you every step of the way.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.840
I'm Ian Lake.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.540
I'm here to talk to you about
what the Support Library is,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.010
and why you should use it.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.720
OK.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.760
Hear me out.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.430
Shouldn't the newest
version of Android

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910
have everything you need?

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.120
It does have quite a bit.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.830
But think of it more like
the foundation of a house.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.410
A solid but inflexible base
to build your app on top of.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.260
The Support Library
is the framing

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.340
you actually build
your app around,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.230
letting you build
apps faster and focus

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.410
on the important part,
the unique experiences

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.650
only your app provides.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.370
So maybe this
framework is helpful.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.387
But what does that
exactly entail?

00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:14.220
Well, we've talked about
the Support Library

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.370
as single library.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.200
It's actually a whole
constellation of libraries.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.012
Yeah.

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.530
There's a lot there.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.560
Thankfully, you don't
have to use all of it.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.700
You can choose exactly what
makes sense for your app.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.200
So you may have
noticed this library

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.020
at the base of just
about everything?

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.980
That's the support-v4 library,
providing compatibility shims

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.980
and new functionality
for devices

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.950
all the way back to Android 1.6.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.430
It includes support for
application components--

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.100
like fragments-- notification
enhancements for Ware and Auto,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.090
and more.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.450
Support for common UI
patterns, like paging

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.130
through content, tabs,
and navigation drawers.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.960
And makes it easy to
load and share content.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.500
As well as a ton of classes
to make your life easier.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.490
And you see all those components
with stars next to them?

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.290
Those are unique to
the Support Library,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.670
making this an essential
part of any app,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.240
even if you're targeting only
the latest Android versions.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.160
So they've got the big
one out of the way.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.009
Phew.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.720
Believe me, if they
were all like that,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.500
we'd be here all day.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.810
You may have heard of this
material design thing.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.540
A fresh new look for Android,
iOS, the web, and everything.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.540
The appcompal library makes
it easy to give your app

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.830
a material code of paint
all the way back to API 7,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.530
through a custom theme and a
backward compatible version

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.080
of the AppBar framework.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.830
I can't tell you
how critical this

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.020
is for making a modern-looking
Android app that looks great

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.360
on the latest devices, yet
doesn't have you pulling

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.900
your hair out supporting the
thousands of Android devices

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.104
out there.

00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:43.270
So what else could there be?

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.140
You've got a beautiful app
using familiar UI patterns.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.410
So the question becomes, how do
you take it to the next level?

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.620
Perhaps you have some
fantastic video content

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.500
that would look great on a TV.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.420
The mediarouter library
provides the Cast button,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.770
needed to get your
content to Google Cast

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.910
devices like Chromecast
and the Nexus player.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.240
Or take it a step farther, and
build out a great Android TV

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.600
app using the leanback library.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.674
Maybe your app has
fantastic pictures.

00:03:09.674 --> 00:03:11.965
In that case, you might want
to use the palette library

00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:15.550
to pull out prominent colors
from those pictures and color

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.560
coordinate your UI.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.260
Perhaps you need a
bit more UI polish

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.580
to really make your
app pop off the screen.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.790
The cardview library builds
a consistent card look

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.335
that fits in perfectly
with material design.

00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:29.850
The gridlayout library
gives you an easy way

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.460
to align elements to a
grid without requiring

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.040
a complicated relative layout
or multiple linear layouts.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.230
The recyclerview serves as
a more flexible and animated

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.190
replacement to
listview, making it

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.330
easy to build lists and
grids that react to changing

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.250
data in a beautiful way.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.735
But maybe pixel pushing
isn't your thing.

00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:51.350
You can use annotations
from the annotations library

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.990
to give extra hints
to the compiler

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.240
and catch even more
errors at build time,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.170
rather than your app
misbehaving at run time.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.590
Or you want to do some
serious parallel processing.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.780
Renderscript is
perfect for that.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.260
Finally, if your
code should ever

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.050
grow beyond the 65,000
method decks limit

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.090
that exists on
pre-Lollipop devices,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.480
the multidex library can
keep your app building.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.570
So there's a ton out
there, all serving

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.490
as the framing which can help
you build apps faster and work

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.450
across a wide range
of Android devices,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.690
letting you focus on
the unique experiences

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.800
only your app provides.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.440
You can learn even more about
all the parts of the Support

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.520
Library on the developer site.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.130
I'm excited to see
what you can build

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.860
with the help of the
Android Support Library.
