00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:04.500
 We have 2 2/3 plus 8 3/4 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.073
 and I recommend you stop the video 

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:08.848
 and try to calculate this alone. 

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:10.246
 Let's solve it together. 

00:00:10.246 --> 00:00:12.503
 There are several ways we can solve the phrase. 

00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:14.721
 I will do it in several different ways. 

00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:16.409
 One way you may see, 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.887
 is to write the phrase, 

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:23.211
 just write 2 2/3 plus 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.220
 plus 8 3/4. 

00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:30.033
 Plus 8 3/4. You can say, 

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:32.064
 why am I recording it like this? 

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:34.014
 When you write the number so, 

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:36.781
 that these are the fractional parts of the mixed numbers, 

00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:38.807
 these are the whole parts of the mixed numbers, 

00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:40.630
 and we can collect them separately. 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.899
 Before we start collecting the fragments 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.617
 of the mixed number, 

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:46.323
 that they have different denominators. 

00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:48.151
 We have 3 and 4, 

00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:50.821
 so it would be good to find a common denominator. 

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.719
 So far we have seen several times, 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.157
 that when we collect fractions with different denominators, 

00:00:55.157 --> 00:00:56.892
 the best common denominator 

00:00:56.892 --> 00:00:58.266
 is their least common fold. 

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.710
 The smallest total fold of 3 and 4. 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.115
 What is this number? 

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:04.314
 Let's see the multiples of 4. 

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:07.947
 4 is not divisible to 3 without residue. 

00:01:07.947 --> 00:01:10.443
 8 is not divisible to 3 without residue. 

00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:13.628
 12 is divided, in fact 12 is 4 in 3. 

00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:16.291
 Then I can write down the two fragments 

00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.433
 with denominator 12. 

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:20.757
 This will be equal to ... 

00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:22.425
 I'll write it like that. 

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:26.662
 I can record it as 2 

00:01:26.662 --> 00:01:29.686
 and something on 12. 

00:01:29.686 --> 00:01:31.264
 What will this thing be on 12? 

00:01:31.264 --> 00:01:33.133
 To get 12 out of 3 in the denominator, 

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.048
 multiply by 4, 

00:01:35.048 --> 00:01:37.492
 but I have to multiply by 4 and the numerator. 

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:40.278
 2 in 4 is 8. 

00:01:40.278 --> 00:01:42.605
 2/3 is equal to 8/12, 

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:46.535
 and 2 2/3 equals 2 8/12. 

00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:48.316
 We can do the same here. 

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.460
 8 3/4 will be equal to 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.707
 8 and something on 12. 

00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:56.235
 To get 12 out of 4 in the denominator, 

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:57.703
 multiply by 3, 

00:01:57.703 --> 00:02:00.019
 but we need to multiply the numerator by 3. 

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:04.726
 3 in 3 is 9, and now we can collect them. 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.407
 We can get the numbers. And what do we get? 

00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:11.063
 We have 8/12 plus 9/12. 

00:02:11.063 --> 00:02:14.294
 This will be equal to 17, 

00:02:14.294 --> 00:02:16.737
 17/12. 

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:18.582
 Maybe you can see that 17/12 

00:02:18.582 --> 00:02:22.204
 is greater than or equal to 1, and we can ... 

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:24.781
 This is an irregular liver here, 

00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:27.265
 and we can record it 

00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:29.081
 as a mixed number. 

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:30.207
 Let's make things clear. 

00:02:30.207 --> 00:02:34.334
 17/12, we will record it here. 

00:02:34.334 --> 00:02:37.551
 17/12 is equal to 

00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:40.053
 1 5/12. 

00:02:40.053 --> 00:02:41.341
 How did I know that? 

00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:45.971
 12 is contained at 17 once with residue 5. 

00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:48.633
 17/12 equals 1 5/12. 

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:51.564
 What I can do is write down part 5/12 

00:02:51.564 --> 00:02:54.802
 in the fractions, 

00:02:54.802 --> 00:02:57.501
 or in the fraction of our numbers, 

00:02:57.501 --> 00:02:59.293
 then regrouping the unit, 

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:01.158
 put it in the column of the integer. 

00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:03.681
 Now I can collect 1 plus 2, 

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:07.159
 which is 3, plus 8 is 11. 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.961
 We get 11 5/12. 

00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:12.965
 11 5/12. 

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:16.057
 There are other ways to solve the phrase. 

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:18.808
 We can do that, 

00:03:18.808 --> 00:03:23.595
 from this place here, 2 8/12 

00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:26.637
 and 8 9/12 to turn them 

00:03:26.637 --> 00:03:29.998
 in fraudulent fractions and then collect them. 

00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:32.075
 We can say what is the same as, 

00:03:32.075 --> 00:03:33.990
 let me write it, see, 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.952
 2 is equal to 24/12 plus 8, 

00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:39.775
 32/12 is obtained. 

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:43.141
 I can write the upper mixed number 

00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:46.650
 such as 32/12, 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.399
 which is obviously an irregular liver. 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.574
 I can write the lower number as, let's see, 

00:03:51.574 --> 00:03:53.867
 8 is how much twelfth? 

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:57.973
 This will be 96/12 plus 9/12, 

00:03:57.973 --> 00:04:00.057
 105/12. 

00:04:00.057 --> 00:04:01.637
 105/12. 

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:04.597
 If what I did seems confusing, 

00:04:04.597 --> 00:04:06.834
 you can watch the videos of the Cannes Academy 

00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:08.114
 to convert mixed numbers 

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.741
 in wrong fractions and vice versa. 

00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:13.648
 But now I can gather these two fractions. 

00:04:13.648 --> 00:04:14.973
 And what will I get? 

00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:18.762
 32/12 plus 105/12, what will it be? 

00:04:18.762 --> 00:04:22.577
 137. 

00:04:22.577 --> 00:04:25.015
 137/12. 

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:29.495
 If I want to write this as a mixed number, 

00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:33.909
 I can say, well, let's see, 12 is contained in 137 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.608
 11 times, it means 11. 

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:39.214
 11 by 12 is 132, then we have a residue of 5. 

00:04:39.214 --> 00:04:42.609
 11/12 is obtained. 

00:04:42.609 --> 00:04:43.844
 You can do it in both ways. 

00:04:43.844 --> 00:04:44.957
 I think this way, 

00:04:44.957 --> 00:04:46.318
 the way we first thought, 

00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:47.542
 it will be a little easier for us, 

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:48.811
 because you do not have to deal with 

00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:52.891
 with large numbers like 137 and 105 and 32. 

00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:54.689
 We think of much easier numbers. 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.664
 Let's say 8/12 plus 9/12 is 17/12, 

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:00.770
 which is equal to 1 5/12, 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.736
 then collect 1 5/12 with 8, 

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:06.520
 we will get 11 5/12.
