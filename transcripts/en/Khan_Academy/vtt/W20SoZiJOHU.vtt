00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.740
So right over here we have the graph of
the function f.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.250
And we're assuming that f is a function of
t, our horizontal axis.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.110
Here's the t-axis.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.680
So that is f of t, lowercase f of t.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.440
And now let's just, let's define another
function.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.570
Let's call it capital F of, and it's not
going to be a function of t.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.480
It's going to be a function of x.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.050
So capital F of x is equal to.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.500
We're gonna definite it as the definite
integral between t

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.860
is equal to negative 5 and t is equal to
x.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.100
Actually let me make those x's in the same
color so they really stand out.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.310
So f of x is equal to the definite
integral between t is equal to negative 5

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.970
and t is equal to x of f of t, f of t dt.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.000
And if I had my druthers I'd probably
wouldn't use capital f and lower case f,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.130
I would use like a g or capital G just so
that when I say F, you don't get confused.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.640
Well I'm gonna try my best to say
lower-case F of t, capital F of x.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.790
So this is how we're gonna define the
function capital F of x.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.770
Definite integral between t is equal to
negative 5, and x of f of t, dt.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.550
Now given this definition.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.807
What I wanna think about is at what x
values does

00:01:22.807 --> 00:01:28.820
capital F of x, does capital F of x equal
0?

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.670
So we'll write that down.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.436
At what x values

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:40.550
does, this is, is this, I guess you could
say, this equation, at

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.810
what x values is this equation true?

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.710
And I encourage you to pause this video
right

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.480
now and try to think about it on your own.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.190
And then we can work through it together.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.590
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it, so
let's just think

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.500
about what this, what this function
capital F of x is really talking about.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.700
Well it's the one way to think about it

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.919
is it's the area below, between negative
5, between t

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.480
equals negative 5 and t equals x, that is
below

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.930
the function f of t and above the t axis.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.260
And if the areas is the other way around,
if it's below

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.040
the t axis and above the function, it's
gonna be negative area.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.570
So we're looking at t equals negative 5,
which

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.860
is this, you could say this boundary right
over here.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.835
That is t is equal to negative 5.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.034
And if you put, pick an x value, let's
just say x were negative

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:44.082
2, so if that is your x value right over
here, capital F would

00:02:44.082 --> 00:02:49.033
describe, would describe this area, this
area it would be a

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:54.020
negative area because here the function is
below the t axis.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.450
So, for example capital F of negative 2
would be negative.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.650
Now, what x values makes this a 0?

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.920
So one might jump out at you.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:13.480
Well, if we just, if we made, if we put x,
if we put x right at negative 5.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.600
Right at negative 5.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.480
Then there's no width, width here.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.870
There's not going to be any area.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.430
So f of, f of negative 5.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.320
F of negative 5, F of negative capital F
of negative 5, I should be clear here.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.500
Capital F of negative 5, which is equal to
the definite integral between t is equal

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.570
to negative 5 and t is equal to negative
5, of f of t dt.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.040
F of t dt.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.610
Well you have the, you have the, you, you
have the same boundaries here.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.970
So this is going to be 0, once again this
area you have no width to this area.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.990
So this is going to be equal to 0.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.610
So, we can list x equals negative 5 as
being one of the points.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.360
One of the x values that makes capital F
of x equal 0.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.560
But let's see if we can find more of them.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.250
Let's see if we were to go, let me erase
this right over here.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.470
So, this was.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.364
We're starting at t equals negative 5.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.500
Now as x gets larger and larger and
larger,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.029
when x is equal to negative 3, our area.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:27.474
So, let's see this area right over here,
this area right over here is going to be,

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:34.310
so that is, I see that we have, it's 2,
we're going from negative 5 to negative 3.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.420
So the distance right over here is two.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.160
This height, right over here, is 4.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:48.940
So, this area, right over here, is 2 times
4 times 1/2, which is going to be 4.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.200
And, since it's above the function and
below the t-axis, we'll

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.690
write this as a negative, we'll write that
as a negative 4.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.820
And now, so let's see, so we're starting
when x is equal to 5.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.440
Uf, capital F of x is equal to 0, that is
you get further and

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.590
further out, you're getting more and more

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.080
negative values, that's more and more
negative values.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.410
But I just picked out this point right
over here because this

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.150
seems like a point of transition of the
function, and then we have.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.590
This region, which is just going to add
more negative area to

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.670
capital F of x as x gets larger and larger
and larger.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.350
And this looks like a really, a quarter
circle.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.560
This is, it has a quarter circle of radius
4, and now we

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.230
have another quarter circle of radius 4
until we get to x equals 5.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.800
And this is actually going to be positive
area.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.660
Because here our function is above the t
axis.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.710
So when we've gotten this far, so all, the
way I'm thinking about it, my

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.930
x is, my x, when capital F of x equal
negative 5 is, is 0.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.720
And now our area, as x becomes larger and

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.980
larger, and larger, our area becomes
negative, negative, negative, negative.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.420
Now it becomes less negative, because
we're

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.510
starting to add, we're starting to add.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.430
So, for example, if x is equal to 2, if x

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.480
is equal to 2, we would be looking at this
positive.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.420
But we still have all this huge negative
area to overcome.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.700
So we're still in negative territory.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.460
But the more positive we add, we're gonna
become less negative.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.930
And you go all the way to x

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.760
equals positive 5 and this positive area,
this quarter

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.430
circle right over here of positive area,
is going

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.760
to exactly offset this quarter circle of
negative area.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.530
You don't even have to think about what
that area is, although

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.340
you can obviously figure it out with pi R
squared and whatever else.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.100
And so now we just have to keep

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.270
adding more positive area to offset this
negative 4.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.100
So how do we do that?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.755
Well the height here, the height right
over here is 4, the height right over

00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:56.630
here is 4 so if we, if we can add our
rectangle that is one wide and 4 high.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.640
That's positive area of 4, which this has
right over here.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.280
So this is plus 4.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.590
Is going to offset this negative 4.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.140
So we go all the way to x is equal to 6.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.750
When x is equal to 6, capital F of x is
going to be equal to 0.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.260
Let's write that down.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.160
So capital F.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.912
Capital f of, capital f of positive 6, of
positive

00:07:22.912 --> 00:07:27.879
6, which is going to be equal to the
definite

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:33.980
integral between negative 5 and positive
6.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.770
Positive 6 of f of t.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.150
F of t, dt, well we can break this up.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.293
We already went through it, I'm just
gonna, going to

00:07:44.293 --> 00:07:46.870
make sure that we really understood what
was going on.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.130
This is equal to, and I'll just to it all
in one color now.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.170
This is equal to, actually I'll do it in
these colors that I did here.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.520
This is equal to the integral.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:01.941
The integral between negative 5

00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:07.336
and negative 3 of f of t, dt, plus

00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:12.546
the integral, plus the integral

00:08:12.546 --> 00:08:19.190
between negative 3 and 1 of f of t dt.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:27.020
Plus the integral between 1 and 5 of f of
t, dt.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.430
That describes this right over here.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.880
And then finally, plus, plus

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:40.730
the definite integral between 5 and 6 of f
of t, dt.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.549
f of t, dt.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:47.920
And, this describes this negative area.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.620
This describes this positive area.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.700
These two net out to be 0.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.240
And then this area we already figured out,
is.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.850
Or this definite integral I should say is
negative 4.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.520
This is negative 4 and this one right over
here is positive 4 and so they

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.520
net out and this of course is equal to 0
which we wanted to figure out.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.300
Once again how did I do that?

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.770
Well I said okay clearly when x is equal
to negative 5 you have no area and then i

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.530
just kept increasing, kept increasing xs
to larger and

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.840
larger values, I could have gone actually
the other way.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.520
And, I would have had just more and more
positive values there

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.130
would have been nothing to offset it to
get us back to 0.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.024
But, as we increased x above negative 5,
the

00:09:29.024 --> 00:09:32.040
capital Fof x; the area, is more and more

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.120
and more negative, but then it becomes,
then we

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.920
start adding positive value to it to
offset the negative.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.666
And, we fully offset the negative at x is
equal to 6.
