00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.170
When are we getting
rid of that bike?

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.400
We're going to
get rid of it today.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.770
We have to get rid
of the bike today.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.130
[inaudible]

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.870
Frankie and I are hauling the
Indian four cylinder project

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.200
we bought from Zane in Oregon,
because I have a friend named

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.670
Bobby Green that
owns Old Crow Speed

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.600
Shop that's going to buy it.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.100
I paid 20 grand for the bike.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.830
I have to have the
handlebars fixed, that big

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.530
weld on the left hand side.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.800
There were some repairs I
needed to do on the frame.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.100
Ben got all of that
stuff done for a grand.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.230
That's $21,000.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.470
All right, then I
couldn't find a gas tank.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.200
Everybody I called were
laughing, going good luck,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.700
stand in line, you're
never going to find it.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.700
So I got a repop gas tank.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.630
That was $800.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.970
$21,800.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.170
And then I had to find a
front fender because, remember,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.270
the front fender was hacked off.
- Hacked off, right.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.900
I finally found a front
fender that matches it,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.400
patina-wise, for $1,000.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.530
OK, so that's $22,800.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.730
What I told Bobby on
the bike was 30 grand.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.970
And he was all over it?

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.430
Yeah, because the baby
fours are hard to find, man.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.470
I know they are.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.470
Now Bobby Green is
just a name to me.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.530
I've heard about him.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.030
He's a hot rod specialist.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.600
Bobby Green is like the Marlon
Brando of hot rods out here,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.570
dude.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.900
He races the
Bonneville Salt Flats.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.900
Remember, like,
12 years ago when

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.070
we found that 1939
Woody that somebody

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.200
made into a pickup truck?

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.200
Yeah it had the chicken
on the side of it?

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.130
Yeah, OK.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.530
Bobby's the guy that bought it.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.300
OK.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.430
He's into period patina.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.100
That's the way he builds stuff.
- OK.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.600
Everything he does.
Even his car hauler is period.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.270
- Wow.
- I know.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.570
I mean, his
attention to detail--

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.530
[inaudible]

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.030
--is a crazy cool way.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.370
Wait until you see
the cars he builds.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.300
You're going to freak.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.330
I'm ready, dude.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
It's going to be
code brown for you.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.700
All right, here, where
this old truck is.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.800
- OK.
- See what I mean?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.200
Look at it.
- Oh, yeah.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.300
I'm seeing what you're saying.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.630
That's what I'm saying.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.930
All right.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.230
Look at that car hauler.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.730
I can tell I already
like this place.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.730
It's going to be
nice to have $30,000

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.600
cash for the rest of our trip.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.330
Check that.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.500
That's nice.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.000
Wait until you see the
inside of this place.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.200
Bobby!

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.930
Hey!

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.430
The Iowa boys are here.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.370
BOBBY GREEN: You made it.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.200
This place has
old school stuff.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.030
It's got Harleys sitting
around, Indians sitting around.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.800
It's like stepping back in time.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.830
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.370
How are you doing, man.
- I'm doing well.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.170
- My name's Frank.
- Frank?

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.270
Good to meet you.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.030
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.030
I'm a designer.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.600
I restore old buildings.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.100
I'm in the bar business.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.470
So I kind of do with cars
what I do in my real life

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.830
with buildings and
bars and restaurants--

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.700
I just love saving something
old, bringing it back to life,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.200
and sharing it with everybody.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.270
- There it is.
- There she is.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.800
Wow.
- This is it.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.170
Wow.
Gorgeous.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.570
I know that I'm never going
to get to this Indian project,

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.230
and Bobby is the guy to take
it across the finish line.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.530
It went from Oregon
to Iowa to California.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.370
Wow, really?

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.530
It's got a lot of miles on it.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.870
Hopefully it will
have a lot more.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.830
I'm really excited
about this new bike.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.130
I've been wanting
an early 4 cylinder

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.270
Indian for a long, long time.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.500
They're so beautiful.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.430
The way the tank is inside
the frame, is exposed.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.970
This frame is in
really good shape.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.100
I know.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.800
These early four
cylinders are hard to find

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.100
and they're expensive.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.570
So this is kind of
the only way I'm

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.100
really going to
get into one, you

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.470
know, one that needs some work.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.600
Because I couldn't go just
pay, like, for a restored one.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.970
You know, I wouldn't do it.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.570
To me, this being built and
ready to go is the key thing.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.430
Because that's 15, 20
grand to build the motor.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.770
That's what he said.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.130
His dad had like $12,000 to
$15,000 in the engine on it.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.900
Easy.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.570
They're hard to build.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.670
Very few guys do it.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.130
Now will you
sweaty up the motor,

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.530
or you'll leave
it the way it is?

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.700
Well I think that, you know,
once you start riding these,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.130
they get sweaty quick.
- OK.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.130
You know, they're spitting
out oil here and there.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.030
[interposing voices]

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.530
Some people would
look at it and be like,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.570
what are you going to paint it?

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.800
What color are you
going to paint it?

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.300
But, like, no, no
this is perfect.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.730
The character of it
is perfect, you know?

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.470
I might do some
custom stuff to it,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.900
and I'll leave it
sweaty and raw,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.170
and just do little
things that make it pop.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.900
So in the end, when
this bike's on the road,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.030
it's going to be way
more me than some bike

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.830
restored by some other guy.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.830
It's unbelievable.
