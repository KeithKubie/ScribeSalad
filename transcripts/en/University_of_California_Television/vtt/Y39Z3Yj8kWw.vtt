We are the paradoxical ape; bipedal,

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:35.840
naked, large brain. Long the master of
fire, tools and language, but still trying

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:44.353
to understand ourselves. Aware that death
is inevitable, yet filled with optimism.

00:00:44.353 --> 00:00:54.850
We grow up slowly. We hand down knowledge.
We empathize and deceive. We shape the

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.720
future from our shared understanding of
the past. CARTA brings together experts

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.570
from diverse disciplines to exchange
insights on who we are and how we got

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.889
here. An exploration made possible by the
generosity of humans like you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.370
- [Charles] We live 'twixt the past and
the future, and we live in the present.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.950
And those of us from Scripps, climate
scientists here, try to use our

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.590
understanding of the present climate to
try to answer the third of your questions,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.350
"Where are we going?" at least in the
climate area, and how will those changes

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.970
impact us as civilizations. We have
learned what Yogi Berra knew all along;

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.100
that prediction is very hard, especially
when it's about the future.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.650
But as I started thinking about this
conference, I understood also that

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.110
understanding the past is in this
particular area equally difficult. The

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.530
reason is, I think that paleoclimatology
is probably the most difficult branch of

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.990
climate science, because you need to know
what modern science is saying about how

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.340
the climate works, but you have to use
data that you infer from proxies. So you

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.250
need at least two, and usually many more
scientific disciplines to make sense of

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.860
the climate in the past. But what we have
learned is that it went through a

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.360
tremendous series of changes, in a
different environment, but of a magnitude

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.770
and scope and rapidity that I think rivals
what we will have in the future. So the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.980
question is; how did we get here? And how
did our ancestors cope with these huge

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.250
changes in climate?

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.620
And that is the topic of this symposium,
and Rick has put together an all-star cast

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.590
of people who have studied this most
difficult topic. So I have just a couple

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.131
of questions about the relationship of the
past to the future. We are ice age

00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:15.368
creatures. How did our earliest thinking
ancestors survive their huge climate

00:04:15.368 --> 00:04:20.976
change? When we reached the present
interglacial, the climate calmed down, and

00:04:20.976 --> 00:04:28.158
we developed agriculture and a more stable
climate, but were we more sensitive to the

00:04:28.158 --> 00:04:33.126
smaller changes of climate that have
allowed us thus far to build our

00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:39.099
civilization? And so with those questions
in mind, I'm going to start the

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:47.970
conference. I expect to have a great
debate between the past and the future,

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.126
and it will be mediated by the present.
