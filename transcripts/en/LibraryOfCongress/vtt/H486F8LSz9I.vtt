00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Welcome
to The Library of Congress.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.680
My name is Steve
Winick, and I work here

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.450
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.150
And we're conducting
an interview,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.100
my co-interviewer is Mary Sue
Twohy from SiriusXM Radio,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.890
and our guests are the
filmmakers who made the series,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.650
American Epic, which
showed on PBS,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.720
and I will let them
introduce themselves.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.350
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: I'm Allison
McGourty, one of the writers

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.270
and producers of American Epic.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.340
Originally from Scotland,
now living in Los Angeles.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.090
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And I'm
Bernard MacMahon, I'm director

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.770
and co-writer of the series.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.070
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So
we understand it took

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.440
about a decade for you
to go from inspiration

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.480
to the series, itself.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.750
So the series explores the early
days of commercial recording,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.600
particularly that burst
of activity that occurred

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.500
with 78 RPM disks all
across the country

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.140
and particularly roots music.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.440
So can you tell us some

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.860
of the inspirations
for making this film?

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.460
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: The period
was of great interest to us

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.700
because in 1925 in
America the vast majority

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.790
of music was being sold to
wealthy people in the cities,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.220
that was the audience.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.570
And in '26 radio
took off in America

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.700
and record sales
dropped overnight.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.900
All those people
in Chicago, Boston,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.310
and New York started
listening to the radio.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.210
So the record companies
thought we're going to be

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.920
out of business and they
came up with the novel idea

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.480
of why don't we try
and sell music

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.220
to poor people in rural America.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.520
But they're not going
to be interested

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.480
in buying the show tunes and the
classical music and the big band

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.190
that we've been recording,
we're going to have

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.910
to record what they like.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.120
So they devised a plan and that
was to advertise in local papers

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.370
across the whole of America
inviting people to come

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.220
and audition and
thousands of people came

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.820
and the auditions were
open to all Americans --

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.210
African Americans, Mexican
Americans, Hawaiians,

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.040
Cajuns, Native Americans.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.490
And many of the guys, some

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.270
of the guys organizing the
sessions were song publishers

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.030
so they, like Ralph
Pierce, they insisted

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.720
that people bring their
own songs they'd written.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.310
And they had just invented at
that time, the year before,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.190
the first electrical
sound recording equipment,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.300
the first microphone,
the first amplifier.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.780
And they were recording
everything direct to disk

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.930
on a pulley-driven lathe
because they couldn't trust the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.480
electricity to turn the
turntable at a constant 78 RPM.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.110
And it took about
three-and-a-half minutes

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.450
for that weight to slowly
fall and hit the floor,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.390
which is why today the pop
song is still three-and-a-half

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.180
minutes long.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.490
And that explosion of recordings
is what our film is about,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.920
it charts the journey of that
machine from New York to Oahu,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.030
tells the story through
10 families

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.170
that participate in
those recordings.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.120
And then for the fourth
film we rebuild that machine

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.270
from original parts
scavenged over 10 years

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.780
and it's the first time anyone
has seen it in almost 80 years.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.490
And we asked contemporary
artists to record on it.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.130
So I think the thing
that attracted us

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.860
about this story was it
hadn't been told before

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.690
and it combined all the things
about America that we loved --

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.830
its entrepreneurism, it's
incredibly rich culture,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.890
its music and its
freedom of speech.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.190
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Great.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.550
Well, thank you.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.860
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Can
you tell us a little bit

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.280
about your background before
creating American Epic?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.390
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: I'll
pass that to you first.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.630
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Well, I
spent five years at the BBC

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.040
in Documentaries and Acquisition
and also the BBC World Service,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.230
and prior to that at
Reuters Television,

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.630
so I was always interested
in storytelling

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.810
and history and journalism.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.440
My dad was a newspaper man.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.040
My sister was a journalist.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.900
And then and I played
music growing up,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.410
so I'd buy music as a kid.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.360
I played the clarinet and
my sister played the flute.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.390
And my dad would come
on holiday to America

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.450
and bring back records from
the Smithsonian and The Library

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.430
of Congress and Louisiana, so
I grew up listening to jazz

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.310
and Blues and old-time
American music.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.260
And then when I started working
with Bernard in about 2003-04,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.060
we started working
together on a record label

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.370
that then quickly segwayed

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.370
into a film company
with this project.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.850
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes, and I
just tagged along in her wake.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.150
[laughter]

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.870
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So
another interesting aspect

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.220
of this film is there
are some names

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.840
that people will recognize
associated with this film.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.930
You have executive producers
who are T Bone Burnett,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.120
Jack White and Robert Redford.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.970
So how did those big names
essentially get involved

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.550
in this production?

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.120
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Well,
I knew Bob Dolan's manager,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.800
Jeff Rosen, and once Bernard
had gotten some really important

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.300
findings, some film
footage and photographs

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.290
that we knew had never been seen
before and published before,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.920
we thought who better to
take it to than Jeff Rosen

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.840
who would essentially know
if we had a story here

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.140
and if it was worth telling.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.260
So he was the first person
we went to and almost became

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.270
like a mentor to us in the
beginning and helped us.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.870
So he's thought it
was a terrific story.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.240
I made an introduction to BBC
Arena, to Anthony Wall there,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.670
who came on as an executive
producer immediately

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.430
and was a super nice
guy, really helpful.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.570
And he said you must take
this to T Bone Burnett,

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.080
so he made a phone call

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.210
and literally we find ourselves
the very next day flying

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.020
to Los Angeles for
the first time.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.300
And we walked into the recorder
studio with our findings,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.930
our folder and photographs
and walked into the studio

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.110
where there was two figures
leaning over a sound desk,

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.200
just finishing off,
tweaking a record.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.720
And one was T Bone Burnett and
the other one was Elton John.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.700
And Elton said, well, I've been
hearing about this project,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.830
you mind if I sit in and listen?

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.590
So we went, oh, we'd
be delighted.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.880
And then we sat down with
Elton and T Bone Burnett,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.500
told the story of everything
we'd done, where we'd been.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.890
At that point we
traveled from Cleveland,

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.200
Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.120
I've spoken to hundreds
of families.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.070
And then Bernard,
take it from there?

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.370
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.540
I presented this
film idea to them.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.500
And I think Elton
said at the end of it,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.330
he said that you should become
an executive producer on this,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.940
right up your street, and
he said if you want me

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.350
to do anything just give me a
call, and passed on his numbers.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.960
And then a few days later
I had a call from T Bone

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.430
and he said I've been talking
with a film guy for a few months

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.060
about he wants to do a
music related project

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.360
and I brought him
a lot of ideas.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.350
He didn't seem interested
in any of them.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.230
And I mentioned that
you had come

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.120
into the studio the other
day, he wants to meet you.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.880
So we went down to Santa Monica
and it was Robert Redford,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.310
and so I presented that to him.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.220
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty:
And he loved it.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.300
He said this is, I think this is
America's greatest untold story.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.030
And he gave us his
offices so we could kind

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.120
of finish our writing
there, so we essentially --

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.420
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
it was like, it was almost

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.660
because you're presenting
the whole idea of the film,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.650
just like having a
screening in front

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.530
of a really tough audience
before you shot a frame,

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.830
you know?

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:12.460
And then when we came up with
the idea to actually do kind

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.260
of a proof of theory film, which
a full film is essentially --

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.580
I've always had an issue
with historical films,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.810
where a feature is
based on supposition

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.160
of what may have happened.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.470
And I think that the practical
employing of the ideas

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.770
or what took place
is really important

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.840
to understanding what
actually did take place.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.240
And if you actually
do something,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.540
for example you could a
film in 100 years' time

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.140
about the Apollo missions, but
if you were to actually rebuild

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.790
that rocket and go to the moon
there would be innumerable

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.290
things you'd learn about what
they must have done that aren't

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.070
in any books and that no
one alive would remember.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.400
And that was the purpose of
the full film was to rebuild

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.390
that machine and then record on
it, and this was basically how,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.960
the way we communicate
today at the end.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.170
And every, all the sound
on these cameras here,

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.060
all that technology
comes from this machine

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.890
that no one had seen before.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.760
Now, and so I felt we approached
Chad White, I think we wrote

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.940
to him because we thought he
would be a good person to come

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.500
and arrange and produce
those sessions.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.810
I got the impression
he liked working

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.350
with analog here, which we did.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.180
And so I think I wrote him an
e-mail, I think it was e-mail

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.310
and I dropped him a line,
I think I said something

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:39.370
like I have a photograph of some
house from 1929 and film footage

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:44.630
of Sleepy John Estes from 1938.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.980
I think he wrote
back in a minute.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.280
[laughter]

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
It's a good book, yes.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.170
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes, yes, I
mean in his world that's catnip.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes, yes.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.080
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: So at the
very beginning of American Epic,

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.290
setting the scene in the
1920s, you hear the voice

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:13.470
of Robert Redford and he says,
when America first heard itself.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:20.520
I love that phrase, can you
describe just what that means?

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.710
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Well, it's
coined by a dear friend of mine,

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.240
Charles Shala Mari @.
I said, can you sum-up

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.280
in one sentence what
this film is about?

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.530
I talked to him about
it many hours.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.940
And he goes, let me think.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.230
The first time America
heard itself.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.600
And, of course, as always he
was completely on the money.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.020
I like, I'm fascinated
and we both are

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.440
with the beginning of things.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.640
I mean my first love was
early American cinema

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.920
where the language is being
invented, from the teens,

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.420
the '20s, the early '30s.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.020
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: As
you go through silent

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.320
and the early talkies,
because that's

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.240
where as a filmmaker you
learn the language of film.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.370
And similarly in
music, this is the point

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.980
that everything is
being invented.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.430
But really the phrase
comes from the fact that,

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:14.890
as I told Charles, up until
this point the vast majority

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.380
of America were not
communicating with each other.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.420
The people living in the
Appalachians and in Louisiana

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.740
and in New Mexico, there
really is no communication.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.340
We didn't have talking pictures,

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.210
there isn't coast-to-coast
radio, so these records

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.420
when they first appeared
were a method

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.090
that a woman picking cotton

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:41.380
in Mississippi could communicate
her ideas about her life

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.820
to the rest of America.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.040
And it was the first time
in the history of the planet

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.920
that the poorest people in the
country were given a platform

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.890
on a nationally distributed
medium to express themselves.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.090
And it was for entirely
commercial reasons,

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.290
they just wanted --
the guy, the record men

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.460
like Ralph Pier @
wanted to publish songs,

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.830
to own the words and the music.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.240
So they insisted if you showed

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.700
up that you brought stuff
you'd written yourself

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.950
or at least did the
courtesy of adapting songs

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.260
and sticking a few of
your own words in it,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.950
but basically it meant
for the first time all

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.000
of this incredible
autobiographical material.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.030
The other factor
was that the crisis

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.770
that the record companies
were facing from radio

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.900
in the cities was so
serious that they needed

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.330
to move really quickly.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.160
And so they were going
into territories,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.820
Cajun being a perfect example,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.050
where they couldn't understand
a word they were singing.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.970
French people couldn't
understand what they were sang.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.460
It's perfect French, but the
pronunciation is so strange.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.710
But if they found after test
sessions there were a few

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.010
thousand people that
wanted to buy

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.860
that record they'd go back
again and record more.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.530
And so they weren't editing
or affecting the content

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.550
of that material, they were
letting people do what they

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.580
wanted to do, and as long
as it sold they carried

00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.880
on recording more of it.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.480
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And so,
yes, you had this freedom

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.670
of speech, this platform
for people to come out,

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.390
and these are people -- I mean
imagine if you were working

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.480
on a plantation or
Dockery and suddenly you're

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.840
in this tiny rural
community, you can't leave

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.220
and suddenly you're on a record
that is being distributed

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.950
around the whole
country and that people

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.770
to this day are still covering.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.070
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.370
&gt;&gt; If that isn't
freedom of truth

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.810
with speech I don't
know what is.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.040
So that, I think that's why it's
the first time America heard

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.150
itself, and it actually
became a model

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.530
as to how the world heard
itself because the rest

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:36.830
of the world picked up on that.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.820
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: And
they were writing songs

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.490
about their everyday
lives, their love lives,

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.180
local politics, stories of --

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.480
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.400
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: You know,
murders in their local town,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.890
and it was a method of --

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.190
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.550
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Sharing
their stories with the world.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.960
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And the
thing that's different is The

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.020
Library of Congress I mean
organized these, you know,

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.810
with John Lomax these
amazing recording trips.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.400
These are noncommercial trips.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.700
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.000
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And
there's a huge amount

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.840
of value many years later of
being discovered from the songs

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.020
and things that were
recorded in these trips.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.460
But this I think
was an even more

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.760
or a much more exciting thing

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.780
because these were commercial
recordings, people wanted these

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.100
to be heard by as many
people as possible.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.660
They drew amazing adverbs
depicting the lyrics

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.960
of the songs.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.120
The idea was to get this
in front of as many people,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.870
and so it really meant that you
had Blues musicians listening

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.160
to country musicians,
country musicians listening

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.830
to Blues musicians,
Hispanic musicians listening

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.310
to Cajun musicians, everyone
was hearing everyone else

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.610
for the first time.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.040
So it kind of -- it
basically made American music

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.540
and communication way richer.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So is there a way

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.900
that particular challenges
involved

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.080
in making what's essentially
a visual film about sound?

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.670
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
Almost impossible

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:55.680
because when we started there
was literally no archive at all.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:03.620
I would say half -- the figure,
at least a third of the subjects

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.410
of our film there was no
known photograph of them

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.400
when we started, so that
meant there might be --

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.870
there may never be a
photograph of them.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:17.030
We researched over 100 musicians
and groups that recorded

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.610
and whittled it down to
10 for the film, but, yes,

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.240
it was an enormous
detective job and so.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.060
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: I remember
[inaudible] it looks here

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.500
like we've got a
really good radio show?

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.800
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.100
[laughter]

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.400
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Because
they were so [inaudible]

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.840
at that time of any of
the artists that we wanted

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.650
to tell the story of, so finding
enough material for Bernard

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.010
to make the film with.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.500
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes, so
it involved going through,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.960
now I'd say probably, I would
say it's the biggest archive

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.460
in the world of material
relating to that era in terms

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.940
of the stills that
we have and the audio

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.260
and the private tape recordings
of these people speaking

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.980
and all the documentation,
along with the machine, itself.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:11.070
But I think it started actually
as a kind of just a fascination

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.690
with trying to track down
some of the people, you know?

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.230
So I think one of them was,
I love this song Henry Lee

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.700
by Dick Justice, yes, and
so I started running --

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.000
I wanted to find him.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.300
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: It was
on the charts at the time.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.600
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
it was in the charts.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.400
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Nick
Haive @ and PT Hovery @.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.120
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And so I
just started running stories

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.880
in all the -- he was believed
to come from West Virginia

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.850
so I just started running
stories in local papers

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.280
in West Virginia in the mining
communities because that was all

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.180
that was known of him, that
he might have been a miner

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.480
from West Virginia.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.610
And then must have run about
six stories and I ran one

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.000
in the paper called The Logan
Banner and that resulted

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.490
in the editor calling
me and saying,

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.340
an old man has left his number,

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.410
and it was a guy called Bill
Williamson, a lovely man.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.440
And he said, I know
Dick Justice's daughter

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.780
and she's quite elderly,
but here's her number.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.120
And so I called her up and she
was really shocked to get a call

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.020
from England about her
dad, and she had no idea

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.730
that her dad's songs
had been covered

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:17.920
and were known around the world.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.030
And she talked about him
going down in the mines

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:26.000
and how the musicians had
auditioned over the telephones

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.860
to record companies
because they couldn't get

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.950
to the standard auditions
everyone else went to.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:36.050
And she said, she revealed she
only had one picture of him,

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.410
which was this embossed
plaque that's in the book.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.950
And I think we arranged
a car to travel 100 miles

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.740
to this little community to
pick-up the picture and take it

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.650
to the nearest place
that could photograph it.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.540
And I called Bill back to
thank him and he said, well,

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.880
my dad was also in the group

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.100
and they were called the
Williamson Brothers in Curry @,

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.300
and I knew them, they did the
first every John Henry recording

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.210
and he had all these
incredible stories.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:06.080
And I think we started looking
for some more people and after

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.130
that Allison said they
should be made into a film,

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.830
this is the last time these
people are going to be alive

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.300
that can tell the story.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.670
And then with our producer
and co-writer, Juke @,

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.050
we started in earnest
to really track

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.000
down the musicians we
personally felt the strongest

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.300
connection with.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes, I mean
one sort of heartbreaking moment

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.250
in the film is when
you're talking

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.440
to I guess it's Dick Justice's
son and he says, you know,

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.450
I never even knew that my
father had recorded these songs,

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.360
I knew he played the
piano and sang in church

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.100
but you'd think I would
have heard him sing one

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.950
of these songs at some point
in his life and I never did.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:48.010
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
yes, one of the things

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:52.250
that was most beautiful
about doing this film,

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:57.050
something I never expected,
was that we would be going

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.310
into communities and meeting
families that didn't know

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.980
about these records but they
knew about them playing music,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.240
maybe locally, or that they
had an interest in music.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.210
And so you would often sometimes
be playing these records

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.470
to people for the first time.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.600
And so what was amazing
to me was

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.240
that we were bringing something
that they really wanted, too,

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.570
and they were giving all this
amazing memories and stories,

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.280
sometimes I think the
oldest interview was 104.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.620
So we were catching these
people before they moved

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.920
on to the next world.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.220
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:36.870
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And that
was the most pleasing part was

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.870
to give all the research
that you had put together,

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:43.130
including the music to that and
then telling you the background

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.620
of what they knew about it.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.650
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
One of the themes

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:56.560
of American Epic is how
recording technology has changed

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:02.400
the world in terms of radio
for one and then of course,

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.710
you know, the technology
of recording music.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:11.030
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Well,
yes, I mean that's --

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:14.890
the film is like
is multifaceted,

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.710
it deals with a lot of things,
I think is equally important

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.570
and the technology is as
important as the content,

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.920
in fact it defines the content.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.510
And we in this moment here our
conversation is being shaped

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.530
by the limitations of being
recorded and sitting on a chair

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.590
with a mike and what have you.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:38.220
And there the thing about this
recording machinery was this

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.780
machinery, when you work

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:47.220
with this recording system
it favors small groups,

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.460
vocal led groups
sound good on it,

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.770
and guitar bass things
particularly.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.580
The microphone likes it.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.600
So our sense of it is that the
emergence of the small group,

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:04.840
be it a popular group, a country
group or even a jazz group is

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.920
because that was sadly
given that machine.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:15.100
And whereas opera and that
kind of music was much bigger

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.850
in the acoustic era when you
were singing and shouting

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.860
into a horn because you
needed huge amounts of volume.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:27.660
This, in '26 when this machine
was invented it allowed you

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.430
to capture very subtle
nuances, and so performers

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.890
that were singing very quietly

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.820
and performing delicately
could be captured on it.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.970
And then people actually
started to exploit

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.080
that that sounded really good
and the intimacy of this.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.570
And so, yes, I think it
fundamentally shaped the way all

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:50.250
music is to this day and now
recording technology that's

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.910
followed on from it.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.680
But most really hardcore
engineers consider the

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.190
technology today in
many ways inferior,

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:05.740
in recording technology
the purer it is,

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.140
the less parts you're moving

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.050
through between the
signal coming in

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.610
and the end product the better
and this is very simple.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.970
So people that are really big
audio buffs would love this

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.250
amplifier for its simplicity.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.850
But, yes, I think it shaped
the way we communicate.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.530
And this is the really
interesting thing in relation

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:30.220
to say what we're
filming here today,

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.730
Hollywood had been resisting
for years putting sound

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:39.120
on motion pictures but
they relented in '27 with

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.170
and I think one of the
factors in this was

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.190
that this machine was putting
electrical sound recordings all

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.090
around America in the
cheap, in the poorest homes,

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.390
where the people
would listen to them

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.360
on little wind-up
record players.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.510
And I think this amongst other
things is one of the factors

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.880
that allowed Western Electric
to go back to Hollywood and go,

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.240
how can you not have
sound on talking pictures?

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.530
You have the whole
country listening

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.470
to electrical sound
recording, you know?

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.450
So it's impossible to even
overstate how important this

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:16.550
machine is to how we
communicate today.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.730
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So you talked
about the small group and one

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.760
of those sort of
iconic small groups

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.940
from that era was
the Carter family.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.660
So what do you think is --
there've been a lot of books

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.220
and other things written
about that particular group,

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.830
what do you think is your take

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:37.960
on the Carter family that's
different in this film?

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.530
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Well,
that's it's a female group.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.760
We're not taking anything away
from A.P. Carter in the film,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.370
but if you listen to interviews
with Sarah and Maybelle,

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:53.210
and we've been through
everything that exists as far

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.810
as we know, they found a lot
of songs themselves and a lot

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.050
of the early repertoire
was theirs.

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:03.040
And essentially it's
a female duo,

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.640
I mean A.P. is often no present
on a lot of the recordings.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.240
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
And they often joke

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.750
that he would just
wander off in the middle

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.220
of a recording session and
just look out the window.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.900
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And so
the Carter family struck me

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:20.700
as a female group and
that in itself in 1927

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.180
and in the country medium
is an unusual thing.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:29.230
And it's a pretty immense
produced female group,

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.870
it's like a strong
powerful female group.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.290
So I think that was the
shading on the story.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.020
I'm now literally -- the way
we approached these stories was

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:43.120
just we wanted to
let the families

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.900
that knew these people
tell these stories

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.590
in their own words.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:51.520
And our sense was that
historians in places

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.100
like New York, some of who may
have never have visited the

00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:00.540
Appalachians, like my Kentucky
friends always tell me it should

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:05.980
be pronounced, there would be
all these theories and concepts

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.280
about what would happen.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.940
And so after we traveled
extensively

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.130
in America we felt
the appropriate thing

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.000
to let families themselves
tell the stories.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.360
And my feeling was
I just wanted --

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.190
we just wanted the viewers
to feel what we felt was

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.010
when we spent time
with these people.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.190
And if you're with the son
of somebody that has grown

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.120
up their whole life
with this person,

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.660
not only do they have a lot of
their father or their mother

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.850
in them, they often
speak like them,

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.610
they often think like them.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:37.910
And this is the closest
way for another person

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.410
to touch the beating
heart of that story,

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.270
when that person
is long past away.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:45.560
And so our sense was
let them tell the story.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.860
And so really the stories

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.300
as they are really how they
see them is an accumulation

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.120
of how they depict that.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.980
And so I think our sense of
the Carter family story was

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:00.980
that it was very much that he
was the driving force in terms

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.670
of getting them the session,

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.610
but it was a female group
essentially in terms

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:07.120
of records and its performance.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.420
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Interesting.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.410
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: How did
you find the connection

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.490
between Elder Birch
and Dizzy Gillespie?

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.240
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
Want to do this?

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.540
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty:
Yes, but you do it.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.320
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Well,
all these stories come

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.190
out of a particular record.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:43.250
And I think we become --
if you saw a beautiful girl

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.410
or a handsome dashing man
walking along the street you'd

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.400
become curious about
them, you know?

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:55.170
And it's that kind of, it's
the music that draws you in.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.330
And so if you're interested,
I heard this record,

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.050
My Heart Keeps Singing, and I
just thought it was one of --

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.950
just this beautiful,
beautiful record.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:07.000
And I thought if we do a gospel
piece in the film we have

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.670
to put this song, My Heart
Keeps Singing, in there.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.030
It was only a few years later
that Taj Mahal explained

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.510
to me why I loved that song.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.820
I grew up in a West Indian
neighborhood in South London.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.020
And he said, this comes
from Saint Kitts this song,

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.210
this is a Caribbean song or
this is a West Indian Song.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:28.260
If you didn't know the song, he
says, it's the style of singing.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.590
And I listened to when I grew up
as a child listening to Reggae,

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.760
and I went, oh, my God,
that's why I like this.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.410
It sounded like the songs that
my Jamaican friends would play,

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.520
their parents would play.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.760
And so I love this song and
this voice in me said we need

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.580
to put this song on the film,

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.810
but we need to at least know
something about who made it.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.190
And all that we had was
on the record label,

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:52.730
it said Elder J.E.
Birch and Congregation.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.050
And I remember asking around,

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:58.700
all the different people I could
find that were into gospel music

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.600
and nobody had heard of Birch.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.910
They knew him, they
knew the name,

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.520
but no one knew anything
about him.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.720
And so I went to the Sony
archive in the basement

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.020
of Sony Records and went
through their recording ledgers.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.390
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
What was that like?

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:19.360
I mean did you have to go
in an elevator, down floors?

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.880
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
it's deep in the basement.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.180
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty:
Yes, exactly.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.350
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And, yes,
and it is these rows and rows

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:29.250
of boxes containing
the recording ledgers

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:32.730
of each session, so
at these sessions back

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.670
in the teens even there would
be someone with a typewriter

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.450
that would be typing up
the songs that were done

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.340
and making notations about it.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And thank
God that they did that.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.910
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes, and
eventually I found in this box,

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:49.860
Birch, and it listed the songs
and there was just one piece

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.320
of information in the corner, it
just said Turola @ misspelled,

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.140
North Carolina I think it
said, South Carolina I believe.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:04.820
But anyway and there was no
indication what that meant,

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.460
often it was a place, and
there was no indication

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:11.870
that Birch had come from
there but it was all we had.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.920
And so I think one of the
reasons that doing this

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.130
for The Library of Congress
is appealing to me is I want

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.520
to say this, this
project was only possible

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:26.080
because of librarians because
anytime we found an obscure town

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.630
the first thing we'd do
is call the town library.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.810
And librarians are the most
universally helpful people

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.750
at trying to find the
person in the town

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.460
that might know what
you're trying to find.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.930
And librarians also seem to
get very curious about the call

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.270
from England about a member

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.590
of their community
they've heard of.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.720
So that's a big -- I just
want to say that if it wasn't

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.360
for the librarians of America
there wouldn't be an American

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.370
Epic because so many of
things were unearthed

00:29:56.370 --> 00:30:01.540
because of a genial elderly
old librarian that kind of --

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.960
but never heard of him.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.550
[laughter] And let's
find out about him,

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.230
somebody in London knows
about him, you know?

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.120
So anyway we went to Turola
and nobody knew anything

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.800
about Birch, and eventually
we were told to speak

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.110
to an African-American
town elder.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.400
And we went over to
the poorer part of town

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.750
and we met this lovely
man, Ted Bradley.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.630
And Bradley remembered Birch.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.900
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: He
was lovely, too, wasn't he?

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.200
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
He's a gorgeous man.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.030
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: He just
had the shine about him.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.330
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
He really did, yes,

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:39.960
he's one of the great
flowers of America, you know?

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.460
Wonderful fellow.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.170
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: We'd
been there for two weeks.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:48.300
We first, it was our evening
before we were leaving we were

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.340
having a farewell dinner and
we failed in our mission,

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.640
we hadn't found any leads.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.290
And we walked into
this restaurant

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.870
that was only open a couple
of nights and somebody put us

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.830
in touch with one of the
people that worked there,

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.950
made a phone call and
said, oh, you need to stay,

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.820
this person knows him.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.520
And so we extended our flight

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.530
and that was the next day we
went over to the other side

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.420
of the tracks and
met Ted Bradley.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.050
So it was just in
the nick of time.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.350
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
Yes, and so --

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.650
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
And he knew Birch?

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:16.950
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
and he'd gone to that church

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.850
and he described that
the church was this kind

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:24.690
of raw looking affair and
that he was not a sanctified

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:25.990
church member.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.540
And so he said he would have
been punished by his parents

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.300
if they'd known as a
little boy he was sneaking

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.620
into this church, but the music
was so good he was drawn to it.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.880
And he mentioned that
the music was so powerful

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.620
that white people
after they had been

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.750
to their church would all sit
in their cars and the trees

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:46.120
around the little wooden Triumph
church that birch had built

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:51.270
with his bare hands and listen
to the music all afternoon.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.730
And so it brought the white

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.040
and black members of
the town together.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.050
And Birch was one of the people

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:05.300
that set-up the NAACP
in South Carolina.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:10.400
And Turola became quite an
emancipated town and I think

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.530
that church was a big
factor in spreading,

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:19.260
connecting the races together.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.210
And so but we still didn't
have a photograph of Birch,

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:28.170
and we were then introduced
to Ernest Gillespie

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.580
and he was a friend of Ted
Bradley and Ernest had also

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.130
as a little boy snuck into
that church and listened

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.330
to all the stomping
and the shouting.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.000
And he, when we met,
he said, well,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.460
you know who was really
influenced by this music,

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.950
it was my cousin who lived
next door, Dizzy Gillespie.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:56.210
And he pulled out this, he
pulled out this autobiography

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.080
by Dizzy, it was
long out of print

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.260
and no one has ever seen
this connection in there,

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.480
and said look in
here and he talked

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.880
about Birch's church being
the big inspiration for him

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.460
and going to hear, that's where
he understood about rhythm

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:11.310
and melody and spiritual
transport through music

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:12.610
through going to that church.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:13.910
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes,
I think that was kind

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.410
of a really great moment in this
film because it really is true

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:20.020
that Elder Birch's recordings
are known among the sort

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.980
of record officiants
and, of course,

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.660
Dizzy Gillespie is
revered among everyone

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.730
who studies American music
and the connection was there

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.510
to be made but nobody made
it before because he wrote

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.580
about Elder Birch in his book.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.020
So it was great that you
found that and were able

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.320
to bring that out in the film.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.920
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Exactly,
yes, and I think it's just --

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.000
so I think what I liked
about the story and the story

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.700
for the audience was that in
your own communities there are

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.640
those little pieces of string

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.610
that if you start pulling
them could easily lead

00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.910
to a story like this.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:00.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.870
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And
they're all over America,

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.040
and this is an example of
a guy that's just known

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.580
for this one record

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.940
but it transpired he was a
pivotal influence upon the most

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.620
important musicians
of the 20th Century.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:18.320
Yes, I think so, and the Joseph
Kekuku story is the same.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well, I was
just going to ask about that

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:24.350
because the Kekuku story has
been somewhat known among

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.570
ethnomusicologists
and the like and many

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.510
of them don't actually think he
invented the slide in the sense

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:34.360
that it's part of African music
and so a way for it to get

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.770
to the Blues that's more obvious

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.190
than Hawaiian music would be
just through African roots,

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.990
although obviously the style
of playing steel guitar

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:43.360
or something that he did invent.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.960
So what is your take on that
and on the slide question?

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:54.660
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Well, it
doesn't, the steel bar played

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:58.790
on the guitar, but it doesn't
exist in any form that I'm aware

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:04.570
of before he started playing it.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:12.340
And the earliest record I
found of it was in the '30s,

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:18.850
a musician called C.S. Delorno
@ wrote in a track on a guitar

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:25.130
and banjo, published in Britain,
and he recalls Kekuku talking

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:31.020
about when he came up with the
idea and how he propagated it.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.020
And that's by far the
earliest writing about that.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:39.860
And then the first
ever book in the teams

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.470
of slide guitar playing is --

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.040
or steel guitar playing
is by Myrtle Stumpf @,

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:51.500
and she was one of
Kekuku's pupils.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:58.190
So I'm just, I'm not aware
of that and I'm not aware

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.910
of anything that proceeds it

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:03.840
that is played in
a similar fashion.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.970
And then the other thing to
remember as well with this is

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:12.860
that there's no way to be
absolute about these things,

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.430
and I think that's a kind
of a desire of historians is

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:20.590
to be an absolute truth.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.600
Oftentimes you can
have situations

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.990
where two people are working

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:29.140
on the same scientific
problem solving or theory

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:36.170
and on opposite ends of the
world, and one may popularize

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:37.980
that theory before the other.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.540
But in this instance
it's pretty clear

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.960
that after the World's Fair

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:49.690
in San Francisco there were
extensive tours organized all

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:54.510
across America with Toots
Paka that Kekuku played with.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.310
And the newspaper, if you go
through the newspaper cuttings

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:01.560
through the teens you can see
this tour going everywhere

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.010
and it's a big sensation.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.510
There's no musician that we
worked with that we tracked

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.830
down that has as much
publicity as Kekuku has,

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.960
which is incredible given
how until this film came

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.250
out he was largely
completely forgotten.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:19.720
But that tour was organized by a
big theater promoter at the time

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.030
and it meant that
thousands and thousands

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:27.010
of people heard that
musical style.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:31.130
And Kekuku toured Europe
and around the world.

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:34.520
He played in the Bird
of Paradise show.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.910
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And I
believe that is how people heard

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:42.650
that music and I think
that's how that playing got

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:47.700
to the delta, people in the
delta heard those, that --

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:52.420
when the Toots Paka's group
toured there they heard

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.440
that music and wanted
to do it themselves.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.740
And really if you look at it,

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.600
if you see someone playing it
it's not that difficult to do.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.350
If you play guitar and you
hear this incredible sound

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.910
that is made simply just by
flipping the guitar on its side

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:08.140
and then running a belt
across it I mean most people

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.670
or musicians would go
back and go let me figure

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:11.970
out how we did that, you know?

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.820
And it wouldn't take very
long to realize you just need

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.710
to raise the strings up
and get a smooth object.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:22.180
So I think really those
tours are what propagated it

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.210
around America.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:28.420
And then I'm not aware
of any other musical unit

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.020
that was spreading that idea.

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:37.970
Because by the early '20s, you
know, Hawaiian music was one

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:43.120
of the most popular forms of
music in America, so there's no,

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.340
any evidence whatsoever
that points to anyone other

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.790
than to Kekuku as being the
person that propagated that.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.090
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.620
So I probably did this
backwards, but I should say

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:56.500
that the Kekuku story
is about Joseph Kekuku,

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.160
a great Hawaiian
guitarist who is said

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.930
to have created what we
call Hawaiian steel guitar

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:06.380
and also steel guitar in
general coming through that

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.090
and that's I think undisputed.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:10.620
The only question among
ethnomusicologists has been

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.170
whether another form of slide
playing existed with the guitar,

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.670
which would have been
essentially bottleneck slide

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.480
playing on one string as opposed
to across all the strings,

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.780
and that's something

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.300
that ethnomusicologists
kind of argued about.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.860
So I probably did
that backwards,

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.030
I should have had you tell
the Kekuku story first

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.720
and then just bring
up that point,

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.360
but it is in a way a minor
point in the sense that all

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.440
that you are saying
is it is undisputed

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.040
that he started what we
think of as steel guitar.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.020
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
That would be fascinating

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.230
if someone presented a recording

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:46.300
or serious documentation showing
somebody using a smooth bar

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:51.190
on an upturned guitar
prior to Kekuku.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:55.090
If such documentation exists
it'd be fascinating to see it.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.140
There's no doubt he invented --

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.550
I've always found
the distinction

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:04.050
between the steel guitar
played on all the strings

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:12.050
and the bottleneck, I don't
see a huge difference, myself,

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:13.990
between them in terms of
the concept is the same.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.290
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:16.590
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: But, yes,

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.110
I'm just not aware
of anyone doing it.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.940
Who do they cite as
being the person that --

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.240
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well,

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.080
essentially what they cite is
the fact that slides are used

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.480
in African music on a whole
range of stringed instruments,

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.420
including musical bows, and
the diddly bows were known

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.680
in the south, and so a
more obvious way of getting

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.660
to the bottleneck
slide in southern,

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.370
African-American music would
have been straight from Africa

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:45.070
as opposed to it coming in
from Hawaii, but there's no way

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.710
to prove it because, as you
say, I don't think any recording

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:50.020
of it, specifically a
guitar, being played

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:53.600
with a slide exists before
Joseph Kekuku's recordings, so.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.110
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
and all the countries,

00:40:56.110 --> 00:41:00.540
which is in the same regions
is clearly Hawaiian based

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.840
of the steel guitar.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.140
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.440
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: What was it

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.400
like to hear the slide
guitar on the recording?

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.840
You had mentioned
something about it just,

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.250
it being a very good experience.

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.040
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty:
Oh, it was wonderful.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.680
And Bernard discovered this
record with Joseph Kekuku,

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.670
I think one of the earliest
recordings, I think it was

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:24.970
from the late teens, wasn't it?

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:28.650
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Well, as
Delorno mentions in his article

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:32.760
that Kekuku had made,
he'd appeared on records

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.680
with this group called
Layton and Johnstone,

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.930
which were an English,
African-American group that went

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.910
over to Britain and
started making these kind

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:44.920
of musical numbers,
all dressed in tuxedos,

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.590
and the King was a
big fan of theirs.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.340
And they said that he played
on three of their records,

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.480
and everything he had said

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.620
in his article I
checked out panned out.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.610
And so I went and I
searched these records

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:01.990
and it took something like
two years to find one of them,

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.700
they were the hardest
records to find.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:07.860
The internet is saturated with
the Layton and Johnstone records

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.460
from Britain, but
not those titles.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.460
And eventually one
showed up and we dubbed it

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:17.010
and halfway through,
the slide guitar,

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.520
which is kind of incredible.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:23.040
So in the film we
brought that to Oahu

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.120
and because no one has ever
heard Joseph Kekuku play

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.930
and played it to the
family for the first time,

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:34.390
so the first time anyone in Oahu
had heard what it sounds like.

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.320
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: And
to answer your question

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.400
about what it felt like, when
you hear the music in the place

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:44.180
that it came from it touches
you differently, it feels right.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.850
So it sounds different in
Hawaii than it does in London,

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.730
and we noticed that
everywhere we went

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:53.270
with all the different
kinds of music in the place

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.990
where the music was
created you can tell,

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:57.740
you can sense it's right,
that's where it belongs.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.270
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
Wow, so the landscape

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:04.520
and where it originated
was really truly important?

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.520
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Yes,
absolutely, yes, so the rhythms.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.890
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: We
called it geographonics.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:10.190
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Yes.

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:11.490
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
That that music sounds

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:14.320
like the place it comes from
and you can hear the landscape

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.610
in the music and you can also
only truly understand the music

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:21.590
when you go to the
place it was made.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:26.500
So as a Londoner you only ever
really truly understand jazz,

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.560
modern jazz when you're sitting

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.600
in a New York taxicab
and it's playing.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:34.400
That was the first time
I understood jazz truly,

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.920
I loved it but I
didn't understand it.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.100
And the nature of
American music,

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:44.240
the Hopi songs I was fascinated
by them, but when I went

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.490
to Hopi, which is one
of the strangest places

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:49.530
on the planet I've ever visited,
those songs certainly sounded

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.340
like pop songs when I was there.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.240
I know they're scared songs,
but they sounded catchy to me,

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.210
and once I heard them at Hopi
I started humming the songs.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Interesting.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:00.810
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
And I didn't,

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.250
I couldn't even follow
the melody line

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.600
of the songs originally,
they disinterested me,

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.170
but once I'd been there in that
geography and playing that song

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:14.040
as we drove around or wandered
around Hopi I was like, oh,

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.190
this basically sounds
like this landscape.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.880
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
That's fascinating.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.280
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Yes,
[inaudible] talks about that

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:25.340
as well in the other film when
he talks about the Cajun music

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.960
and the [inaudible] that the
music reflects the environment

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.270
in which it comes from.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.870
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes, Cajun
music, which is a little strange

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.220
to other people's ears is
really commercial when you're

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.480
in Louisiana because it
sounds exactly like the place.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.080
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: So a
little weird, a little strange,

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.060
going everywhere and swamps

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.320
and strange things
crawling out of them.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:50.200
This slightly odd music sounds
exactly right there, you know?

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.500
Yes, and I guess that --

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.800
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Oh, yes.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.340
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
Yes, so I think a lot

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:59.360
of art is mirroring
our environment

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.860
and it's entirely affected
by the environment,

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:08.630
kind of responding, and
so it's best I think.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:12.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: San Antonio,
Texas, that became kind of a hub

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.540
for record companies
in the 1920s,

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:22.090
and that is where Lydia Mendoza
@ and her family first recorded.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:26.420
You actually met with some of
her relatives and got to visit

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:30.880
with them, can you
tell us a little bit

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.090
about that experience?

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:36.870
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
The Hernandez family,

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:41.180
they're Lydia's grandchildren,
and they live --

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:44.040
yes, they live in San Antonio.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:51.780
And the house, they're
wonderful, it's Roger and Ann --

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.080
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty:
Ann McKinney.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.380
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
And their dad, Fernando.

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.410
And the house is almost partly

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.610
like a shrine to
their grandmother.

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:01.910
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:04.570
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: So
they had more photographs

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.820
and memorabilia related to her

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:10.120
than I think almost
any other family we met

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.300
in researching this film.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:20.100
And she had obviously been this
huge larger than life figure,

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:24.410
and when you were with them they
almost spoke in hushed tones

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:27.680
about her as if she could
walk in the door at any moment

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:31.890
and go, what are
you saying about me?

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:34.960
[laughter] So she was a
woman that cast a long shadow

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.830
and I really like
that, that's why I kind

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:40.350
of wanted the audience, I hoped
the audience got a little sense

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.890
of that in the films,
was this woman,

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:46.470
she felt like she
just left the house

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:51.330
and she died a long time ago.

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:55.710
And so I found them really kind

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:59.640
of really wonderful
people to hang out with.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:04.630
And I think I like the
idea, I love the idea

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:09.010
of all these different stories
being next to each other

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.070
because I think American
culture,

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.520
that's what makes American
culture really exciting is the

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:18.190
Hispanics mix, the Cajuns
mix, the Native Americans,

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:20.860
the African-Americans
and the Hawaiians.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:27.230
So kind of it was like it
was almost like being hit

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:30.490
by this emotional Tsunami
traveling from these places

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:33.780
because when you arrived to film
it would often be the result

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.130
of many meetings, many
phone conversations,

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.580
a really close relationship
built with these people

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:43.530
and then this explosion of them
telling the story on camera.

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:45.870
And you'd be just
inundated with all this stuff

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:47.550
and these new things they'd
found, and then you'd go

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:49.960
on to the next place
and into their world.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well, one
thing you might find cool is

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:56.800
that Lydia Mendoza performed in
this building in 1977 or '78,

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.020
I can't remember the exact
year, but she performed

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.650
in the Coolidge Auditorium,
which is right in the building

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:03.040
where you're sitting here.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.340
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.640
This [inaudible] was
she here for that?

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: It may have
been, yes, it may have been.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.410
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: The Jimmy
Fox @ inaugural, so, yes,

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:13.410
that was -- yes, she was -- I've
forgotten the specific question

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:14.710
about -- what was it about?

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.010
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Well, we
were just kind of talking

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.900
about how it was
meeting with her family

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.020
and you described
that, but I also want

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.440
to know about the dresses?

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:26.980
She made her dresses and
did you see one on premise?

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:28.280
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty:
Yes, she made the dresses

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.430
and the family talked about how
there was always sequins all

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:32.730
over the place.

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:34.980
And I met the family
again this year when we --

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:39.670
when I went down to San Antonio
for the ARSC Annual Meeting,

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:45.500
and we invited the family in to
talk and they got to see the cut

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.270
of her story for
the very first time.

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:48.570
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Oh, neat.

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:49.870
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: With
the audience at that meeting,

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:54.990
so that was wonderful and that
brought a tear to their eyes,

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:58.850
but they were just so thrilled
to have their family honored

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:01.640
like that and have
people remember, yes.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.940
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
Yes, that's the best bit

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.450
of the film is screening
it for the families

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:09.100
and then getting the approval
of the people that it's about.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.190
I mean actually as a
filmmaker that's the only,

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:12.650
that's the thing you
really care about is

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:14.970
that they think it's
true, you know?

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:19.330
And actually those families
are very, they're very open,

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.890
you know, the story doesn't
have to be sugarcoated,

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:24.510
there's lots of tough
bits to it.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:28.240
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: But
what was it like in Sedona,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.340
I didn't come to that
screening with the Hopi

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.380
when you got their blessing?

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.920
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Oh,
yes, so I had invited Lee,

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.790
who is in the film, who is --

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:42.090
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Suvant @.

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:46.210
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes, and
he's a very, very senior Hopi

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:48.540
and to come -- they
were having --

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:52.610
the last screening at the Sedona
Film Festival, and I thought,

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:54.670
well, let's do this, this
will be an opportunity

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:56.370
to show Lee the film
before it airs.

00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:02.160
And we go to this theater
and I'm expecting it to be

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.880
like 20 people there
or something.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:09.770
And it's absolutely packed and
the film director says, oh,

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:11.460
we invited Lee to a few things,

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.540
but he never comes,
he won't come surely.

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:18.060
And he shows up and he's
very friendly and goes in.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.650
I was sitting next to
him and the film starts

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:23.380
and I was thinking thank
God I put the Hopi story

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:28.080
at the beginning of this film
because [laughter] I don't want

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.640
to wait for 40 minutes
for his reaction.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.260
And I think about 10 minutes
through he started laughing

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:38.210
at something out loud and
then he kind of leaned over

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:40.820
and tapped me on
the arm, like this.

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.340
And the screening was up there

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.830
and it was a very kind,
wonderful reception.

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:49.210
And then someone was asking
us questions and they ran

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:53.050
up to the back of the theater
and put a mike in front of Lee.

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:55.650
And this is obviously a
very big deal he'd shown up,

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:57.990
apparently he doesn't
show up at these things.

00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:59.290
And I said, what
do you think of it?

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:01.540
And he goes I think
it's wonderful

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.550
and I give it my full
blessing, you know?

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:06.570
That was a very meaningful
moment.

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:07.870
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:11.510
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And he
was very kind, he let us use --

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:13.600
we showed him all the footage
we were planning on using

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.210
and gave his permission to
use it, and so it was --

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:18.510
because I said, look,

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:20.520
we've found some amazing
things you see in the film.

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:23.170
The performance on the steps
of Congress I said are we okay

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:25.250
to use this, it's your call?

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:29.800
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Where
did that footage come from?

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.190
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: We,

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:33.910
this was like another
detective story,

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:38.220
like the whole film I suppose.

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:44.140
I had basically -- I was
fascinated in this record,

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:46.740
it was one of the first
electrical sound recordings

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:51.310
of Native American music and I
knew a tiny bit about the Hopi

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:53.540
and I know a very little
more since I did that film.

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
it was called the Hopi?

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.390
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
Hopi Indian Chanters.

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:58.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Okay,
and the title of the?

00:51:58.310 --> 00:51:59.730
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: The
title of the record was Chant

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:03.620
of the Eagle Dance and
Chant of the Snake Dance.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.840
And the Snake Dance is the
most sacred Hopi ritual

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.790
and that is used to
bring rain to the desert,

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:12.840
so it is essential that
song is for their survival.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.180
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
And it's a private --

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.890
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Entirely
secret, private ceremony.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:22.880
So a friend of ours flew us
to Flagstaff when we found

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.770
out about a Hopi convention
that was happening in Flagstaff

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:27.400
where all the Hopi
elders were meeting

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.680
to discuss preserving
their language.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.860
They were worried that the
younger generation may stop

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.160
speaking Hopi.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.800
So we went there and met them
and I met a Hopi called Satilla,

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.490
and I played him the songs.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.760
And he said, well, that's
not the Snake Dance,

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.610
that's the Eagle Dance, and the
Eagle Dance is not the Eagle

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:47.740
Dance, that's the Buffalo Dance.

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.930
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: So
they're inaccurate labelings

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:52.870
on the Victor recordings
for the title of the --

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:54.170
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Well,

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:55.730
they're entirely what the Hopi
wanted Victor to call them.

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:59.990
[laughter] But the
film, the one thing

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:03.140
about the Hopi is they don't
feel the rest of the world needs

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.440
to know their business,

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.790
it doesn't really help
stuff for them, you know?

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:09.490
So try to respect that
and it's a little message

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:12.020
that we don't have to
look under every rock,

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.550
you should let certain
people be if they want to be,

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:16.140
let them do their thing.

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:17.440
They're certainly not in an area

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:18.740
where they're bothering
anybody, you know?

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.040
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.340
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
They've chosen to be

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.300
in the toughest place on
the planet or one of them.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.090
So, yes, so I wanted --

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.400
so I started searching
around for this

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.790
and eventually I tracked

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:35.550
down that Billingsley @ was a
white guy that traveled the Hopi

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:38.390
and he had befriended
them and lived the Hopi,

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:42.380
and Congress were attempting
to ban the Snake Dance

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.690
and they felt that if they could
ban the Snake Dance it would

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:49.310
basically pull the
heart out of Hopi.

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:53.690
And that tribe, which was
resistant to being integrated,

00:53:53.690 --> 00:54:01.260
were being messed
with, they felt,

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:04.580
Lee said if they could break
the religion they'll break

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:05.880
the tribe.

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:11.260
And so they moved in Congress
to get the Snake Dance banned

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:15.950
because it involves carrying
snakes in the mouths of dancers

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:19.020
and they argued that
it was barbaric.

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.630
It's not barbaric to snakes
or anything, it's just,

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:25.380
as Lee puts it, it was a
mechanism that they saw

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.070
of destabilizing the tribe.

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:31.060
And so Billingsley,
rightly or wrongly,

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:34.410
decided that if he brought
the Hopi and toured America

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:37.400
with them and showed
their rituals.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.650
It would bring an acceptance

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:42.320
that these rituals weren't
a threat to anybody.

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:46.520
And so they went to Victor and
made recordings, which I think

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.700
to make them more
commercial they wanted it

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.000
to be the Snake Dance,

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.070
but obviously no white people
had any idea what they were

00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:54.570
listening to.

00:54:54.570 --> 00:55:00.100
And so there was another dance.

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:04.230
And then they brought them to
Congress like a few weeks later,

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:05.820
so they were on this tour.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.200
And I found newspaper reports
of them dancing on the steps

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:13.860
of the Capitol, and so really
essentially it was purely a gut

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:18.140
instinct that there might have
been a newsreel camera there,

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:21.220
and zero showed up
until we eventually went

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:28.030
through some archives in North
Carolina that had thousands

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:32.130
and thousands of feet of
unused Fox movie time newsreel.

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:35.430
This is where the
unedited newsreels went,

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:38.020
things that weren't
cut into newsreels.

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:44.000
And buried in there was footage
from a Fox movie time newsreel.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.300
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
That's amazing.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That is amazing.

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.060
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: So
it was just an instinct,

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:51.230
and I think someone might
have been there with a --

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:53.680
actually I found a still,
a picture of the crowd

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.910
and the crowd was huge,
which I show in the film.

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:58.380
I found that and that
in itself was a eureka.

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:01.640
And then looking at it
after it's like it has

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.940
to be a camera, a movie camera.

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:06.040
And that was still silent film,
but I think the camera there.

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.700
I was going through the
thing with a magnifying glass

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.800
and I couldn't see a
movie camera, but yes.

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Did you
shout when you found it?

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.400
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Oh, my God,

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.940
and the footage you
see is stunning.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.240
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
It is stunning.

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.540
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: It sure
is, it's amazing footage.

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:20.840
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: I
didn't tell Leo I was going

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.140
to show it --

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.440
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes, it looks

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.740
like it was shot
yesterday except

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:26.040
for being black-and-white.

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.340
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Because
it had never been used

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.640
since it was developed,
it had never been

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.940
in a projector before.

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.240
It had never been transferred.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.540
So a lot of the footage in the
film is like that, it's unseen.

00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.230
And so, yes, and so I thought

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:37.080
when I interviewed Lee I
had never even told him

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:41.010
about the footage, I thought
I'll just show it, I'll show him

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:44.490
that and see what he thinks, and
like he was very moved by it.

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:47.690
He was obviously shocked because
he'd heard about the event,

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:49.960
but he didn't think they'd
actually done the Snake Dance

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.680
there, he thought they
had done a fake ceremony.

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:55.280
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Thinking

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.330
that white people wouldn't
know the difference.

00:56:57.330 --> 00:57:00.410
And so he was moved to tears
when he saw they actually had

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:02.150
to do, they did the ceremony.

00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:03.450
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:05.370
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And so
he felt that was something

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:07.070
that the rest of
the world should see

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:11.500
that the Hopi shouldn't have
had to do that in order just

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.850
to continue doing something that
they'd been doing for so long.

00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:17.500
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes, so
one of the connections for me

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:18.800
that was really interesting just

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.610
because it's not something you
would necessarily think of was

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:25.370
to find out that Charlie
Mussel White @ was mentored

00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:27.500
by Will Shade @ of
the Memphis Jug Band.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:30.610
[laughter] So talk about Jug
Band music a little and how

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:33.950
that sort of dominates
part of that first film?

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:37.670
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: I love
it, I mean I'm obsessed

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:38.970
with the Memphis Jug Band.

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:42.390
I see the Memphis Jug Band as
like the first black pop group.

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:45.010
I think they're absolutely
brilliant.

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:47.580
I love everything about them.

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.590
That was one story that was like
we're doing then, I don't care

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.330
if there's nothing, we don't
know anything about Will Shade,

00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:55.370
we're doing this group, people
have to hear this music.

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:59.420
And it so obviously is
a precursor of R and B,

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:00.720
everything seemed that.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.320
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty:
Even Skiffle.

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:04.620
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
absolutely, yes, yes, I mean.

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:05.920
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Absolutely.

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.220
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: I
mean that's what Skiffle,

00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:08.760
they called it Skiffle
back in the '20s.

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:10.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.360
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: I thought
Skiffle was something my mom

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.660
used to like, you know?

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.910
But, yes, that's
where that comes from.

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:17.680
And we all know the Beatles
were a Skiffle band or some

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.380
of them were originally.

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.070
Yes, so Will Shade.

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:25.080
So then the question was how do
I tell the story, there were no,

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:28.180
there were like two pictures
of Will Shade in existence

00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:31.530
and pretty much nothing else.

00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:36.700
There are a few fragments of an
interview that Paul Oliver did,

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.220
but he really was
for someone that was

00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:43.100
like a huge big music
selling artist with masses

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:46.010
of records being covered by all
these people there was very,

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:48.670
very little known about him.

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:53.500
And so I tramped with Allison
around Memphis repeatedly trying

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.980
to find anybody that knew him.

00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:58.400
I knew from the Center's
records,

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:02.130
I found in the Center's records
that he didn't have children,

00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:07.580
so that really makes
things very difficult.

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:11.290
And there was nobody
alive that remembered him,

00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:15.060
even though he died in 1996.

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.270
So something happens in Memphis,

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:20.230
things get swept away unlike
any other city I've been

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:22.070
to in America and you
really got the sense

00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.920
after three visits
even though in '66,

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.980
which in historical terms
not long ago it felt

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:30.110
like this is gone, this has just
been it's like Katrina has come

00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:32.480
in and just swept this
away, any memory of this.

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.770
All the houses where they
lived were knocked down,

00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:36.370
the area he lived in.

00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:40.200
And so I was literally about
to give up until my friend,

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:45.460
Garth Cartwright, an
author in Britain said,

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:47.520
I think Charlie Mussoway @,
a friend of mine, knew him.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:50.360
And I was like it just
seemed too good to be true

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:53.220
that a well-known musician
would actually know this dude,

00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:55.130
after we tramped over the city.

00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:59.260
And I called Charlie and
he went, my God, yes,

00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:02.340
two guys were my big
influences in Memphis, you know,

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:05.120
it was Will Shade
and Elvis Presley.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:09.380
So Charlie would be
going to this really,

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:12.520
really poor neighborhood and
learning to play from Will Shade

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:16.020
and then he would go to
a fun fair late at night

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.160
that Elvis Presley
had rented out.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.000
And I just thought,
wow, the dichotomy

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.160
between those two
musical worlds, you know?

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.730
[laughter] But, yes, so
Charlie, and I just --

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:28.300
it felt to me like
it was a wonderful,

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:30.840
that became a story
of mentorship.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.080
So a lot of these stories
are emotional stories

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.690
and the music is emotional.

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:39.480
People can take all this
information now and go

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.820
into much detailed
historical treatise

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.550
and pull all the bits together,
but to me I love the story

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:46.230
of this music being
handed down to this boy

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:47.530
that was visiting his house.

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:49.550
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And
he was, he was a boy

01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.640
when he first met Will Shade.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.940
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
He was, yes.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.080
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Tell us
about where you filmed Charlie

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.050
when he was talking
about Will Shade?

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:02.140
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: All the
people in the film are filmed

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:06.990
on location in a place that is
very significant for stories,

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:10.720
there are no interviews
that are like we are,

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.390
just to give us a backdrop.

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:18.100
Although we are in a
space, not like a studio.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.710
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty:
Lydia was here.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.690
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
this is a perfect a place.

01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:26.530
But, yes, you're brought into
a studio and are interviewed.

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:29.670
We want to interview
Charlie in a club

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:33.910
that Will Shade would have
played in on Beale Street

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:37.740
and all the clubs had been
knocked down on Beale Street,

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:42.670
Pee Wee's, [inaudible] the
Monarch, which was owned

01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:45.060
by Jim Canane @,
who was a big kind

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:47.850
of mafioso type guy in Memphis.

01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:49.390
Old Jim Canane is the place.

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:51.590
In fact, there's even
a song on our box set

01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:56.840
by Robert Wilkins called Old Jim
Canane about going to that club

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.690
and sniffing cocaine,
very rough.

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:01.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yes.

01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:03.320
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
And Will Shade

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.710
and the Memphis Jug
Band were the house band

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:08.060
and we found the
building, and we peered

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:10.760
into the building it
was a police station.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.060
[laughter]

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.030
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: The irony.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:18.350
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: But
for some strange reason the

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:21.540
downstairs of the club
was largely untouched

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.510
with the same walls and brick,

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:26.520
and the police stored
their bicycles there.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:32.010
And the upstairs floor was
the actual police station.

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:35.470
When we went into the police
station they were so bemused

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:38.540
and intrigued of what the
history of the club was

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:42.290
that they let us basically empty
out the entire police contents

01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:45.470
of the ground floor and set-up
a makeshift studio there.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:48.680
So, yes, we filmed Charlie
on the very club floor

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.550
that Will would have played in
in the '20s, yes, in the '30s.

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:56.070
So, yes, all the films, all
the places are shot like that,

01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:58.860
you know, in the church
at Sharore @, on the steps

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.980
of Maybelle Porter's Chop House.

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:05.860
So really just as a filmmaker
your hope is to bring people

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:10.190
to the place on a film where
the story happened to be talking

01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:12.930
to the family and just to have
a sense, to create a sense

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:15.890
of what it would be like if you
went and met, spent an afternoon

01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:17.760
with Dale Jet @,
sitting on his porch,

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.750
and he's telling you the story,
and he's effectively bringing

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:24.180
out the photographs and the film
clips and showing them to you.

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:27.620
And that's all we wanted to
do was to create that sense

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:30.170
of you going into the
place where it happened.

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:31.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:32.770
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: With the
people that knew those people,

01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:34.600
their blood, and they're
telling that story.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.430
And if they don't
have blood, you know,

01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:38.960
they're protegees, you know?

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.260
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Exactly.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.120
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And
so, yes, and so I think

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.680
with Charlie it's emotive
when you're in that place,

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.340
when you're in that room, the
emotions are strong, you know?

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.260
And you could feel it
in the way he talked,

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.060
the way he sings his song.

01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:56.210
He knows that Will was
in that room, you know?

01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:58.780
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: At one
point he breathes in deeply

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.610
and just sort of
takes in the air

01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:03.770
of the room and all its history.

01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:05.070
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes.

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:06.870
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And
completely enjoys that moment.

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:08.480
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
it was absolutely real,

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.020
history did that, you
know, he was like --

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.600
he knew what it meant
to be in there.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.320
And I think it was we had a very
funny moment, I really wanted

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.360
to put in the film but it just
couldn't fit, was we wanted

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.500
to go and visit Will
Shade's grave

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:29.380
and have Charlie leave a
memento for Will on the tomb,

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.280
a harmonica or some such.

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.620
And so we get to the cemetery

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:37.080
where Will is buried
outside Memphis

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.780
and there is yellow tickertape
around the whole cemetery

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:44.150
and just mountains of
police cars piled up.

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:46.350
And we're like what
went on here?

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:50.310
And they go, the
cemetery is a crime scene.

01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:52.980
[laughter] And Charlie
turned to me and went,

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:56.230
only in Memphis it
would be a crime scene.

01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:58.460
And I said to the policemen,

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:02.090
I said what do you
mean a crime scene?

01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:03.950
He goes, well, the owners

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:08.620
of the cemetery have been doing
illegal things with the bodies,

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:12.070
removing them, reburying them.

01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:14.140
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I remember
this story, it's crazy.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.000
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: I said when
do you think they'll open it?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.850
You know, it was like we
expect this to be a crime scene

01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:23.780
for another couple of years for
him to figure out all the stuff,

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.390
like digging up corpses.

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:29.470
And Charlie stood
outside on camera

01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:34.090
and played his harmonica song
to Will, outside the cemetery,

01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:35.450
and he just said -- he looked up

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:39.530
and he said this is a Will Shade
joke, he said he didn't come

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:42.740
and see me enough when I was
alive, he certainly ain't going

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.450
to come and see me
when I'm dead.

01:05:45.450 --> 01:05:47.840
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: But that
relationship between Charlie

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.350
and Will Shade kind of
brings up another issue

01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:54.000
that I think is a sort of
an undercurrent to a lot

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.330
of the film, but you don't
get very explicit about it

01:05:57.330 --> 01:06:00.990
which is the question of race,

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:05.090
that there was probably
more musical interplay among

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:08.660
African-Americans and white
Appalachian folks, for example,

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:11.460
then is evident from
the records, themselves,

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:14.450
and yet there's also all
kinds of racial tension

01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:16.950
and racial issues going on.

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:19.600
And I mean an example that
came up in the film was

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.780
when Mississippi John Hurt
wanted to hear his record

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.600
and his neighbor
played it for him

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.770
and he stood outside the window
and listened to it playing

01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:31.970
through the window rather than
just going into her house,

01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:33.830
as would be normal now.

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:38.330
So how do you feel that
the story of race is told

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:41.900
through this music, as well?

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.200
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
Well, the records are not

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.300
in themselves an entirely
accurate representation,

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.590
they're a piece.

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:54.670
Talking to the old
musicians, that you may recall

01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:59.240
in the film we interviewed the
three oldest Blues musicians I

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.520
the world -- Robert
Lockwood and Honey Boy

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:08.450
and Holmes @. I think
it was '98.

01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:11.020
And Lockwood made it clear

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:16.160
that those musicians would have
repertoires for white audiences,

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:20.500
as well as black audiences,
and that they were very fluent

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:25.410
in country music and music that
would appeal to white audiences.

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:26.960
Obviously, there
are white audiences

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:32.260
that enjoyed listening
to Blues, as well.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:39.490
And I think that those
issues are implicit in a film

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:41.250
and being in that environment.

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:48.460
I mean there's a moment
that I was discouraged

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:52.000
by the broadcast
they put in the film,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.810
which was when Charlie
Patton's relatives go to Dockery

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:59.470
and they meet Bill Lester,
who is the owner of Dockery,

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:04.430
and there is this interesting
and uncomfortable conversation

01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:06.350
where the current curator

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:11.220
of a plantation is telling
the history of their relative

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:16.640
to them on a plantation
where the family worked.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:22.520
And I felt that that scenario
was enough to tell you

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.050
about the interesting

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:30.000
and uncomfortable
situation at that time.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.490
However, the most
important thing

01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:35.650
that the film is really about,
and it's certainly the heart

01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:39.040
of what I've, we've come to feel
making this film and traveling

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:45.700
across America and meeting all
these people, I mean hundreds,

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:52.690
is that music is the one
thing that unites the races.

01:08:52.690 --> 01:08:58.820
Music is like the, it
is the communication

01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:02.810
that transcends everything
else, and it's music

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:05.420
that actually brings people
together and it's music

01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.030
that puts an African-American

01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:15.420
in a white person's home before
any government decree or law

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:19.480
or any book or newspaper.

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.090
It's a record that
brings those out

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.840
and the record brings
those ideas

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.460
and those feelings
into someone's home.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.500
And how we appreciate other
cultures generally is first

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.920
through music.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:35.230
I mean before Reggae
took off with Bob Marley,

01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:37.780
most people could have written
what they knew about Jamaica

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:39.750
on the back of a postage stamp.

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:43.080
It was music that made an
awareness of the West Indies,

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.420
that's how we hear
about those cultures.

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.470
And because generally
film doesn't,

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:51.520
from other cultures
doesn't penetrate

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.060
to the same degree
popular music does.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.900
So I think music was
actually something

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.130
that brought these
cultures together,

01:09:58.130 --> 01:10:00.980
and they're all listening
and playing with each other.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.730
I'm always bemused
by the kind of some

01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:07.650
of the really weird theories you
read in books about this person

01:10:07.650 --> 01:10:11.440
and this person, it's
not as clean as that,

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.060
everything is bleeding
one into the other.

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:18.200
I mean you could certainly make
a strong case that there's a lot

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:21.840
of Irish folk music in Blues,
and if you talk to someone

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.200
like Taj he would
absolutely agree with you.

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.200
He would also probably
say that there's a lot

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.640
of Native American music
in some of the delta Blues

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.970
because there was a lot
of Native American blood

01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:35.380
within the people, like Patton,
that were making that music.

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.630
So there really is
a huge comingling,

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:41.080
I mean every single
African-American Blues performer

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.660
was a massive fan
of Jimmy Rogers,

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:46.530
I mean they all had
Jimmy Rogers records.

01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:47.830
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:49.130
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: You saw
Jimmy Rogers' records were

01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:50.580
advertised in all the
African-American newspapers

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.520
at the time.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.390
So there's a big crossover.

01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:57.270
It's just the thing that fools
people is it's not always the

01:10:57.270 --> 01:11:00.330
people that you would think,

01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:01.710
liking the things
you would think.

01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:05.730
I remember years
ago meeting some

01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:08.670
of these early Hip-hop
artists from the '80s

01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:11.290
and they basically thought
Gary Newman was a God,

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:12.670
Gary Newman and [inaudible].

01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:13.970
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:15.270
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
Now they're not

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.470
into some white dude
that's doing soul music,

01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:21.410
they're into a white guy that's
doing some robotic schtick

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:22.950
that is about as far away

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:25.200
from African-American
culture as you can get.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.410
And we tend to be drawn to
things that are really different

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:30.880
and look different
from what we know.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.200
And so I think it was -- I
just thought it was amusing

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.800
that there was that, that
there's always been a comingling

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.390
of those cultures
and those ideas.

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:43.480
So I kind of think that
was really it for me.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:49.470
The film is about saying all
these radically different

01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:53.210
cultures are in the same
country, that's why America is

01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:55.680
such an incredible
and beautiful place.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.390
And we had actually the most
wonderful luckiest experience

01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:03.230
of a lifetime to be able to
travel in a really deep way

01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:04.660
through all these
different bits of America.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:06.090
And I decided to go,
when you get from --

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:09.330
when you travel from New York
through the Appalachians,

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:16.590
you know, down into Mississippi,
Louisiana, Texas, Hopi,

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:21.280
then over to Hawaii, the idea
that one person in Washington,

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.900
D.C., the President of
all this, is mindboggling.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:27.920
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
Yes, absolutely.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.220
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
It is staggering

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.250
that all this is actually
under this is one country.

01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:32.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes.

01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:34.130
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And
that's an incredible thing.

01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:37.480
And, as we said, when you
travel America you see parts

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:40.510
of old Britain, where
we came from, untouched.

01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:44.220
And you see people with old
British cultures, you know?

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.520
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yes.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.820
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty:
Especially in South Carolina

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.120
when I was down there.

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.420
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes.

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.720
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: I hear,
too, in West Virginia.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.020
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes.

01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:53.320
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: I
wanted to bring up,

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.620
maybe this is a good time, the
importance of gospel music.

01:12:54.620 --> 01:13:00.840
It's kind of central, essential
-- can you talk to that?

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.800
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Well,
it's spiritual and I think

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:11.130
that spiritual music has a
power to it and an energy

01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:14.000
and a passion that
you can't approximate

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.970
in the secular world.

01:13:15.970 --> 01:13:20.450
And I think an example
people will appreciate,

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:24.160
I grew up listening to
little Reggae music as a kid

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:27.240
and since the Rastafarianism
the religion has gone

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.880
out of the music and it's become
dancehall I just don't think the

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.990
music has anywhere near
the same commercial

01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:37.060
and global reach it once did.

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.360
What people were drawn to,

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:44.070
people didn't really
understand Rastafarianism,

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:47.290
but they were drawn to the
spirituality of the music,

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:49.210
the fact that the
people singing it,

01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:52.150
whether it was Winston
Rodney and Burning Spear,

01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:56.560
or Bob Marley, had this
absolutely unshakeable passion

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.340
and belief in what
they are projecting.

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:07.200
And that spiritual belief is
even more powerful than being

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:12.240
in love with your partner,
it's a higher thing.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:20.290
And so I think these preachers
in the south were fundamental

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:23.940
to the emancipation of the
African-American people,

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:26.570
as they told me,
and those preachers,

01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:29.890
those church services
would last the entire day.

01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:34.090
I'm repeating what Ted and
the guys there would tell me.

01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:39.150
And a lot of the time people at
Birch would be up in the pulpit

01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:42.010
and they would be talking
about issues, social issues

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.610
that related to them
and being proud

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:45.910
and standing up for themselves.

01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:47.300
I mean Birch came back and he --

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.970
we met an old lady that was too
old to interview for the film,

01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:51.830
she was like 98, wasn't she?

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:53.130
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Yes.

01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:54.430
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
And she remembered Birch

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:55.730
in the '20s building the church,

01:14:55.730 --> 01:15:00.980
when she was a little
girl, with his bare hands.

01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:04.560
And so he would be standing
up and he would be the person

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.930
that would be putting
forward those ideas

01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:13.990
about how there was equality
was needed, how people needed

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:15.490
to stand up, how they needed to,

01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:19.150
and the church was their
inspiration in that.

01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:21.140
And you can see,
if you're trying

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.630
to track these people
down, when you're looking

01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:23.950
through the African-American
papers,

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:27.510
like the Pittsburgh Courier
and the Chicago Defender,

01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:30.300
all these people that Levy
Bird and Birch is speaking

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:33.180
to each other in these
columns in the paper

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:34.480
and those newspapers,

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.090
most people were
distributing those newspapers,

01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:41.440
like Levy Bird, in Turola, they
were getting those papers sent

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.270
and they were distributing
them on street corners

01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:46.620
because they wanted their
fellow people to hear those,

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.540
read those words and find out
what was going on in the cities.

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:53.310
I think the church, it
was incredibly important

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:57.010
for those people, and
I think in the kind

01:15:57.010 --> 01:16:01.290
of secular era we're living
in now I think it's easy

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:07.010
to forget how important
that spirituality can be.

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:13.350
And I think, Dizzy says in his
book, I think he says something

01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:18.280
like the closest to the New
Testament is those sanctified

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.640
churches, which although
churches look

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.030
down when people are really
losing and getting into it.

01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:23.690
But if you go, if
you see those kind

01:16:23.690 --> 01:16:26.600
of performances you
just get swept up in it.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.500
I mean when we filmed, when
we got all the Triumph choir,

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.830
members in the Triumph choir
from around America to come

01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:36.690
to the little church, it was
really difficult to film it

01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:39.420
because it's really
hard to concentrate

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.720
on shooting something

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.140
when that's going
off in front of you.

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:45.740
It's so explosive, the
emotion that you have

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:47.250
to be constantly
pinching yourself

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:49.420
to remind yourself
to stay on point.

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:56.890
So I think gospel music is,
it's in the very kind of rubric

01:16:56.890 --> 01:17:03.490
of all good contemporary
music, that it's not a --

01:17:03.490 --> 01:17:06.370
it's a commonly known thing that
a lot of the greatest rhythm

01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:09.360
and Blues music came from
people being in the church

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.830
and singing in the church.

01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:15.400
And people sing better being in
churches, people that have sung

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.220
in churches sing better
because they learned to sing

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:22.270
out from a young age,
so you project better.

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:25.500
So I think even on a
practical physical, therefore,

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:28.090
the church makes better singers.

01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:29.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All right.

01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:30.890
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes.

01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:33.900
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So one of
the reasons why we were keen

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.260
to have you at The
Library of Congress

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.210
and to show your film here
and to talk about the film was

01:17:39.210 --> 01:17:42.080
that there's footage from
our collections in the film.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.600
And I'm going to tell a
little bit of the story

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.610
of some footage, which
then you'll pick-up on

01:17:47.610 --> 01:17:49.410
and tell the rest of it.

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:52.690
So this is footage
of Honey Boy Edwards,

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:54.130
whom you've already mentioned,

01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:56.580
who passed away a
few years ago sadly.

01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:00.260
But this footage was made
by Alan Lomax in 1942

01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:03.600
when he was doing
recording for The Library

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.410
of Congress in Mississippi.

01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:09.960
And he brought along a silent
film camera, color film,

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.420
and he filmed some of the
artists that he recorded.

01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:17.050
And out of this footage he put
together a demonstration reel

01:18:17.050 --> 01:18:19.310
that he would take
around and show to people

01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:20.860
about what he had
done in Mississippi,

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.780
and other people brought this
demonstration reel around,

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.080
as well.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:28.800
And over time this reel got
very ratty and the color faded,

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.810
and it was labeled and we don't
know who did the labeling,

01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:34.170
it was back in the 1940s.

01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:35.500
It could have been
Alan, himself,

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.280
but it was probably
someone else.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.790
And so the individual segments
of this film were labeled

01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:44.660
and one of them was
labeled, Charles Edwards,

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.650
which was not Honey
Boy Edwards' name,

01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:48.850
his name was David Edwards.

01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:52.610
And so we just assumed
that this was film

01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:54.300
of some buy named
Charles Edwards,

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:57.600
which would not have been
that significant necessarily

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.630
in the history of
American music.

01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:04.050
But at some point our curator
of the Lomax Collection,

01:19:04.050 --> 01:19:06.990
whose name is Tod Harvey,
whom you met a little earlier,

01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:10.620
Tod had this insight and it was
actually I was the person he was

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.820
talking to, we were sitting in
the reading room and he said

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:17.830
to me, why would Lomax film
this guy playing the guitar

01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:20.170
but then not record his
music, there's no recordings

01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:23.370
from anyone named Charles
Edwards in the collection?

01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:25.080
And I said, you know,
that's a really good point.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:28.840
And we both sort of said, you
don't think they could be?

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.190
Nah, couldn't be.

01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:32.490
[laughter] Because
Honey Boy had gone

01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:35.930
on to be a Grammy winning artist
and Blues Hall of Fame and one

01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:39.590
of the great Blues artists of
the 20th and 21st Centuries.

01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:43.050
So we, so I started, I wouldn't
let this go, I kind of went

01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:44.350
and did a little legwork

01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:47.100
and I started reading both
Lomax' accounts of his meetings

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.020
with Honey Boy and
Honey Boy's accounts

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.510
because he wrote
an autobiography.

01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:52.960
And the reason this was
difficult to determine was

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.000
that there was no other
picture of Honey Boy known

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.070
for 25 years after this event.

01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:59.140
Even Honey Boy in his
own book had no pictures

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.260
of himself to print.

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:04.390
So his appearance had just
changed a lot in those 25 years

01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:07.880
and it was not immediately
obvious that this was him.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:10.470
But I started to read these
accounts and the hat was right

01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:13.370
and the thumb pick was right,
and the guitar was right,

01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:16.240
and I said this has got
to be Honey Boy Edwards.

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:19.720
So we bundled the film
together, we got a good transfer

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.120
from the original which
looks beautiful, as you know,

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:26.890
and we sent it to Michael Frank
who had been Honey Boy's sideman

01:20:26.890 --> 01:20:28.840
and manager for many years.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:32.940
Unfortunately, Honey Boy had
just died a year before we made

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.790
this, we had this insight.

01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:37.490
But we sent it to Michael
and Michael showed it

01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:41.120
to Honey Boy's stepdaughter
and he communicated to us

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:44.030
that her immediate phrase
on seeing this film was,

01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:46.520
that's my daddy, and
so that's how we knew

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.140
that that was Honey Boy.

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:52.940
And then we were really tickled
when you used this footage

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:56.700
in the film, so explain how you
used it because you synched it

01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:59.500
up amazingly with
Honey Boy's music,

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:04.610
so explain how you used it and
how you found out about it?

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:06.930
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: We
were, one of the things

01:21:06.930 --> 01:21:09.410
that got American Epic
started was Michael Frank.

01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:15.490
A friend of ours, Garth Cartra
@, who I mentioned earlier,

01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:17.760
had approached us
and said you know

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:23.950
that these three Blues men
are coming to a festival

01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:31.990
in the Lake District to play
and nobody knows about it,

01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:34.380
it's run by some wealthy
guy and he just brings

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.680
in Blues musicians he likes

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:36.980
and doesn't do any
national promotion,

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:39.150
it's just the locals come.

01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:43.170
And he wanted to have these
three oldest Blues musicians,

01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:47.550
and so I had found out that
Michael Frank looked after all

01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:50.570
of them -- Lockwood,
Homesick and Honey Boy.

01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:55.820
So I called Michael and said,
could we come up and film them?

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:58.550
Money will change
hands if need be.

01:21:58.550 --> 01:22:00.960
And he said, sure.

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.370
You know, I said,
when are they free?

01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:05.070
He said, they're completely
free, no one knows we're here.

01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:06.370
[laughter] Far from the gig.

01:22:06.370 --> 01:22:08.240
And so that's, I'm sure
that's how I met Michael

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.630
and spent this entire
day with all three

01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:12.920
of them interviewing each of
them for a couple of hours each

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:17.070
and then I think an hour or so
with all three of them together

01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:19.270
and we use a part
of that in the film.

01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:23.510
And so then when you made this
discovery, which is amazing.

01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:28.600
This is very strange having
this interview because this is

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.650
like the genesis of the
project full circle, basically.

01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:32.950
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Wow.

01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:34.250
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: So
that's the very beginning

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:35.900
of the whole American
Epic research was that,

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:37.200
doing that interview.

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.510
I did that because I thought
this needs to be filmed

01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:42.230
and one day I'll probably
need it, that's why I shot it.

01:22:42.230 --> 01:22:44.190
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
I'm really glad you did

01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:45.490
because Honey Boy is gone.

01:22:45.490 --> 01:22:46.790
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes.

01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:48.090
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
And, you know?

01:22:48.090 --> 01:22:49.390
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And on
top of it there's three guys,

01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:51.310
so the mountains of
other stuff they talked

01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:53.330
about was just incredible.

01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:55.570
I'd just love to -- I think
one day I'd like to put

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:58.000
that up online so
people can just watch it,

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.670
it's really hilarious and
they go all over the place.

01:23:01.670 --> 01:23:05.020
I mean all these musicians
they knew, but anyway.

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.570
So Michael called
me and he told me

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:11.810
that you'd made this discovery
and that he knew we were going

01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:14.610
to do a piece, this is
after you'd found it,

01:23:14.610 --> 01:23:18.120
and said I can speak to
The Library of Congress

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:22.080
and get permission for you
to use it in your film.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.230
So I was kind of over the
moon that this had turned up,

01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:32.040
and then I spoke to Tod.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.370
And it just seemed to --

01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:35.580
it was like one of those
moments it just seemed to good

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:38.590
to be true, it seemed staggering
that someone had shot this.

01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:40.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: It seemed
too good to be true to us.

01:23:40.050 --> 01:23:41.350
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.260
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And Tod
really had that great insight

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:45.180
that it's got to
be something other

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:46.480
than what it appears to be.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.780
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: So
it had something about it.

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:49.630
As I said, you would have
thought it had been done the

01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:51.750
same day he'd been
recorded, but it wasn't.

01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:53.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:55.070
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And I
don't know where I heard this,

01:23:55.070 --> 01:24:00.750
but I was told that when Lomax
was shooting him he wanted

01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:04.820
to record him and that
Honey Boy had said something

01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:08.160
to the effect, I'm making too
much money on this corner,

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.250
come back another time, and
they arranged another time.

01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:13.770
But I don't know where I -- I
have to say it wasn't germane

01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:15.700
to the film and I just don't
remember where I heard this,

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:17.280
but generally these
things power out,

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.550
I remember they stick
in my mind.

01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:24.680
However, I got a hold
of all the recordings

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:28.200
that Lomax had made
shortly after he shot that.

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.750
I think, was it a
week or two later?

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:31.250
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
I think it was, yes.

01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:36.370
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And
I hired a lipreader to try

01:24:36.370 --> 01:24:39.990
and decipher what he was
singing, couldn't do it,

01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:43.060
and then I hired another
lipreader, couldn't do it,

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:47.060
then I hired another
lipreader, they couldn't do it.

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:50.620
I got five lipreaders,
all of whom I paid,

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.380
until eventually I
found a lipreader

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:54.780
that identified two
words that he was saying.

01:24:54.780 --> 01:25:01.790
And that, I went back to the
tapes and I went, oh, my God,

01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:05.480
this is from Army Blues, one
of the songs he recorded,

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.550
he was actually singing
one of the songs.

01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:13.370
And so an engineer,
Peter Henderson, who said

01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:14.670
and I think it's Army Blues

01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:16.290
and I think the other
one is called West Coast,

01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:20.380
was it Waterfront -- it was
Water Blues or something,

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.940
there's a fragment of that.

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:26.310
Because he's taking
different clips.

01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:28.040
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right,
yes, he shot the camera.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.590
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Two songs,
the bulk of it is Army Blues.

01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:35.110
All right, Peter Henderson, who
worked on a lot of the sound

01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:44.510
for American Epic, is a genius,
won his first Grammy at 21,

01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:51.040
and he's a wonderful guy, huge
important figure in this film

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:55.640
in terms of like always guiding
us in the right approach.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.220
And I said, Peter, you
need to synch this.

01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.170
And he went, you've
got to be kidding?

01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:01.010
[laughter] And he just, he said,

01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:03.650
this guy has never
played the same song

01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:05.980
in the same way twice
in his life.

01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:09.410
But he did a really
amazing job of that.

01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:10.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
A real good job.

01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:12.010
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yes, he does.

01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:13.310
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:

01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:14.610
And so basically he's
playing the same song.

01:26:14.610 --> 01:26:20.680
And so it was incredible, it was
like this really amazing moment.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:21.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yes, it's funny --

01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:24.230
well, I mean that he was playing
Army Blues, which was very much

01:26:24.230 --> 01:26:27.170
on his mind because when
Lomax met him he was going off

01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:30.540
to be drafted, and the reason
that Lomax lost touch with him

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:33.000
for many, many years
was that he assumed

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.560
that he had been drafted but, in
fact, he managed to talk his way

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:39.180
out of the draft by
claiming an injury.

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:42.790
And that injury is a dent in his
head that he got from being hit

01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:46.250
by a bottle of soda
that was thrown at him,

01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:49.100
and that dent is one of the
ways that people were able

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.510
to identify that this
actually was footage of him.

01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:52.810
So it all goes around.

01:26:52.810 --> 01:26:54.110
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Oh,
that's incredible, yes.

01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:57.250
And then what was wonderful
there was all this other

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:59.100
beautiful footage
that you transferred

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:04.040
of kids dancing nearby,
which we also used

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:05.340
at the end of the film.

01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:07.390
And there's something
very touching about that,

01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:11.730
those young African-American
girls dancing in the field.

01:27:11.730 --> 01:27:17.410
And I love old photographs
of people happy decades

01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:20.010
and decades ago and wondering
what happened to them.

01:27:20.010 --> 01:27:21.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes.

01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:25.420
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: There's
an innocence about it.

01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:28.310
Yes, it's very emotional.

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:31.880
So for that reason we
decided in the film

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.090
that there were quite a lot
of dissolves between stills

01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:39.650
from the '20s and '30s, and
then we dissolved a footage

01:27:39.650 --> 01:27:40.950
of that same place.

01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:43.460
So we were all the time tramping

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:46.150
around where we were doing
the interviews, is take --

01:27:46.150 --> 01:27:49.000
I remember our line producer
would be constantly tamping his

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.340
watch and we were trying to
find the exact location of where

01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.650
that still had been taken
so I could match the frame

01:27:55.650 --> 01:27:59.320
and that you could dissolve, so
that people could see how places

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:02.350
in America looked then
and how they look now.

01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:03.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:05.490
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And so
that's kind of the metaphor

01:28:05.490 --> 01:28:11.910
for walking by and just or
as you walked past every door

01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:14.200
and every street just
thinking for a minute what

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:18.190
that building may have housed
80 years ago, 100 years,

01:28:18.190 --> 01:28:20.800
who might have been in there and
what they might have been doing.

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: It's a
great segway to the question

01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:26.520
of how you melded
archival footage,

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.820
I mean you said one way,

01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:29.390
dissolve into the
contemporary footage,

01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:32.240
but I'm sure there are
other ways that you worked

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.180
with both contemporary and
archival footage in the film?

01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:37.790
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Well,
we developed a new technique

01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:41.550
that we invented for using
archival footage, that a couple

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:45.720
of really sharp cinematographers
have spotted.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.550
But most people just go,
it looks really nice,

01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:51.420
and they don't actually
know why.

01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:52.720
[laughter]

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That would be me.

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.270
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Now
it's all scanned at really,

01:28:56.270 --> 01:29:04.710
really high resolution,
sometimes as high as 8K.

01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:06.400
We went to great
efforts to ensure

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:09.370
that everything was original
prints so that it felt

01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:12.770
as tangible as possible,
like the music.

01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:15.080
But what we did with the
archive footage is one

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:18.380
of the issues you have with
historical documentaries is,

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:21.980
and you see this in all of
them, they do something --

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:28.630
on a film the aspect ratio,
which is the shape of the image,

01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:30.670
has changed over the years.

01:29:30.670 --> 01:29:34.080
And now we were in a sort of
letterbox format for a film,

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.800
but in the '20s and into
the '50s we were dealing

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:42.600
with a 4-3 aspect ratio,

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.060
which is essentially
more like a square.

01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:50.080
And so what filmmakers
have done in documentaries

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.710
since there were documentaries

01:29:51.710 --> 01:29:55.860
in the modern format is
they punch into the footage,

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:59.090
now that is to say they zoom
into the footage so that

01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:01.490
that image fills
the whole screen.

01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:04.410
And I'm not knocking it,
if that's what you like,

01:30:04.410 --> 01:30:08.010
but you are basically losing
a massive amount of what

01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:09.970
that original cameraman
framed up.

01:30:09.970 --> 01:30:12.380
And I think in historical things

01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:14.870
and in everything
context is everything,

01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:17.810
you need to see the
whole picture.

01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:20.250
So I like total truth
in documentaries,

01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:23.500
so I mean my view is
just you have the people,

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.980
the family talking, you see the
real photographs and you show

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:28.280
as much of everything
as possible.

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:31.190
So what we did is we did a
technique called over-scanning,

01:30:31.190 --> 01:30:37.500
which is where we scan the
entire film showing the frame.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.950
So this would normally
be cut-off,

01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:42.450
so you see the curved
edges of the frame.

01:30:42.450 --> 01:30:47.010
And then we would scan
the leader of the film,

01:30:47.010 --> 01:30:53.420
which is like the black
leader which is the celluloid

01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:56.470
or the nitrate before you get
to the film, before you get

01:30:56.470 --> 01:31:00.090
to the actual images, and
that would be superimposed

01:31:00.090 --> 01:31:03.100
at the side of the screen, so
you actually have the grain

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.530
of that film at the
side of the screen.

01:31:05.530 --> 01:31:10.250
So basically the picture is
never retracting and expanding

01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:13.000
as it would when you're moving
from contemporary footage

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.410
to old footage, it is
always full screen.

01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:19.400
So you're not only seeing the
entirety of the '20s picture

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.350
with no cropping, in
fact, you're seeing more

01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:23.390
than you would be seeing
when it was projected

01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:25.880
because there would have been
some cropping of those edges,

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:29.380
but also the entire
picture is breathing.

01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:32.430
And so we devised that
technique to use this material

01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:34.490
so that we could
constantly move in and out

01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:36.310
of the old and the new.

01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:38.580
And that was it really.

01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:45.090
And then the other thing is
just a sense of momentum.

01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:48.220
We shot the whole -- I
shot all the interviews,

01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:50.970
much to the chagrin
of my cinematographer,

01:31:50.970 --> 01:31:54.100
on a slider or a dolly.

01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:56.960
That is a device that
allows the camera

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:00.230
to move from left to right.

01:32:00.230 --> 01:32:03.460
And so this gentle movement
is happening, but the idea is

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:08.860
to mimic the feeling of
the way your head looks

01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:10.440
when you're staring at somebody.

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.540
If you're in a situation
of conversation

01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:17.360
with somebody your head is
not held by a metal clamp

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:22.450
so you're unmoving,
and you are moving

01:32:22.450 --> 01:32:24.050
and your constantly
looking around

01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:25.750
and at the sides of the people.

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:29.650
So the sense was that not
more, yes, so essentially it's

01:32:29.650 --> 01:32:32.190
to mimic the feeling as if I
was standing on a porch talking

01:32:32.190 --> 01:32:35.780
to somebody, I would be looking
at them slightly from the left

01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:38.370
and right and it's to mimic
that feeling of being there,

01:32:38.370 --> 01:32:40.040
but it also creates
a sense of momentum

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:42.640
which interestingly enough
blends the old footage

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.070
with the new footage and
the old footage better.

01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:46.370
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Interesting.

01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:47.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes.

01:32:47.670 --> 01:32:48.970
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
That's fascinating to me.

01:32:48.970 --> 01:32:50.270
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
That's just tricks

01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:52.170
of the trade I've never
talked about before.

01:32:52.170 --> 01:32:53.470
[laughter]

01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:58.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well, I
think we're probably running low

01:32:58.150 --> 01:33:01.110
on time, so we should talk
very briefly about some

01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:04.290
of the related products
that you've come out with

01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:07.050
in addition to the film, itself.

01:33:07.050 --> 01:33:11.020
One thing that really
interests me is the box set,

01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:13.840
which you talked
about the influence

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.730
of the Harry Smith
anthology in the film

01:33:15.730 --> 01:33:19.150
and this is sort of
a similar concept.

01:33:19.150 --> 01:33:23.700
How did you conceptualize
the set?

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:28.930
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Well,
the set is 100, maybe 100,

01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:34.220
as I mentioned 100 groups
or musicians were researched

01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:39.770
for the film across all these
different genres of music.

01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:46.230
I wanted American Epic
to have all the kinds

01:33:46.230 --> 01:33:48.000
of indigenous music in it

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.570
that other sets before
hadn't included.

01:33:53.570 --> 01:34:00.410
And so the Hispanic, the
African-American, the Hawaiian,

01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:02.120
I wanted all those things
to be in it because they're

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:05.180
such an important
part of the mix,

01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:06.530
and so are the Native American.

01:34:06.530 --> 01:34:11.380
And so in doing that and looking
at the artists that should be

01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:15.880
in the film we came
up with the idea

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:18.440
of having what we
thought were the hundreds

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:22.090
of the most powerful songs,
performances from that era.

01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:24.670
It was a method of having
something people would really

01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:29.480
dive into and they could
experience just how colorful

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:33.390
this period was.

01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:35.050
And this is really a metaphor

01:34:35.050 --> 01:34:36.560
for how we should
be proceeding today.

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:40.320
I mean what they were doing then
is what should be happening now.

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.600
We should be embracing
that level.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:43.900
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:45.200
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:48.680
And actually the doorway has
become much more restricted

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:51.400
since that time in terms of what
gets in and what gets in front

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:55.740
of the public or what's
available to the public.

01:34:55.740 --> 01:35:00.210
And so this was a method
of saying here is hundreds

01:35:00.210 --> 01:35:01.510
of the greatest parts.

01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:05.360
And American Epic is
a film, it's not --

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.600
it's what we would
describe as nondidactic.

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:16.830
It's not a scientific project,
it's an emotional response

01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:20.260
to music and a culture
that we love

01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:21.560
and it's basically the reason,

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:24.390
it's the reason why
we love America.

01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:28.650
It's two bricks in one American,
putting on to film what we love

01:35:28.650 --> 01:35:31.020
about America, and we're
doing it at the point

01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:33.970
when America really kind of
explodes and comes into its own,

01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:39.180
which is the '20s, and the world
is still kind of in the throw

01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:41.430
of what America developed
in the '20s.

01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:48.020
And so those songs, when you
watch the American Epic films,

01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:49.680
the visual metaphor we use

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:52.800
to convey how the film is being
approached is an old record

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:55.400
album is kind of pulled off the
shelf and we see the book open,

01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:57.450
and these were those
old leather-bound books

01:35:57.450 --> 01:35:59.260
that people would
put their records in.

01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:00.560
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Albums.

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.830
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes, that's
where the term album comes from,

01:36:02.830 --> 01:36:05.680
like a photo album except
you had your records in it.

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:06.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:08.280
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
And years later,

01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:09.980
a few years later record
companies got the idea why don't

01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:11.400
you put someone's photograph

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.910
and have all one
person's records in there.

01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:16.080
But before then you'd buy
these leather-bound books

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:18.360
and you'd put your singles,
if you will, in that

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.860
and that would become
your record album.

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:24.460
And so you see that book
turning and you see the records

01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:28.080
and we zoom in on a record
and we hear the story behind

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:30.250
that record, some are an
artist you might have heard

01:36:30.250 --> 01:36:32.390
or many you will
never have heard.

01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:34.190
And the idea that
we're suggesting is

01:36:34.190 --> 01:36:37.580
that there are hundreds of
thousands of these records

01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:40.260
and here are 10 of
these stories, go forth

01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:43.400
and explore yourself, because
behind every one there may be a

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.510
story like this.

01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:49.750
And so the book, the box set,
is a method of going into 100

01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:53.680
of those things and you
can start to extrapolate

01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:56.700
from looking at the film what
the stories are about those.

01:36:56.700 --> 01:37:02.310
So the box set has I think
it has lyrics transcribed

01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:04.870
for all the songs, which many
have never been transcribed

01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:08.690
before, and again in an
emotional response as opposed

01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:13.480
to historical we have quotes
from the artists or their family

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:16.560
about every single one, that
was incredibly hard to find

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.570
that once you said, oh, we're
going to do this for everyone.

01:37:18.570 --> 01:37:21.750
It was really difficult,
and stills for most of them,

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:23.300
I mean there's many,
many people in there

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:25.970
that music fans have
never seen before.

01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:28.710
But the big breakthrough
is the sound.

01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:30.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes, I
wanted to talk about that, yes?

01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:31.940
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: That's
a huge part of American Epic.

01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:40.800
In a music film or any film
sound is 50% of a movie,

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.800
and yet sound is often a big
neglected part of features,

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.860
it's like a poor cousin,

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:50.580
it's a thing that's generally
tossed off at the end.

01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:54.500
And so here when we had the
Western Electric recording

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.750
system and Nick Burger
and Ginny had got

01:37:56.750 --> 01:38:00.390
that machine working we recorded
all the contemporary artists

01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:02.450
on it first.

01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:04.600
What was amazing was

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:07.420
that I suddenly could hear
how the old records might have

01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:10.090
sounded because I was
hearing Willie Nelson

01:38:10.090 --> 01:38:12.400
or Elton John on that machine.

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:16.890
I in my mind's ear hear how
John Hurt was meant to sound,

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:18.810
how those records
might have sounded,

01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:21.370
because we were the first
people in almost 80 years

01:38:21.370 --> 01:38:25.120
that were using this machinery
that made those records.

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:28.810
And so I said, spoke to Nick and
said, look, how would you feel

01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:30.110
about doing some serious R

01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:32.250
and D work using what we've
learned recording this

01:38:32.250 --> 01:38:34.900
to transfer these records?

01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:40.070
And Nick being the highly
professional individual he is

01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:43.450
kind of put that off for
months and months and months,

01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:45.260
but he was -- he was actually
doing it, he just didn't want

01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:46.560
to say he was going to do it

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.530
until he figured he could make
a significant improvement.

01:38:49.530 --> 01:38:51.510
And he said, okay, I'll do it,

01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:53.400
but he'd actually
figured it out.

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.430
And so he was able to
transfer these old records

01:38:57.430 --> 01:39:03.000
and bring things out in them
that we never heard before,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.640
but the main thing is
they were really musical,

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:08.160
the transfer sounded
really, really musical.

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.300
They had a kind of
musicality and nuance

01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:15.190
to them I'd never heard
and there were songs,

01:39:15.190 --> 01:39:17.830
these songs were
making me feel things

01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:19.880
that I had never felt before.

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:23.290
And so we asked him
to get involved

01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:24.590
in transferring all the disks

01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:28.460
for the compilation,
as well as the film.

01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:33.020
And what I noticed I'd never
heard before is that the trouble

01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:36.670
with the '20s music is that
the disks they recorded

01:39:36.670 --> 01:39:40.050
to were often so gnarly and
it's so difficult for people

01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:43.420
to know how to play them back
that the problem you have is

01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:46.540
after four or five songs
your ears get really tired

01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:48.940
and you can't listen to
any more and you want

01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:50.240
to put a modern recording

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.010
on that's made on
tape or something.

01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:54.760
Here, on this box set, you
don't have that affect anymore,

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:57.550
you can just listen to the song,
song after song, they just roll

01:39:57.550 --> 01:40:00.460
into each other because they
have a musicality of flow

01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:03.610
to them but they
also have a clarity.

01:40:03.610 --> 01:40:07.220
And so the engineers, Peter
Henderson and Joel Teftella @,

01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:09.640
they did just insane amounts

01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:13.630
of work manually removing all
the clicks from these records

01:40:13.630 --> 01:40:16.320
without putting them through
processing and stuff like this.

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.620
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
That's amazing.

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.920
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: So
everything sounds very open,

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.120
like there's lots of air,
you can really hear the room,

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.330
you can just when you hear the
recordings you can hear the

01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:25.940
sound of the record, the
performance as it echoes

01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:28.170
around the room that
they're in recording it.

01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:30.960
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And you
actually have before and after

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:34.340
of the recording to kind
of compare the improvement?

01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:35.640
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: Yes.

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:36.940
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
I mean, yes, you can,

01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:39.000
we can play an example of one of
these disks how they would sound

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.070
like if you transferred
them on a normal turntable

01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:44.850
and then we can play an
example of how they would sound,

01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:46.330
how they sound like now

01:40:46.330 --> 01:40:49.120
when they've been
transferred to the system.

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.420
And, yes, so then --

01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:53.140
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty: And then
we can play a reimagined version

01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:55.080
where we rerecord the song

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.160
in the present day
on the same machine.

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.000
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
the contemporary, doing that.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.090
But, yes, so there are 12,
I think 12 album releases,

01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:03.660
there's the box set,
there's a soundtrack,

01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:07.620
and then there are 10 artists
and genre compilations.

01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:09.900
So there's all of John
Hurt's recordings,

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:14.090
a selection of the
Memphis Jug Band stuff.

01:41:14.090 --> 01:41:15.860
Yes, it's pretty --

01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:17.160
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
It's productive.

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.790
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
it's very -- yes, yes.

01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:20.770
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And you
have your companion book, too,

01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:24.710
a beautiful, beautiful companion
book with all these photographs,

01:41:24.710 --> 01:41:28.910
it felt like a scrapbook
that's kind of done up right.

01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:30.210
[laughter]

01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:31.510
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And, yes.

01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:32.810
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:

01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:34.110
An award-winning
book we should say.

01:41:34.110 --> 01:41:35.410
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty:
Yes, thank you.

01:41:35.410 --> 01:41:36.710
Yes, we wanted to let the
reader feel like they were

01:41:36.710 --> 01:41:38.200
on the journey with us,

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.910
understanding how Bernard did
the research and what it was

01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:43.920
like to be traveling across
America, meeting these people.

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.470
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes,
that's like kind of the --

01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:50.530
we get asked a lot about making
the films, and so the book is --

01:41:50.530 --> 01:41:51.830
I mean all the parts are meant

01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:53.670
to be really essentially
somewhat exclusive,

01:41:53.670 --> 01:41:56.450
so that's really the insight of
how everything was put together

01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:57.750
and it's an opportunity
to tell a lot

01:41:57.750 --> 01:42:00.690
of stories you can't
tell in a film, but yes.

01:42:00.690 --> 01:42:02.110
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
And Elijah Walt.

01:42:02.110 --> 01:42:03.550
&gt;&gt; Allison McGourty:
Oh, he's wonderful, yes.

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:05.720
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: You
worked with him on the book.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:08.650
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon:
Elijah is fantastic.

01:42:08.650 --> 01:42:12.060
He's like a scientist
with words.

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:16.350
He's really, he was really
helpful, he came in and went

01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:18.470
through the iteration before
we went to see Redford

01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:20.730
with it and recorded it.

01:42:20.730 --> 01:42:26.210
And Elijah has got a
wonderfully acute eye and ear

01:42:26.210 --> 01:42:28.760
for exactly what the
sentence is saying.

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:31.910
Because here, I mean you
raised this thing about this,

01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:34.910
the question about the
slide guitar earlier

01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:36.320
and where it came from,

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:40.050
and I just presented the
information that we found.

01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:42.490
I think it's not possible
to be absolutely right

01:42:42.490 --> 01:42:43.870
on any of these things.

01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:45.170
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:42:45.170 --> 01:42:46.470
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: And so
there are statements you have

01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:50.910
to make in a film where
as emotionally to try

01:42:50.910 --> 01:42:53.260
to tell a story and people
in the room is we have

01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:55.040
to steer the audience
room to room.

01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:00.730
And Elijah was very helpful in
having a line of iteration not

01:43:00.730 --> 01:43:03.880
to say more than it
was meant to say.

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:05.180
Yes.

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:06.480
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: That's key.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.780
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: It's
really, it's very important.

01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:09.080
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: We
know this in radio.

01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:10.380
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Yes, yes.

01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:11.680
Anything else?

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:12.980
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: No.

01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:14.280
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
Well, let's see.

01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.580
I think we covered
a lot of ground.

01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:18.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I think
we've covered a lot of ground.

01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:19.640
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yes.

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And I
think we have to get you

01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:23.790
over to the soundtrack so that
you can actually get your movie

01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:25.090
screened tonight.

01:43:25.090 --> 01:43:26.390
&gt;&gt; Bernard MacMahon: Okay.

01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:27.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, once
again, these are the Producers

01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:31.420
and Director and
Writer of American Epic,

01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:36.120
which was a series of films
that became a series on PBS.

01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:38.750

SiriusXM Radio,
