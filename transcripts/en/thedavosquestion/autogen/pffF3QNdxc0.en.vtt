hi I'm just going to talk about this
 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.460
hi I'm just going to talk about this
question that's categorized under

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470
question that's categorized under
 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.230
question that's categorized under
technology I'm just going to read it

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240
technology I'm just going to read it
 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.000
technology I'm just going to read it
unemployment rates are rising and one of

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010
unemployment rates are rising and one of
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.830
unemployment rates are rising and one of
the main reason is because technology is

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
the main reason is because technology is
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.259
the main reason is because technology is
replacing labor how can we solve the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269
replacing labor how can we solve the
 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.879
replacing labor how can we solve the
unemployment crisis and improve the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
unemployment crisis and improve the
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.129
unemployment crisis and improve the
standards of living workers when there

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
standards of living workers when there
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.170
standards of living workers when there
is rapid growth in technology use okay

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
is rapid growth in technology use okay
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.840
is rapid growth in technology use okay
well I wanted to talk about this because

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
well I wanted to talk about this because
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.970
well I wanted to talk about this because
I sort of agree with this and I sort of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
I sort of agree with this and I sort of
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.460
I sort of agree with this and I sort of
don't I mean obviously this question was

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
don't I mean obviously this question was
 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.220
don't I mean obviously this question was
sent by someone in a developed country

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230
sent by someone in a developed country
 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.870
sent by someone in a developed country
because really if you look at the impact

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
because really if you look at the impact
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240
because really if you look at the impact
of technology on balance it definitely

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
of technology on balance it definitely
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.940
of technology on balance it definitely
is creating jobs but it is not

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
is creating jobs but it is not
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770
is creating jobs but it is not
necessarily creating jobs where jobs

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780
necessarily creating jobs where jobs
 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.200
necessarily creating jobs where jobs
have historically existed so you know

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
have historically existed so you know
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.670
have historically existed so you know
the single biggest impact of technology

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
the single biggest impact of technology
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.700
the single biggest impact of technology
is to bring the world together to allow

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
is to bring the world together to allow
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.250
is to bring the world together to allow
more collaboration to allow what we call

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
more collaboration to allow what we call
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.740
more collaboration to allow what we call
in business and value chains to emerge

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750
in business and value chains to emerge
 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.110
in business and value chains to emerge
that it connects different players in a

that it connects different players in a
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.310
that it connects different players in a
variety of different parts of the world

eat or in a city but increasingly it's

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
eat or in a city but increasingly it's
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.920
eat or in a city but increasingly it's
convenient and more affordable for a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
convenient and more affordable for a
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260
convenient and more affordable for a
company to have some kind of work done

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
company to have some kind of work done
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.580
company to have some kind of work done
in a region where the people will work

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
in a region where the people will work
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.429
in a region where the people will work
for less and that isn't comfortable for

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439
for less and that isn't comfortable for
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.770
for less and that isn't comfortable for
the people who might have otherwise done

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780
the people who might have otherwise done
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.140
the people who might have otherwise done
the job in a higher wage region but for

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150
the job in a higher wage region but for
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390
the job in a higher wage region but for
those people who get the job in the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
those people who get the job in the
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.920
those people who get the job in the
region where they are willing to work

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
region where they are willing to work
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.390
region where they are willing to work
for less the reason they're willing to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
for less the reason they're willing to
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100
for less the reason they're willing to
work for less is because there no other

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
work for less is because there no other
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.740
work for less is because there no other
jobs there so if you take a global view

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
jobs there so if you take a global view
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.320
jobs there so if you take a global view
I think you can argue that technology is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
I think you can argue that technology is
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.020
I think you can argue that technology is
an unalloyed benefit to employment and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
an unalloyed benefit to employment and
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.149
an unalloyed benefit to employment and
and the other way I think technology is

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
and the other way I think technology is
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.070
and the other way I think technology is
a benefit to employment and I'll get in

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
a benefit to employment and I'll get in
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.539
a benefit to employment and I'll get in
a minute to how I agreed it with this

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
a minute to how I agreed it with this
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.469
a minute to how I agreed it with this
question is that it's basically just

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479
question is that it's basically just
 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.270
question is that it's basically just
increasing the pace of the economy and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
increasing the pace of the economy and
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.140
increasing the pace of the economy and
when economic payson and economic

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
when economic payson and economic
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.980
when economic payson and economic
activity speeds up that tends to create

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
activity speeds up that tends to create
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.649
activity speeds up that tends to create
more value

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659
more value
 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.410
more value
and more productivity and more jobs

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420
and more productivity and more jobs
 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.929
and more productivity and more jobs
almost by definition and I am very much

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939
almost by definition and I am very much
 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.940
almost by definition and I am very much
a believer as a technology writer I

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950
a believer as a technology writer I
 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.069
a believer as a technology writer I
wrote a book about Facebook called the

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079
wrote a book about Facebook called the
 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.389
wrote a book about Facebook called the
Facebook effect and I've written about

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399
Facebook effect and I've written about
 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.990
Facebook effect and I've written about
technology for 20 years that technology

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000
technology for 20 years that technology
 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.679
technology for 20 years that technology
is increasing the pace of communication

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689
is increasing the pace of communication
 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.080
is increasing the pace of communication
and therefore making a lot of things

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090
and therefore making a lot of things
 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.910
and therefore making a lot of things
more efficient in modern society

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920
more efficient in modern society
 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.089
more efficient in modern society
efficiency leads to productivity overall

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099
efficiency leads to productivity overall
 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.039
efficiency leads to productivity overall
leads to jobs again those jobs may not

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049
leads to jobs again those jobs may not
 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.110
leads to jobs again those jobs may not
be in the developed world but let me

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120
be in the developed world but let me
 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.479
be in the developed world but let me
just like so but there isn't a

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489
just like so but there isn't a
 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.970
just like so but there isn't a
legitimate question if the developed

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980
legitimate question if the developed
 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.520
legitimate question if the developed
world is where we live which I do I live

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530
world is where we live which I do I live
 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.400
world is where we live which I do I live
in New York how are you going to get

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410
in New York how are you going to get
 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.069
in New York how are you going to get
more jobs especially for people with

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079
more jobs especially for people with
 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.130
more jobs especially for people with
less training in an age when technology

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140
less training in an age when technology
 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.110
less training in an age when technology
is having all these effects and I think

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120
is having all these effects and I think
 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.970
is having all these effects and I think
we don't have the answer especially in a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980
we don't have the answer especially in a
 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.979
we don't have the answer especially in a
country like the US where education is

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989
country like the US where education is
 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.729
country like the US where education is
so disregarded so the only real answer

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739
so disregarded so the only real answer
 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.360
so disregarded so the only real answer
to unemployment caused by technology

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370
to unemployment caused by technology
 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.190
to unemployment caused by technology
which really is more about displacing

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200
which really is more about displacing
 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.050
which really is more about displacing
jobs than actually making them

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060
jobs than actually making them
 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.080
jobs than actually making them
unnecessary is better education so that

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090
unnecessary is better education so that
 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.539
unnecessary is better education so that
people can do higher value work because

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549
people can do higher value work because
 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.460
people can do higher value work because
if the pace of the economy increases

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470
if the pace of the economy increases
 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.960
if the pace of the economy increases
there's always going to be work for

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970
there's always going to be work for
 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.420
there's always going to be work for
people who are trained that's my overall

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
people who are trained that's my overall
 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.750
people who are trained that's my overall
view on that so thanks a lot
