It's fucking hilarious.

On this show,
here's what happens,

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:46.379
a bunch of comics tell true
stories and that's all it is.

Ladies and gentlemen,
everyone's favorite Monchichi,

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.283
Mr. Bobby Lee everybody!

[Cheers And Applause]

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:55.221
- So, I make bad
choices in life.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.157
And my instinct
is all fucked up.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:59.592
95% of my instincts is wrong.

[Audience Laughs]

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.028
I could be a zombie
apocalypse and just

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:03.663 align:start size:84% position:16%
run toward the
zombies head first.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:04.931
[Audience Laughs]

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.566
Like, I can't even
believe I'm alive.

[Audience Laughs]

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.969
So, this is, I was on
a show called MadTV.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.871
It was a sketch show on FOX, and

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.974
4th season I show up one
morning, we had rehearsals.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:17.310
And there was a little white
girl sitting on the couch,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.245
and she's eating
(laughs) yogurt.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.214
I go, "Oh that's nice".

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.148
[Audience Laughs]

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.817
You need sustenance, you know.

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:26.119
And for some reason,
this is what I did.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.988 align:start size:81% position:19%
I grabbed the back
of her head and

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.723
I farted in her mouth.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.093
[Audience Laughs And Claps]

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:37.263 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like just (mimics fart

[Audience Laughs]

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.969 align:start size:84% position:16%
Ugh, it's so
shameful (whimpers).

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.272 align:start size:97% position:3%
An actor named Ron Peterson
physically attacked me.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.774
He punched me in
the face, right?

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.542
I get beat up a lot.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:50.844
[Audience Laughs]

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.278
And, Mike McDonald who
played Stewart put him

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.013
in a rear-necked
choke hold, right?

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.549
Chaos, I'm laughing,
It's fucking hilarious.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.118
[Audience Laughs]

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.854
But it turns out, that girl
was a new actress we hired,

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.790
named Christa Flanagan,
she's really talented.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.259 align:start size:97% position:3%
And so, I go home after
rehearsals and I take a nap.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.760
I wake up and they said,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.864
"You have to get a lawyer
for sexual harassment."

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.265
[Light Audience Laughter]

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:15.301
Sexual harassment,
I've never farted in

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.037
anybody's mouth
during sex, ever.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.307
That's not a move.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.809
[Audience Laughter]

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.646
"That was a great movie,
hunny. (mimics fart sound)

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.114
[Laughter]

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:29.382
So they have to get a lawyer.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:31.784
So Monday, I'm in a law
office in Beverly Hills,

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:33.253
and there's all these lawyers.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:36.022 align:start size:97% position:3%
And a lawyer says, "Okay,
Bobby tell me what happened."

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.257
(chuckles)

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:41.127
Okay so, I don't know,
I show up to rehearsals.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.065
I see a girl sitting
there eating yogurt.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.400
[Audience Laughs]

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.501
She loved it.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.071
It looked delicious, you know.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.840
And I grabbed the
back of her head...

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.074
[Audience Laughs]

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.843
and I farted in her mouth.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.912
[Audience Laughs]

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.413
There's a 20 second pause,

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.715
in the back you hear, "Why?"

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.085
[Audience Laughs And Claps]

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.787
Like I have a fucking reason.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.289
[Audience Laughs]

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.424
Like it's cultural or something.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:13.193
That's the Korean "Hello".

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.961
[Audience Laughs]

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:19.365 align:start size:94% position:6%
When you land in Seoul,
we go (mimics fart noise).

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.201 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then, when
happened after that is,

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:25.038 align:start position:0%
I bought her a gift certificate
to for a massage place.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.641
And I put her on my sketches,
and we're best friends now.

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:30.577
So, that's the story.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:31.611
[Audience Claps]

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:32.612
Thank you so much, thank you.

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.113
[Audience Cheers]

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:36.349
Thank you so much, thank
you, high-five, high-five.
