00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.160
Area 51 is now so ingrained into popular culture
that it’s virtually synonymous with Aliens;

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.070
it’s impossible to mention one without the
other somehow creeping into the conversation,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.849
but why are the two so intrinsically linked?

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.180
Why do we automatically picture little green
men any time someone so much as mentions the

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.280
words, Area 51?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.750
First it’s important to realize what Area
51 actually is.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.100
For all intents and purposes and according
to every government document ever released,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.899
Area 51 is a “secret” military base where
they test experimental pieces of military

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:48.960
hardware.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.430
For example, experimental jets such as the
SR-71 Blackbird and the Lockheed U-2 Dragon

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.670
Lady were tested at the Area 51 base.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.789
The latter of which was actually the first
piece of hardware publicly known to have been

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.690
constructed and tested there.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.500
The site Area 51 was built on was supposedly
first chosen due to the incredibly smooth

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.880
land found on nearby lake beds, coupled with
the area’s natural inaccessibility.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.830
Both of these features made it perfect for
testing aircraft like the Lockheed U-2 which

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.000
required a large area of flat land from which
it could take off and land, while at the same

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.400
time required being in an area enemies of
the US couldn’t, at the time, easily lay

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.580
their peepers on.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.990
Understandably for a location that deals in
incredibly sensitive military information

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.580
that costs billions to produce, the government
has a real hard on for keeping it secret.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.610
However, over the years, this hasn’t exactly
panned out.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.990
For example, on April 19th, 1974, Astronauts
taking part in a Skylab mission accidentally

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.471
photographed “the airfield at Groom Lake“-
Groom Lake being an alternative name for Area

00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:57.471
51.

00:01:57.471 --> 00:02:02.220
The funny part being that this photo wasn’t
taken by the ship the Astronauts were on,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.970
it was taken by one of the Astronauts when
he pointed his camera out of the window.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.069
This is despite the fact that said astronaut
was under specific instructions not to take

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.860
pictures of that particular area of Earth;
it’s not currently known whether or not

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.230
this event was a mistake made by the astronaut
or a conscious decision on his behalf.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.820
The first known picture of the site to eak
its way into the public domain was taken in

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.950
1968 during a U.S. Geological Survey, however,
as far back as 1955 papers have made passing

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.200
reference to the facility, referring to it
as a “super-secret atomic energy commission

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.790
installation“- they obviously sucked at
naming things back then.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.060
Though the government has always maintained
a rather tightlipped stance on the base, slip

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.870
ups have been made in the past.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.320
For example, in this PDF, Area 51 is referred
to, by name, by the, then CIA director Richard

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.380
Helms in a secret memo discussing air reconnaissance
of North Vietnam in 1967.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.120
However, for the most part the government
has always either remained coy or simply ignored

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.120
the site altogether when referring to it in
official documentation.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.000
As for what it’s like to work at Area 51,
unlike pop-culture would have you believe,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.620
the people who worked there aren’t forbidden
from ever speaking to their family or held

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.240
in giant underground bunkers a-la Independence
Day.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.180
Just ask James Noce, who worked in the secret
facility for decades; though James has been

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.790
sworn to secrecy, as is to be expected when
you work on highly experimental classified

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.570
government projects, he’s free to talk about
his experiences there.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.600
For example, James noted that he was always
paid in cash, whereas others were paid in

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.160
cheques from companies they didn’t work
for.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.310
Even more interesting, when a plane from Area
51 crashed once, James was tasked with confiscating

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.070
the cameras of a nearby family, who were quickly
rewarded with a fat stack of cash for their

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.070
silence.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.120
So why do we think aliens are stored there?

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.530
Although the testimonials of people like James,
trusted government and military officials

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.300
with decades of experience, do include a number
of telling facts about Area 51, he and the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.170
other people who’ve spoken out about it
have never once alluded to any sort of alien

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.290
activity ever occurring there.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.370
But of course, the government would say that;
governments lie all the time about stuff like

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.370
this.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.370
So what about Roswell?

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.160
Surely that’s when all the rumors started,
right?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.489
Well, not so much.

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.930
Though today some conspiracy theorists believe
that the craft that crashed at Roswell was

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.270
of Alien origin and that it was or is now
being stored in Area 51, when the incident

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.270
first took place, area 51 wasn’t mentioned
in any documentation from that time.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.000
Not to mention the fact that the two sites
are hundreds of miles apart.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.040
If the wreckage was of alien origin and it
was moved, it’s likely the government would

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.010
have moved it somewhere closer.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.090
Though the Roswell Daily Record from July
6th, 1947 did feature the words “Flying

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.950
Saucer” on its front page, secret government
facilities, and in particular Area 51, were

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.950
not mentioned.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.700
As noted above, it would be another 20 years
before Area 51 was even referred to in an

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.830
official sense; people back then had no idea
it even existed, meaning that they’d have

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.570
been unable to suggest that the wreckage could
have been taken there, even if they did believe

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.720
it was of extraterrestrial origin.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.960
In fact, it would appear that the stories
about aliens being held in Area 51 are a rather

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.130
recent invention.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.600
It wasn’t until 1989 when the awesomely
named Robert Lazar appeared on a Las Vegas

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.199
TV Station under the guise of a government
scientist and stated that Area 51 was just

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.570
full of alien technology, that interest in
Area 51 and aliens really started to gain

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.910
momentum.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.240
We should mention that almost as soon as Lazar
appeared on TV, every single one of his credentials

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.110
was pulled to pieces- no school he claimed
to attend had ever heard of him and the science

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.040
behind his theories was soundly debunked.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.740
However, the very first known mention of Area
51 on TV was a full year earlier in 1988 during

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.720
the show “UFO Cover-Up?: Live!“, which
oddly enough revolved around the possibility

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.130
of the existence of UFOs being covered up.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:12.760
Just to clarify, Roswell, UFOs, Aliens, little
green men and Area 51 were in no way linked,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:55.360
as far as popular public opinion was concerned,
until exactly one man went on TV and claimed

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:24.389
that that was 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:25.389
the case.

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:26.139
Science!
