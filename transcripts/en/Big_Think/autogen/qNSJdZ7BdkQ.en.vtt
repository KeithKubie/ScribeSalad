savannas in Africa human infants are
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.920
savannas in Africa human infants are
incredibly helpless and it's very hard

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
incredibly helpless and it's very hard
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.140

of sense and so there are evolutionary

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750
of sense and so there are evolutionary
 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.880

psychologists and biologists who would
say we evolved a propensity for romantic

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650
say we evolved a propensity for romantic
 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.610

just the mother taking care of the child
but a father as well mothers have this

are less inherently attached to the
 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.000

an evolutionary biologist would say yeah
we have this propensity that's evolved

seem to have a propensity to eat fatty
 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.000

foods for example and yet in the society

in which we live that's not so adaptive

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350
in which we live that's not so adaptive
 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.680
in which we live that's not so adaptive
as it was ten thousand years ago we

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690
as it was ten thousand years ago we
 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.300
as it was ten thousand years ago we
should have eaten fat every chance we

should have eaten fat every chance we
 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.850
should have eaten fat every chance we
got and now we have to sort of fight

it's not necessarily a contradiction

it's not necessarily a contradiction

it's not necessarily a contradiction
that we could have evolved a I keep

a propensity for romantic love and yet
it's it's counter adaptive sometimes to

it's it's counter adaptive sometimes to

it's it's counter adaptive sometimes to

that's about as dramatic as it gets a

that's about as dramatic as it gets a

so we've seen homosexuality even in
 

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.620
so we've seen homosexuality even in
cultures such as their own that have and

on the one hand we could say again from
an evolutionary perspective it makes

an evolutionary perspective it makes

an evolutionary perspective it makes
sense for women to want to remain

on earth we have to reproduce and have

40 years in which they can have children
 

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:23.829
40 years in which they can have children
then you have a nine-month gestation

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839
then you have a nine-month gestation
 

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.049
then you have a nine-month gestation
period and then you have several months

00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:26.059
period and then you have several months

after they give birth and so women can

after they give birth and so women can
 

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.500

only have so many children in their
 

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.169
only have so many children in their
lifetimes so mathematically if we looked

00:17:35.169 --> 00:17:35.179
lifetimes so mathematically if we looked
 

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.730

at this mathematically it makes sense

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:36.740
at this mathematically it makes sense

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:24.970
sites first came up I always used to
joke with friends and say you know

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:24.980
joke with friends and say you know
 

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.410
joke with friends and say you know
wouldn't you hate to have to tell people

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:26.420
wouldn't you hate to have to tell people
 

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.360
wouldn't you hate to have to tell people
when you go around and say how did you

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:28.370
when you go around and say how did you
 

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.260
when you go around and say how did you
meet well you know we met on on a dating

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:32.270
meet well you know we met on on a dating
 

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.080
meet well you know we met on on a dating
site and now I don't feel that way

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:35.090
site and now I don't feel that way
 

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.420
site and now I don't feel that way
anymore I think you know why not it's

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:37.430
anymore I think you know why not it's
 

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.940
anymore I think you know why not it's
it's a perfectly acceptable way of

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:39.950
it's a perfectly acceptable way of
 

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.130
it's a perfectly acceptable way of
meeting other people and so maybe we

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:44.140
meeting other people and so maybe we
 

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.140
meeting other people and so maybe we
some of us old-fashioned folks did or

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.150
some of us old-fashioned folks did or
 

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.720
some of us old-fashioned folks did or
still would fetishize the other kind of

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:49.730
still would fetishize the other kind of
 

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.510
still would fetishize the other kind of
running into somebody on the street or

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:52.520
running into somebody on the street or
 

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.150
running into somebody on the street or
at a bar or being introduced by friends

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:55.160
at a bar or being introduced by friends
 

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.480
at a bar or being introduced by friends
and yeah so there's there's no single

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:58.490
and yeah so there's there's no single
 

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.280
and yeah so there's there's no single
formula so I was reading something

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:00.290
formula so I was reading something
 

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:04.150
formula so I was reading something
recently about the there's a phenomenon

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:04.160
recently about the there's a phenomenon
 

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.660
recently about the there's a phenomenon
in Japan of young men who take as their

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:07.670
in Japan of young men who take as their
 

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:11.519
in Japan of young men who take as their
girlfriends these inflatable dolls

00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:11.529
girlfriends these inflatable dolls
 

00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:13.379
girlfriends these inflatable dolls
and they're not really sex dolls they're

00:21:13.379 --> 00:21:13.389
and they're not really sex dolls they're
 

00:21:13.389 --> 00:21:15.230
and they're not really sex dolls they're
more elaborate than that and they

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240
more elaborate than that and they
 

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.460
more elaborate than that and they
although they do have sex with them I

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:17.470
although they do have sex with them I
 

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.320
although they do have sex with them I
think and they will take them on dates

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:19.330
think and they will take them on dates
 

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.080
think and they will take them on dates
to restaurants and so it it makes one

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:22.090
to restaurants and so it it makes one
 

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.769
to restaurants and so it it makes one
think art can one have a romantic

00:21:25.769 --> 00:21:25.779
think art can one have a romantic
 

00:21:25.779 --> 00:21:29.159
think art can one have a romantic
relationship with a nonhuman with a

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:29.169
relationship with a nonhuman with a
 

00:21:29.169 --> 00:21:30.840
relationship with a nonhuman with a
piece of technology or a piece of

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:30.850
piece of technology or a piece of
 

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:35.129
piece of technology or a piece of
plastic and I think so I think I think

00:21:35.129 --> 00:21:35.139
plastic and I think so I think I think
 

00:21:35.139 --> 00:21:36.480
plastic and I think so I think I think
the answer would be yes but it's an

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:36.490
the answer would be yes but it's an
 

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.340
the answer would be yes but it's an
interesting question does love have to

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:38.350
interesting question does love have to
 

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.610
interesting question does love have to
be reciprocal to be loved and I think we

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:41.620
be reciprocal to be loved and I think we
 

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.529
be reciprocal to be loved and I think we
can create love in our own minds in a

00:21:43.529 --> 00:21:43.539
can create love in our own minds in a
 

00:21:43.539 --> 00:21:46.590
can create love in our own minds in a
way that can probably be rewarding

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600
way that can probably be rewarding
 

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.690
way that can probably be rewarding
although many of us who are involved in

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:48.700
although many of us who are involved in
 

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.810
although many of us who are involved in
relationships with real-life people

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:50.820
relationships with real-life people
 

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:56.680
relationships with real-life people
might not clearly see how

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:56.690
 

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.900
Second Life is a wonderful example I've

00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:58.910
Second Life is a wonderful example I've
 

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.060
Second Life is a wonderful example I've
read statistics that you know the

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:01.070
read statistics that you know the
 

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.370
read statistics that you know the
extramarital sex on Second Life is just

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:03.380
extramarital sex on Second Life is just
 

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.040
extramarital sex on Second Life is just
rampant so it's a it's a it's a easy

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:06.050
rampant so it's a it's a it's a easy
 

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.470
rampant so it's a it's a it's a easy
outlet for people to to pursue these

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480
outlet for people to to pursue these
 

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.900
outlet for people to to pursue these
things but they seem to be real as well

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:10.910
things but they seem to be real as well
 

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.700
things but they seem to be real as well
I mean people have real emotions

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:12.710
I mean people have real emotions
 

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.310
I mean people have real emotions
invested in this it's not as if it's

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320
invested in this it's not as if it's
 

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.760
invested in this it's not as if it's
just a game and so I think technology

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:18.770
just a game and so I think technology
 

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.370
just a game and so I think technology
will will probably keep changing the way

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:21.380
will will probably keep changing the way
 

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:27.640
will will probably keep changing the way
in which we envision love in that sense

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:27.650
 

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.100
I think love does play an important role

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.110
I think love does play an important role
 

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.410
I think love does play an important role
in our economic behavior and it's

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:32.420
in our economic behavior and it's
 

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.840
in our economic behavior and it's
something that we don't allow I think

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:34.850
something that we don't allow I think
 

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.570
something that we don't allow I think
that the dominant model of human

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:37.580
that the dominant model of human
 

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.210
that the dominant model of human
behavior is based these days is based on

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:40.220
behavior is based these days is based on
 

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.520
behavior is based these days is based on
economic behavior that were rational

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:42.530
economic behavior that were rational
 

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.620
economic behavior that were rational
that we're self-interested and we're

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:44.630
that we're self-interested and we're
 

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.330
that we're self-interested and we're
never surprised by self-interest or

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:46.340
never surprised by self-interest or
 

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.450
never surprised by self-interest or
selfishness if we read a headline of an

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:49.460
selfishness if we read a headline of an
 

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.330
selfishness if we read a headline of an
executive that that fudged the books and

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:52.340
executive that that fudged the books and
 

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.160
executive that that fudged the books and
took a big payout

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:54.170
took a big payout
 

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:55.960
took a big payout
we're not that surprised we may be

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:55.970
we're not that surprised we may be
 

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.700
we're not that surprised we may be
disappointed but we're not that

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:57.710
disappointed but we're not that
 

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.830
disappointed but we're not that
surprised and it's because we have this

00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840
surprised and it's because we have this
 

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.620
surprised and it's because we have this
notion that in economics and in all

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:02.630
notion that in economics and in all
 

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.660
notion that in economics and in all
aspects of our lives we're looking out

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:04.670
aspects of our lives we're looking out
 

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.410
aspects of our lives we're looking out
for number one

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:05.420
for number one
 

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:09.280
for number one
we're selfish rational actors and yet

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:09.290
we're selfish rational actors and yet
 

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.410
we're selfish rational actors and yet
love is the opposite of self-interest

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:11.420
love is the opposite of self-interest
 

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.290
love is the opposite of self-interest
it's the exact opposite and so how and

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:14.300
it's the exact opposite and so how and
 

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.150
it's the exact opposite and so how and
yet we would none of us would say that

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:16.160
yet we would none of us would say that
 

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.890
yet we would none of us would say that
love isn't important in our lives either

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:17.900
love isn't important in our lives either
 

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.260
love isn't important in our lives either
so how then can we incorporate a

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:20.270
so how then can we incorporate a
 

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.510
so how then can we incorporate a
consideration of love of concern for

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.520
consideration of love of concern for
 

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.350
consideration of love of concern for
others into our economic behavior and I

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360
others into our economic behavior and I
 

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.700
others into our economic behavior and I
think that this is really important and

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:27.710
think that this is really important and
 

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.690
think that this is really important and
in fact we're seeing now a lot of this

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:30.700
in fact we're seeing now a lot of this
 

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.380
in fact we're seeing now a lot of this
neurological research in this

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:32.390
neurological research in this
 

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.540
neurological research in this
evolutionary biological research that

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:34.550
evolutionary biological research that
 

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.820
evolutionary biological research that
has said we're self-interested and even

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:36.830
has said we're self-interested and even
 

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.980
has said we're self-interested and even
love is a way of promoting our

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:38.990
love is a way of promoting our
 

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.440
love is a way of promoting our
reproductive success we're seeing now

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:41.450
reproductive success we're seeing now
 

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.890
reproductive success we're seeing now
that maybe empathy is also as deeply

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:44.900
that maybe empathy is also as deeply
 

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.930
that maybe empathy is also as deeply
ingrained as self-interest and the

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:46.940
ingrained as self-interest and the
 

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.420
ingrained as self-interest and the
compassion and these would have real

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:49.430
compassion and these would have real
 

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.940
compassion and these would have real
evolutionary advantages as well again

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:51.950
evolutionary advantages as well again
 

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:56.740
evolutionary advantages as well again
think of you know naked humans on two

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:56.750
think of you know naked humans on two
 

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.110
think of you know naked humans on two
legs who can't run very fast living out

00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120
legs who can't run very fast living out
 

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.450
legs who can't run very fast living out
in the African savannas 10,000 years ago

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:01.460
in the African savannas 10,000 years ago
 

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.940
in the African savannas 10,000 years ago
we needed to bond together and not just

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:03.950
we needed to bond together and not just
 

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.060
we needed to bond together and not just
men and women and babies but groups of

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:07.070
men and women and babies but groups of
 

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:11.800
men and women and babies but groups of
people and so maybe empathy is as deeply

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:11.810
people and so maybe empathy is as deeply
 

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.650
people and so maybe empathy is as deeply
ingrained in our evolutionary history as

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:14.660
ingrained in our evolutionary history as
 

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.140
ingrained in our evolutionary history as
self-interest is and in fact we can see

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:17.150
self-interest is and in fact we can see
 

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.590
self-interest is and in fact we can see
this in we there are mirror neurons in

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600
this in we there are mirror neurons in
 

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.540
this in we there are mirror neurons in
our brains and so when we look at

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:22.550
our brains and so when we look at
