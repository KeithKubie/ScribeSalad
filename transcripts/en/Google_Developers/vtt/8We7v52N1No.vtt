00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.515
MARY GROVE: Google for
Entrepreneurs is our umbrella

00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:33.330
effort of all of Google's
programs and partnerships that

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.200
support startups and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.520
entrepreneurs around the world.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.510
Today, we have roughly 50
different efforts live in over

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.940
30 countries around the world.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.330
On the partnership front,
we work with an amazing

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.130
organization called
Startup Weekend.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.030
They're a team that puts on
these 54-hour weekend events.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.390
They'd hack throughout the
weekend and launch companies

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.450
on Sunday night.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.560
One of my favorite programs is
called Jagriti Yatra, and it's

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.900
a train ride across rural India
with about 400 really

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.640
energized youth and mentors.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.750
They discuss and they iterate
and they get off really

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.340
inspired and ready to go out
there and implement that idea.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.810
Women Entrepreneurs on the Web
is a program to get female

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.450
entrepreneurs onto the web to
help build and market and then

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.530
[? scale ?] their businesses.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.560
ARCHANA DOSHI: It's a great
place to get ideas, great

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.330
place to network with
women who are

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.090
pursuing their passion.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.590
MARY GROVE: We're really excited
about a number of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.720
programs across the Middle
East and North Africa.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.190
With our local office in Tel
Aviv, we're seeing a lot of

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.320
opportunities for technology
and entrepreneurship, like

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.790
hackathons with both Palestinian
and Israeli youth,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.090
for example.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.850
Campus London is one of our
most exciting initiatives.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.280
EZE VIDRA: It's a seven-story
building filled with startups,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.560
where startups can get
workspace, access events,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.730
mentorship, all under
one roof.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.460
MALE SPEAKER: Having an
environment like this, you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.890
have specialists
in each field.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: I would never
have had the chance to meet

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.440
people who were developers,
who were designers.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.670
There isn't anywhere else
where you can do this.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.510
MARY GROVE: There's a huge
opportunity to continue to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.230
make an impact, to
scale this work.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.970
And we really want to empower
the next generation of

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.630
entrepreneurs and startups
to be successful.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.720
DEREK SLATER: Welcome back to
a Google Developers Live.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.180
My name's Derek Slater, and I
defend the open internet on

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.850
Google's Public Policy team.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.310
Yesterday, we talked about
measurement tools that can

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.840
empower users to know more about
what's happening online

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.890
and how they can help defend
and protect the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.010
free and open internet.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.270
Today we want to talk more about
the economic impact of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.420
the internet and,
specifically,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.510
entrepreneurship.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.630
We're joined here by two guests,
John Lyman from Google

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.800
for Entrepreneurs and Mike
McGeary from Engine Advocacy.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.090
And we'll start by just having
the two of them introduce

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.400
themselves before we talk about
the economic impact of

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.420
the internet and the policies
that affect it.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.160
John, why don't we
start with you?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.130
JOHN LYMAN: Thanks, Derek, and
thank you for having us on the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.620
show today.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.460
I'm really excited to talk
about entrepreneurship.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.030
I work on the Google for
Entrepreneurs team.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.950
I've been at Google for
about five years.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.680
Before that was in Washington,
D.C., so I've got a tech and

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.920
policy background.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.360
DEREK SLATER: And John, why
don't you tell us-- what is

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.010
Google for Entrepreneurs?

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.520
What's the program about?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.160
JOHN LYMAN: So Google for
Entrepreneurs launched

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.480
publicly in September
of this year.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.110
And our mission is to empower
entrepreneurs across the world

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.190
through products, partnerships,
and programs.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.370
We work with groups as diverse
as Startup Weekend, which

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.160
launches businesses and products
in 54-hour weekend

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.770
sessions across the world and
groups like Campus London,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.710
which is a seven-story building
that Google owns and

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.660
operates in East London.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.400
It's a tech hub where
entrepreneurs and startups are

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.670
working, and accelerators and
others in the space are coming

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.600
together to help them
do their job.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.110
And it really grew out of a
sense that executives had at

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.860
Google that we were-- as a
company having relationships

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.960
with a lot of different
incubators, accelerators, tech

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.960
hubs globally-- it was happening
in a very grassroots

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.410
way, which is a specialty of
Google's, I would say.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.050
But they wanted to figure out,
OK, what are we really getting

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.870
out of these relationships?

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.560
What makes sense?

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.560
How can we help entrepreneurs
the most?

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.680
So they created a small team,
which is now Google for

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.649
Entrepreneurs, to really look
across everything and figure

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.680
out, OK, what's happening and
how can we make sure that

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.560
we're bringing Google's products
and tools to bear in

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.620
the way that makes
the most sense?

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.890
And we're doing it for
a few reasons.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.080
As people know by now, Google
itself started in a garage,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.870
and we think there are a lot of
other people out there who

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.680
are doing the same thing.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.550
We'd like to help them.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.080
Larry and Sergey, the founders
of Google, believe that they

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.100
had a lot of help
along the way.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.590
Silicon Valley's a great place
to start a business, but we

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.960
wanted to help others who are
outside of Silicon Valley do

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.500
the same thing.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.180
And we believe we're
a startup at heart.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.990
We think that we move quickly,
and we're trying to infuse

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.190
those values into others.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.340
We acquire a lot of companies
here in Silicon Valley but

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.920
also globally.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.130
And we want to make sure that
when people come here, they

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.620
feel comfortable as
entrepreneurs.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.080
More than 2/3 of entrepreneurs,
founders, that

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.590
come from companies that Google
has acquired actually

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.550
still work here, which we view
as a very, very good thing.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.580
And we found entrepreneurs all
over the world who we're

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.470
excited to work with.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.050
We estimate that there are
more than 400 million

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.310
entrepreneurs globally, and we
think that 70 million of those

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.590
are working in early-stage
ventures on new

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.860
products and services.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.310
And we're trying to reach them
in a variety of different ways

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.290
and give them all the help that
they need and tell them

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.410
about Google.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.860
DEREK SLATER: Great.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.700
Thanks, John.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.690
So Mike, why don't you tell us
about Engine Advocacy, sort of

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.740
what it's about, where it
came from, and what

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.600
you're doing this year.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.120
MICHAEL MCGEARY: Well
thanks, Derek.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.360
It's great to be here today
with all of you on Google

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.230
Developers Live.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.410
I'm Michael McGeary.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.120
I'm the co-founder, political
director, and senior

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.120
strategist for Engine
Advocacy.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.670
We are a nonprofit based in
San Francisco here in the

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.260
United States.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.290
And our goal is to effect
better public policy by

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.500
leveraging the voices and
stories of the startup

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.770
community and help educate both
startups about government

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.530
and government about startups.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.910
We got started last year,
slightly before many here in

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.500
the US did, around the SOPA/PIPA
fight and around

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.070
some of the copyright
fights that were

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.380
happening in Congress.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.970
But that was actually slightly
away from our core mission,

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.020
which is really to act in a
positive and forward-thinking

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.760
way to find better policy
alternatives where we can on a

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.210
range of different issues.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.440
And the reason is very simple.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.520
And as John alluded to
previously, entrepreneurs and

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.250
the businesses built on the
internet and disruptive,

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.750
technology-focused startups
really do power the economy in

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.490
America and, in many cases,
around the world as well.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.370
And what we want to do is make
it a little easier for those

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.500
businesses to take root and to
get more of those stories to

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.700
effect that policy
and grow those

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.090
businesses going forward.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.070
We have a whole range of
issues that we work on,

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.960
including things like high-skill
immigration in the

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.460
US, patent, spectrum and
broadband deployment.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.310
But one of the reasons that I'm
here today-- and I think

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.620
it's vitally important that
we're having this

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.860
conversation--

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.470
is that without a free and
open internet, it doesn't

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.730
matter what other issues we work
on because innovation in

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.955
this country will be chilled in
a way that we haven't seen

00:07:38.955 --> 00:07:42.470
and in a way that would be
totally detrimental to the

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.840
internet and to the economy
on the whole.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.140
So that is really a
core issue for us.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.270
It's what brought us to the
SOPA/PIPA copyright fight

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.510
earlier this year and
late last year.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.400
And it's what guides us in terms
of how we think about

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.570
the issues that we tackle and
the issues that we want the

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.140
startup community to lend their
voices to in helping

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.380
create better policy.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.785
So that's the background
on us.

00:08:08.785 --> 00:08:10.630
We've been going now for
a little over a year.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.040
We've got members all around
the country who have done

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.130
things as diverse as sign
letters to Congress and meet

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.270
regulators in our office in San
Francisco or take their

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.340
story to Capitol Hill.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.200
And we're looking to do more
of that in the coming

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.440
Congress, and I think we'll
probably talk a little bit

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.580
about today some things we can
expect there on a range of

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.360
policy issues.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.230
But we're excited to be part
of the ecosystem and help

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.794
startups and government connect
in a more meaningful

00:08:36.794 --> 00:08:39.830
and powerful way when it
comes public policy.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.679
DEREK SLATER: Thanks, Mike.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.760
I think one of the interesting
things about Engine that we've

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.630
seen over the last year is
entrepreneurship being more of

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.880
a central focus in public
policy, which, in many ways,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.650
isn't necessarily a natural fit
for the tech community.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.470
What do you think is now
shifting in terms of

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.500
entrepreneurs getting
more involved?

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.090
Do you see that it's hard as
their resistance to sort of

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.400
getting involved?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.460
MICHAEL MCGEARY: I think that
it's become a little bit more

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.820
in vogue for entrepreneurs
to be a part of this.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.330
SOPA was a real catalyst
for that.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.080
But a lot of what we've done
over the last year, and

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.180
alongside people here at Google
and in other places all

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.960
across the internet, has been
really to try to turn that

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.320
moment into a movement.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.340
And really to try and capitalize
off a lot of the

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.550
good stuff we did and a lot of
the good feelings that came

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.220
out of that in order to continue
that discussion and

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.490
continue to get people from
the startup community,

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.770
entrepreneurial community,
more involved in their

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:40.590
government.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.150
And on the flip side of that--
in working with members of

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.820
Congress and their staff and
with regulators and with

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.290
people at the White House and
right on down to state and

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.890
local governments as well--

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.760
I'm finding more and more that
there's a new currency in

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.680
politics in a lot of ways
in that the stories that

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.620
entrepreneurs and investors and
people from this community

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.740
can lend really carry
a lot of weight.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.460
Not just in terms of building
better legislation, but in

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.870
terms of better understanding
and building better

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.230
relationships between members of
Congress, their staff, and

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:15.420
an entrepreneur so that a
member or a staffer or a

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.610
regulator has better
understanding of exactly how

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.810
tech powers the economy and how
their influence really can

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.960
be felt in terms
of the debate.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.330
And beyond that, I think that
understanding also has a

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.680
backbone in some
of the economic

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.750
data that we're seeing.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:36.010
We're going to release a study
tomorrow that says, in no

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.560
small part, that
entrepreneurship is really

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.650
happening everywhere, just
as John was saying.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.366
I know you'll probably
talk more about that.

00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:45.150
But entrepreneurship is taking
root, not just here in Silicon

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.950
Valley and in New York,
but in communities

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:47.860
all across the country.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.360
That's something that speaks
to 435 members of the House

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360
and a hundred US senators.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.400
That's something that everyone
can take a hold of and say,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.010
this is happening in my
community and I want

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:57.730
to help that out.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.250
So that's the message that we're
really working with the

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.190
community to try to push, and
it's been well received on

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.380
both sides.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.490
DEREK SLATER: So John,
you talked about how

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.410
entrepreneurship isn't just
something for Silicon Valley

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.080
or Silicon Alley or even the US,
and you've worked with a

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.690
bunch of communities
around the world.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.950
On the public policy side, we
certainly get asked by many

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.130
different policy makers-- how
can I grow Silicon Valley

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.240
where I am, whether
that's in Idaho or

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.040
in France or wherever?

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.500
What's your take on
that question?

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.210
Are there commonalities that
you see of successful

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:27.610
communities?

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.720
And are there things that
policymakers can do or

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.010
shouldn't do in order
to help grow the

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.650
same sort of ecosystem?

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.530
JOHN LYMAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.170
We get this question
a lot as well.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.810
And I think there's some things
that people across the

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.280
spectrum agree on are probably
necessary, not always

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.550
sufficient, for some sort of
innovation hub to exist.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.410
It's usually proximity to
a university, probably a

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.120
research university.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.680
Good infrastructure, so things
like highways, fast broadband

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.780
speeds, so that people can
actually get to where they

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.030
need to get physically
and electronically.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.030
A lot of times--

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.030
it sounds a little bit weird--
but some sort of

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:16.400
counterculture that appears on
the scene, usually before the

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.030
hub itself.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:21.880
So if you look at places that
are hotbeds of innovation in

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.510
the US and also globally,
Silicon Valley, obviously,

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.230
Boulder, Austin, Boston,
New York, Seattle.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.400
These are places that usually
have a little bit of

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.010
counterculture.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.140
That's usually something that
government can't help that

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.880
much with, but they can get
out of the way sometimes.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.680
So things like that.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.860
And then there are other factors
that I think haven't

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.930
been researched as much
but are interesting.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.270
So non-compete agreements, for
example, are not particularly

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.830
enforceable in California.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.960
Meaning that when people go
to a company and sign an

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.620
agreement that prevents them
from leaving and taking

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:02.430
information with them freely
and openly, those are less

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.470
enforceable in California
than in other parts.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.530
Which means that when people
leave jobs, they take some

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.440
knowledge with them about how
things worked at other

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.820
companies and that helps with
the free flow of information.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.590
I think what's really
interesting is that, in many

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.890
ways, this is the
internet itself.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.610
The internet started at
research universities.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.920
It had a lot of free information
flowing between

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.460
different people.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.790
It was counter-cultural.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.640
Infrastructure was
very important.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.770
So I think those are all things
that can be done to

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.780
help create these
hubs globally.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.470
One point I wanted to follow up
on that Michael made, which

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.460
I think is really important, is
entrepreneurs getting more

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.740
involved in policy.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.810
So SOPA/PIPA was a great example
of people actually

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.400
really coming together and
making change, and I think

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.170
that was important.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.920
I think entrepreneurs like to
be able to see that they can

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.220
have an impact.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.680
SOPA/PIPA, great example.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.610
Here in San Francisco, some of
the work that Twitter and Ron

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.850
Conway did--

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.230
there was a victory
there, right?

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.740
Twitter was going to leave
San Francisco.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.230
Now they are not going to leave

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.060
because of a policy change.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.920
Another example yesterday out
of Washington, D.C. That I

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.090
thought was really interesting
was Uber--

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.520
worked through the system and
are now going to be allowed to

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.710
operate their car ride service
without interference.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.280
But they were able to get
a policy win through a

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.590
grassroots movement, essentially
of users, who

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.120
said, this is a really important
service to us and we

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.070
want to contact our policymakers
and make sure

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.020
that innovation is allowed
to spread.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.380
MICHAEL MCGEARY: And if I could
just launch off of that

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:35.980
for a second--

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.910
I think you're absolutely right,
John, in that point.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.340
And we actually wrote something
on our site this

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.200
morning by our policy analyst,
Ed Goodman, on this, which is

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.980
that we can disagree on things,
but that does not mean

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.150
we should disengage as a
startup community, as

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.730
entrepreneurs.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:54.070
In fact, it means we should
engage even further in a lot

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.290
of ways because, as we saw,
especially with the Uber

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:03.080
example, is when the company
went and worked to make a

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.370
policy alternative, in reality
it worked out.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.310
Now that's not going
to be every case.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.490
We're not always going to win
like we did on Prop E or like

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.580
on SOPA/PIPA.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.280
Prop E is the San Francisco
initiative on

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.790
the ballot last November.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.810
And some of these victories that
we're going to have are

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.910
going to be much, much longer
slogs than a blackout on

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.950
January 18 and a bill getting
pulled on January 20.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:28.330
That was light speed in
Congress, as was JOBS Act, as

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.770
with so many of the great
victories we've had over the

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.620
last year here in the US.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.290
But it's important to stay
engaged in that fight.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.350
It's important for entrepreneurs
to be a part of

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.140
that because, as we've seen,
when they lend their

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.760
particular viewpoint and angle
to that story, it really does

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.880
change the debate in very
meaningful ways.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.120
DEREK SLATER: Well, let's talk
about one part of the JOBS Act

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.490
for a second, particularly
on crowd funding.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.690
That's been a big issue
over the last year.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.690
And it's sort of similar to
what's been happening with

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.120
Uber and Airbnb, where we
have these network-based

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.810
businesses, these communities
being formed, where the law is

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.490
sometimes a little
bit out of step.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.720
What happened with the JOBS
Act and its crowd funding?

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.630
Where does that stand now?

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.820
Are there things, Mike, that
developers, entrepreneurs, who

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.460
are watching this can do in
order to help move that along?

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:16.570
MICHAEL MCGEARY: Well, I think
that JOBS Act, again, went

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.540
through Congress in a very
partisan year, during a very

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.180
partisan election, and did
so in about six weeks.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.250
If you look at the calendar from
when the majority leader

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:30.370
in the House, Eric Cantor, and
some of his colleagues first

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.820
proposed the bill to when the
President signed it in the

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.440
Rose Garden, it was all
of about six weeks.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.240
And, again, that really is
light speed in the United

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.360
States Congress and for
getting things done in

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.140
Washington.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.210
However, that bill
is not yet law.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.060
There are still regulations that
have to be put forth by

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.130
the Securities and Exchange
Commission on crowd funding,

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.570
on a few other pieces of that
bill, in order for it to

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:52.460
become a reality.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.580
And for what a lot of people
from the entrepreneurial

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.310
community would like to see in
terms of crowd funding become

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.520
part of the law and become
something where people can see

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.640
real and direct benefit
off of it.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.160
That process is still ongoing.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.560
There are still ways to--

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.310
as an entrepreneur or as a
developer, as someone who

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.210
works at a startup that could
benefit from crowd funding--

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.680
are still ways to be part
of that debate.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.020
And you can log a comment with
the Securities and Exchange

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:18.430
Commission.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.060
And that's something that is
ongoing, especially on the

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.859
crowdfunding piece.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:25.630
We hope that the SEC will
promulgate those rules early

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.829
in the new year and really
start working towards a

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:30.490
solution so that we
can finally see

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:31.590
that become a reality.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.920
But it's not there yet.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.170
Despite how much work this
community's already put in

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.930
there, there's still a little
bit more to do.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:43.260
But when we get there, if we're
able to, again, lend our

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.882
collective voice to this debate
and help shape the law

00:17:45.882 --> 00:17:48.100
in a way that will work best for
us, I think that'll be the

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.930
most positive outcome overall
for entrepreneurs.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.170
JOHN LYMAN: And I think that's
interesting that you bring

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.380
that up because, I think finally
can people engage to

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.980
shape what happens, but I think
they can also engage and

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.120
hopefully speed it up a bit.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.330
We're hearing from entrepreneurs
that it's taken

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.840
a bit longer than they thought
to actually get regulations

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.990
put around crowd funding.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.310
I think it's going to be
important for entrepreneurs.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.710
And these are not, again,
entrepreneurs in New York, in

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:16.190
Silicon Valley, who oftentimes
have access to financial

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.740
resources and venture capital
that others don't.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.220
But these are the entrepreneurs
in Omaha who are

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.570
trying to do an angel round with
friends and family and

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:30.480
want a platform to be able to
do that a little bit more

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.830
easily than they
have right now.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.170
So I'm really interested to see
where this goes and hope

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.940
that it happens quickly.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:36.590
DEREK SLATER: John, one
of the things you

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.950
talked about was culture.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.810
And another key issue that's
certainly been coming up over

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.170
the last month, and looks like
will be on the front burner in

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.420
2013, is immigration.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.140
For both of you-- what is
the outlook within the

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.300
entrepreneurs' community?

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.580
What do you hear about
in terms of

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.880
immigration, visa issues?

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.730
Is this sort of a front-burner
issue for entrepreneurs these

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.980
days in the Valley?

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.120
And what are the hopes and
desires for what entrepreneurs

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.850
want out of immigration
reform here in the US?

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.020
JOHN LYMAN: Yeah, I think
it's a huge issue.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:15.400
I hear about it quite a bit,
more so, I think, in some ways

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.520
than almost any other
policy issue.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.000
So one quick example.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.470
I have a friend who's a
recruiter in the Valley.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:27.000
And as a lot of developers
know, recruiters are the

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.090
lifeblood, in some ways, of
the Valley because they're

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.250
effectively and efficiently
taking talent from one place

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.390
and deploying it in another.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.210
So they see a lot of resumes.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.440
They talk to a lot of
people, and they

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.260
understand this issue firsthand.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:43.830
This friend went to SoundCloud
for a year, which is one of

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.580
the most successful startups
based in Germany.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.640
It's in Berlin.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.690
And when she recruited there,
she recruited globally.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.130
She had two requirements,
essentially,

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:53.880
that she had to meet.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.560
She had to meet the technical
requirements for the

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.910
engineering position, so the
coding languages, and then,

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:00.630
usually, people had
to speak English.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:01.730
And that was it.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.920
And she had engineers from India
and Eastern Europe and

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.940
Russia and Africa and
all over, Americans.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.080
She moved back about eight
months ago and she's at

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.240
Square, which is one of the
most successful American

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.130
startups around right now.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.220
Immediately, she stopped
recruiting globally.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.060
She just doesn't want
to mess with it.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.920
She can't get visas.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.150
It slows her down.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.080
And so she only recruits
in the US.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.170
Now there's a lot of talent in
the US, but there's obviously

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.800
more talent globally,
and Michael can

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.340
speak to these numbers.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.750
But I think what ends up
happening is when these jobs

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.270
at Square--

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.210
when they're filled and when
they're filled with good

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.550
talent-- that helps Square,
which is an American company,

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.010
but it also helps innovation
in general.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.570
And it helps the local ecosystem
as other jobs are

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:50.520
created when those jobs are
filled with the right people.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.910
So, yeah, incredibly important
issue and one that I hope the

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.510
Congress addresses.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.370
MICHAEL MCGEARY: Well, I can't
agree with that enough.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.780
And I think that we're looking
at a situation, not just here

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.100
in Silicon Valley and in New
York, but we're looking at

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.850
entrepreneurial communities
throughout the country that

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.760
are suffering right now.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.370
And to say that immigration is
a top-line issue, it may be

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:16.700
the only issue in
a lot of cases.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.480
As you said, John, and I can
speak to the numbers as we'll

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.340
have in the report tomorrow.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.370
But with each job that's created
at a technology firm,

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.115
whether it's here in Mountain
View or at San Francisco, New

00:21:27.115 --> 00:21:31.540
York, wherever, we can look and
create an average of 4.3

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.200
jobs in the non-tradable
sector.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.160
So let's dig down from the
economics textbook here.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.270
What's a non-tradable sector?

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.310
It's everything from barbers
to plumbers to doctors and

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.920
lawyers and yes, even bankers,
and all of the things that

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.330
make a community run,
restaurants, you name it.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.900
And these are the kind of jobs
that are created when a

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.510
technology company moves in or
when a startup is created.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.570
And we're also looking at a
situation where these startups

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.010
can't fill their talent
gap fast enough.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:04.180
They can't get more people out
of the universities and into

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.620
jobs fast enough to develop the
products that are really

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.640
changing the economy.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.490
And we talked--

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.990
Derek talked a little bit about
some of the [? peer ?]

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:16.110
economy, things like Etsy and
Airbnb and Square and others

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:19.180
that are powering other
businesses as well.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.360
The faster that those businesses
and others like

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.760
them get created and more
businesses are created on top

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.030
of them, the better off
we're going to be.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.660
They can't do that
without talent.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.330
So this is why immigration
and, also, education--

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.880
investment in science,
technology, engineering, and

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.710
mathematics--

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.920
is vital to the long-term health
and success of the

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.110
American economy.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.040
And if we don't fix immigration
in the near term,

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.460
and we don't invest in education
in the long term, we

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.390
are going to be met with a gap
between the vacancies that we

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.450
have and the jobs that we could
create and the jobs that

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.060
just won't be there--

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.230
and the talent that's
not there to fill

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.890
them, I should say.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:03.870
So we can talk about the
individual stories, as well,

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.170
of entrepreneurs.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:06.290
We know many of them.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:07.930
In my line at work--

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.220
so I have a day job, too.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.650
I'm a strategist in the
operations group at Hattery,

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.670
which is a venture capital
firm in San Francisco.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.380
And we see entrepreneurs every
day and work alongside some of

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.320
them that are immigrant
founders and

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.650
entrepreneurs that are--

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.410
while they're building their
product and building a

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.720
business to compete in, doing
it in the United States--

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.520
still trying to figure out
their own visa status.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.160
And whether or not they're going
to be able to stay here

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.340
or whether they have to go
to their home country or,

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.410
frankly, to another country
around the world where the

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:38.910
help wanted sign for
entrepreneurs is out.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:43.640
Places like Start-Up Chile or
South Korea or Canada or any

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.110
of a number of countries around
the world where they've

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.150
taken steps to fix their
immigration problems.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.200
And we're losing the advantage
in the United States that

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.770
we've had for a very
long time on that.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.910
So yes, it's top-line issue.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:58.080
It is the top-line issue.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.420
And I think it's one that, in
the new Congress, we hope to

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.760
see a lot of movement
on very soon.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.370
DEREK SLATER: We've got a couple
of questions here from

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.820
folks watching.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.860
Aaron in Atlanta brings up a
good question, which is,

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.010
basically, if you wanted to do
a startup that was about

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.120
protecting the free and open
internet, are there

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.380
ways you can go?

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.000
The social entrepreneurship
route or are there ways to

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.070
pursue funding for projects that
are about building tools

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.800
that help the internet?

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.520
Because another way of looking
at it is, we've talked about

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.660
entrepreneurs getting engaged
in Washington.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.810
Are there things they can
do as entrepreneurs--

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.980
sorts of companies or
technologies they could be

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:36.430
building that would help
advance this cause?

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.670
JOHN LYMAN: Yeah.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.090
I mean, I think that
there are.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.120
And I think that there are ways
that they can go out and

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.750
get funding through those.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.740
Kickstarter and Indiegogo
are two platforms.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.820
We worked a lot with
Indiegogo.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.870
We launched a partnership with
them in Germany that allowed

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.820
entrepreneurs to go out and
fundraise for their ideas and

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.260
get money, I think, a little
bit more easily than they

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.130
would have otherwise.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.880
But are there specific
for-profit businesses that

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.620
help keep the internet
open and alive?

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.630
Yeah, I think there
absolutely are.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.330
I think that any time you create
a company that shows

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:11.940
people that innovation helps
create jobs and make the

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.850
economy better and stronger,
I think you're

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:14.820
contributing to that.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.560
So I mentioned Kickstarter
before but as a platform.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.020
But I also mention them as a
company that you could start.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.760
This is something that didn't
exist or wasn't even possible

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.810
five years ago-- the idea of
being able to go online and

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:30.290
get funding for an art project
or a piece of hardware that

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:31.360
you wanted to make.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.140
I think legislators
notice that.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.900
I think legislators
notice Uber.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.020
And they realize that, hey yeah,
these are companies that

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.940
are going to be the future, and
we understand that we need

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.150
to help them evolve, even though
there are a lot of

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.610
vested interests that don't
want them around.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.870
I think people are starting to
recognize, yeah, this is a

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.800
job, a net job creator, and we
need to make sure that they're

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.270
allowed to succeed.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.930
MICHAEL MCGEARY: Yeah, I think
the access to capital part is

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.140
key in that.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.650
We look at the free and open
internet, and the one thing

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.310
that always springs to my mind
is the internet is the

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.120
greatest force for
democratization of ideas,

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.250
really, in the history
of the world.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:08.940
And now, when we add better
access to capital to that and

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.460
more benefit to social
entrepreneurship, I think that

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.690
there's a lot of ideas
that can take flight.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.070
One of the things, as we built
Engine over the course of the

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.710
last year or so, has been
whether or not we want to

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.670
build tools in house or whether
we want to work with

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.560
other startups and leverage the
tools that they've built,

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.270
and we've had a combination
of that.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.330
But there's a lot of great
tools out there from--

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.760
whether it's POPVOX or some of
the things that are happening

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.600
over at Center for Rights and
Fight for the Future and

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.400
groups like that in the
digital innovation and

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.440
activism spaces.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.700
Well, there are lots of places
that we can plug in and work

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.900
together and help to promote
each other and help to promote

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.050
these tools that are
being built.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.860
So I think there's a lot of
good happening in terms of

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.360
social enterprise in that way.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.260
And I think that the more that
there's access to capital to

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.430
make those products a reality,
the more that we'll be able to

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.010
use them and other
groups like us.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.420
And that can only be a good
thing as we continue to build

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.610
our sites and our products
moving forward.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.570
DEREK SLATER: And Mike, Mark
in Palo Alto wants to know,

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.840
along with access to capital and
immigration, what are the

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.080
other issues you're going
to be working

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.120
on in the next year?

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.450
And also, are other ways that--
this is a developer

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.740
audience-- can they get involved
with Engine in some

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.430
way or somewhere that
they can join?

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.123
Or, how does that work?

00:27:30.123 --> 00:27:31.110
How does membership work?

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.740
MICHAEL MCGEARY: Well, Mark from
Palo Alto, first I'd like

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.680
to take you out for a beer and
thank you for that question.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.010
The second thing is that yes,
you can join us at engine dot

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:43.010
is online or engine
advocacy dot org.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.580
We've got a site up
there that's--

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.250
we're putting a lot of great
content on every day, talking

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.900
about the issues that matter,
the community.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.900
We're going to keep our focus on
those issues, keep writing

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.820
and researching about them,
whether it's the economic

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.150
impact of startups overall
in the tech community.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:02.770
Some of the other issues we're
working on besides

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.350
immigration--

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.680
like I said, we're working on
better investment in STEM

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.550
education in the long term.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:12.150
Things like access to quality
spectrum and broadband, trying

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.780
to bring things like Google
Fiber to places beyond Kansas

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:21.000
City or other projects like that
in order to make better

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.440
access to better,
faster internet

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.940
possible for more people.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.910
We're also working
on patent issues.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.400
And this is one that I think we
might see a lot of movement

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.230
on in the new Congress
as well.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.850
Of course, Congress just went
through a multi-year process

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.600
to pass the American
Invents Act.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.290
We think that there's a lot
more that Congress can do,

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:44.510
that the regulatory agencies
can do as well, in terms of

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:50.240
how that goes into force and how
we think about patents in

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.330
the software space
and with internet

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.670
businesses in general.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.570
And I think that there's some
room there for a lot of

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:00.190
advocacy from the developer
community and from engineers,

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:04.030
who may, themselves, have gone
out and gotten patents or work

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:07.690
in companies where that's
a priority as well.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.830
And trying to look at different
legislative

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:13.940
alternatives to solve some
of the morass around

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.610
non-practicing entities and
other problems having to do

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:17.370
with the patent community.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:18.920
So there's a lot that you
can find out about

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.240
on engine dot is.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.572
I encourage you to go
there and sign up.

00:29:23.572 --> 00:29:25.890
DEREK SLATER: That brings us
to the end of today's show.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.060
Thanks again for joining us.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.910
Tomorrow, I will be back to talk
with civil society groups

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.380
from around the world--

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.920
the [? IT, ?] you, and
internet freedom.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.500
We'll talk to you then.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:35.750
Thanks.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:30:04.800
