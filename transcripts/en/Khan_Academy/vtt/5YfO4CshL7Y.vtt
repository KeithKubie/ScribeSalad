00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.460
You bought your house
recently for $200,000,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.340
and the way that you
were able to pay $200,000

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.530
is you were able
to put 25% down.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.170
So you made a
$50,000 down payment.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.440
And the balance, the other 75%,
you borrowed from the bank.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:31.010
So $150,000 loan from
the bank, and you pay it

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.027
off with your
monthly payments that

00:00:33.027 --> 00:00:36.130
include paying down the
loan and the interest.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.660
Now something
happened in your life.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.550
Maybe, unfortunately, you
lost your job or your spouse

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.700
lost their job.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.310
Or maybe you just
overestimated your ability

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.180
to pay off your
mortgage payments,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.120
and so you're having
difficulty making them.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.940
Frankly, you can't make your
mortgage payments anymore.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.110
So in this situation, you have
a couple of options for you.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.790
One option is you can
try to sell the house, so

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.320
some type of a sale.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.370
Or the other option is you could
essentially give the house back

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.320
to the bank, and that
we'll call foreclosure.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.970
In another video
we'll go more in depth

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.290
of what happens in foreclosure.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.180
But the bank's going
to get the property,

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.140
try to auction it off.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.470
If it can't auction it off, then
the bank will own the property.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.890
And then maybe they'll try
to sell it at a later date.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.260
And this is not a
good option for you.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.850
This will kill
your credit, which

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.184
will make it very hard for
you to get a loan-- really

00:01:29.184 --> 00:01:31.100
of any type of loan, but
especially a mortgage

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.480
loan-- anytime in
the near future,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.800
really over the next
several or many years.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.030
So you say, OK, I want
to do the sale option.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.140
Now unfortunately for
you, the housing market

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.240
has deflated dramatically.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.460
And so when you
talk to a realtor,

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.040
the realtor figures
out, well look,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.587
after all is said
and done-- I mean,

00:01:51.587 --> 00:01:53.670
you try to sell it for
more than your loan amount,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.628
but you're not able to.

00:01:54.628 --> 00:01:56.440
You're getting
really low offers.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.329
The offers are like
120,000, 130,000.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.120
And so when you really
sit with the realtor

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.820
and you think about
what the market is

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.640
willing to pay for
your house, you

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.040
realize that the most you're
going to get for your house

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.440
after you pay the real
estate commissions and all

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.840
the other things that are
involved when you sell a house,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.670
you could get maybe
120,000 for the house.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.566
And let's say you still
owe pretty close to 150,000

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:23.950
on the loan for the bank.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.270
Your loan might have even
been an interest-only loan,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.728
but even after a
year or two you're

00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:30.211
probably not going to pay down
the balance of your loan too

00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:30.710
much.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.070
It might be like
140,000 or 145,000.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.860
And you're only able to
get 120,000 for the house.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.652
So what do you do?

00:02:38.652 --> 00:02:40.110
You don't want to
go to a situation

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.450
where you sell the
house for 120,000,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.590
you still owe
150,000 on the loan.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.380
And so you're still going to
have to pay $30,000 for a house

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.560
that you don't
even have anymore.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.030
So what do you do?

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.750
Well, one option--
and this is not always

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.750
going to be an option-- is
to go to your bank and say,

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.750
can I do a short sale.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.780
And a short sale is
essentially selling the house

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.790
for less than you
owe on the loan.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.320
So let me write this down.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.030
Selling for less
than what you owe.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.525
And the bank doesn't
have to, but the bank

00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:27.900
might-- well, one,
the bank would

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.030
have to agree to the short sale,
because their loan is secured

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.860
by this property
that you're selling.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.282
And in most cases,
the reason why

00:03:34.282 --> 00:03:35.740
you would want to
do the short sale

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.770
is that the bank may forgive
the balance of the loan.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.560
So you try to convince
a bank to forgive.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.330
So for example, you
could go to the bank.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.210
And you say, look,
I lost my job.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.160
We're having trouble
paying for this house now.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.590
After paying real estate
commissions and all the rest,

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.620
I could only get
120,000 for this house.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.130
I know that I owe you 150,000.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.400
Can you forgive the
extra 30,000 that I owe?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.550
And the bank might
choose to do that.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.950
Now, even in this
situation, you have

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.809
to be very, very, very,
very, very careful.

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:15.600
And this has to be
negotiated with the bank

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.810
and all the rest is because
the bank could still report you

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.900
to credit agencies,
which is really not

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.230
going to be a whole lot better
than getting a foreclosure.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.540
So in part of this negotiation
process-- and the bank

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.340
is under no obligation to
either forgive your loan

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.740
and let you go forth
with that short sale.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.104
And they're under no
obligation to hide it--

00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:40.520
I wouldn't say
hide it, but to not

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.170
talk to the credit agencies.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.980
But part of that negotiation
you should try to convince them,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.200
or you would ideally
try to convince them,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.520
not to report it to
the credit agencies.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.330
The other issue with a
short sale-- and this

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.580
is something that few people
think about-- is when you have,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.880
let's say, in this
case $30,000 forgiven,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.330
the IRS might consider
that to be income.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.199
So you might have to pay income
tax on this right over here.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.490
And people always ask me, wait.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.760
If someone forgives a loan,
why is that considered income?

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.370
And the best way
to think about it

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.980
is if the IRS did not
consider that income,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.150
it would be a huge
loophole in how

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.720
someone could
compensate someone.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.260
If I wanted to pay someone,
I could give them--

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.450
so this is me.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.020
This is the person
that I'm trying to pay.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.680
I could give them a loan.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.340
Let's say I could give
them $100,000 loan,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.100
and then I could
forgive the loan.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.350
And so it would essentially be
I gave them $100,000 maybe to do

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.110
some work for me.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.412
It would be a transfer
of money by giving a loan

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:47.370
and then keep forgiving
over and over and over.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.500
It would be completely
identical to giving someone

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.680
a gift, which is taxed,
or giving someone

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.510
some type of income.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.360
So a short sale,
you're not always

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.690
going to be able to do
it in this scenario.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.750
But if your house is
selling less than the value

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.130
of the loan, you might be able
to negotiate with the bank

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.900
to allow you to sell the
house for less than the value

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.520
of the loan.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.410
The bank's other
option is that they're

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.270
going to have to go into
some type of a foreclosure

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.550
proceeding and take
ownership of the house, which

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.770
is expensive for
the bank as well.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.200
But they keys here
are even if the bank

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.060
is willing to let you
sell the house for less

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.650
than the loan amount,
the owner really

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.550
needs to make sure
that the bank is

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.260
willing to forgive the
balance and ideally not report

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.400
to credit agencies.
