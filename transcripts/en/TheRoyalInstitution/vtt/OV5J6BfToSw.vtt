00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.370
Why is so much writing so bad?

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.240
Why do we have to struggle
with so much legalese,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.480
as in the revocation by these
regulations of a provision

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.030
previously revoked
subject to savings

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.210
does not affect the
continued operations.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.700
Why do we put up
with academese, as

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.980
in "it is the moment
of nonconstruction,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.550
disclosing the absentation of
actuality from the concept,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.950
in part through its
invitation to emphasise

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.220
in reading the helplessness of
its fall into conceptuality."

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.302
Why is it so hard to set the
time on a digital alarm clock?

00:00:51.302 --> 00:00:55.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.230
There's no shortage of
theories, and the one

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.030
that I hear most
often is captured

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.100
in this cartoon in
which a boss says

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.830
to a tech writer, "good start.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.670
Need some more gibberish."

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.150
That is, that bad writing
is a deliberate choice.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.040
Bureaucrats insist on gibberish
to evade responsibility.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.230
Pasty-faced nerds
get their revenge

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.110
on the girls who turned them
down for dates in high school

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.290
and the jocks who kicked
sand in their faces.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.200
Pseudo-intellectuals try to
bamboozle their audiences

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.870
with highfalutin gobbledygook,
disguising the fact

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.640
that they have nothing to say.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.280
Well, I have no doubt that
the bamboozlement theory

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.750
is true of some writers
some of the time.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.870
But as a general explanation,
it doesn't ring true.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.100
I know many scientists
who do groundbreaking work

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.110
on important topics.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.990
They have nothing to hide
and no need to impress,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.300
but still their writing stinks.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.330
Good people can write bad prose.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.570
The second most popular
theory is that digital media

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.520
are ruining the language.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.160
Google is making us stupid.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.650
The digital age
stupefies young Americans

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.170
and jeopardises our future.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.090
Twitter is forcing us to
think in 140 characters.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.310
Well, if the dumbest
generation theory were true,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.890
then that implies
that it must have

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.520
been much better before the
advent of digital media,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.230
such as in the 1980s.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.780
Many of you will
remember that that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.560
was an era in which teenagers
spoke in articulate paragraphs.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.810
Remember when bureaucrats
wrote in plain English

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.200
and every academic
article was a masterpiece

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.030
in the art of the essay?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.430
Or was it the '70s?

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.610
The thing is, that complaints
about the imminent decline

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.130
of the language can
be found in every era,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.640
such as 1961, in which a
commentator complained,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.640
"recent graduates, including
those with university degrees,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.850
seem to have no mastery
of the language at all."

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.580
Well, we can then go
back before the advent

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.910
of radio and television.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.260
In 1917, a commentator
wrote, "from every college

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.350
in the country goes up the
cry, our freshmen can't spell,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.610
can't punctuate.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.200
Every high school
is in disrepair

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.090
because its pupils
are so ignorant

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.830
of the merest rudiments."

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.400
Well, maybe you have to go back
even earlier to, say, the glory

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.990
days of the European
Enlightenment,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.310
such as 1785, in which a
commentator said, "our language

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.860
is degenerating very fast.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.850
I begin to fear that it will
be impossible to check it."

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.770
And then there are the ancient
grammar police said, "oh,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.540
for crying out
loud, you never end

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.219
a sentence with a little bird."

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.095
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.870
I think a better theory comes
from Charles Darwin, who

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.940
wrote "man has an
instinctive tendency

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.640
to speak as we see in the
babble of our young children,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.910
whereas no child has
an instinctive tendency

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.670
to bake, brew, or write."

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.620
That is, whereas
speech is instinctive,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.890
writing is and
always has been hard.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.400
Your readers are unknown,
invisible, inscrutable.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.350
They exist only in
your imagination

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.880
when you put pen to paper.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.020
They can't react or break
in or ask for clarification.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.960
As a result, writing
is an act of pretence,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.079
and writing is an
act of craftsmanship.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.350
Well, what can we do then to
improve the craft of writing?

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.530
For many decades, this question
had, at least in the United

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.020
States, a single answer, which
is that you hand students

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.750
this, the iconic The
Elements Of Style

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.920
by Cornell Professor William
Strunk, Jr. and his student,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.770
EB White, who later
went on to glory

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.190
as the New Yorker essayist and
the author of the children's

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.822
classics, Charlotte's
Web and Stuart Little.

00:04:43.822 --> 00:04:45.780
Note, by the way, that
both these men were born

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.580
before the turn of the century.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.950
That is, before the turn
of the 20th century.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.820
Now, there is undoubtedly
a lot of good sense

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.410
in The Elements of Style.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.510
There are little gems
of advice like use

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.180
definite, specific,
concrete language.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.160
Write with nouns and verbs.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.410
Put the emphatic
words at the end.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.160
And my favourite, their prime
directive, omit needless words,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.690
which is by the way, an
excellent example of itself.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.620
On the other hand, there are
many reasons why The Elements

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.710
of Style and other
traditional style manuals like

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.680
Fowler's Modern English Usage,
probably the closest English

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.830
equivalent, why they cannot
be the basis of writing advice

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.630
in the 21st century.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.090
For one thing, a lot of
the advice is obsolete.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.170
Language changes.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.530
For example, Strunk and White
declared that "to finalise is

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.531
a pompous, ambiguous verb."

00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:38.280
Now, many of you will
be surprised to find

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.760
that this perfectly
unexceptionable and useful word

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.540
would be deemed pompous
and ambiguous at the time.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.770
But it just happened to be
new in Professor Strunk's era.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.430
It grated on his ears.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.340
He declared it pompous, but it
then fell into common usage.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.620
And no one even remembers
that it was ever

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.540
considered ungrammatical.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.420
Or to contact is vague
and self-important.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.130
Do not contact people.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.680
Get in touch with them, look
them up, phone them, find them,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.412
or meet them.

00:06:08.412 --> 00:06:09.870
Of course, Strunk
and White did not

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.530
live to see the day in which
you could also text them

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.780
and instant message them and
tweet them and email them

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.920
and so on.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.052
Nor did they really appreciate
that to contact actually

00:06:20.052 --> 00:06:22.260
is an indispensable verb,
because there are sometimes

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.940
when you don't care whether
one person phones or meets

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.350
or texts another, as long as
they do get in touch with them

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.330
by one means or another.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.520
And for that purpose, to contact
is a perfectly useful verb.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.580
Some of the advice is
baffling, such as this--

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.580
"the word people is not to
be used with words of number

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.840
in place of persons.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.900
That is, you should
not say six people."

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.860
Why not?

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.590
Well, of six people,
five went away,

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.060
how many people would be left?

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.730
Answer?

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.300
One people.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.690
Did you get that?

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.090
By the same logic,
you should never

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.850
say I have two
children or 32 teeth

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.766
or two feet or any
other irregular plural.

00:07:10.766 --> 00:07:11.660
Or how's this?

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.790
Note that the word
clever means one thing

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.390
when applied to people,
another when applied to horses.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.185
A clever horse is a good-natured
one not an ingenious one.

00:07:22.185 --> 00:07:24.125
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.620
The problem with traditional
style advice is that it

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.980
consists of an arbitrary
list of dos and don'ts based

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.620
on the tastes and
peeves of the authors.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.660
It's not based on a
principled understanding

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.070
of how language works.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.780
And as a result,
users have no way

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.530
of understanding and
assimilating the advice.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.600
And as I've noted, much of
the advice is just wrong.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.950
I think we can do better today.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.220
We can base advice on writing
on the science and scholarship

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.100
of language, on modern
grammatical theory, which

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.680
is an advance over
the old grammars

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.410
that are reported
over from Latin,

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.960
on evidence-based
dictionaries, on research

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.060
in cognitive science
on what makes sentences

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.630
easy or hard to read, and an
historical and critical studies

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.400
of usage.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.420
It all begins with a model of
effective prose communication.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.050
As I have been emphasising,
writing is an unnatural act,

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.130
and good style must begin
with a coherent mental model

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.580
of the communication scenario,
how the writer imagines

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.580
the reader, and what the
writer is trying to accomplish.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.090
And my favourite model of this
sort comes from a lovely book

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.940
by the English scholars
Francis-Noel Thomas and Mark

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.730
Turner, and they call
it classic style.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.150
The model behind classic
style is that prose

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.280
is a window onto the world.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.380
The writer has seen
something in the world

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.750
that the reader has
not yet noticed.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.520
He positions the
reader so that she

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.890
can see it with her own eyes.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.440
The writer and
reader are equals.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.370
The goal is to help the
reader see objective reality

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.100
and the style is conversation.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.470
Now, that may seem
obvious, but classic style

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:08.420
is just one of a variety of
styles that they explicate,

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.940
including contemplative
style, oracular style,

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.610
and practical style.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.230
But the one that they argue
that infects most academic prose

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.610
is one they call post-modern or
self-conscious style, in which

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.460
the writer's chief if
unstated concern is

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.400
to escape being convicted
of philosophical naivete

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.420
about his own enterprise.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.090
They continue.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.610
"When we open a cookbook,
we completely put aside

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.400
and expect the author to put
aside the kind of question that

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.790
leads to the heart of certain
philosophical traditions.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.820
Is it possible to
talk about cooking?

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.100
Do eggs really exist?

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.070
Is food something about
which knowledge is possible?

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.520
Can anyone ever tell us
anything true about cooking?

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.350
Classic style
similarly puts aside

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.950
as inappropriate philosophical
questions about its enterprise.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.480
If it took those
questions up, it

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.640
could never get around
to treating its subject,

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.280
and its purpose is exclusively
to treat its subject."

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.160
Well, I'd be defying the
principles of classic prose

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.180
if I just talked about it
without showing you an example.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.180
And here's an example.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.990
It is an article by the
physicist Brian Greene

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.690
on the theory of
inflationary cosmology

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.930
and one of its implications,
multiple universes.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.500
And he wrote it for
Newsweek magazine.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.920
Greene writes, "if space
is now expanding, then

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.010
at ever earlier
times the universe

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.630
must have been ever smaller.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.700
At some moment in the
distant past, everything

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.980
we now see, the
ingredients responsible

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.670
for every planet, every star,
every galaxy, even space

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.470
itself, must have
been compressed

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.860
to an infinitesimal speck
that then swelled outward,

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.500
evolving into the
universe as we know it.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.660
The Big Bang Theory was born.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.300
Yet scientists were aware that
the Big Bang Theory suffered

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.790
from a significant
shortcoming-- of all things

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.560
it leaves out the bang.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.510
Einstein's equations
do a wonderful job

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.090
of describing how the universe
evolved from a split-second

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.980
after the bang,
but the equations

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.620
break down, similar to
the error message returned

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.540
by a calculator when
you try to divide 1

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.180
by 0, when applied to
the extreme environment

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.370
of the universe's
earliest moment.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.320
The Big Bang thus
provides no insight

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.690
into what might have
powered the bang itself."

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.820
Now, in these few
sentences, Greene

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.180
has covered some fairly
sophisticated cosmology

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:20.960
and physics.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.560
But he does it in a way that
anyone can see for themselves.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.320
That is, if you can imagine
the universe expanding,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.570
you can run that
mental movie backwards

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.490
and imagine that it
must have originated

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.490
in an infinitesimal speck.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.310
And even the abstruse
mathematical notion

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.400
of equations breaking
down, he presents in a way

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.390
that anyone can
see for themselves.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.690
You can either pull
out a calculator

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.180
and try it-- try
dividing 1 by 0,

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.400
and indeed you will
get an error message,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.580
or you can try to wrap your mind
around what it could possibly

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.900
mean to divide the
number 1 into 0 parts.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.670
And that is classic style.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.190
The reader can see
it for herself.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.970
Now, many examples of
writing advice I think

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:10.160
are implications of the
model behind classic prose.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.440
To begin with, the
focus of classic prose

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.210
is on the thing being shown, not
on the activity of studying it.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.730
So here's an example
of the kind of prose

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:24.650
that I have to wade through
during my working day.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:28.180
A typical article in my field
might begin as follows--

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.640
in recent years, an increasing
number of researchers

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.430
have turned their attention to
the problem of child language

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.360
acquisition.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.640
In this article, recent
theories of this process

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.860
will be reviewed.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.060
Well, no offence, but
not a whole lot of people

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.510
are all that interested in how
professors spend their time.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.270
A more classic introduction
to the same subject matter

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.000
could have been, all
children acquire the ability

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.500
to speak and
understand a language

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.180
without explicit lessons.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.090
How do they
accomplish this feat?

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.480
A corollary of this advisory
is to minimise the kind

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.200
of apologising that academics
in particular feel compelled

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.420
to do.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.960
Again, this is the
kind of sentence

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.272
that I have to deal
with in my daily life.

00:13:08.272 --> 00:13:09.730
The problem of
language acquisition

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.530
is extremely complex.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.600
It is difficult to give
precise definitions

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.540
of the concept of language
and the concept of acquisition

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.330
and the concept of children.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.430
There is much uncertainty
about the interpretation

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.370
of experimental data and a great
deal of controversy surrounding

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.330
the theories.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.162
More research needs to be done.

00:13:27.162 --> 00:13:28.546
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:28.546 --> 00:13:29.920
Now, this is the
kind of verbiage

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.360
that could be deleted at a
stroke with no loss in content,

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.610
because classic prose
gives the reader credit

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.040
for knowing that many
concepts are hard to define

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.260
and many controversies
hard to resolve.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.980
The reader is there to see what
the writer will do about it.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:51.010
Another corollary is to minimise
the hedging that is apparently

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.320
obligatory in academic prose.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.370
The sprinkling of words
into prose such a somewhat,

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.740
fairly, rather, nearly,
relatively, seemingly, in part,

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.630
comparatively,
predominantly, apparently,

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.560
so to speak, and presumably.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.990
And the similar use
of shutter quotes,

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.910
by which a writer
distances himself

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.314
from a familiar
figure of speech.

00:14:12.314 --> 00:14:14.480
So here's an example from
a letter of recommendation

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.250
I received.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.410
"She is a quick
study and has been

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.080
able to educate herself
in virtually any area that

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.220
interests her."

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.790
Well, are we to take this
recommendation as saying that

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.850
the young woman in question is
a quick study or that she is

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.960
a quick study, namely someone
who is only rumoured or alleged

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.020
to be a quick study
but really isn't.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.820
And if she's been able
to educate herself

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.490
in virtually any area that
interests her, are there

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:40.930
some areas that
interest her where

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:45.400
she tried to educate
herself but just failed?

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.110
This habit was
brought home to me

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:51.340
when I came across
an acquaintance

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.222
at an academic conference.

00:14:53.222 --> 00:14:55.180
We hadn't seen each other
in a number of years,

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.640
and I asked how she was.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.290
And as she pulled out a picture
of her four-year-old daughter,

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.524
and she said, we
virtually adore her.

00:15:02.524 --> 00:15:03.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.280
Aw.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.150
Why the compulsive hedging?

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.320
Well, there is an imperative
in many bureaucracies

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.400
that the bureaucrats
abbreviate as CYA--

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.610
cover your anatomy.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.730
But there is an alternative
in classic style--

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.930
so sue me.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:27.030
That is, it's better to be clear
and possibly wrong than muddy

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.190
and, as the physicists
say, not even wrong.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.400
Also classic prose counts
on the cooperative nature

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.030
of ordinary conversation.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.740
The fact that two
people in chit-chat

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.440
will read between the
lines and connect the dots

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.930
so that not everything has to be
stated with absolute precision.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.690
So if I were to say, well, in
recent years Americans have

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.090
been getting fatter,
you interpret it

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.624
as meaning on average
or in general.

00:15:54.624 --> 00:15:56.290
You're not going to
hold me to the claim

00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:00.280
that every last one of the 350
million citizens of the United

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.460
States have all
been getting fatter.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:08.530
I call these tendencies
professional narcissism,

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.580
the confusion of the
activities of your guild

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.480
or field or profession
with the subject matter

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.790
that it is designed
to deal with.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.900
And it is not just a
problem in academics,

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.000
but it infects many professions.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.060
News media, for example, will
often cover the coverage,

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.140
giving rise to the notorious
media echo chamber.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.540
Much coverage of movies
and popular music

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.150
will tell you all about the
first weekend gross receipts

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.800
and the number of
weeks on the charts

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.160
but say nothing about
the actual work of art.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.780
I'm sure I'm not
the only person who

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.200
has been bored to tears
by the museum display

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.030
where you get a
shard in the showcase

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.920
and a lengthy
explanation of how it

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.960
fits into a classification
of pottery styles.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.530
But it says nothing about
the people who made it

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.490
or what they did with it.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.330
And many government and business
websites will instruct you

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.589
into the bureaucratic
organisation but have no ready

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:09.369
way to find the information
that you actually need.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:11.105
A second feature
of classic prose

00:17:11.105 --> 00:17:13.869
is that it keeps up the
illusion that the reader is

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:17.650
seeing a world rather than
just listening to verbiage.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.550
And as such, it avoids
cliches like the plague.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.810
We are all familiar with
the kind of writer who

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.650
dispenses sentences
such as we needed

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.660
to think outside the box in
our search for the holy grail

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.739
but found that it was neither
a magic bullet nor a slam dunk.

00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:36.280
So we rolled with
the punches and let

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.446
the chips fall where they
may while seeing the glass

00:17:38.446 --> 00:17:39.550
as half full.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.860
It's a no-brainer.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.400
Now, the problem with
writing in cliches

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.560
is that it either
forces the reader

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.110
to kind of shut down
her visual brain

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.820
and just process the words as
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:53.960
blah, blah.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.860
Or if she actually does
think through the prose

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.530
to the underlying
image, she'll inevitably

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.820
be upended by the
inevitable mixed metaphors.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.380
Here's another sentence from
a letter of recommendation

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:06.880
I received.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.010
"Jeff is a Renaissance
man, drilling down

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.960
to the core issues and
pushing the envelope."

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.030
It's not clear how you can do
all of those at the same time.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.670
Or this is from an article
in The New York Times.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.410
"No one has yet
invented a condom that

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.556
will knock people's socks off."

00:18:22.556 --> 00:18:24.448
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.220
And if you write
this way, you will

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.060
be eligible for membership
in AWFUL, that is, Americans

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.790
Who Figuratively Use Literally.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.420
And I'm told there's
a British chapter.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.750
Now, it is perfectly acceptable
to say she literally blushed.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.890
It's much more problematic to
say she literally exploded.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:52.840
And it's very, very bad to say
she literally emasculated him.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.290
Now, third, classic
prose is about the world.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.750
It's not about the
conceptual tools with which

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.010
we understand the world.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.680
And as such, it avoids
the excessive use

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.730
of metaconcepts, that is,
concepts about other concepts,

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.060
such as approach, assumption,
concept, condition, context,

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.150
framework, issue, level, model,
paradigm, perspective, process,

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.850
rule, strategy,
tendency, variable.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.540
Admit it, you use these
words a lot when you write.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.890
As in, this is a sentence
taken from an editorial

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.204
by a legal scholar.

00:19:25.204 --> 00:19:26.620
"I have serious
doubts that trying

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.920
to amend the Constitution
would work on an actual level.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.900
On the aspirational
level, however,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.760
a constitutional
amendment strategy

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.010
may be more valuable,
which is to say,

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.930
I doubt that trying to
amend the Constitution

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.670
would actually
succeed, but it may

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.890
be valuable to aspire to it."

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.780
Or this from an
email I received.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.520
"It is important to
approach the subject

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.310
from a variety of strategies,
including mental health

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.460
assistance, but also from a
law enforcement perspective."

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.610
Translation-- we should consult
a psychiatrist about this man,

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.093
but we may also have
to inform the police.

00:19:57.093 --> 00:19:58.985
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.280
Classic prose narrates
ongoing events.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.540
We see agents who perform
actions that affect objects.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.330
Non-classic prose
thingifies the events

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.150
and then refers to
them with a single word

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.140
using a dangerous tool
of English grammar called

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.800
nominalization, turning a verb
or an adjective into a noun.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.080
So instead of appearing,
you make an appearance.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.270
Instead of organising
something, you bring about

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.460
the organisation of that thing.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.420
Helen Sword, a language scholar,
calls them zombie nouns,

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.190
because they kind
of lumber across

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:41.530
the page with no conscious agent
actually directing the action.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:46.360
And they can turn prose into
a Night of the Living Dead.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.850
Participants read assertions
whose veracity was either

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.220
affirmed or denied by the
subsequent presentation

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.460
of an assessment word, which
is another way of saying

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.170
people saw sentences,
each followed

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.020
by the word true or false.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.670
Subjects were tested
under conditions

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.060
of good to excellent
acoustic isolation, to wit,

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.740
we tested the students
in a quiet room.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.850
But again, it is
not just academics

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:10.960
who have this bad habit.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.970
It is also politicians.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.780
When a hurricane threatened
the Republican Party National

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.500
Convention a few years ago,
Florida Governor Rick Scott

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.200
said, "right now there
is not any anticipation

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.850
there will be a cancellation."

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.860
That is, right now
we don't anticipate

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.140
that we will have to cancel it.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.090
And just to be nonpartisan,
on the other side

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.650
of the American
political spectrum,

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.530
here we have Secretary of
State John Kerry saying

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.330
"the president is
desirous of trying

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.370
to see how we can make
our best efforts in order

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.810
to find a way to facilitate."

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.420
In other words, the
president wants to help.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.800
And corporate consultants.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.650
A young man interviewed
by a journalist

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:56.330
explained that he is a digital
and social media strategist.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.180
"I deliver programmes, products,
and strategies to our corporate

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.275
clients across the spectrum
of communications functions."

00:22:02.275 --> 00:22:03.650
And when the
journalist confessed

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.140
that he had no idea what
that meant and asked him

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.880
what he really did,
he finally broke down

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.314
and he said, "I teach big
companies how to use Facebook."

00:22:11.314 --> 00:22:15.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.070
And product engineers.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.570
Portable generators
and combustion heaters

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.380
used to carry a warning
more or less like this--

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.460
"mild exposure to CO can
result in accumulated damage

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.450
over time.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.430
Extreme exposure
to CO may rapidly

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.831
be fatal without producing
significant warning symptoms."

00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:33.330
Yeah, yeah.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.510
Whatever.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.330
And as a result, several
hundred Americans

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.480
every year turn their
houses into gas chambers

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.880
and asphyxiated themselves
and their families

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.030
by running heaters and
generators indoors,

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.820
until they replaced the
warning with this one--

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.196
"using a generator indoors
can kill you in minutes."

00:22:51.196 --> 00:22:53.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:57.270
So classic prose can literally
be a matter of life and death.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.270
Yes, literally.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:00.900
So part two.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.570
How can an understanding
of the design of leaving

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.940
lead to better writing advice?

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.660
Another contributor to zombie
prose is the passive voice.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.680
This refers to the
contrast between a sentence

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.360
in the active voice, such
as the dog bit the man,

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.820
and a sentence like the
man was bitten by the dog,

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.380
in the passive voice.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:23.250
It's well known that the passive
voice is overused by academics,

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.680
as in, on the basis
of the analysis which

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.820
was made of the data
which were collected,

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.540
it is suggested that the null
hypothesis can be rejected.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.820
For passives in one sentence.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.600
And lawyers.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.910
If the outstanding balance
is prepaid in full,

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.190
the unearned finance
charge will be refunded.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.540
Three passives.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.230
But perhaps most infamously
of all, politicians.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.440
Here we have one of
candidates for president

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.550
in the United States, New Jersey
Governor Chris Christie, who

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:55.230
in explaining how it was that
his administration caused

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:58.980
a three-hour traffic jam
by deliberately closing

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.110
the lanes to a tunnel
during rush hour

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:05.040
in order to punish the mayor of
a town that would not endorse

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:10.020
his re-election, he said,
"mistakes were made."

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.970
The infamous politician's
evasive passive.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.730
Not surprisingly, all of
the traditional manuals

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.800
warn against using
the passive voice.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.740
Strunk and White say,
"use the active voice.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.140
The active voice is usually
more direct and vigorous

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.400
than the passive.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.010
Many a tame sentence can
be made lively and emphatic

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:31.770
by substituting a transitive
in the active voice

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.600
for some such
perfunctory expression

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.500
as there is or could be heard."

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.100
Well, I'm glad to
hear from the laughter

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.880
that a number of people
have noted that, yes, Strunk

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.580
and White used the passive
in order to tell people not

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.680
to use the passive.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.700
The other iconic bit
of writing advice

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.910
is the classic essay, Politics
and the English Language

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:58.260
by George Orwell, probably the
second-most widely distributed

00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.970
bit of advice on writing.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.730
And Orwell too says,
"a mixture of vagueness

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.940
and sheer incompetence is the
most marked characteristic

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.900
of modern English
prose," he wrote in 1949,

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.690
showing that some
things don't change.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:14.310
"I list below
various of the tricks

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.830
by means of which the
work of prose construction

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.510
is habitually dodged.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.150
The passive voice is wherever
possible used in preference

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.110
to the active."

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:26.220
A passage that has not one but
two uses of the passive voice

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.960
to tell people not to
use the passive voice.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.920
Well, the passive
construction could not

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.100
have survived in the English
language for 1,500 years

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.230
if it did not
serve some purpose.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:41.700
Why can't we do without it
even when telling people

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.230
not to overuse it?

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.990
It comes down to the
design of language.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.850
You can think of
language as an app

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:51.810
for converting a web of
thoughts into a string of words.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.390
Now, the writer's
knowledge can be

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.480
thought of as a kind
of mind-wide web

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.400
what cognitive psychologists
call a semantic network.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.020
That is, a collection
of nodes for concepts.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.270
Here we have a fragment
of a person's knowledge

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.510
of the tragic events brought to
life by Sophocles in his play

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:13.710
Oedipus Rex.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:18.990
So you've got a number of
nodes for concepts like father,

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.880
kill, marry.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.010
You've got a bunch of
links that indicate

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.880
how the concepts are related.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.500
Doer, done to,
about, is, and so on.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:39.180
Now, when you just lie back
and ponder your knowledge base,

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.520
your mind can surf
from one concept

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.490
to another in pretty
much any order.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.750
But what happens when you have
to translate your web of ideas

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.940
into a sentence?

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.060
Well, now you've got to
convert that tangled web

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.520
into a linear string of words.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.340
In Sophocles play,
Oedipus married his mother

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.050
and killed his father.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.660
That means that there's
an inherent problem baked

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.550
into the design of language.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.940
The order of words in a sentence
has to do two things at once.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.730
It's the code that
English syntax

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.120
uses to express who
did what to whom.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.640
At the same time, it
necessarily presents some bits

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.130
of information to the
reader before others

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.410
and thereby affects
how the information

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.120
is going to be absorbed.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.510
In particular, the early
material in the sentence

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.540
refers to the sentence's
topic and naturally

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.330
connects back to what's
already reverberating

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.740
in the reader's mind.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.450
In the metaphor
of classic prose,

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.370
it refers to the
general direction

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.560
in which the reader is looking.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.140
The later words in
the sentence contain

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.960
the sentence's focal point,
what fact it is now conveying.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.620
In the metaphor,
it's what the reader

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.930
is supposed to now notice.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.640
Any prose that violates
these principles,

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.120
even if each sentence
is clear, will

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.240
feel choppy or
disjointed or incoherent.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.550
And that brings
us to the passive.

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:07.110
The passive is a
workaround in English

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.780
for this inherent design
limitation of the language.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.920
It allows writers to convey
the same ideas, namely

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.540
who did what to whom, while
varying the order of words.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.980
In particular, it
allows a writer

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.670
to start the sentence with
the done to or the acted upon

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.010
rather than the
doer or the actor.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:31.140
And that's why avoid the passive
as a general law is bad advice.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.540
The passive is, in fact,
the better construction

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.670
when the done to
or the acted upon

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.107
is currently the target of
the reader's mental gaze.

00:28:39.107 --> 00:28:40.440
Again, I'll give you an example.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.490
This comes from the Wikipedia
entry for Oedipus Rex,

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.730
and it describes
the pivotal moment

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.030
in the play in which the
horrific backstory is

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.250
revealed to the audience.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.072
Spoiler alert.

00:28:55.072 --> 00:28:57.390
"A messenger arrives
from Corinth.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.060
It emerges that he was formerly
a shepherd on Mount Kithaeron,

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.490
and during that time
he was given a baby.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.050
The baby, he said,
was given to him

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:05.550
by another shepherd
from the Laius

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.440
household, who had been told
to get rid of the child."

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.610
Now notice that this passage
has three passive sentences

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.770
in a row and for good reason.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:18.240
As the passage opens, our
eyes are on the messenger--

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.300
a messenger arrives
from Corinth--

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.110
and so the next
sentence telling us

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:25.410
something about the messenger
should begin with a reference

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:29.520
to the messenger, and thanks to
the passive voice, so it does.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.130
He, the messenger,
was given a baby.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.440
Well, now we're
kind of figuratively

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.200
looking at the baby, at
least our mind's eye is,

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.460
and the next sentence should
then begin with the baby.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.970
And again, thanks to the
passive voice, it does.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:45.087
The baby was given to the
messenger by another shepherd.

00:29:45.087 --> 00:29:46.920
Well, now we're looking
at this new shepherd

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.086
and the next sentence telling
us something about him

00:29:49.086 --> 00:29:50.320
should begin with that.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.340
And again, the passive
makes that possible.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.960
The other shepherd had been
told to get rid of the child.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.190
Now imagine that the
writer of this passage

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:02.460
had either followed the advice
in the traditional manuals

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.640
literally or was the victim
of the kind of copyeditor

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.400
that turns every passive
sentence back into an active,

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.970
then you would have a
messenger arrives from Corinth.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.880
It emerges that he was formerly
a shepherd on Mount Kithaeron,

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.670
and during that time
someone gave him a baby.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.510
Another shepherd from
the Laius household,

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.950
he says, whom someone had
told to get rid of a child,

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:24.690
gave the baby to him.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:28.050
Now, I think you will agree
that this is not an improvement.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.000
Your attention is
kind of jerked around

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.920
from one part of the
story to another.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.830
And participants
kind of parachute in

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.640
without warning or a
proper introduction.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.340
More generally, English
syntax provides writers

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.610
with constructions that
vary the order in the string

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.380
while preserving the meaning.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.460
Oedipus killed Laius.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.140
Laius was killed by Oedipus.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.730
It was Laius whom
Oedipus killed.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.530
It was Oedipus who
killed Laius, and so on.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:55.260
And writers must
choose the construction

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.080
that introduces ideas to
the reader in the order

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.510
in which she can absorb them.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.880
Well, why then is the
passive so common in bad

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.580
writing, as it surely is?

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.780
It's because good
writers narrate

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.120
a story, advanced
by protagonists

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.830
who make things happen.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.070
Bad writers work backwards
from their own knowledge,

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.340
writing down ideas in the order
in which they occur to them.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.230
They begin with the
outcome of the event,

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.580
because they know
how it happened.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.120
And then they throw in the
cause as an afterthought,

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.600
and the passive makes
that all too easy.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.620
So why should this be so hard?

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.840
Why is it so hard for writers
to deploy the resources made

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.910
available by the
English language

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.490
to convey ideas effectively?

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:43.050
The best explanation that I know
of is conveyed by this cartoon,

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.350
and it's called the
curse of knowledge.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.940
The fact that when
you know something,

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.910
it's hard to imagine what
it's like for someone else

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.780
not to know it.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.620
Psychologists give
it various names.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:00.010
It's also called mind blindness,
egocentrism, hindsight bias,

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:01.680
about half a dozen others.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.570
Perhaps the best
introduction comes

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.420
from a classic
experiment that will

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.120
be familiar to any of you
taking a course in child

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.790
psychology, the M&amp;M
study or in Britain you

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.040
can call it the Smarties Study.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.340
A three-year-old boy comes into
a lab, sits down at a table.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.490
The experimenter gives
him a box of Smarties.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:22.650
He's all excited.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.700
He opens it, and he finds that
instead of containing Smarties,

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.607
the box contains pencils.

00:32:27.607 --> 00:32:28.690
So the child is surprised.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:31.490
And the experimenter puts
the pencils back in the box,

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.290
closes it, puts it
back down on the table.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:34.220
And he says, OK.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.850
Well, now another little boy
is going to come in, Jason.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:40.130
What does Jason
think is in the box?

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.876
And the boy will say pencils.

00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:43.250
Even though, of
course, Jason has

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.650
no way of knowing that
the box contains pencils,

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.040
the boy knows it, but
a newcomer would not.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.990
And in fact, if
you ask him, well,

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.730
when you came into
the room, what

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:54.110
did you think was in the box?

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.940
And he'll say pencils.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.890
Now that he knows
it, he can no longer

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:03.140
recover the innocent state in
which he once did not know it.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:09.360
Now adults, of course,
outgrow this limitation--

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.480
kind of, a little--

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.350
because many studies have shown
a similar effect in adults.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:21.350
People will tend to attribute
their own obscure vocabulary

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.150
to the population at large.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:26.180
If they know of fact, they
assume everyone else does.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.020
And in one study, the more
practise someone had at using

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.540
a complicated gadget
like a smartphone,

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.390
the less time they estimated
it would take someone else

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.960
to learn it, because the
more familiar the were,

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.912
the obviously easier it must be,
because it was easy for them.

00:33:44.912 --> 00:33:46.370
I think that the
curse of knowledge

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.820
is the chief contributor
to opaque writing.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.590
It simply doesn't
occur to the writer

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.750
that readers haven't
learned their jargon,

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.490
don't know the
intermediate steps that

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.800
seem too obvious
to mention, can't

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.810
visualise a scene
that's currently

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:01.710
in the writer's mind's eye.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.550
And so the writer doesn't
bother to explain the jargon

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:09.199
or spell out the logic or supply
the concrete details, even when

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:13.159
writing for professional peers.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.980
It's a lazy excuse
that writers often have

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.674
that they don't have
to spell things out

00:34:17.674 --> 00:34:19.340
because, after all,
they're just writing

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.110
for their professional peers.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.940
But because of the
curse of knowledge,

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:26.719
even prose written
for professional peers

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:28.730
is often surprisingly opaque.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.790
I'll give you an example.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:33.170
This is a passage from an
article on consciousness

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:34.610
written in a journal
called Trends

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.909
In Cognitive Science, which
is designed to present

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.520
short, readable
summaries of research

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.449
for the benefit of cognitive
scientists keeping up with one

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.197
another's work.

00:34:46.197 --> 00:34:47.030
So here's a passage.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.909
"The slow and integrative
nature of conscious perception

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:53.000
is confirmed behaviorally by
observation such as the "rabbit

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.010
illusion" and its
variants or the way

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.410
in which a stimulus is
ultimately perceived,

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.450
is influenced by
post-stimulus events

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.550
arising several
hundreds of milliseconds

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.860
after the original stimulus."

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.430
Now, I've been in this
business for almost 40 years,

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.440
and I have no idea what
they're talking about.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.230
I have never heard of
the rabbit illusion,

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:14.900
though I know an awful
lot of illusions.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.966
And I know what the
word stimulus means,

00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:18.590
but I have no idea
what they're talking

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.960
about when they talk about
how a stimulus is ultimately

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.064
perceived.

00:35:22.064 --> 00:35:23.480
So I went to my
bookshelves, and I

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.550
found one that had an
entry for something

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.100
called the cutaneous
rabbit illusion, which

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.630
works as follows--

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:33.440
the subject closes his
eyes, sticks out his arm.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.540
The experimenter
taps him three times

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.790
on the wrist, three
times on the elbow,

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:39.290
three times on the shoulder.

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:43.190
And the person experiences it
as a series of taps running up

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.370
the length of his arm, kind of
like a hopping rabbit, hence

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:47.810
the rabbit illusion.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:50.780
Well, why didn't
they just say that?

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.450
Not only is it no
less scientific

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:56.150
to spell out the
concrete scenario,

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.100
but it's actually
more scientific

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.070
because knowing that that's
what the rabbit illusion is,

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:04.220
I can then follow the logic
of what they are claiming,

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:09.140
namely what it allegedly
shows us is consciousness

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.160
does not track sensory
events in real time.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.100
But our brain is constantly
editing our experience

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:20.400
after the fact to make
it feel more coherent.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.690
Well, knowing what the
illusion actually consists of,

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.240
I can then ponder whether
that really follows,

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.330
whether that's a correct
interpretation of the illusion

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.510
or whether it might have
some alternative explanation,

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:36.200
something that I can't do with
stimulus this and post-stimulus

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.760
that.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.830
The temptations of
thoughtless abbreviation

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.290
are I think best
captured by an old joke.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:51.770
So a man walks into a Catskills
resort in Upstate New York

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:53.690
and walks into the
dining room, and he

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:57.110
sees a bunch of retired
Borscht Belt comedians

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.400
sitting around a table.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.990
And so there's an empty chair.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.015
He joins them.

00:37:01.015 --> 00:37:04.550
And he hears one of the
comedians saying 47,

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:08.100
and the others break out
into uproarious laughter.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.970
Another one says 112,
and then again they

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:14.740
all just burst out into peals of
laughter, rolling on the floor.

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.407
And he can't figure
out what's going on.

00:37:16.407 --> 00:37:17.739
So he asked the guy next to him.

00:37:17.739 --> 00:37:18.940
He says, what's happening?

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.440
And the guy says,
well, you know,

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.250
these old timers, they've been
together for so long, that they

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.120
all though the same jokes.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.930
So to save time, they've
given each joke a number,

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:29.870
and now they just have
to say the number.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:31.660
They guy says, that's ingenious.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.635
I'll try it.

00:37:32.635 --> 00:37:35.200
So he says 31.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.625
Stony silence.

00:37:36.625 --> 00:37:38.952
He says 77.

00:37:38.952 --> 00:37:39.910
Everyone stares at him.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:40.900
No one laughs.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.510
So he sinks back down into his
seat and he says to his friend,

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:44.720
uh, what happened?

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.730
Why didn't anyone laugh?

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.402
The guy says, well, it's
all in the way you tell it.

00:37:49.402 --> 00:37:52.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:55.210
So how do you exercise
the curse of knowledge?

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.670
Well, the traditional solution
is always keep in mind

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.470
the reader over your shoulder.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:04.300
That is, empathise
with your reader,

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.920
see the world from her point
of view, try to feel her pain,

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.450
walk a mile in her
moccasins, and so on.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.570
Well, this is good
advice as far as it goes,

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:18.040
but it only goes so far, because
a lot of research in psychology

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.320
has shown that we're not
very good at figuring out

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.670
what people know, even when
we try really, really hard.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.010
A better solution
is to actually show

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:30.790
a draft to a real-live
representative reader,

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:33.850
and you will often discover
that what's obvious to you

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:36.700
isn't obvious to anyone else.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.410
You can even show
a draft to yourself

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.884
after some time has passed,
and it's no longer familiar.

00:38:41.884 --> 00:38:43.300
And if you're like
me, you'll find

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.880
yourself thinking
that wasn't clear

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.090
or what did I mean
by that, or all

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.304
too often, who wrote this crap?

00:38:51.304 --> 00:38:53.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.680
And then rewrite,
ideally several times,

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.230
with the single goal
of making the prose

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:03.050
understandable to the reader.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.800
Finally, how should we
think about correct usage

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:10.480
of what is right or wrong,
correct or incorrect?

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.110
Which is the aspect of writing
that by far attracts the most

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.380
attention and arouses
the most emotion.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.060
Now, some usages
are clearly wrong.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:25.180
There is a famous and beloved
American children's character

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:29.860
known as Cookie Monster,
who's famous on the Muppets

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.990
and Sesame Street,
whose signature line

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:34.170
is, "me want cookie."

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:36.760
Now, even,
three-year-olds appreciate

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.130
and can laugh at Cookie
Monster, because even

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.290
by their own lights, they
know that Cookie Monster

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.970
has made a grammatical error.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.110
Many of you may be familiar with
the form of humour or alleged

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:55.150
humour called the lolcat,
as in I can has cheezburger,

00:39:55.150 --> 00:40:01.330
the humour in which resides
in the fact that this cat is

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.850
incompetent at English grammar.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:06.700
If we didn't recognise that the
cat was making a grammatical

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.620
error, we would
not find it funny,

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:12.800
at least those people
who do find it funny.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.240
Is our children learning?

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.580
Even ex-president
President George W. Bush

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.100
acknowledged that this
was a grammatical error

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.850
in a self-deprecating speech
in which he pointed out many

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.910
of his own past speech errors.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.720
But others are not so clear,
just again to be nonpartisan,

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.700
the Democratic
President Bill Clinton,

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.880
when he was running
for office in 1992,

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.160
had as one of his
campaign slogans

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.650
"give Al Gore and I a chance
to bring America back,"

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:50.520
appalling the nation's
English teachers

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.550
who pointed out that this is
an example of the notorious

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:54.840
between you and I error.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.150
And it should be "give
Al Gore and me a chance

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.670
to bring America back."

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.980
Another Democratic
President, Barack Obama,

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.430
said no American should live
under a cloud of suspicion

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.680
just because of
what they look like.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:12.510
The infamous singular
"they" error.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.690
Captain Kirk of Star Trek,
the five-year mission

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:19.800
of the Starship
Enterprise, "to boldly go

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.230
where no man has gone before."

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:25.350
Split infinitive.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:27.840
The Beatles, "you think
you lost your love.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.430
Well, I saw her yesterday.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:32.460
It's you she's thinking of,
and she told me what to say."

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.406
Anyone?

00:41:33.406 --> 00:41:35.030
Sentence with a
preposition at the end.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.570
Preposition at the
end of a sentence.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:40.211
And then I doubt many people
will recognise this American

00:41:40.211 --> 00:41:40.710
icon.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:43.740
This is Dick Cavett,
who was the host

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:49.020
of our short-lived and
much-missed urbane,

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:52.270
witty, intelligent talk show.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:57.720
And in an Op Ed in which he
was talking about a college

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.040
reunion, he wrote
"checking into the hotel,

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.480
it was nice to see a few of my
old classmates in the lobby."

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.910
Anyone?

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.290
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:10.271
Anyone go to school
before the 1960s?

00:42:10.271 --> 00:42:10.770
Yes.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:12.990
It's a dangling participle.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:17.237
Well, what do we do with these
more contested usage errors?

00:42:17.237 --> 00:42:19.320
They have given rise to
what journalists sometimes

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.910
called the language war.

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:23.370
On the one side, there
are the prescriptivists

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:26.970
who prescribe how people
ought to speak and write.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:29.900
They are also known as the
purists, sticklers, pedants,

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.730
peevers, snobs, snoots,
nitpickers, traditionalists,

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:36.450
language police, usage nannies,
grammar Nazis, and the gotcha

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:40.740
gang, according to whom rules of
usage are objectively correct.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.590
To obey them is to uphold
standards of excellence.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.990
To flout them is to dumb
down literate culture,

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:50.550
degrade the language, and hasten
the decline of civilization.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.220
Now, according to the scenario,
on the other hand side,

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.650
we have the descriptivists,
who describe

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.900
how people do speak
and write, according

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.450
to whom rules of usage are
just the secret handshake

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:02.340
of the ruling class,
and the people

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.220
should be liberated to
write however they please.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.010
Now, I think there are reasons
to believe that the language

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:11.910
war, however beloved it
is of certain magazines,

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.490
is a pseudo-controversy.

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:17.040
If it were really true,
then the prescriptivists

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.890
would have to insist that the
lyrics to the famous Beatles

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:24.156
song should be, it's you
of whom she's thinking.

00:43:24.156 --> 00:43:25.530
And the descriptivists
would have

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:27.870
to claim that there is
nothing wrong with I

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.700
can has cheezburger,
in which case

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.850
they could not get the
joke of the lolcat.

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:34.740
I think we need a
more sophisticated way

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.460
of thinking about usage.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:37.770
So what are rules of usage?

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:38.860
Where do they come from?

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.780
They're certainly
not logical truth

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:45.840
that you could prove in
the propositional calculus,

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.870
nor are they officially
regulated by dictionaries.

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:50.580
And I can speak
with some authority

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.730
here, because I am the Chair of
the Usage Panel of the American

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:56.460
Heritage Dictionary, and
when I joined the panel,

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.190
I asked the editor
in chief, so how

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:02.130
do you guys decide what
to put in the dictionary?

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.140
And his answer was,
"we pay attention

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.970
to the way people use words."

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:08.400
That is, when it
comes to correctness,

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.230
there's no one in charge.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.576
The lunatics are
running the asylum.

00:44:12.576 --> 00:44:14.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.250
So a way to make sense
of rules of usage

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:20.070
is that they are tacit,
evolving conventions.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.410
A convention is a
way of doing things

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:25.950
that has no particular
advantages other than the fact

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:27.960
that everyone else is doing it.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.950
Paper currency is an example.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:33.420
A piece of paper with
a picture of the queen

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.670
has no inherent value
other than the fact

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.740
that everyone expects
everyone else to treat it

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.180
as having value.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.760
There's no particular reason to
drive on the right as opposed

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.810
to driving on the left.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:46.340
There's nothing sinister about
driving in the left or gauche

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.490
or socialist.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:52.380
But there's an excellent
reason to drive

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.300
on the left on this
side of the Atlantic,

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.270
namely that's what
everyone else does.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:02.040
Unlike the rules of traffic
or laws authorising currency,

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.960
though, the rules of
language are tacit.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.870
They emerge as a rough
consensus within a community

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.690
of careful writers without
explicit deliberation,

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:11.480
agreement, or legislation.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:15.960
And the conventions evolve,
as I mentioned in the case

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:20.880
of "to finalise and to contact,"
they organically change over

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.500
time.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.230
So should writers
follow the rules?

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:27.460
And the answer is, it depends.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.300
Some rules just extend the
logic of everyday grammar

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.500
to more complicated cases.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.120
So let's take is our children
learning, which not only George

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.880
W. Bush but the
Microsoft Word grammar

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:45.840
checker flags as an error with
the famous wiggly green line.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.050
"Is our children learning" is
equivalent to "our children

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.130
is learning."

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.830
Everyone can see that
"our children is learning"

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:55.620
is ungrammatical, and therefore
"is our children learning"

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.120
is also ungrammatical.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.910
Or a slightly more complicated
case, the impact of the cuts

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:01.680
have not been felt yet.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.890
Why did Microsoft Word put
a wiggly line under that?

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.350
Well, when you think
about it, that sentence is

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.260
"the impact have not been felt."

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.810
If you delete the
optional "of the cuts,"

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:15.330
that just jumps off the
page as ungrammatical.

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.850
Of course, it's "impact
has not been felt,"

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:20.880
and so it's "the impact of
the cuts has not been felt."

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.370
The writer was just
distracted by the plural

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:28.230
cuts that happened to be cheek
by jowl with the verb have.

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:30.720
Also, there are some
rules of word choice

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.280
that make important
semantic distinctions.

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:38.670
Fulsome is not a fancy-schmancy
synonym for full.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:43.950
Fulsome means
excessive or insincere.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.380
And so one ought
not to thank someone

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.681
for their fulsome
compliment, that is,

00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:51.930
that if someone gives you a
fulsome compliment, that's

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.810
a bad thing, not a good thing.

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:56.650
Likewise, you should
not compliment

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:59.940
someone's elegant theory
by calling it simplistic.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.440
Simplistic means overly
simple or childlike

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:07.080
or incorrectly simple.

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.520
Nor if you think that
something is meritorious should

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.872
you call it meretricious.

00:47:10.872 --> 00:47:13.080
If you don't know why, you
can go home and look it up

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.630
in the dictionary.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:20.520
In general, one should avoid
reaching for a hoity-toity word

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.100
to replace a humbler synonym.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.870
If you do, you might
elicit the reaction

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:30.480
of Inigo Montoya in
The Princess Bride

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.210
when another
character kept using

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:36.660
the word inconceivable to refer
to things that just happened.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.180
He said, you keep
using that word.

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:43.930
I do not think it means
what you think it means.

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:47.070
On the other hand, not
every pet peeve bit

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:49.740
of grammatical folklore
or dimly remembered

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:52.110
lesson from Miss
Thistlebottom's classroom

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.630
is a legitimate rule of usage.

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:57.240
And many supposed
rules of usage turn out

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.090
to violate the grammatical
logic of English,

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:02.910
turn out to be routinely
flouted by the best writers,

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:06.960
and often have always been
flouted by the best writers,

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.880
singular they being
an excellent example.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.290
A recent article in a
conservative opinion magazine

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.630
in the United States
argued that singular

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:20.250
they was a feminist plot
that had been forced down

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:24.690
our throats by angry women's
liberationists in search

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:27.090
of a gender neutral
means of expression

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:30.090
and that we should resist
this linguistic engineering

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:34.260
and go back to the crystalline
prose of Jane Austin.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.250
Whoops.

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.860
Turns out that Jane
Austin used singular they

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:42.180
87 times in her novels,
as in "everybody

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.186
began to have their vexation."

00:48:45.186 --> 00:48:46.560
Likewise, if you've
got a problem

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.440
with sentence final
preposition, maybe you

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.050
should go back and
edit Shakespeare,

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:55.770
when he wrote "we are such
stuff as dreams are made on."

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:58.200
And the same is true
of split infinitives,

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.480
dangling participles,
between you

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.020
and I, and many
other pseudo-rules.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:08.790
In fact, not only is obeying
bogus rules unnecessary,

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:10.650
it can often make prose worse.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.920
Here is a sentence
from a communication

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.920
that I got from my own
employer, Harvard University,

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.740
in one of its
boastful newsletters.

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.660
"David Rockefeller has
pledged $100 million

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.450
to increase dramatically
learning opportunities

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:26.190
for Harvard undergraduates."

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:29.130
Now, this writer twisted
himself into such a pretzel

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:33.720
to avoid a split infinitive
that he churned out a sentence

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.210
that, as far as I
can tell, does not

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:38.480
belong to the English language.

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.480
In fact, obeying bogus
rules can literally

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:46.860
lead to a crisis in
governance-- literally.

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:50.250
In 2009, Chief
Justice John Roberts,

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.400
who was a famous
grammatical stickler,

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.890
was charged with administering
the oath of office

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:57.660
to Barack Obama.

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.310
And the wording of
the oath of office,

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:03.460
as stipulated in the US
Constitution would be "I,

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.120
Barack Obama, do solemnly
swear that I will faithfully

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.120
execute the office of President
of the United States."

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:13.620
But Chief Justice Roberts
spotted a split verb

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:17.830
in that oath, and so he had
Obama say "I, Barack Obama,

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:20.870
do solemnly swear that I will
execute the office of President

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:24.300
of the United States
faithfully," which not only is

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.180
not a stylistic
improvement, but it

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.000
calls the legitimacy of
the transition of power

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:30.990
into question.

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:33.450
And so they had to
repeat the oath of office

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.030
in a private ceremony
in the White House

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:38.580
later that afternoon.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.220
So how should a careful writer
distinguish legitimate rules

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.140
of usage from bogus ones?

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:46.110
Well, the answer is
unbelievably simple.

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:47.520
Look them up.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:51.180
If you turn to a dictionary, say
Merriam-Webster's, and look up

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.130
split infinitive,
it will say, "it's

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:56.040
all right to split an infinitive
in the interest of clarity

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.350
since clarity is the
usual reason for splitting

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:00.480
this advice means merely
that you can split them

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.110
whenever you want to."

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:03.750
Encarta World
English Dictionary,

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:05.970
"there is no grammatical
basis for rejecting

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:07.230
split infinitives."

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:10.350
American Heritage Dictionary,
Random House Dictionary,

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:12.480
none of the dictionaries
say that there's anything

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.790
wrong with a split infinitive.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:16.710
So modern dictionaries
and style manuals

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:19.920
do not ratify pet peeves,
grammatical folklore,

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.000
or bogus rules.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.890
And that's because
they base their advice

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:26.850
on evidence, on the practises
of contemporary good writers,

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:30.150
on the practises of the
best writers in the past,

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:33.250
in some cases on polling
data from a panel of writers

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:37.350
in contested cases,
on effects on clarity,

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:41.400
and on consistency with the
grammatical logic of English.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.200
Also, we should keep correct
usage in perspective.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.350
Now, I do think that
it is a good idea

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:48.580
to respect the legitimate rules.

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:51.840
But in fact, they're the least
important part of good writing.

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:56.130
They pale in significance
behind maintaining

00:51:56.130 --> 00:52:00.180
classic style, coherent
ordering of ideas,

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.130
overcoming the
curse of knowledge,

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:04.740
to say nothing of factual
diligence and sound

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.170
argumentation.

00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:08.880
And also, even
when we get grumpy

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:14.730
about some undoubtedly
grammatical error,

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:17.070
we should keep in mind
that they are not signs

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:18.460
of the decline of language.

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.910
And this is nicely captured
in an XKCD webcomic

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:28.380
by Randall Munroe, in
which he shows a purist who

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:31.980
is haunted by a vision
of things to come,

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.850
by a ghost in the
middle of the night,

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:36.850
and says "I bring a cautionary
vision of things to come.

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:38.730
This is the future.

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:41.310
And this is the future if you
give up the fight over the word

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:42.276
literally."

00:52:42.276 --> 00:52:43.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:47.230
And yes, they are
exactly the same.

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.560
So to sum up, I've suggested
that modern linguistics

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:52.170
and cognitive science provide
better ways of enhancing

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:55.440
our writing, a model
of prose communication,

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.540
namely classic style,
in which language

00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:00.660
is a window on the world;
an understanding of the way

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:04.470
language works, namely as a way
of converting a web of thoughts

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:08.310
into a string of words; a
diagnosis of why good prose is

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:11.190
so hard to write, namely
the curse of knowledge;

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:15.510
and a way to make sense of rules
of correct usage, namely tacit,

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:17.520
evolving conventions.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.386
Thank you.

00:53:19.386 --> 00:53:21.796
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:21.796 --> 00:53:25.360
It seems as thought the way
in which we're acquiring words

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.800
is definitely speeding up
because of digital technology.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.175
And I was wondering if you
thought the same was happening

00:53:30.175 --> 00:53:31.830
with usage and grammar.

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.520
Are we seeing an
increase in the pace

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.670
at which things are changing?
