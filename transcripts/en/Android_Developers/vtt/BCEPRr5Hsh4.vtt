00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.380
GERARDO CAPIEL: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.830
I'm Gerardo Capiel.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.790
And I lead product management
for consumer payment products

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.040
here at Google.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.180
And with me is my partner in
crime, Varouj Chitilian, who

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.870
leads the engineering side.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.050
Payments are at the
heart of commerce.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.300
If I want to buy a cup of
coffee, I've got to pay for it.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.730
Payments are that link between
desire and fulfillment.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.040
And that link is paramount
to making your apps grow

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.520
and your businesses thrive.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.100
Unfortunately, that link
is also a major pain point

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.730
for many of you, particularly
on the mobile web

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.220
where conversion rates
are a third of what

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.220
they are on desktop.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.410
We're constantly
thinking about how

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.945
to make payments easier,
faster, and safer.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.600
Today, we're going
to be talking to you

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.050
about the foundation that
we've built with Android Pay,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.610
and about how we're
expanding our APIs to enable

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.006
richer commerce experiences
both online and in-store.

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:25.880
Take it away, Varouj.

00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:29.540
VAROUJ CHITILIAN:
The foundation,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.170
as Gerardo mentioned,
is Android Pay,

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.530
our solution for fast and
secure mobile payments.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.890
Over the past year, the team's
been working around the clock

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.340
to scale this
foundation globally.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.110
And I'm so proud to say
that Android Pay is now

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.885
available in 10 markets.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.130
But we're not stopping there.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.870
In the coming months, we'll be
launching in Brazil, Canada,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.800
Russia, Spain, and Taiwan.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.540
So the momentum and the
traction is just incredible.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.760
I'm personally very
excited about Brazil,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.240
because it will be the first
Latin American country.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.615
And I really want
to visit there.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.840
We're not just strengthening
the foundation by expanding it.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.750
We're strengthening it
also through partnerships.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.560
One example of this is a
push provisioning APIs.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.450
These APIs allow issuers
to embed core Android Pay

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.380
functionality directly
into their own apps.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.550
So that for example in this
case, a Discover app user

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.760
can simply click the
link for Add Card.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.540
This will provision their
card to their device.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.150
And they can go
into a store, tap

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.960
and pay to purchase a good
without ever having installed

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.550
the Android Pay app.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.800
The issuers that have
integrated the Push Provisioning

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.250
API to date have seen
phenomenal success.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.795
And we're really
proud of this API.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.090
We're also strengthening
this foundation

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.230
by partnering with
app developers.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.620
We're doing this through
the Android Pay in-app APIs

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.770
that thousands of apps
have now integrated with.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.190
And these APIs are bringing
seamless, streamlined, and very

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.440
smooth checkout to these
apps that are integrating.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.170
For example, the jet.com app is
seeing a 3.5x conversion rate

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.970
increase just by implementing
these in-app APIs

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.940
in their checkout flow.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.840
We're also expanding this
foundation to the mobile web.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.990
And we're bringing Android
Pay to the mobile web.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.560
And we're doing that through the
Payment Request APIs in Chrome.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.840
So we're very
excited about that.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.090
And recently "Washington Post"
integrated with these APIs.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.890
And they've seen
very nice success

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.660
with a streamlined
and native experience

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.709
that they're seeing in their
mobile web checkout flow.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.980
We're very excited
about all the momentum

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.050
we're seeing in
building this foundation

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.880
that we've built
over the past year.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.480
Now I'd like to pass
it over to Gerardo

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.430
so he can talk about
how we're building

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.950
on top of this
foundation that we have

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.640
so we can expose our users to
even greater mobile payment

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.840
experiences.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.550
Gerardo.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.841
GERARDO CAPIEL: Thanks, Varouj.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.530
Great.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.020
So let's start with online.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.970
As many of you know, having a
streamlined checkout experience

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.280
is critical for your
web sites to grow

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.950
and for your business to thrive.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.430
We want to make
it easier for you

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.550
to make it easier for your users
to transact online, and not

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.510
have to deal with onerous forms.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.010
And we're going to
do that two ways.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.380
First, we're collaborating
with a major payment platforms.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.230
Last year we
announced initiatives

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.880
with Visa and MasterCard.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.220
And as you might have heard
in Sridhar's keynote earlier,

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.610
we're adding Paypal
to that list.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.630
As we roll out each
of those integrations,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.210
users will be able to
link either Visa Checkout,

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.420
Masterpass or PayPal to
their Android Pay account.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.800
And they will enjoy a
streamlined authentication

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.540
and payment experience.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.100
And the best part
is they don't have

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.040
to do any additional
work if they're already

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.235
accepting Visa Checkout,
Masterpass, or PayPal.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:06.780
So let's take a look
at how that works.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.560
We flip the phone, please?

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.911
Great.

00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:14.410
All right.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.140
So it's starting to get
hot out there already.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.400
Summer is around the corner.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.760
And I'm starting to
think about it's time

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.100
to spend some time
around the pool.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.320
So what do I like to
have around the pool?

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.930
Well, margaritas,
that's for sure.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.910
And so earlier today I went
and started looking around

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.320
for some margarita mix.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.310
And I have some in my
shopping cart right here.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.810
Skinny Williams-Sonoma
Margarita Mix.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.140
Williams-Sonoma,
great e-commerce site.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.320
And so I think I have
enough margarita mix.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.840
And now I'm ready to check out.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.290
So down here I see a
Visa Checkout button.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.610
Now when I click
that button, voila.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.460
I see the cards.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.750
I'm already logged in.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.550
And I see my Visa cards already.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.980
I didn't have to enter in
my username or my password.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.350
It's that simple.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.300
And the best part is the finish.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.010
I just supply my fingerprint.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.340
And voila again.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.840
I'm done.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.220
Just a really
fantastic experience.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:28.340
And like I said, the best part
is that Williams-Sonoma already

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.200
has Visa Checkout.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.070
So when we roll out that
integration and Android Pay

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.300
users link their Visa Checkout
account to Android Pay,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.560
they'll be ready to go.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.490
Nothing else to do.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.500
But we're not stopping there.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.830
As you probably
heard earlier today,

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.750
our users have saved hundreds of
millions of payment instruments

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.930
to their Google account.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.820
And they do that
when they're making

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.320
purchases on Google
Play, on YouTube,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.740
or transacting in Chrome.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.280
And the benefit of that is that
they get a simplified checkout

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.710
experience on future purchases.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.740
It's really great experience.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:23.220
So what if we could bring that
simplified checkout experience

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.180
to your apps and the
websites that you build?

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.250
Well, as hopefully you heard
in the earlier keynote,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.970
today we announced the
Google payment API.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.010
And when you implement
that API, your customers

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.400
will be able to
quickly check out

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.330
using any of the cards
in their Google account.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.770
Just super simple.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.300
And that's going to work, as
I said, in apps; on the web;

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.622
and as you'll see in
a bit, the Assistant.

00:08:58.622 --> 00:08:59.830
So let's take a look at that.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.390
So I'm going to pop over here.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.470
And let's bring it back.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.820
Great.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.850
And I'm going to fire up
one of my favorite apps--

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.140
the Wish app.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.350
And Wish has been
testing this API with us

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.670
over the last couple of months.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.070
And so I was talking
about summer, the pool.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.320
I need some pool toys.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.370
I love this inflatable lounger.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.480
But unfortunately, last year
I jumped off the diving board,

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.120
belly flopped onto the
lounger and popped it.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.920
So I need another one.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.670
So I have it in my shopping
cart already ready to go.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.750
And if I see at the
bottom of the screen

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.610
there is a Pay
with Google button.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:53.690
When I click that button, I
see the last card that I used.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.550
But if I click further, I can
see all the cards in my Google

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.690
account, including those that
I added through Android Pay.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.270
Hit Continue.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.530
And voila again.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.503
Transaction is complete.

00:10:10.503 --> 00:10:14.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.460
It's really fantastic.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.370
Super simple.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.870
Love it.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.400
So in the next few
months we're going

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.500
to be piloting
the Google Payment

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.960
API with a number of
leading merchants and apps.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.510
And we want all of you to
be able to pilot this app

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.680
and implement it.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.500
And to accelerate
that process, we're

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.930
partnering with leading payment
processors such as Braintree,

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:50.590
and Stripe, Invantive,
ACI, Addion, First

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.100
Data, and Worldpay.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.660
We're really excited to see
what you all do with the API,

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.560
and what fantastic
conversion rates you get.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.890
Soon, we're going to be
uploading our developer

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.870
documentation.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.420
And in the meantime, I
encourage you all to go

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:16.510
to
developers.google.com/payments

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.290
and register to get
notifications of when

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.110
the developer documentation is
available so you can get going.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.140
Now as I've mentioned, this
also works on websites.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:36.330
So tomorrow morning I
would encourage you all

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.670
to go get a cup of
coffee free on us.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.340
You don't have to pay for it.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.780
And go to the Future of Web
Payments session on Stage 6

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.210
at 8:30 AM.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.610
But if you can't
get up that early--

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.790
and I'll be up that
early, I'll be there--

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.930
we have office hours
at 9:30 AM tomorrow

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.740
and at Friday at 11:30 AM.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.080
Hope to see you all there.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.360
So now that you've
seen how easy it

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:12.270
is to do transactions
on the web and in apps,

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.940
let's talk about how
seamless transactions can

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.510
be in the Assistant.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.740
So I hope a lot of you here in
the crowd own a Google Home.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.700
And if you do, you've
hopefully had the opportunity

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:31.260
to buy everyday essentials
from over 50 merchants,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.190
including Whole
Foods and Walgreens.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.700
Soon, we're going to be
adding even more merchants who

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.000
have integrated with our
Google Shopping APIs.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:51.290
But we're taking it
one step further.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.470
We're also going to enable
you all to build purchase

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.590
actions with the Assistant.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:03.170
And in case you didn't see
it at the last session,

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.190
here's how it works.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:11.370
So the user simply says,
I want to talk to Panera.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.250
They specify what
they want to order.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.800
Panera might even
suggest some drinks

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.260
that they might want
to go with that order.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:24.030
And then the user is able to
complete the transaction using

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.520
the cards in their
Google account,

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.400
and authenticate with
their fingerprint.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.420
That simple.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.830
Fantastic experience.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:38.790
So now you see how we're
making the Assistant an even

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.039
greater platform for commerce.

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:42.330
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Wow, Gerardo.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.879
That was super cool.

00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:44.795
GERARDO CAPIEL: It is.

00:13:44.795 --> 00:13:46.211
VAROUJ CHITILIAN:
How about we use

00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:48.740
the Assistant to order some
Panera for after the session?

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.531
GERARDO CAPIEL: OK.

00:13:49.531 --> 00:13:52.920
But let me pay you
back for dinner.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.690
I don't want it
to be just on you.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.430
And what I can do
is I'll send you

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:00.104
some money using our new
Gmail Send Money function.

00:14:00.104 --> 00:14:01.020
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Nah.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.970
Everyone's seen
that feature before.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.170
How about you pay, and I'll show
the audience something really

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.550
cool that no one
has seen before.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.341
GERARDO CAPIEL: OK.

00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:12.228
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Who wants
to see something super cool?

00:14:12.228 --> 00:14:14.116
Come on, let's hear it.

00:14:14.116 --> 00:14:16.251
[CHEERING]

00:14:16.251 --> 00:14:16.750
All right.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.390
So let's move to Cast One.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.880
There you go.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.380
OK.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.290
Google.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.390
Send $10 to Gerardo for dinner.

00:14:36.367 --> 00:14:36.867
Yes.

00:14:43.354 --> 00:14:44.352
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:44.352 --> 00:14:46.348
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Whoo!

00:14:46.348 --> 00:14:47.346
Awesome.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.710
GERARDO CAPIEL: We need--

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:05.360
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: I think
you have to go back a slide.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.870
Let's go back two slides.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.690
GERARDO CAPIEL: So-- thank you.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:17.580
As you saw, we're adding
P2P to the Assistant.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.420
And it will leverage the debit
cards in your Google account

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.450
to send money to
friends and others.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.430
And we're just getting started.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:31.245
We plan to soon onboard
other P2P providers.

00:15:31.245 --> 00:15:31.745
Varouj.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.500
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: So Gerardo is
showing some really cool stuff

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.470
that we're working on in mobile
payments in the online space.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:50.500
We all know that 85% of commerce
still happens in in-stores.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.960
So I'd like to talk
to you a bit about how

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.680
we're enhancing our
merchant-facing APIs to give

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.884
your customers a better
in-store experience.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.270
At the center of
it all is loyalty.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:11.050
Loyalty is the
connection between you--

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.410
the merchant, and
your customers--

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.150
the user.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.165
And we'd like to help you
with loyalty in three ways.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.730
We'd like to help you
one, with enrollment.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:30.660
So helping expose your loyalty
programs to Android Pay users

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.700
and signing them up.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.300
Two, with engagement.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.690
Once the Android Pay user has
your loyalty card associated

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:42.090
in their Android
Pay account, being

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.480
able to push offers to them
that are relevant to them,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.210
personalized to them.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:52.110
And three, we'd like to help
you with easy redemption

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.470
and earning of loyalty
points and offers

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.000
so that just with
a simple NFC tap--

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.340
what we call a smart tap--

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.390
the user with Android Pay can
transmit loyalty and offer

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:10.290
information just as
easily as they paid today

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.020
with Android Pay.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.710
So let's look at each of
these three individually.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:24.700
So say I'm an Android Pay user.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.720
And I need to go to Walgreens
to pick up some shampoo.

00:17:31.317 --> 00:17:32.650
It's for my daughter, of course.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.910
So Android Pay will send
the following notification.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.540
Says, Faster checkout
at Walgreens.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.030
Add your balance rewards to
Android Pay for an easier way

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.550
to save.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:51.060
Balance Rewards is a loyalty
program for Walgreens.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.270
And Walgreens has implemented
our Smart Tap technology

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.250
at their payment terminals.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.580
So with one tap on
this notification,

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.340
and a few things in
the Android Pay app,

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.990
we can easily sign
up the Android Pay

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.190
user for the Walgreens Balance
Rewards loyalty program.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.530
So super exciting.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.225
But we've taken
it a step further.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.470
Say I'm a Balance
Rewards member.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.050
And I'm an Android Pay user.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.110
But I haven't connected
my Balance Rewards card

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:28.370
to my Android Pay.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.520
So let's move to the demo.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.430
This is cast 2.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.240
The second cast.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.100
View cast to 1.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.180
Oh.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.690
There we go.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:02.802
Great.

00:19:02.802 --> 00:19:04.260
Oh, that's the
wrong one, actually.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.540
I tried some magic here.

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:21.950
Actually, I really
need to be casted.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:22.793
There we go.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:29.930
Oh, there we go.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.600
Perfect.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.430
Actually, these are
demo slides, I guess.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.660
Oh, perfect.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.320
I think it's the device.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:40.830
All right.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.940
So we're on cast 2 now.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.570
So now I'm buying a bag of nuts.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.200
And I have to remember
my phone number here.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.690
I think it was that landline
that I had four years ago.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:54.471
I think it was.

00:19:54.471 --> 00:19:54.970
OK.

00:20:02.778 --> 00:20:04.242
Now I tap.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.320
So now I have tapped to pay.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.890
But I've entered my loyalty
information manually.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.880
Wouldn't it be magical
if I was somehow

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.250
told that I can now add
this Balance Rewards

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:29.710
card that I entered manually
into Android Pay automatically?

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:30.210
Wow.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.001
That's pretty cool.

00:20:31.001 --> 00:20:34.260
We just got a notification
from Android Pay.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.590
And with a single
click in the app,

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.990
we can now save this
Balance Rewards card

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.050
that I used manually
into Android Pay

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:47.970
so that on subsequent visits,
I don't have to actually punch

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.220
in my phone number on
the payment terminal

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.430
and remember what my number
was on that landline years ago.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:05.660
So a second pillar of
loyalty, and the second area

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.670
we'd like to help you
with, is engagement.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.700
How do you engage with
that customer that

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.030
saved your loyalty
card in Android Pay

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.620
and push them offers
so that they'll

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.850
come back to your store?

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:30.590
For this we have another
demo with a Panera app.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.290
And the Panera loyalty
program is actually

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.420
called the My Panera program.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.640
So if you can go to--

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.240
there we go.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.130
So I'm going to go
into the Panera app--

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:41.750
Panera app.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.204
Sorry.

00:21:43.204 --> 00:21:44.620
And I'm going to
click on Rewards.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.930
There you go.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:56.640
And what I'll do is I'll save
my My Panera card to Android Pay

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.140
by this one click
of this button.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.930
Great.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.150
So my My Panera loyalty card
is now saved to Android Pay.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:16.420
Now if I go into Android Pay, I
see the My Panera loyalty card,

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.250
which is really cool.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.320
When I click into
it, we'll actually

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.620
see a rich set of offers
associated with my My Panera

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.970
card.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.020
What's even cooler is if
I'm walking by a Panera,

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.320
I will actually get a
GeoNotification that tells me

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.790
I have offers available to be
redeemed at the Panera store.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:42.550
So this is a great way in
which to engage your customers

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.070
after they've linked their
loyalty program into Android

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.180
Pay.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.170
And these new card-linked
offer APIs are now available.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.150
And you guys can
take a look at them

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:58.420
at
developers.google.com/payments.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.440
So now let's move
to the last part--

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.080
the last feature that we'd
like to help you with.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:13.030
And that's to redeem loyalty
and offers at the store.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.430
So I mentioned about Smart Tap.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.640
We're very excited to announce
that Smart Tap is also

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.800
rolling out in
Singapore with NTUC

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.850
Link, our first
international partner.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.850
But more than that, we're happy
to announce that Smart Tap will

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.060
be available to
businesses of all sizes,

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.290
including small and
medium-sized businesses.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:39.870
And in order to do that, we've
partnered with Clover, a First

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.610
Data company.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.760
I'm sure you've all seen the
slick point-of-sale and payment

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.450
terminals at your local
restaurant and cafes.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:54.210
But the Clover terminals now
support Smart Tap technologies

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.480
to allow for easy redemption
of loyalty and offers.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.020
So I'd like to invite John
Beatty, the CEO of Clover,

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.460
to come up and say a few
words about the collaboration.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.620
Please give him a hearty
round of applause.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.895
JOHN BEATTY: Thanks, Varouj.

00:24:08.895 --> 00:24:13.980
So we at Clover are huge fans
of what Varouj and Gerardo are

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.220
doing here to really push
the boundaries in commerce

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.510
and consumer
experiences in commerce.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.050
So let's give these guys a hand.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.850
And it dovetails perfectly
with Clover's role.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.930
So Clover's mission is to
enable innovation in commerce

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.370
on the merchant side.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.230
Now we do this in two ways.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:38.950
We provide open platforms in
point-of-sale and payments

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.070
to developers, and then also
through our parent company,

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:45.100
First Data, one of the world's
leading payment technology

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.950
companies.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.520
We provide broad
distribution capabilities

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.320
to our vast array of
merchants, both in the US

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.610
and in many, many
countries worldwide.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.880
Now we'll be supporting
Smart Tap in two ways.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.760
First, in our Open
Payments platform.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.460
This allows these devices here
that I'll demo here in a moment

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.910
to be able to do Smart
Tap interactions.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.800
And so we're also
happy to announce

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.270
that two of our partners--

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.550
ShopKeep and Bypass Mobile--

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.760
will be building Smart
Tap-enabled experiences

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.820
through the Clover platform.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:27.070
Secondly, the Clover customer
engagement suite of products--

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.750
through that suite
of products we'll

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.590
be enabling Smart Tap
technology to a vast array

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:36.220
of our small
businesses in the US.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.100
We've shipped over
500,000 devices

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.410
to small businesses in the US.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.000
And through this,
consumers and merchants

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.600
will have some fantastic
user experiences.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:52.120
Now, there's three things about
Smart Tap that I really like.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.300
First is simplicity.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.480
It doesn't get
simpler than tapping

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.270
to earn, redeem, and pay.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.370
It could hardly be simpler.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:07.780
Second, it drives real
value for merchants.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.710
When a customer enrolls
through Smart Tap, what

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:16.780
the merchant will be able to
do is push offers and rewards

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:22.420
directly into Android
Pay for those consumers.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.170
They can also send
offers if say, you

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.790
have a lapsed
customer, and you want

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.000
to incent them to come
back to your store.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.270
And it's really a
marketing technology

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.340
that I personally want.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.840
It's both convenient,
and it's in context.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.230
So lastly, it also
does one other thing,

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.960
which is it enables all
sorts of other innovation.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.630
You can imagine a scenario
where you buy something online.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:51.880
It could be on the mobile web.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.160
It could be in a native app.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.870
And say you buy it online.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:59.740
And then you want to
pick it up in store.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.100
You could save to Android
Pay, come in, and then tap

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.597
to present proof of purchase.

00:27:04.597 --> 00:27:07.180
There's many, many other things
that we've been thinking about

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.120
in online to offline
commerce and offline

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.690
to online commerce that
are really enabled by this.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:17.200
So if you need to build
anything that touches consumers

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.280
on the other side of the counter
with merchant technology,

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.440
please check us out.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.700
clover.com/developers.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:25.754
Back to you, Varouj.

00:27:25.754 --> 00:27:26.920
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: All right.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.970
Thank you, John.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:34.300
At this point, I know two things
for certain about every member

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.760
of the audience here.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.110
One, everyone could use a snack.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.900
Right?

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.000
And number two, everyone
wants to check out

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.520
some of these loyalty
features in Android Pay

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.380
that we've been talking about.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.870
Of course, right?

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.600
So we've got something
special for you.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.030
We've created a game
called Tap for Treats

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:59.020
around I/O. All you have to
do is download the I/O loyalty

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:04.700
card from [INAUDIBLE]
URL or from the I/O app.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.810
And you have to find
the Clover Smart

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.290
Tap terminals around the venue.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:15.280
And if you find all
five of these terminals,

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.350
you will get a limited
edition Android

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.300
robot that looks like me.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.880
No.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.850
Just kidding.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:25.060
Limited edition Android Paybot
that's not sold in stores.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.040
So highly encourage
you to do that.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.100
And I'd like to see if John
could show us how the Smart

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.450
Tap works on a Clover terminal.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.650
We have one right here.

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:36.400
JOHN BEATTY: Sure.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.750
So what I have here is my phone
with a Tap for Treats loyalty

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.310
card here.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:46.240
Here I have a Clover Mini, which
is a fantastic customer-facing

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.170
payment device.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.310
Happens to be based
on Clover OS use AOSP.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:55.130
And then on this side is
our merchant-facing device.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:58.270
So what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to take this.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.920
I'm simply going
to hold this here.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.910
I'm gonna tap.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.740
Now you'll see here that
it welcomes me by name.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.880
It says, Welcome to
Google I/O 2017, John.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.610
Now one extra thing--
and this is another thing

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:12.170
I forgot to mention that I
love about Smart Tap-- is

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.950
it enables additional
personalization

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:15.950
at the point of sale.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.470
So over here on
the merchant side--

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:18.553
this is still a prototype.

00:29:18.553 --> 00:29:20.510
And we'll certainly
improve this.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.850
But it has my name here.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:26.954
You can imagine it can do things
like pull up my previous order.

00:29:26.954 --> 00:29:28.370
The merchant can
greet me by name,

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.760
ask me if I want my usual.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.810
And so I'll go ahead
here, and I'm just

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.630
going to check out
just real quick here.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.040
And then right here
you'll be able to see

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.369
if I just refresh this that now
I have my extra loyalty point.

00:29:47.369 --> 00:29:49.160
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: And
so John gets a treat.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:49.930
JOHN BEATTY: Ah!

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.560
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: This is
a shave ice from Powder.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.070
And it's a Smart Tap terminal
right here on Porch 1.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.330
So thank you very much, John.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:58.630
JOHN BEATTY: Wonderful.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.840
Hey.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.670
Thanks, everyone.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:00.170
All right.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:02.259
Thanks, Varouj.

00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:03.884
VAROUJ CHITILIAN:
Gerardo, back to you.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.730
GERARDO CAPIEL: So cool.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.610
So hopefully, well, John's
getting a real taste.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.350
But hopefully you
all have gotten

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.320
a taste of how we're
making payments

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:22.090
faster, easier, and safer.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.800
You've heard how
we're collaborating

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.370
with the major payment
platforms like Visa, MasterCard,

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:32.860
and Paypal; how we're scaling
our solution by enabling users

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:37.270
to pay with the cards
in their Google account;

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.530
and how we're helping
merchants generate

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:49.540
loyalty among their customers
through our expanded APIs.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:54.110
We can't do all this
innovation by ourselves.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.080
We need all of you
to participate.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.500
And we thank you
for your support.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.150
We look forward to
working with you

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:04.900
between now and the
next I/O. And just

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.460
to wrap up with
some final points,

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.960
I'm going to turn
it back to Varouj.

00:31:11.104 --> 00:31:12.270
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: All right.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.010
So if you have any questions
about any of the features

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:18.010
you've seen or any of the
demos that you've seen,

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:21.660
please go to
developers.google.com/payments

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.160
and get information about
everything you've seen today.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.850
Also, these are the
listings for our office

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.780
hours and our codelab.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.920
So please drop by so we can give
you some hands-on experience

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.880
with some of this technology.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.400
I'd also like to
direct you to two

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.440
sessions with related content.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.090
One is for Android
developers called

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:44.090
Improved Sign-in, Payment
and Data Entry in your Apps.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:48.760
And one is for Chrome
developers called Web Payments,

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.150
Making it Easy for
Users to Give You Money.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:53.900
So thank you very much
for your attention.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.360
And go out and tap for treats.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.266
Thank you.

00:31:56.266 --> 00:32:00.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:01.612 --> 00:32:07.236
