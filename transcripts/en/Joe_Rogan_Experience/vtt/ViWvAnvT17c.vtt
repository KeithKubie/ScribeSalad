1
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.820
Boom and we're live. How are you sir? Oh brother, I'm so blessed to be here man.

2
00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:11.690
I want to salute you to work that you do and the fact that you will.

3
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:14.960
One hell of an artists, man, I'm telling you. Well thank you very much.

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.880
Coming to the stolen def comedy at strange times. Ooh,

5
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.170
we to swing from the political, the personal from the animal's own,

6
00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:28.040
do the a division area. Just a beautiful thing to behold. My brother,

7
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.050
thank you from you. That is an honor.

8
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.090
I've been a huge fan of you for a long time.

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.170
So for you to say that to me means it means the world. Oh,

10
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:38.750
it's a deep thing and I can see your love. Richard Pryor, man.

11
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:42.360
I walk in Yo space and I'm just chatting formed by the guys, the spirit.

12
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.180
Desperate at his place, man. Yeah,

13
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.480
it's here prior here.

14
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.870
Then when you tell me you work with two great Richard Price,

15
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.300
my five weeks.

16
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:56.570
I followed him when I was a young comedian at the comedy store.

17
00:00:56.571 --> 00:01:00.600
I went on right after him every night he performed. What was that like?

18
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.090
It was strange to be in a room with him because uh,

19
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.350
when I was a 14 year old boy,

20
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.670
my parents took me to see live at the sunsets trip and I could not believe that

21
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:12.980
anybody could be so funny just talking.

22
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.350
That was my first experience with stand up comedy.

23
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.210
Other than that I had seen like I'd seen people perform on the tonight show and

24
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:23.570
things on those lines. A lot of hope and so many of the other talent.

25
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.300
It was like ha ha ha, it was okay. You know what I mean?

26
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.020
But when you see Richard in concert in a movie theater,

27
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.260
I couldn't believe how funny it was. It didn't make sense.

28
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:34.910
I had seen funny movies before, like you know,

29
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.870
comedy movies that were made you laugh but nothing, nothing like that.

30
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.780
I'm like this guy's just talking. It changed my life.

31
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.370
That's what you can see the power of art and it's connected to freedom because

32
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:49.370
I've always viewed Richard prior as a free, as men, 20th century,

33
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:51.560
certainly free as black man along with Muhammad Ali.

34
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.360
He's free as black men of 20th century. He is so self determining.

35
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.790
Yeah. The choices that he makes has to do with his own sense of self.

36
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:03.540
He doesn't care what other people think. He doesn't.

37
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.260
Another looking for other people's approval, recognition.

38
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.670
He's going to be who he is and he pays a major cause for that.

39
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.920
Anytime you that free in a world of such a such unfreedom,

40
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.010
you're going to pay up major, major costs.

41
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.500
But he had spectacular honesty and he took,

42
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.850
I feel like what happened was Lenny bruise open the art form up and then Richard

43
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.020
Pryor took it to a new place. And that's in terms of the, the origins,

44
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:34.490
the real greats. That's exactly, but then George, oh yeah. Hello George Carlin.

45
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.301
Well,

46
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:39.710
he was the most prolific lord an hour special every year until he died.

47
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.680
Every year he did. Anyway, each one different than but all three, but at the,

48
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.000
but you are in that tradition. I was saying, man, when I saw you doing the, uh,

49
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.460
the dogs and cats

50
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.520
and getting inside their souls,

51
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.040
you know how profound that is still man, an artist. And

52
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.150
<v 2>as a human being to do that, I said, oh my God.</v>

53
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.280
And it reminded me of prior to that,

54
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.790
it's when I walk in and I see your connection, I say, Oh, be

55
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.670
<v 3>hm. I'll be, I shouldn't be surprised. Well,</v>

56
00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:17.280
it was just being in the room with him was strange.

57
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.900
I just couldn't believe it was real. You know, I was in my twenties.

58
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.600
You in the 20s. He was in his,

59
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.920
he was at the end and the guy said he couldn't walk anymore.

60
00:03:25.921 --> 00:03:30.140
They used to have to carry him to the stage and uh, but he performed,

61
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.830
sold out every night sitting in the chair. Yeah, I sat in the chair. Yeah, yeah,

62
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.210
yeah. But it was sold out every night. People couldn't believe,

63
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.800
I'm going to see, I don't believe there's tapes of it.

64
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.280
I don't believe anybody recorded it. If they did record it, nobody released it.

65
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.630
It was just, it was, this was in the 90s. And, um, this was again,

66
00:03:48.631 --> 00:03:52.120
this was the end of his life. He just decided, you know,

67
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.140
he was dying and he's decided he'd go back to his, his love go. Wow,

68
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.480
you want to go back doing stand up

69
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.450
<v 2>cause you got, you all got that picture. January 1st,</v>

70
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.380
1963 brother prior,

71
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.550
my brothers just broke down all [inaudible] brother Jamie got it. Me,

72
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.980
I didn't even know when he got around 35 days.

73
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.310
<v 4>Jay, he had a woman that he knew, he moved to Pittsburgh,</v>

74
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.260
apparently was, he was about 22 years old. Uh,

75
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.550
that isn't their prior conviction. There it is. There's a mugshot. Wow.

76
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.820
So he had a friend of his,

77
00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:31.240
which is a woman that was singing in clubs. Her father was a cop and,

78
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.291
and his autobiography,

79
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:37.090
he wrote that among other things that he or she paid him or she gave him money.

80
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.010
He admitted to beating her ass. So I beat her ass first.

81
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.080
Didn't think about hitting a woman. As much as I thought about my own survival,

82
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.270
that led him to being arrested, uh, sentenced to 90 days. He served 35 of them.

83
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.010
And had a $7 fine. He had a crazy life man. He grew up in a brothel.

84
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.460
<v 2>Yeah. Right. Then Peoria. Yeah. Peoria and all that.</v>

85
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.070
Now with the violence against any sisters wrong, but prior dove, him and man,

86
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:07.420
he uh, he was wild, free, cruel,

87
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.250
tender genius. Crazy wrong.

88
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:15.250
As he could be right as he can. He's a human being.

89
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:19.990
He's a complicated human being. I never met him before, but uh,

90
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.230
it's his spirit means the world to me.

91
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.210
<v 3>Me as well. Well, I think every comic,</v>

92
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:29.030
I've never met a single comic that doesn't think he's one of the most important

93
00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:31.940
figures in the history of the art. Probably the most important.

94
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.330
It's like him and Lenny Bruce in my opinion, and then Kennison later,

95
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.560
but Kinnison for a much, much shorter time. Who would be the greatest female?

96
00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:42.780
A comic artist, I think Roseanne Barr. Roseanne. Yeah.

97
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.800
Roseanne is profoundly talent. Yeah. No doubt about she,

98
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.750
she doesn't get the credit she deserves because she's legitimately mentally ill.

99
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.410
And that's one of the things I had on the podcast to highlight with literally

100
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.890
mentally,

101
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.890
she was hit by a car when she was 15 she knows she spent nine months in a mental

102
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:03.260
hospital. Yeah. She lost her ability to count.

103
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.730
She was very good at mathematics before that and then after the car accident,

104
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.010
the severe head injury changed her personality. Yeah. Same with Kinson.

105
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.490
Kennison is hit by a car when he was young as well and changed his personality

106
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:20.300
radically to head injuries, make people very impulsive,

107
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.740
very wild and impulsive, and oftentimes a slave to their own impulses.

108
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.610
And I think a Kinison was a big example of that as was Roseanne,

109
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.780
but Roseanne was the first really loud, brash,

110
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.580
almost male female comedian who could kill like a man. You know?

111
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.850
She was,

112
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.350
<v 5>well, what about the down rivers and the, Oh yeah. Louis [inaudible].</v>

113
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.870
I Love Monique. Monique gets to me. She, she,

114
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.330
she touches my soul every time she's on the stage.

115
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.490
<v 3>Do you, have you ever seen Miss Pat? No. Ms Baths a monster.</v>

116
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.790
She's a monster and she's had a crazy life.

117
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.840
She's been on this podcast a couple of times. Her life was insane. I mean,

118
00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:01.420
she was selling crack when she was 14.

119
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.120
She had a baby when she was 14 or 13.

120
00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:07.240
She was pregnant at 13 with a married man.

121
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.390
Had a couple of kids with him. Yeah, she's,

122
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.960
she and she is so funny.

123
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.120
She's so wild and funny.

124
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.650
<v 5>Yeah. Something about the, it goes back to aristophanes's, you know,</v>

125
00:07:20.651 --> 00:07:23.480
it goes back to a, uh,

126
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.530
those early comics in the history of the west who were willing to tell the

127
00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:29.741
truth,

128
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:34.741
especially as it related to the everyday experiences of ordinary people.

129
00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:38.230
You know, the first play, those texts itself, you know,

130
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:43.231
the republic was grounded in an imitation of the comic writers who were the

131
00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:49.060
first to really delve into everyday people's experiences.

132
00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:51.340
Not the, well to do that was tragedy.

133
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:55.060
Tragedy only had to do with what the nobility and aristocracy,

134
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.530
but it was comedy that dwelled into the lives of everyday people that played old

135
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.310
texts, the whole form and shifted into the dialogue and make Socrates,

136
00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:05.410
of course, the grant, the grant hero.

137
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.550
But it was aristophanes's at least in the west who initiated this with the

138
00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:12.010
clouds and, and frogs and so on.

139
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.120
And it goes all the way through from Jonathan Swift to mark twain,

140
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:20.010
to Nathaniel West to, uh, uh,

141
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.390
own the brother Ishmael Reed. I mean,

142
00:08:22.391 --> 00:08:27.280
these are the great American comic writers, Twain Wes,

143
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.150
read and see comic write as a different and the tragic ones of Dostoyevsky and

144
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.940
not that the cop Kafka's comic in his own deep way to the greatest. Of course,

145
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.950
the checkoff dough. Anton Chekhov, I know you check out checkoff, right? No. Oh,

146
00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:42.611
brother, you,

147
00:08:42.611 --> 00:08:47.611
you haven't fully lived and read some cement on check off all you read.

148
00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:49.560
Three sisters, uncle volunteer.

149
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.570
You read the Cherry or any of the short stories he's had over 6,000 in it.

150
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.130
Short

151
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.710
<v 2>Stories, the beats, frost and</v>

152
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.860
[inaudible] into the, um, in,

153
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.970
in the ravine or even misery, man. The greatest one is called a student.

154
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.500
It's only two and a half pages. It's his favorite short story.

155
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.850
Or You read that tonight. Blow. You're not mine. You listen to it.

156
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.110
You read that tonight. Listen to look. Curtis may feel doesn't, hello?

157
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.730
Stephen Sondheim. Okay. Steven Sondheim. No more into the woods.

158
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:28.890
Curtis may feel I loved and I laws and then the student checkoff.

159
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.760
Oh man, you'd be ready for some serious, serious cognac

160
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.790
on your recommendation. Oh No, no.

161
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.330
Cause I know you use serious side intellectual to you do your homework.

162
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.840
But I'm just saying this in terms of just enhancing, you know, all of our lives,

163
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:47.030
I mean the comic writers,

164
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.080
the Comedians of various sorts be they on the stage or video on the page are Ra.

165
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.300
I think the vanguards of the species in a very deep way. You know,

166
00:09:57.301 --> 00:10:02.301
because we as a species have to objectify our grief and our pain and our sadness

167
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:05.220
and our sorrow.

168
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.300
And it begins with moans and groans and you transfigured those moans and groans

169
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:10.350
first into song.

170
00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:15.240
But song then moves into language and the language is not rational language or

171
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:18.720
philosophy and dialectic, but it's a language of stories,

172
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.370
especially the stories that are self critical. We laugh at ourselves,

173
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:27.720
not at others. We left with others rather than just at others.

174
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.470
So it's not that sudden glory that Hobbs talks about in regard to the comic.

175
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.930
When you're looking down and condescending, you see,

176
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:36.480
that's an ever Mr cratic conception of the comic.

177
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:40.200
You laughing at the ordinary people who are so dirty and filthy,

178
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.510
it's profoundly anti-democratic, right? As if you know well to do. Folk,

179
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.630
don't fart. Don't, don't, don't, don't,

180
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:52.800
don't do number one and number two and fall in and out of love and act a fool

181
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:54.960
and live lives of [inaudible] consistency, right?

182
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.000
But back when you get these democratic forms of the comic c,

183
00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:03.630
that's you and Pryor and Roseanne and Monique and George Carlin and all of that.

184
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.260
That's free spirit though, brother. In most of our lives, you see,

185
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:11.940
we dealing with the whole history of a species of structures, of domination.

186
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.240
Oh, pressure. That's the history of the species for the most part.

187
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:20.730
And there's moments in which there's breakthroughs in which there's a freedom of

188
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:25.380
spirit, and then you have some institutionalization of that, which is democracy.

189
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:29.400
That's why democracies are so fragile and usually don't last that long because

190
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.530
it cuts so radically, radically against the sense of really wanting to be free.

191
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:39.210
I mean, those just skews, right? Most people really are afraid of freedom.

192
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.380
They want to defer to authority, they want to conform,

193
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.130
and when they're introduced to freedom and they really catch his whole,

194
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:49.860
they say, oh my God has tremendous cost to be paid,

195
00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:53.010
but I liked that there's something about,

196
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.700
<v 5>and they, they can hear it in the music, they can see it in your comic art,</v>

197
00:11:57.701 --> 00:11:58.720
the priors and others,

198
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.550
and it allows these little effects and consequences that people's lives to

199
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:05.740
really enrich their lives before they die.

200
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.030
Why do you think people are afraid of freedom? Well, it's courage. I mean,

201
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.110
there is no freedom without unbelievable, unprecedented,

202
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:16.540
unstoppable courage and courage.

203
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.650
It's not widely distributed in this pcs bay.

204
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.950
<v 1>That's a very charitable way of looking at people. No, it's true, man.</v>

205
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.670
Rather conformed and complacent. They're complicit too. As they cowardly,

206
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.140
they well adjusted in justice and wanting to smile and walk around as peacocks

207
00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:38.100
rather than cut against the grain and have to bear witness and therefore end up

208
00:12:38.101 --> 00:12:43.101
on the cross or like Socrates condemned on most of the great figures that we

209
00:12:43.801 --> 00:12:48.330
know. And so it's more consequences for that now than ever. Oh yeah.

210
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.670
Cancel culture. That's exactly right.

211
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.510
<v 5>Oh it's true. It's very, very true.</v>

212
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.630
But I mean we live in a culture that's so corporatized,

213
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.180
commercialize marketized. Um, it's all about money, money, money, status,

214
00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:06.860
status, status, and you lose any deep sense of honor character.

215
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.230
It's all about what appears to be the case.

216
00:13:09.231 --> 00:13:11.840
It's a culture of superficial spectacle.

217
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.270
So it's all about image you see and images,

218
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.900
just some, a surface phenomenon.

219
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.550
<v 3>Well, I can't recommend your book race matters enough.</v>

220
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:30.030
And one of the reasons is because of your analysis of that, your, your,

221
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.270
your understanding of this,

222
00:13:32.271 --> 00:13:37.040
the superficial aspect of the pursuit that so many people are locked into from

223
00:13:37.041 --> 00:13:39.740
cradle to the grave and you just,

224
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.260
you encapsulated that so well.

225
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.610
And the way you worded it and the way you phrased it, it's, it's so,

226
00:13:46.611 --> 00:13:49.870
it resonates so well and I, I,

227
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:55.060
I really admire this lifelong pursuit that you have for not just understanding

228
00:13:56.271 --> 00:13:57.104
these things,

229
00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.760
but explaining them in such a succinct way where it's absorbable.

230
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.930
Like that book, it's in the 25th anniversary.

231
00:14:05.931 --> 00:14:08.030
I want to talk to you about it because that's the one I read.

232
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.990
And it's so strange when you read something that's so,

233
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:16.250
it's so current, even though it's 25 years old,

234
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.820
it rings true and does that sometimes,

235
00:14:19.821 --> 00:14:22.130
does that feel few times where you, you,

236
00:14:22.131 --> 00:14:25.010
you have the same issues for that.

237
00:14:25.011 --> 00:14:30.011
You spoke on 25 years ago and there's very little change in those 25 years.

238
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:31.410
No.

239
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.040
<v 5>Wonderful. Deep question. No Man.</v>

240
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.510
And I appreciate the Times that you spent reading. Oh,

241
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.150
race matters. But no, it's never. Few towns don't man,

242
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:46.780
never a few towns because you have a conception of victory that is not messianic

243
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:52.080
or salvific. You're not trying to save people. You're not to be a messiah

244
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.940
<v 2>that brings some kind of grand a gospel to people.</v>

245
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.250
You simply trying to touch people's lives.

246
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.020
So when you enrich and enabled person's life,

247
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.990
the way in which you've talked about debt right there,

248
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.870
you already talking about the ways in which you were touched.

249
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.020
That means ever no futility at all.

250
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.570
And there's certainly not if you told them to go to the, uh,

251
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.430
the full condom t of it, it's all, all we can do, you know,

252
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.690
as human beings,

253
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.260
is to try to inspire one another and encourage one another and enable one

254
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:27.470
another and noble one another.

255
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.180
And that in and of itself was what the Great John Coltrane call a force for

256
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:37.040
good. How do I become based on a love supreme,

257
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.570
a force for good in a colon crew. World Love Supreme.

258
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.580
Absolutely. Absolutely. And love supreme is not loving the abstract,

259
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:51.020
right? It's a love of beauty in its concrete forms.

260
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.960
It's the love of goodness in his concrete forms.

261
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.840
It's a love of truth and it's concrete forms.

262
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.800
Now I'm a Christian Revolutionary Christians.

263
00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.630
I got a love of God mediated through Palestinian Jew named Jesus.

264
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.460
But that's tied to a justice that comes at a prophetic Judaism, right?

265
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.620
And we know Judaism, Christianity, Islam, all of these religions from me, uh,

266
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.980
have no wholesale monopoly on how we understand the world because they all

267
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.240
emerged at various historical moments.

268
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:25.690
But when it comes to this love that allows us to persist in a world in which

269
00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:31.040
cruelty and envy, contempt,

270
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:36.020
manipulation, this honesty and that shot through all of us.

271
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.370
So we're not finger pointing the name called, oh no. You know,

272
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.910
I called up brother Donald Trump a gangster over and over again. And I,

273
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.660
and I say that because there's a gangsta inside of me.

274
00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:50.810
I got to reconquer concrete every day. So I know gangsters.

275
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:54.950
When I see one and gangsters, not a subjective expression,

276
00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:59.420
it's an objective condition, but you grabbing a woman's part that's gangster.

277
00:16:59.421 --> 00:17:03.690
You dig with somebody oil, another country that's gangster. You lies.

278
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.630
And these people have said that the America's garbage quit lying.

279
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.331
That's gangster.

280
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:11.530
They got a critique of America you did to in American car and the genuine

281
00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.580
inauguration. You said all you're talking about,

282
00:17:13.581 --> 00:17:15.620
the full sisters in Congress saying, well,

283
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.660
all evil Jews know Dan said, evil Jews,

284
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:23.180
they said evil doings of Israel.

285
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.780
Every nation state is dumped some evil things, right?

286
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.670
If there's a Palestinian state,

287
00:17:28.671 --> 00:17:31.670
which I hoped areas they're going to do some evil things.

288
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.750
Every nation state has to be accountable. You is Upo, Opo,

289
00:17:36.751 --> 00:17:40.580
Guatemala, Israel, trying and so forth and so on,

290
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.880
and every nation state has been associated with certain forms of barbarism.

291
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.020
We know that, but there's some good things, some wonderful things about Israel,

292
00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:51.300
some wonderful things about Palestinians and formation, creating a state.

293
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.430
There's wonderful things about America. I mean,

294
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:57.180
a lot of people say even brother Trump to all, they hate America now.

295
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:02.100
They love American comics. They love American music.

296
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:07.710
You ask sister Talia, you asked us the Priestley, y'all love a reefer.

297
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.550
I've read the Franklin means the world to me. What about buried Jake?

298
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.990
Mary j means the world.

299
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.920
Mary J and Aretha are as American as Donald Trump.

300
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.460
Even more in some ways when they been here longer than people been there.

301
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:21.850
10 generations.

302
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.070
Donald Trump's grandfather just arrive his mother straight from Scotland,

303
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:31.170
precious Maryanne, 1930 she arrived, right? And so in that sense you say,

304
00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:35.040
wait, wait a while. Look, quit, lie. And let's just be honest and candid.

305
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:38.880
Just like the comics. Let's just be honest and candid and recognize.

306
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.740
Cause what is the definition of comedy? It is first drama,

307
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.360
which is conflict,

308
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:50.130
emotionally felt and critically reflected upon.

309
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.000
But it's that conflict that's rooted than incongruity.

310
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.130
Things don't fit. So that's the possibility of hypocrisy,

311
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:03.720
right? And we know hypocrisy is the tribute of vice, the virtue,

312
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.890
so that there's standards and you fall short. So you can laugh at it.

313
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.780
Now when it's really deep comedy is talking about the human condition.

314
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.600
See, that's a deeper thing. I see.

315
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:20.460
That's where you get checkoff and Shakespeare and joys and the blues.

316
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.120
Because deep comedy is the recognition of limits and incongruities at the

317
00:19:27.481 --> 00:19:32.430
highest levels of the mind, heart and soul. That's the different thing.

318
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.370
So you can start with comedy with a, you know, the clown who was,

319
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.520
who's walking around, slipping on bananas,

320
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:43.910
or the sophisticated professor who doesn't realize that he got a banana hanging

321
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:46.740
out the back of his pocket when he's electric with the students. They,

322
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.750
everybody laughing. He don't know what's going on. Well,

323
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:50.990
that's bodily based comedy, you know,

324
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.490
farts and bananas and so forth. And it's, it's important. Yes,

325
00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.560
but high comedy is the highest levels of human dignity,

326
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:07.080
love thought music, mathematics,

327
00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:08.040
metaphysics,

328
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.360
and then recognize all of those are incongruous.

329
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.270
They're broken, they're fractured.

330
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:21.380
There's dramatic conflict of incongruity at the highest levels of who we are as

331
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:26.670
a species. That's deep stuff that is deep. So,

332
00:20:26.671 --> 00:20:28.460
oh Lord, Lord.

333
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.520
Then one of the most fundamental questions of Western civilization is how come

334
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:37.380
Socrates never cries and Jesus never laughs.

335
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.480
Ooh, that,

336
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.530
that's the question Thomas Moore was wrestling with in the tower of London

337
00:20:43.531 --> 00:20:46.710
before he was executed in his dialogues on tribulation.

338
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.830
Socrates never shared the t. What does that mean?

339
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:56.250
The founder of philosophy in the modern West has a love of wisdom,

340
00:20:56.351 --> 00:21:00.490
but he never loves people because it's impossible to love human beings and not

341
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.680
yet tears. Wow.

342
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.890
You go to your Mama's funeral and you're not shedding tears and you're committed

343
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:08.800
to the Socratic ideal of self mastery and self control.

344
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.310
You need to get off the crack pipe, get off,

345
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:18.300
show her the depths of your love for her through being outside of your self

346
00:21:18.621 --> 00:21:21.970
mastery. The tears will flows, you said, and that's the other way.

347
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:22.804
It's like your daughter,

348
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.630
this precious thing that you got when we walk in for your daughter.

349
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.370
You see when she graduates,

350
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:31.570
you and your wife are going to have tears of joy that ain't demoed for self

351
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.530
mastery. That's not the moment to be so cratic. And so when Socrates is dying,

352
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:38.790
his wife walks in, Z is antipathy and she's crying. He said, get her out,

353
00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:41.560
get her away and get him. I can't stand tears. So that's a problem.

354
00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.770
That's the problem. See, I come from Blackfoot, we start with tears.

355
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.740
All the mess we had to come to terms with. You know what I mean,

356
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.020
cries and so forth. And he was scripted.

357
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:51.880
Begins with the cries of oppressed people too. Right?

358
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.710
But then Jesus never laughs. Ooh, I see. That's a deep one. That's a deep one.

359
00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.160
That's GK Chesterton Cheston said,

360
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:05.230
Jesus turns over the tables of the money changes.

361
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:10.120
He does not conceal his rage. Crucial.

362
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.530
Jesus does weep. That's one of the most profound verses.

363
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:16.420
And in the Christian Bible,

364
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.920
Jesus wept unlike Socrates. Why did Jesus weep?

365
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.270
He went for Jerusalem. He went for Lazarus. He left web force friends.

366
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:30.540
But Jesus hides and conceals his mirth. That's what Chesterson says.

367
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.210
Is there any laughter in the Bible? Well, Isaac means laughter.

368
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.370
When you think of the joke of an older Sarah given birthed to a young person in

369
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:41.590
a older age and so forth.

370
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.620
But it's hard to catch Jesus laughing.

371
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.460
None of the synoptic up the gospels have Jesus laughing.

372
00:22:48.461 --> 00:22:52.810
Some people thought they discerned the grin somewhere cause he turned wine in

373
00:22:52.811 --> 00:22:57.430
the water. He probably had a little grant on that. A little sub grant.

374
00:22:57.431 --> 00:23:00.280
Exactly, exactly. But, uh, uh,

375
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.700
but you can never get the full scale and variety of the human condition in any

376
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.420
one tradition. I think one of the, one of the

377
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.860
<v 3>beauties of what you're saying here,</v>

378
00:23:10.861 --> 00:23:14.190
one of the beautiful things about what you're saying here is the complexity of

379
00:23:14.191 --> 00:23:15.024
human beings.

380
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.050
And when you're dealing with the situation between these girls that call

381
00:23:19.051 --> 00:23:21.300
themselves the squad and Donald Trump,

382
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.250
and you deal with these very simplistic things like these chance of sending her

383
00:23:26.251 --> 00:23:31.050
back or lock her up, or they hate America, or you know, this,

384
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.810
this is simplifying things is,

385
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:38.820
is so attractive to some people and so attractive during political discourse,

386
00:23:38.821 --> 00:23:39.890
right? Dude, during these,

387
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.870
these times when you're trying to rally up a campaign and get, get,

388
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.210
get the audience behind you, this is when these simplistic things resonate.

389
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:52.470
But as a human being, we know that things like, I don't use these,

390
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:58.120
I don't subscribe to this idea that human beings are good or bad.

391
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.490
I think there's either way. Yeah, I'm sure.

392
00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:05.840
Look the way Donald Trump loves his family. I'm sure there's love in that guy.

393
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:06.733
I'm sure there is.

394
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.580
<v 5>Oh, I mean he's, he's had some, you know,</v>

395
00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:13.140
relations to his mother and his brothers and sisters that would not ones have

396
00:24:13.141 --> 00:24:16.830
sheer manipulation of domination is no doubt as a human being.

397
00:24:16.831 --> 00:24:19.620
And it's important to keep track of his humanity.

398
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.510
But at the same time what happens is the dominant patterns of behavior.

399
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.900
This is what worries me about brother Trump's Besley,

400
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:31.620
the fact that he's hit of the American empire and headed the government.

401
00:24:31.621 --> 00:24:36.540
You see that when you have dominant patterns of behavior that are completely on

402
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.680
accountable.

403
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:43.010
See for so long he's been able to get away with things with no accountability at

404
00:24:43.531 --> 00:24:48.360
all. Yes, that's what makes him a kind of a Peter Pan.

405
00:24:48.361 --> 00:24:51.990
Like figure. He's pretty tell he became president Xi powerful,

406
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.110
but he hadn't grown up. But even as president, he hasn't grown up.

407
00:24:55.111 --> 00:25:00.111
People had thought that he would grow into the office now he just hasn't grown

408
00:25:00.241 --> 00:25:01.920
up and you know, he's still Peter Pan

409
00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.840
<v 3>to manipulate the office position to change to be what he is.</v>

410
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:07.880
And I think people love that.

411
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.370
There are certain people that that resonates with them.

412
00:25:10.371 --> 00:25:13.430
They think that's so attractive. They love it. Well

413
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.080
<v 5>they, I think they love it because it's expense that,</v>

414
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.170
I mean the first thing that you know,

415
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:25.250
Trump was able to do was to expose the prepackage commodities that we call

416
00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:31.781
politicians that he came across as somebody who was just himself.

417
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.700
Yes. You see, yes gangster that he is,

418
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.680
and he'd just tell the truth. Oh, I was a close friend of Hillary's.

419
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.900
I've been at the same weddings and so forth.

420
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:46.190
Cause that's how the elite circulate in American Empire.

421
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.020
But then when they discovered Lauren Boho,

422
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.940
he's now he's posing himself as some kind of oppositional figure.

423
00:25:52.941 --> 00:25:57.740
And yet he tied the big money tied to big military. When he gets in,

424
00:25:57.741 --> 00:26:02.270
he brings in the old school militarise people.

425
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.020
He's still dropping bombs on the nine countries that had been dropping bounce

426
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.240
for the last number of years.

427
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:13.300
Tax cuts sound exactly the same that Mitch and McConnell and others wanted.

428
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.130
We thought we had something different here. You see. And it has to do with the,

429
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.530
well, when Mr larger storage, we have to be honest about this, that see,

430
00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:29.620
we live in both of very fragile and precious experiment in democracy and we live

431
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:38.540
in an empire that is experiencing profound decline,

432
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:43.980
decay and deterioration simultaneous. So you can

433
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.640
<v 2>from the very beginning in days was really in some ways,</v>

434
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:52.910
much more tied to gold and resources and land.

435
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.640
And so is really crucial.

436
00:26:56.641 --> 00:27:01.641
Democratic experiment is predicated on the monstrous crime against indigenous

437
00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:03.990
peoples that we've never come to terms with.

438
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:09.380
So you get a lot of neoliberal chatter about America's original Sullins slavery.

439
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:10.653
The lie,

440
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.990
the original sin was we had to decide whether we were going to coexist with

441
00:27:15.991 --> 00:27:20.610
indigenous peoples or dominate them. And the decision was,

442
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:25.020
for the most part, genocidal effect in terms of domination.

443
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.760
So it's a settler colonial society, a colony of Britain, you see?

444
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:35.450
Then we enslaved the Africans who become the basis of our economy and the vast

445
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:40.830
majority of profits made were actually tied to slavery.

446
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:42.270
That's why so many of the presidents,

447
00:27:42.271 --> 00:27:47.140
first presidents in America were slave holders and the chief justice of the

448
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.840
Supreme Court and slave holders and so forth.

449
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:53.070
That that doesn't mean that certain democratic practices were not being enacted,

450
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.340
but it was enacted for white brothers with property.

451
00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.020
The white brothers who had no property, they couldn't vote at all. The women,

452
00:28:01.021 --> 00:28:01.441
of course,

453
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:06.441
couldn't vote until 1920 so they had domestic households in which they had to

454
00:28:06.841 --> 00:28:08.670
find some sense of fulfillment.

455
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.810
That's what history of Patriarchy and misogyny in part are connected.

456
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.970
And then tremendous efforts come to expanding it,

457
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:22.440
expanding it. And this is why even when brother Trump talks about socialism,

458
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:27.520
he doesn't realize the pledge of allegiance was written by Francis Bellamy who

459
00:28:29.131 --> 00:28:33.240
was a socialist. The song American, the beautiful,

460
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.160
which is one of the most beautiful psaltery Charles Sing.

461
00:28:35.161 --> 00:28:37.260
That song could take you to a different place. I mean,

462
00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.960
he's seeing things we can't see and you know, he's blind. You know what I mean?

463
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.820
America, the beautiful Elizabeth Lee Bates Socialists,

464
00:28:44.821 --> 00:28:49.740
professor Wellesley, who was our greatest poet, wog Whitman.

465
00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.440
Pete ties to socialism, who was our greatest philosopher, John Dewey,

466
00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.420
democratic socialists his whole life. Helen Keller Deaf,

467
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.020
mute blind, graduated Radcliffe,

468
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.930
socialists, Ryan, whole neighbor,

469
00:29:06.931 --> 00:29:11.820
the greatest Christian thinker of the 20th century, democratic, socialist,

470
00:29:11.821 --> 00:29:15.900
moral man in the moral society. Martin Luther King, Jr Democratic.

471
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:16.950
So Ella Baker,

472
00:29:16.951 --> 00:29:21.810
Democrat Democratic Socialism is as American as Apple Pie,

473
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:27.260
but with the communists and the Communist threat and the Soviet Union and all of

474
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:35.490
its repression and vegemite tation and violation of liberties and killing of the

475
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.610
culottes and so forth. In the American mind,

476
00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:41.500
socialism becomes associated with communism.

477
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.130
So you saw brother Lindsey the other day, ray. Yes, he looked like a cartoon.

478
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.120
His version of, of, of Joseph McCarthy. They're all Communis.

479
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.170
They're all communists. And you see what happens.

480
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.260
He is in a neo fascist discourse, his treating way around the world.

481
00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.680
If you can define a community as pure and then characterize those on the outside

482
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.710
of the threatening as impure and didn't view yourself as those coming to the

483
00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:12.490
rescue to preserve the purity. It can be based on race.

484
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.510
It can be based on religion, it can be based on politics,

485
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.310
preserved at purity.

486
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:22.840
We saw it in the fifties with the hysteria communists with what Smith Act.

487
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.620
They're deported or they take an a jail. I think the first,

488
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.230
the first city councilman from Harlem,

489
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.000
Benjamin Davis went to jail because he was a communist. You see,

490
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.120
because they were the NPO. They said,

491
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:40.530
now communism needs to be radically called into question in terms of its

492
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:45.610
dominating forms like the Soviet Union and China on the mile and so forth and so

493
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:47.410
on. But at the same time,

494
00:30:47.411 --> 00:30:50.710
when you look at Carl Marx and his critique of capitalism, he,

495
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.280
this is prior to let it prior to styling, he says,

496
00:30:54.281 --> 00:30:59.281
capitalism is tied to this obsession with profit that puts profit before people

497
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:05.170
and it will generate all adoptees in which there will be grotesque levels of

498
00:31:05.171 --> 00:31:09.820
wealth inequality and the only way that porn working people will be able to gang

499
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:13.690
assets to any resources to do organizing and mobilizing.

500
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.230
Now you're going to accept that Mark's as insight. What? I'm in a Marxist.

501
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.990
He just telling the truth. Do you think that

502
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:23.800
<v 1>socialism just hasn't been implemented correctly? Is that what you think?</v>

503
00:31:23.801 --> 00:31:26.080
Because like the, the argument has always been,

504
00:31:26.081 --> 00:31:30.870
show me a socialist economy or socialist government that ever worked. Right?

505
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:31.470
Right.

506
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:36.470
But there's so many people that find the idea of socialism attractive because

507
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:36.870
it,

508
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:41.870
it combines this idea of a community with a nation and that we're all tied

509
00:31:42.161 --> 00:31:42.910
together and we have,

510
00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:47.590
we obviously have some socialist aspects to our civilization in terms of like

511
00:31:47.591 --> 00:31:50.650
utilities and they look at the military.

512
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.850
We outsourced the military firefighters, police.

513
00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:59.110
There has to be some kind of governmental control. But the,

514
00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:00.360
the problem is this,

515
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:05.370
that if we have to view democratic socialism as a moment in the larger movement

516
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.560
of democracy, my dear brother Jeff [inaudible],

517
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.450
who's one of the great philosophers and thinkers of democracy,

518
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.840
calls them egalitarianism, freedom traditions,

519
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:25.590
and that simply a way of saying that if you look at the world through the Lens

520
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:29.620
of the masses of people who are poor and working people,

521
00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:35.380
<v 2>what are the conditions under which they can have security from domination?</v>

522
00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.140
What are the conditions under,

523
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.830
they can have dignity by holding forms of oppression at arms length.

524
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.720
And for me is not an ISM. You see, if capitalism,

525
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:55.550
visa, VI, feudalism can generate liberties and freedoms,

526
00:32:55.551 --> 00:32:58.160
I'm forward and that's resize. Lee.

527
00:32:58.161 --> 00:33:02.030
What the middleclass is did when they broke from feudalism in Europe or broke

528
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:04.100
from feudalism and other parts of the world, right?

529
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.230
You had to overthrow kings and Queens in the name of personal liberties,

530
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:14.360
but those personal liberties were confined too often to white brothers with

531
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:17.900
property and the white brothers would know property.

532
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.350
They either tried to hold onto their white and so they become like the white

533
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:25.040
brothers were property or they make moral choices and said,

534
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.380
I want to be a person of integrity.

535
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:31.220
I want to fight with the folk who are being excluded.

536
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.760
And this is one of the problems in talking about race and white supremacy in

537
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:35.870
America because you see,

538
00:33:35.871 --> 00:33:39.800
we think too often than mono lithic categories.

539
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:45.280
There's never been a white supremacy without fighting against white supremacy.

540
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.560
And that includes white brothers and sisters.

541
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.180
There's a tradition from hand Braden from miles Horton.

542
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.840
You have Highlander center, you've got that wonderful picture of Rosa parks.

543
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.200
She was at Highlander center four months before she was arrested,

544
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.500
before she sat down on a bus in order to stand up for justice right there at

545
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:08.720
Highland, the sun on the miles Horton, who was miles Horton,

546
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.520
a white brother who brought black folk and white folk together went to union

547
00:34:13.521 --> 00:34:16.130
seminary, trained under Ryan whole Neba.

548
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:19.520
He had cousins in the Ku Klux Klan. Wow.

549
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:21.680
So his Thanksgiving dentists were very complicated,

550
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.540
but that's true for a whole lot of white brothers who fight against white

551
00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:27.374
supremacy.

552
00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:32.410
And Brayden a rabbi Abraham Joshua Hep test show me Edward Zooey.

553
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.330
You have a whole tradition of white brothers,

554
00:34:35.331 --> 00:34:38.210
sisters who've been fighting against white supremacy. You get it in the music.

555
00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:39.981
Beck's about her back.

556
00:34:39.981 --> 00:34:44.090
He sitting at the feet of Louis Armstrong and he's a great artist.

557
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.740
Louis is genius of geniuses, right? And that middle-class brother from Iowa,

558
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:53.060
you asked him about why supremacy you as Brubeck about white supremacy.

559
00:34:53.061 --> 00:34:55.640
You ask any of the appall Desmo,

560
00:34:55.650 --> 00:35:00.650
all of these folk who are connected to traditions in which black humanity,

561
00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:06.100
Brown humanity is seen and affirmed.

562
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.550
You have it. I had a

563
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.880
<v 3>point in the book race matters.</v>

564
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.520
It resonated with me that I never really thought of before.

565
00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:17.830
And what you said was that because of the fact that the United States has this

566
00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:22.720
deep history of slavery and the slavery of African Americans,

567
00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:28.140
that white people became white people instead of Polish and German and Italian

568
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.040
instead of it being like most other countries where they,

569
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.410
they Italians think of themselves as the Italians and the Greeks are the Greeks.

570
00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.980
Those were white people. They're all

571
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:42.710
<v 1>co, they combine as white people. I never thought about that before. No.</v>

572
00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.970
What it means, you've got these scholars of American studies.

573
00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.060
Let me nail painters, one of the tiring ones,

574
00:35:48.061 --> 00:35:52.020
but it goes all the way back to brother Alexander and David,

575
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.810
David Roediger and some others who've been talking about

576
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.870
<v 2>the way in which whiteness was created. Take for example,</v>

577
00:35:58.871 --> 00:36:01.270
an IRS brother who calls dot Ellis Island.

578
00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:06.220
His people been dealing with 800 years of vicious British colonialism and

579
00:36:06.221 --> 00:36:08.200
imperialism vicious to tax,

580
00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:13.860
various famines that in some ways created or at least enabled and so on.

581
00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:19.290
They get to New York and they're told that they are whiteness and no,

582
00:36:19.301 --> 00:36:23.860
no because we know the British are white and we not British at all,

583
00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:28.480
but then this is, yes, you are. Look at brother West. Look at Jamar.

584
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:32.710
Look at Latitia. Where are you going to go on the Jim Crow bus?

585
00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:36.880
Just get off the boat from Ireland. If you go to the front,

586
00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.750
you would vanilla folk. You go to the back,

587
00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:44.140
you with the chocolate folk what you're going to do and for our presses,

588
00:36:44.141 --> 00:36:47.320
Jewish brothers and sisters, it was even more complicated, more complicated.

589
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:48.520
They get there and they say, no,

590
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.770
we not with the goal and we're not with the gentiles.

591
00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:54.640
Y'all been oppressing us for 2000 years.

592
00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.780
Pogroms ghettos, holocaust,

593
00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:02.530
vicious attacks and so on. But then they get there and say,

594
00:37:02.531 --> 00:37:04.810
well are we going to be in the back with the black folk?

595
00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:10.000
Some of them did you see, cause you got a rich tradition of progressive Jews.

596
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.740
Noam Chomsky would've got back there.

597
00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:15.410
Stanley Aronowitz would've got back there with the black folk. He said, I mean,

598
00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.400
but you got some other Jewish folk like any other group.

599
00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.970
Well we kind of look warm. Let's just kind of move back and forth.

600
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:24.700
And then some of them want to assimilate completely,

601
00:37:24.701 --> 00:37:26.500
especially the highbrow German Jews.

602
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.540
<v 1>We're actually white as well as the jug towels. You're in America now,</v>

603
00:37:31.541 --> 00:37:32.900
get beyond that old world

604
00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.630
<v 2>prejudice. You say,</v>

605
00:37:34.631 --> 00:37:37.570
well you better check yourself because every Christian civilization we know is

606
00:37:37.571 --> 00:37:41.290
shot through with Jewish Atrius. Mm. Don't, don't believe the hype.

607
00:37:41.291 --> 00:37:43.930
Sooner or later it's going to be manifest. You see what I mean?

608
00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:48.760
And so in that way you can see the discourse of whiteness, blackness, brownness,

609
00:37:48.761 --> 00:37:51.190
redness and so forth becomes so,

610
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:56.020
so deeply rooted in American law, American structures,

611
00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:57.700
American perceptions.

612
00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:02.910
And this is why the arts are so crucial because it's primarily in the music and

613
00:38:04.271 --> 00:38:09.250
in the arts where the breakdown of white supremacy begins to take place in the

614
00:38:09.251 --> 00:38:13.760
country. It's not the politicians. It really isn't. It really isn't.

615
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:19.080
There's no accident that the first massive form of entertainment in the United

616
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:23.530
States is what the menstruals and black face. And you say, well,

617
00:38:23.531 --> 00:38:26.290
what was going on with black where Eric Lot and others have talked about the

618
00:38:26.291 --> 00:38:28.150
love and theft. On the one hand,

619
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:33.530
there's a fear of black freedom cause black freedom somehow means less freedom

620
00:38:34.781 --> 00:38:36.070
for, there's

621
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.580
<v 5>a fear of black creativity. Cause that means maybe white supremacy is alive.</v>

622
00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.440
Maybe they're human just like us. Maybe they just as creative, imaginative,

623
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:49.390
intelligent, just like us. Then they hit music and they say food.

624
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:52.210
They got something going on in the black side of town, but we don't know.

625
00:38:52.211 --> 00:38:55.270
It was like you go to see prior, right? If somebody had told you,

626
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.980
oh brother Joe White Supremacy, America tells you that black creativity,

627
00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:02.170
black intelligence, black genius doesn't exist.

628
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.430
And you go see pride with your parents and you go away thinking just negroes

629
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:11.230
with juniors. Somebody lied to me. I got to recognize that.

630
00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:12.580
And then you recognize those,

631
00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:16.350
the whole tradition of prior and we can go on and off from the cold train.

632
00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.180
Sarah [inaudible] and on and on and on. Right.

633
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.750
And so people begin to think federally, white brothers and sisters,

634
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:27.370
my parents had been lying to us when it comes to black intelligence,

635
00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:30.070
imagination and genius and humanity.

636
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:34.120
And yet the structures make it difficult for us to come together.

637
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:36.700
We're talking about up until 1960 that's a long time though.

638
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:42.090
1776 that 1964 and five that's a long time for both slavery and Neal slavery to

639
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:52.561
be in place and here we are now 54 years later trying to create a multiracial

640
00:39:53.771 --> 00:39:56.200
democracy, which is a beautiful, beautiful thing.

641
00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.920
And it's already been enacted in the and jazz groups slash stones,

642
00:40:04.841 --> 00:40:08.410
bands, multi-racial. The comedies,

643
00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:11.710
the studying of the calm is that you all have, you sit down with comics,

644
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.690
y'all talk about the genius across race and gene, junior,

645
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.050
gene and gender as if it's a natural thing that already shatters the white

646
00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:24.730
supremacists and the nets in male supremacists categories, whiteness, blackness,

647
00:40:24.731 --> 00:40:29.010
all in different silos. But it's so hard to do it on the ground. See,

648
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.630
part of the problem of talking about race in American as well.

649
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:36.550
I've been very critical of a number of contemporary black intellectuals because

650
00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.250
white supremacy cuts so deep in the culture,

651
00:40:39.251 --> 00:40:44.230
people begin to think it has magical powers and somehow it just floats above

652
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:48.130
American history as if it's just part of our DNA and not biological way.

653
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:53.580
But all conceptions of race in the modern world are grounded in predatory

654
00:40:54.791 --> 00:40:59.791
capitalism so that the talk about whiteness and blackness becomes a way of

655
00:41:02.291 --> 00:41:07.291
rationalizing social structures like slavery and Jim Crow.

656
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.900
And it has to do with trying to extract labor resources.

657
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.150
It's an attack on their humanity and identity,

658
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:18.790
but it's tied to economic structure.

659
00:41:18.791 --> 00:41:23.791
So to talk only about race means we hide and conceal the social structures that

660
00:41:25.151 --> 00:41:28.990
are generating unbelievable suffering for everybody.

661
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:34.010
Everybody you see. And so the last thing

662
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.490
<v 2>you want is talk about race. I'd say the same thing about gender. In a way,</v>

663
00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:41.990
gender is much more complicated because gender has been around for so, so long.

664
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.910
Every culture that we know almost,

665
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:49.010
but in modern conceptions of race are tied to modern conceptions of predatory

666
00:41:49.011 --> 00:41:53.060
capitalism here and abroad, which includes imperialism between clues.

667
00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:56.960
Empires such as the United States comes out of the British empire.

668
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.240
We engage in a heroic,

669
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:03.110
courageous revolt against the British empire.

670
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.120
It was a magnificent struggle.

671
00:42:05.121 --> 00:42:08.390
That's what I like about George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.

672
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.200
Cause I'm an anti-imperialist. They were anti-imperialist. They urban gorillas,

673
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.840
they picking up guns. They fight. I don't go that far,

674
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.840
but they're also white supremacists. You see,

675
00:42:17.841 --> 00:42:21.890
so as soon as they overthrow or push back the British empire,

676
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.840
what do you get in the declaration of independence?

677
00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:27.710
Beautiful words about equality, but you also get savages.

678
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.570
We got to take their land and you get an empire of liberty.

679
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.130
This is the where the comics come in.

680
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:37.610
What does an empire of liberty looked like?

681
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:43.130
Who's not in on the liberty is a whole lot of people not in on it.

682
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.220
<v 3>Carlin, right? Carlin had this bit about,</v>

683
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:49.540
this country was founded by slave owners who wanted to be free. That's right.

684
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.250
And Doug, but the American dream, you got to be, yeah,

685
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:56.180
you got to be dreaming to believe it. Can you sleep?

686
00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:02.030
Do you think that much like this country is an experiment and self democracy,

687
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:05.120
a very recent experiment when you look at human history, right? Absolutely.

688
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.130
Hundreds of thousands of years that we've been human.

689
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.520
There's really only been a couple of years, a hundred years of this.

690
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.690
Do you think that that's maybe the lens that we should look at something like

691
00:43:14.691 --> 00:43:18.470
democratic socialism through, not that it can't work,

692
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:21.050
but that it hasn't been implemented correctly before.

693
00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.170
<v 2>That's exactly right. That's why we've got to get beyond the ISM.</v>

694
00:43:23.171 --> 00:43:26.090
You're absolutely right. See what makes, uh,

695
00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:29.860
not just United States has been democratic experiments all around the world and

696
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.060
various circumstances.

697
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:36.240
We become central stage because we become a world power that understands itself

698
00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.470
as a democracy with all the contradictions that go ahead and an end with that

699
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:45.490
began as a settler. Colonial enterprise steel got slavery.

700
00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:50.640
Patriarchy workers don't have the right to engage in collective bargaining.

701
00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:56.460
United States until the 1930s Argentina had it in the 1830 Darden.

702
00:43:56.481 --> 00:44:00.190
The teen is not known to being on the cutting edge for social justice love.

703
00:44:00.191 --> 00:44:02.710
You're down there in Argentina, but they know that.

704
00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:04.540
But they had collective bargaining. Why?

705
00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:09.340
Because our Robert Barron's and our power elites was so powerful.

706
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:13.540
You See Rockefeller and company had private militias that were bigger than a lot

707
00:44:13.541 --> 00:44:18.541
of public armies to make sure workers were not able to engage in collective

708
00:44:18.551 --> 00:44:22.360
bargain. I was in San Francisco just yesterday at the Commonwealth Club,

709
00:44:22.361 --> 00:44:25.720
which is now lodged the Longshoreman's association,

710
00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.840
which is fascinated Commonwealth as well to do ruling class Harry Bridges,

711
00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:32.550
Longshoreman,

712
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:36.360
<v 1>Strong Union, Jack London and other great socialists there in Oakland. Right,</v>

713
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:38.680
and what are they trying to do there?

714
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.620
We're just trying to ensure that ordinary people gang assets to jobs with a

715
00:44:43.621 --> 00:44:44.520
living wage.

716
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:48.960
DCE and education is the one reason why I spend so much time with my dear

717
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:50.160
brother Bernie Sanders, right?

718
00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:55.310
Because it's a democratic project that simply say is how come poor children

719
00:44:56.281 --> 00:44:59.940
can't have assets to some of the things that the children have the wealth to do

720
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:03.540
have. They have the same value. And of course there was a Christian for me,

721
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:08.670
they have exactly the same value. So how will they get it? Well,

722
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:13.620
here comes socialist movements that say first they didn't want to do is we're

723
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:18.090
against child labor laws. That's, that's the jungle. That's up to Saint Claire.

724
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:21.030
He's a socialist. Tried to be governor of California. Right?

725
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:24.750
And what were they doing? What were these capitalists doing?

726
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.170
They're hiding these kids at six years old, seven years old,

727
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:33.560
they were dying at 30 there were no laws against child labor and working seven

728
00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:37.680
days a week. So the labor movement brought us the weekend.

729
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:41.730
And I'm not talking about the singer from Canada, God bless him.

730
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.640
I'm talking about the two days we have off.

731
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:48.660
Because if we didn't have that from the socialist moving in, the labor movement,

732
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:53.400
they had been working young kids seven days. They did that year after year,

733
00:45:53.401 --> 00:45:57.600
decade after decade. That's greed, right? And that's, that's greed.

734
00:45:57.601 --> 00:45:59.300
There's no accountabilities z.

735
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:04.460
That's where that whole idea of the let the market decide falls apart because

736
00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:06.820
the market just wants profit. Right? Absolutely.

737
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:11.370
And that doesn't mean that markets can not be used in democratic ways,

738
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:13.830
but they need to be ethical, but they got to be ethical.

739
00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:18.930
You got to have some accountability and regulation of child labor laws were very

740
00:46:18.991 --> 00:46:22.650
important that of a breakthroughs at that time of there other you had,

741
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:26.910
you need to have laws to make sure that the water was clean and the food was

742
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:32.240
regulated and clean and so there's a narrative that you get from poor people

743
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:37.260
often or people that are lower middle class that are against the concept of

744
00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:40.920
socialism because they equate it with people that want a free ride, that trade.

745
00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:45.100
They acquainted with people that don't want to work hard. That trend. That's a,

746
00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.930
it's a strange narrative when you consider all the things that we talked about

747
00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:49.291
already,

748
00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:53.880
like the what we need with the fire department and the police department and all

749
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:58.590
the different ways that socialism does form utilities and all the different ways

750
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.880
that socialism does form that part of our culture and our community.

751
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:05.920
Why do you think that that is this narrative and how,

752
00:47:05.921 --> 00:47:10.170
how does that narrative get reshaped? Because that narrative of that,

753
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:13.140
the only reason why people want socialism is because they want a free ride.

754
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.420
Right? Right. Oh, that's a wonderful question.

755
00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.450
But the one is that you had,

756
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.600
first we have to listen very closely to a right wing brothers and sisters and

757
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:29.870
conservatives and Midler's because often times they're

758
00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.830
<v 2>human means like anybody else. And they've had their own arguments.</v>

759
00:47:32.831 --> 00:47:35.410
I don't think they have strong ones, but they have their own arguments.

760
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:40.800
So the first thing you'd say about that is what makes you think that the well to

761
00:47:41.111 --> 00:47:43.390
do don't have free rides?

762
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:48.580
What is inheriting wealth all about? Oh,

763
00:47:48.581 --> 00:47:53.080
inheriting wealth is free wraps a little is all it is. What is freak?

764
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.210
The connections.

765
00:47:54.211 --> 00:47:58.600
So getting into the prep schools and the Ivy League schools and so forth,

766
00:47:58.601 --> 00:48:00.940
even though they work, it's still a kind of free ride.

767
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.890
So if they're preoccupied with this issue of being free ride, we tell them,

768
00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:11.580
let's make sure that people do work hard and sacrifice and therefore in some way

769
00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:17.560
deserve what they have. Now, if just based on that principle,

770
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:23.430
the upper echelons of American society would be indicted,

771
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:27.310
deeply indicted. And it's not a matter of hating the rich cause.

772
00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:32.230
I don't believe in hating anybody individually. I hate greed. I hate injustice.

773
00:48:32.231 --> 00:48:35.230
I hate white supremacy. I hate anti-Jewish, prejudice.

774
00:48:35.231 --> 00:48:38.590
I hate anti Palestinian prejudice. I hate patriarchy and so forth.

775
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.120
But the human beings,

776
00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:44.410
what these ideologies filter through are still human beings.

777
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.770
You see what I mean? So that's the beginning of it. Now, of course,

778
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:52.000
part of the question here is has to do with a, they'll say, well,

779
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.960
we wasted this money on the pool war. You said, well, wait a minute.

780
00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:01.920
Donald Trump just passed a $750 billion military budget.

781
00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:07.660
Democrats voted for it too. How much waste is in the military?

782
00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:13.380
Why is 60 cent of every $1 coming out of the federal bullet budget tied to the

783
00:49:14.321 --> 00:49:15.154
military?

784
00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:20.170
Why is it no close oversight and accountability of it?

785
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:25.420
How come American people don't know about the four countries that we're bombing

786
00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:29.620
or assisting other countries in bombing? And we can go right down Pakistan,

787
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:34.870
Afghanistan, Yam and absolutely Mali,

788
00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:39.080
Nigeria, Somalia, Iraq.

789
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.080
I mean you can go on and on and on. Right?

790
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:46.330
How can we don't know about the 4,800 military units? 587 around the world.

791
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:50.200
We've got US special operations in 128 countries.

792
00:49:50.201 --> 00:49:54.850
Only under 97 in the world. Right. What about the soldiers who die?

793
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.540
Hardly any talk about it. What about the innocent people?

794
00:49:58.541 --> 00:50:01.690
We kill hardly any talk about it.

795
00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:07.140
What about the drones that we still dropping and not always on military

796
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:08.380
combatant,

797
00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:13.380
but in the sent people to h o sometimes even disproportionately.

798
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.620
Those are precious people too.

799
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:22.600
It may have the same value as anybody in Ethiopia, America,

800
00:50:22.601 --> 00:50:24.190
Chicago. Feel the don'ts.

801
00:50:24.191 --> 00:50:27.740
Drones are particularly insidious because it doesn't even seem like it's really

802
00:50:27.741 --> 00:50:28.250
happening

803
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:32.480
<v 3>because it's a robot doing it. Absolutely. It's done. Lonely distance,</v>

804
00:50:32.481 --> 00:50:36.380
remote lead, no human sensitivity at all.

805
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.550
Apparently the PTSD that suffered by those remote drone operators is pretty

806
00:50:40.551 --> 00:50:44.120
profound too. You could understand that. Yes, deeply

807
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.710
<v 5>and yet no serious public conversation about it. In [inaudible] day.</v>

808
00:50:48.711 --> 00:50:53.290
I was on the plane the other day and uh, the pilot says, ah,

809
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:57.830
I hope you all are able to take a few minutes of your time because we've got a

810
00:50:57.831 --> 00:51:02.270
family outside waiting for the body of someone just killed in Afghanistan and

811
00:51:02.271 --> 00:51:04.010
Italian family in Chicago.

812
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.340
One of the saddest things you want to see in your life, man,

813
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:11.990
as a family lined up and they bring in the body out and you say to yourself,

814
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:17.830
how come there's no public spotlight on that?

815
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:24.170
And you see what I was growing up in the 60s, Walter Cronkite and Vietnam,

816
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:25.820
we saw the bodies,

817
00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:27.880
<v 3>well during the Bush administration,</v>

818
00:51:27.881 --> 00:51:32.860
they made it illegal to take photographs of flag draped coffins.

819
00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.230
It's exactly, which is unbelievably insane.

820
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:39.510
<v 5>That's exactly right. And continued under Obama and company, you know,</v>

821
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:43.910
and you say, well, wait a minute, a day. Their pen is ultimate cost.

822
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:49.520
And the, uh, the change, the narrative and the tears of the, the families.

823
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:54.010
And he can't even put a public spotlight on it. God.

824
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:57.030
And then of course they lie to us as well.

825
00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.800
Our drones are not in any way killing civilians and they end up killing an

826
00:52:00.801 --> 00:52:04.430
American and they have a press conference that same day in economic

827
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:08.210
compensation, the family, the rest of their life. I agree with that,

828
00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:12.620
but what about the drones that are killing folk in Yemen and Somalia and

829
00:52:12.621 --> 00:52:15.050
Pakistan and Afghanistan? Oh,

830
00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:18.740
they denied or even killing them and you say, quit lying.

831
00:52:18.741 --> 00:52:23.450
That's John Brennan and company using both Bush and Obama administration.

832
00:52:23.451 --> 00:52:26.000
You see, how do we keep track of those in the name of what?

833
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:30.140
Democratic accountability. That's not socialism.

834
00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:33.500
Socialism is democratic accountability,

835
00:52:33.501 --> 00:52:36.620
but there's been socialism without democratic accountability and what do you

836
00:52:36.621 --> 00:52:39.260
get? Tyranny. That's Soviet Union and company,

837
00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:44.150
but when you get capitalism with no democratic accountability, what do you get?

838
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:49.480
You get a predatory capitalism with gross wealth inequality and everyday people,

839
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:54.200
the masses of poor and working people fighting for crumbs

840
00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:57.900
<v 3>and there's also this denial of it amongst the most patriotic,</v>

841
00:52:57.930 --> 00:52:59.220
they don't want to consider it.

842
00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:03.630
They don't want to factor it in to what we think of when we think of America.

843
00:53:03.631 --> 00:53:06.990
The great you don't you want, you don't want to factor in those innocent people,

844
00:53:06.991 --> 00:53:10.830
which I, what was the last time we checked? It was in the 90% right.

845
00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:13.980
Of people that are, that are killed by drones are actually innocent.

846
00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.250
It's some insane number,

847
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:20.960
<v 5>but we have to have voices. That's part of the problem though.</v>

848
00:53:20.961 --> 00:53:23.330
You have to have voices that say,

849
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.490
I don't give a damn for popularity.

850
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:29.190
I'm trying to be wedded to integrity.

851
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:34.430
I want to put a smile on my grandmama's face in the grave and she told me as a

852
00:53:34.921 --> 00:53:38.700
Christian that if the Kingdom of God is within you,

853
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.990
then everywhere you go,

854
00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:44.991
you ought to leave a little heaven behind and heaven takes the form of laying

855
00:53:45.751 --> 00:53:48.480
bare the humanity of each and every one of us,

856
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.320
especially the least of these as the 25th chapter of Matthew, right.

857
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:56.610
What you do to the least of these you do unto me, who are the least of these?

858
00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:01.410
The orphan, the widow, the poor, the children, the elderly,

859
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:06.190
the workers, the gays and lesbians. The trans, especially the Trans these days,

860
00:54:06.191 --> 00:54:09.600
they just trashed like, I don't know what, but the black folk,

861
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.610
they're brown folk, they're white, poor,

862
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:17.880
they're indigenous peoples, not just here but around the world.

863
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:22.330
And what does that mean? That means that you have a, um,

864
00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:28.290
a certain kind of calling that will always pit you over against those who are

865
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:33.010
well adjusted to injustice, no matter what color they are.

866
00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:38.370
Well adjusted to injustice as just very, very beautiful way of putting it.

867
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.420
No, it's, that's, that's part of the suit part. Part of the problem,

868
00:54:42.421 --> 00:54:47.310
the American dream. It doesn't go far enough. The American American dream says,

869
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:52.710
I'm gonna work hard sacrifice and get mine and live large and some vanilla

870
00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:57.270
suburb, maybe with a trophy spouse. I feel good about my shot.

871
00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.920
You say nothing wrong with wanting to gain access to resources.

872
00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:05.130
Nothing wrong with working hard and nothing wrong with living where you want to

873
00:55:05.131 --> 00:55:09.240
live. But then the question becomes, now you're successful but you're not great.

874
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:14.970
Greatness has to do what he or she who uses their success for something bigger

875
00:55:14.971 --> 00:55:17.280
than them, service to others.

876
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.570
Service to the least of these so that the great ones like the Richard Pryor's,

877
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:27.230
you see not a matter of how much money he may as a matter of his soul in his

878
00:55:27.601 --> 00:55:31.860
comedy and the love that he left in his legacy,

879
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:37.100
Martin Luther King Jr died basically a broke man gave every penny that he won

880
00:55:38.821 --> 00:55:41.380
from the Nobel prize to the movement. Malcolm x,

881
00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:43.230
the only one that had $150 in his pocket.

882
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:48.380
Who cares about the richest black person in 1968 and 1965 that's ephemeral.

883
00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:52.890
We talked about deep joy, deep love.

884
00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:58.010
We will remember those who raised their voices and said in the name of something

885
00:55:58.771 --> 00:56:02.460
bigger than my ego, when my narcissism and my hedonism and we all have it.

886
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:06.170
We all have. So you know, we have to always be self critical in that regard.

887
00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:06.961
We all fall short.

888
00:56:06.961 --> 00:56:09.990
You know the Great Samuel Beckett and I'm a great now the great comic writer.

889
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:15.270
Try again. Fail again, fail better. That's the story of our life. Try again.

890
00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:18.390
Fail again, fail better. But even in failing better,

891
00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:23.260
we can at least raise our voices and try to connect the two movements and

892
00:56:23.261 --> 00:56:27.280
organizations and structures and thank God we still do have a,

893
00:56:27.281 --> 00:56:32.281
a a significant number of decent people in the American impart it.

894
00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:34.090
Just feel powerless.

895
00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.770
<v 3>Well, there's this conversation that's happening now, right,</v>

896
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:42.190
and this is a conversation that's based on the information of recognizing the

897
00:56:42.441 --> 00:56:46.460
fact that so many people have wasted deep aspects of their lives, long,

898
00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:51.520
long lives pursuing meaningless things and and recognizing that there is a lot

899
00:56:52.611 --> 00:56:55.160
of injustice in this world and that people are,

900
00:56:55.161 --> 00:56:59.060
are afraid of admitting that injustice because then they would somehow or

901
00:56:59.061 --> 00:57:02.240
another be complicit in the enactment of that injustice.

902
00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.150
I think that's one of the things that people are terrified of.

903
00:57:05.151 --> 00:57:10.151
When you talk about doing something to reinvigorate poor and disenfranchised

904
00:57:10.821 --> 00:57:15.460
communities, they start talking about the welfare state or what it's,

905
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:18.470
this is not how things should be done and people need to pull themselves up by

906
00:57:18.471 --> 00:57:21.560
their bootstraps not recognizing that everybody isn't starting at the same

907
00:57:21.561 --> 00:57:23.000
starting line. Absolutely.

908
00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:26.540
There's a concept that I've been talking about that if you really cared about

909
00:57:26.541 --> 00:57:30.170
America, you would want less losers. Like what was the best way?

910
00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.070
What's the best way to love America? What would you want more winners?

911
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:35.690
You'd want everybody to be a winner.

912
00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:39.650
Like if we have these disenfranchised parts of this country that have been that

913
00:57:39.651 --> 00:57:40.484
way forever.

914
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:43.640
There's a guy that's been on this podcast who was a police officer in Baltimore

915
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:47.270
standards, Michael Wood. And uh, he, uh,

916
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:49.070
talked about how when he was a police officer,

917
00:57:49.071 --> 00:57:53.360
he recognized the systemic racism and how, how crippling it was.

918
00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.720
And one of the things that he recognized was they found a piece of paper that

919
00:57:56.721 --> 00:57:59.150
was a blotter report of all the different,

920
00:57:59.151 --> 00:58:02.560
various crimes that were committed from the 1970s. It was a, a,

921
00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:03.950
some year in 1970.

922
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:08.960
It was the exact same crimes in the exact same communities that he was dealing

923
00:58:08.961 --> 00:58:13.490
with them. And he was generation after just recognizing the red lining,

924
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.370
about the fact that there was areas where black people were not allowed to buy

925
00:58:16.371 --> 00:58:18.470
homes, that they kept them in these communities,

926
00:58:18.471 --> 00:58:22.310
the same crimes kept occurring in the same places and all they were doing was

927
00:58:22.311 --> 00:58:25.580
going in there and arresting people and nothing changed and nothing was fixed.

928
00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.410
And as a police officer,

929
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:32.440
he was realizing and just becoming aware of the fact that this is,

930
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:36.260
he's a part of this system. He didn't want to be a part of the system anymore,

931
00:58:36.261 --> 00:58:39.950
but he was a part of this system that is creating this problem.

932
00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.560
When you address that though,

933
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:46.340
the people that don't suffer in those communities that aren't a part of that

934
00:58:46.341 --> 00:58:50.300
community, there's a natural inclination to resist. Oh, that's true.

935
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:53.060
And it's because they don't want to do anything. They don't,

936
00:58:53.061 --> 00:58:54.890
they don't want to think they're responsible.

937
00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:57.170
They don't want to think they're a part of it. They don't want to discuss it.

938
00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:59.490
Even discussing it. You feel resistance.

939
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.850
<v 5>They will in the state of denial, yes. Trying to avoid and trying to evade. No,</v>

940
00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:08.450
it's, it's very, that's very real. That's very real. But you know,

941
00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:10.540
it also works, uh,

942
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:14.910
within communities of people of color. And this is again,

943
00:59:14.911 --> 00:59:19.911
why I think we have to resist any monolithic care or homogeneous

944
00:59:20.491 --> 00:59:21.800
characterizations. People

945
00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:24.880
<v 2>B see so that anytime you talk about white supremacy,</v>

946
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:28.490
you've got the John Brown and you know Mary Ellen pleasant,

947
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:33.610
who was the a black woman who was worth $347 million in the 1840s.

948
00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:38.780
Whoa. She's called the mother of human rights in California. She do.

949
00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.880
She made a rich white brother and he died on her.

950
00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:47.570
So she ended up with man's of dolls. Worst thing she did,

951
00:59:47.571 --> 00:59:50.060
she gave John Brown $1 million. Wow.

952
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:55.690
John Brown had even noticed from her in his pocket when he was at Harper's

953
00:59:56.151 --> 01:00:00.620
ferry. That's how he survive. You see now, John Brown was killing some people.

954
01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:03.290
I think that's wrong. I don't believe in innocent people no matter who they are,

955
01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:05.300
no matter what color. But at the same time,

956
01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:07.160
John Brown had a love of black people,

957
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:09.740
much deeper than many black people have with themselves because he's willing to

958
01:00:09.741 --> 01:00:13.790
die for black people. But the same is true within, let's say, black communities.

959
01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:18.140
You've got, okay, 1% of the population in America alone, 41% of the wealth.

960
01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:22.040
You've got three individuals who have wealth equivalent to 160 million fellow

961
01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:25.130
citizens. But within the black community,

962
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.880
the top 1% of black folk have what was 70% of the well.

963
01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.460
So that means you got a lot of pressures Jamal's and Latitia is out there who

964
01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:34.910
don't are,

965
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:39.910
who are told to live vicariously through the lives of black celebrities.

966
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:46.480
So it's all about representation rather than substantive transformation.

967
01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.750
You get that in politicians, you know, you got a black president,

968
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:55.640
all y'all must be free. Isn't that a beautiful thing? Live through him,

969
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.140
live through the family, beautiful achievement, magnificent achievement.

970
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.020
But it's not about symbolic representation only.

971
01:01:03.021 --> 01:01:07.550
This is about fundamental transformation. So it's a challenge. Mary Ellen,

972
01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:11.300
pleasant and others and Martin King and others up challenges.

973
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:16.450
For those of us who do have some resources to still raise our voices because you

974
01:01:17.421 --> 01:01:22.421
can be black highly well adjusted to injustice economically in terms of race and

975
01:01:24.741 --> 01:01:28.700
so forth. And the same is true. You can be Brown, you can be real.

976
01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:33.850
So it's not just a matter of looking for that one individual who represents,

977
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:39.700
it's a matter of connecting that representation to fundamental transformation.

978
01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:41.750
If there's no fundamental transformation,

979
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.220
you end up with a whole generation of peacocks. Look at me, look at me,

980
01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:49.460
look at me all about for legend. What does that do?

981
01:01:49.461 --> 01:01:53.480
That falls directly into the culture of superficial spectacle.

982
01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:59.420
Wasting we need is just spectacle with no substance in that way.

983
01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.700
And this is a battle within a,

984
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:05.900
within the communities of peoples of color because it's not,

985
01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.100
it's not going to be a matter of just pointing out why supremacy because white

986
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:14.930
supremacy is fundamental foundation and part of the country is not the only

987
01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:19.830
foundation cause you got resistance to white supremacy. Yeah.

988
01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.330
Lydia Maria Child,

989
01:02:21.331 --> 01:02:26.331
she wrote a book in 1834 call an appeal for that class of Americans called

990
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:30.720
Africans who was deeply influenced by one of the greatest works ever written at

991
01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:34.710
that time by David Walker appealed to colored citizens of the world.

992
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:36.090
She's a white sister.

993
01:02:36.091 --> 01:02:41.091
She is as vanilla as Doris Day and the 1830s fundamental part of the black

994
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:45.030
freedom movement. Right?

995
01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:49.110
We see those folk need to be lifted up because what does that do?

996
01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:54.410
That exposes our humanity in terms of the choices we make,

997
01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.110
not just the skin color we have,

998
01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:00.720
and I would say the same thing in terms of gender.

999
01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:05.280
The brothers who are fundamentally concerned about breaking the back of

1000
01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:06.114
patriarchy,

1001
01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:10.980
even we know patriarch is shot through us because we grew up in the 1950s and

1002
01:03:10.981 --> 01:03:15.060
sixties no man escapes it, but you try to reconquer it all in the same as true.

1003
01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:17.400
Where are precious gays and lesbians and Trans Folk?

1004
01:03:17.401 --> 01:03:22.050
You see the to be decent human beings who make moral choices. He,

1005
01:03:22.051 --> 01:03:26.100
I believe in the primacy of the moral and the spiritual,

1006
01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:30.180
the centrality of the artistic, especially the musical.

1007
01:03:30.181 --> 01:03:35.181
And especially the comics as the Vanguard's who represent a freedom and a

1008
01:03:35.971 --> 01:03:40.971
courage and a vision to connect us as human beings because you can't really be a

1009
01:03:42.211 --> 01:03:45.540
comic with a wholesale Nazi ideology.

1010
01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.020
Now you can be a Nazi genius like Martin Heidegger,

1011
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:53.190
who was a great philosopher and a genius and a thug when it come to pop when it

1012
01:03:53.191 --> 01:03:54.480
comes to politics. You see,

1013
01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.430
but a comic has got to be able to be open enough to deal with the incongruity

1014
01:03:59.431 --> 01:04:04.110
and inconsistency and the sheer absurdity of it all

1015
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.370
<v 3>about moments of freedom earlier.</v>

1016
01:04:06.371 --> 01:04:09.670
And I recognize that as like one of the greatest things you ever see when

1017
01:04:09.671 --> 01:04:14.440
someone's on stage and they're killing those moments where everyone's together,

1018
01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.260
they're all together, locked up in the laughter,

1019
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:18.490
and they're all to get that there.

1020
01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:21.940
This a sense of community that you share with the people that are in the room.

1021
01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:24.100
Perhaps it does bring people together,

1022
01:04:24.101 --> 01:04:26.500
even if it's for brief moments for a few seconds,

1023
01:04:26.501 --> 01:04:31.030
or what songs it takes are not to be trashed.

1024
01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:35.380
Life consist of moments. Yes. You know what I mean? Yes,

1025
01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:36.520
definitely.

1026
01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:40.060
<v 2>And See, it's in a democracy. You see,</v>

1027
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:45.150
it's those moments that constitute the memory of what could be as opposed to

1028
01:04:48.491 --> 01:04:52.150
what's in place. You know, the Great August Wilson though, the great playwright,

1029
01:04:52.151 --> 01:04:54.730
black playwright, deeply influence, he said by

1030
01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.280
the Blues Berakah and beard and Roman beard and a great painter.

1031
01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:02.770
But my Mary Barack, of course from Newark like yourself,

1032
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:05.770
there's like Sarah Vaughan and Phillip Ralf by different newer,

1033
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:08.440
he used to say that performance

1034
01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:15.360
authorizes alternative realities for the audience that gets them to unsettle

1035
01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:20.320
their perceptions of the world. Whoa.

1036
01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:24.080
And that's what great artists and great comic, but deaths with debts with Jews.

1037
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:26.590
Yeah. That's your do strange times though, bro, that,

1038
01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.640
that you bring in the fact that we're living in such a grim moment,

1039
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:31.520
what I'd call, you know,

1040
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:36.040
an American empire in decline and we all need to call for his regeneration is

1041
01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:38.620
democratic revitalization and regeneration.

1042
01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:42.010
But how do we do that only by example, man,

1043
01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.820
because there's a difference between the, what the Great Roberto Hunger Calls,

1044
01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:49.420
um, by a graphical time and historical time.

1045
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:52.960
All of us are born in circumstances, not of our own choosing.

1046
01:05:52.961 --> 01:05:57.490
We're only here for so long. We all have insecurities, anxieties, and fears.

1047
01:05:57.491 --> 01:06:01.090
Knowing that our bodies will undergo extinction one day very soon.

1048
01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:05.830
And therefore to deal with those insecurities and fears and anxieties,

1049
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.360
you have to have certain structures of feeling and value that give you some

1050
01:06:10.361 --> 01:06:14.380
sense of worthwhileness as you've moved through time from mother's womb to tomb.

1051
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.393
Right?

1052
01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:20.460
And it's only in biographical tag cause we only got one life decided to Jordan

1053
01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:24.580
and there's no person who was a messiah. Nowadays,

1054
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.190
people will tell you they are, but you say, okay, just go with it.

1055
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.620
Be Self deceived and drink your cognac and keep moving because there is no

1056
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:35.110
messiah is out there. There's no saviors out there.

1057
01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:39.370
There's no messiahs and groups. There's no messiahs and collectivities.

1058
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:43.570
There's only lives to be live. We back to check off again,

1059
01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.820
lives to be lived,

1060
01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:50.110
acknowledging things were in place before we arrived.

1061
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:55.230
So therefore we ought to have gratitude for the love that we received.

1062
01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:02.140
That's how I begin my my whole life. I am who I am because somebody loved me,

1063
01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:06.430
his mom, his dad. That's my brothers and my sisters,

1064
01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.850
my friends, right? And I don't deserve it.

1065
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.700
And I have to somehow following Ashford wins, Ashford and Simpson, and they say,

1066
01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:19.540
send it like a puff of smoke. You got to let it go. Spread whatever.

1067
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.940
Love, justice by example.

1068
01:07:21.941 --> 01:07:26.520
Examples are the gold card of Justin. That's a wonderful line. In consequence,

1069
01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:30.700
[inaudible] pure reason. Examples are the gold card of judgment.

1070
01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:35.940
The judgments we make a predicated on the examples that we have,

1071
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.220
and we must have examples of greatness.

1072
01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:42.280
If you're gonna be a classical composer,

1073
01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.030
you better studied some loot v Beethoven.

1074
01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:49.600
You're going to be a serious artist of musical theater.

1075
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:54.990
You better study a genius who's still alive named Stephen Sondheim from west

1076
01:07:55.751 --> 01:07:56.561
side story,

1077
01:07:56.561 --> 01:08:01.561
the company to Sunday in the park with George to passion Sweeney Todd across the

1078
01:08:02.231 --> 01:08:06.960
board. Not to imitate, but just to know what greatness is in your genre view.

1079
01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:07.873
In hip hop.

1080
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:13.000
You better study some rock him who you better study some followed the leader who

1081
01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:16.120
loves put Tupac, Dad's ride. You studied the folk

1082
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.430
<v 5>with grades the same way. You know, you study prior and Bruce,</v>

1083
01:08:19.431 --> 01:08:22.670
Lenny Bruce and the others, and Roseanne Barr and the others.

1084
01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:24.770
But that's one of the more important parts of being a person, right,

1085
01:08:24.771 --> 01:08:29.300
is to really your diet of what you take in,

1086
01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:34.160
in terms of whatever, whether it's your art or whether it's your education,

1087
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:39.590
try to take in the best and most inspirational and the most spectacular versions

1088
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:42.410
of human human endeavors. Absolute. See,

1089
01:08:42.411 --> 01:08:47.330
that's one of the reasons why sports is a kind of American religion. Sure.

1090
01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.110
Because in sports or whatever,

1091
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:54.410
I know that you got the the taekwondo thing. Yeah. Yeah.

1092
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:58.910
And you understand the role of excellence with the Greek Scott or Tafe take that

1093
01:08:59.270 --> 01:08:59.660
place,

1094
01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:04.660
but to be able just to turn on our television and see by the Lebron James did

1095
01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:07.123
his thing.

1096
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:13.130
That's another context that cuts across race, class, gender,

1097
01:09:13.131 --> 01:09:15.920
and so forth. Let Broan how you do it.

1098
01:09:15.921 --> 01:09:20.300
Didn't memories of Mike Jordan and [inaudible] important.

1099
01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.260
I leave when he sat out those three years and then the late 1960s because he

1100
01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:27.050
wouldn't go to Vietnam. Courage. My mom, Muhammad Ali,

1101
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:28.910
along with Richard Pryor Richards,

1102
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:32.860
it was the freest Black Black Man of 20th century. Uh,

1103
01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:37.820
but see the boxing is so crucial as well as the, uh, the, uh,

1104
01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:40.310
the other sports because for black people,

1105
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:44.840
every other sphere in the society is unfair and unfree.

1106
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:48.770
But when you get in that ring and the referee is fair,

1107
01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:54.560
you finally get fair competition. That's what Jack Johnson was such a threat.

1108
01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:56.870
Remember when Jack Johnson knocking white brothers out,

1109
01:09:57.550 --> 01:10:00.710
there would be racial riots against black folk killing black folk all across the

1110
01:10:00.711 --> 01:10:01.280
country.

1111
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.390
Don't you get the idea that just because he beat the white man in a context of

1112
01:10:05.391 --> 01:10:07.720
fairness that you can beat anybody?

1113
01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:11.270
And that goes all the way to Mohammed Ali. It's very interesting.

1114
01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:15.140
And the time I spent with another genius named Prince who we'd missed so, so,

1115
01:10:15.141 --> 01:10:17.060
so very much this, nobody like him,

1116
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:21.890
but he like Miles Davis View Jack Johnson as his favorite black man.

1117
01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.720
And that interesting, well, he was a pioneer because there was none before him.

1118
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:31.530
Jack Johnson was Jack generally the first, Oh, by him, by himself in many ways.

1119
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:33.380
There was one I think, but not as famous,

1120
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:37.600
not as famous in terms of the spotlight. There was other great boxers that time,

1121
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:42.590
but he, but he just took it to heighten. Yeah, leave the country and so forth.

1122
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:45.680
See and what Muhammad Ali, you know,

1123
01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:50.860
you got someone who was just himself in the context of a social movement that

1124
01:10:53.841 --> 01:10:56.390
was taking place at the same time.

1125
01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.950
So he would associate himself with the black freedom movement called the civil

1126
01:11:00.951 --> 01:11:05.600
rights movement. He joined the nation of Islam under honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1127
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:10.040
They became then became very close to Malcolm x and had to deal with the split

1128
01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:13.890
in its own way and ultimately becomes, you know, a more Muslim.

1129
01:11:13.891 --> 01:11:18.891
But at the same time recognizes his political consciousness was tied to the

1130
01:11:19.111 --> 01:11:22.620
nation of Islam and so forth. And for him to do that,

1131
01:11:22.621 --> 01:11:25.470
I mean to be associated with the honorable Elijah Muhammad,

1132
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:31.430
the nation of Islam probably had about 0.1% approval in the country and probably

1133
01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:39.740
about four or 5% in the black community because at that time black folk and

1134
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:43.140
Black Christians were just afraid of the black Muslims.

1135
01:11:43.141 --> 01:11:45.960
But it was Malcolm x who in his,

1136
01:11:45.961 --> 01:11:50.961
all of his genius made it so broadly conceived that even Christians like myself,

1137
01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:55.590
I'm a f Jesus, love and free black man,

1138
01:11:55.591 --> 01:12:00.330
but I can't live my life without Malcolm c and he's Muslim to the core.

1139
01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:02.700
He's praying five times a day. You know what I mean?

1140
01:12:02.701 --> 01:12:05.070
That's just the beginning of it. And he's also very complicated too,

1141
01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:07.980
because his grandfather was white. Well, he had been first white.

1142
01:12:07.981 --> 01:12:12.030
His father was a Garveyite is his mother, was tied to the interracial,

1143
01:12:12.031 --> 01:12:14.580
but her father was [inaudible] who was killed. His mother, of course,

1144
01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:18.240
put in the US in the sane asylum. He's a foster child.

1145
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:21.510
The great stories he tells in the autobiography of Malcolm X,

1146
01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:22.890
one of the great classics. Really,

1147
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:25.740
I mean more than history of American civilization,

1148
01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:31.260
but very misunderstood in terms of the cultural narrative of who he was.

1149
01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:35.250
Absolutely. No, it's true. He used to say sincerity.

1150
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:39.600
It's my only credential. Ooh, isn't that powerful.

1151
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.520
Damn sincerity.

1152
01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:46.290
So when he said White Men and women are devils,

1153
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:51.180
and he believed it, now he's wrong. No white brothers, sisters, not Dells.

1154
01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.570
Then he says, I changed my mind. They're not devils.

1155
01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.950
They too many got devilish behavior. He dry.

1156
01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.350
Cause that's true too many of all of us have dealt his behavior.

1157
01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.170
But when he said the first thing he said what he meant, he meant what he said.

1158
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:09.930
When he said the second thing he said what he meant. He meant what you said.

1159
01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:15.060
How many folk do we have like that today that aren't scared to change their mind

1160
01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:19.610
and speak with deep enough soul ditches up? See,

1161
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:23.220
one of the great gifts of the artists,

1162
01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:26.460
and I speak about this especially in the black tradition,

1163
01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.810
is what we could call soulful Kenosis.

1164
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:34.080
K. E. N. O. S. I. S.

1165
01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.560
Now kenosis means self-giving self donating and self empty.

1166
01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.010
So if you go to a James Brown concert,

1167
01:13:44.011 --> 01:13:48.030
that brother goals for four and a half hours and gills,

1168
01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:53.100
every thing, every fiber of his be Yang. And at the end of every concert,

1169
01:13:53.101 --> 01:13:56.760
what does he say? I'm an extension of you. You're an extension of me.

1170
01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:58.410
I don't exist without you.

1171
01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:03.830
Did we fail to play a song that somebody came to hear and a sister holiday.

1172
01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:10.160
You didn't play soul power and he say hit it boots.

1173
01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:11.940
Say I got to play that song

1174
01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:17.800
<v 2>because he's serving. You see Al Green, you go to Al Green Concert.</v>

1175
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:21.820
That brother came walk after the cancer.

1176
01:14:21.821 --> 01:14:26.590
He's given everything from false settled at, tended to everything. Ultimately,

1177
01:14:26.591 --> 01:14:29.620
that's what happened with prince, right? I mean prince had such incredible,

1178
01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:34.180
his hair was hip jumping off piano. That's on jump off.

1179
01:14:34.181 --> 01:14:36.490
That's how we got hooked on pain pills. That's exactly,

1180
01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:37.960
and that's what killed him. Ultimately,

1181
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:43.900
John Cold train blowing his horn as if his neck is going to snap every night.

1182
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:47.590
Then he gave a concert in November,

1183
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:52.040
1967 66 right before he died in July 67 he drops the horn,

1184
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:56.620
start beating on his chest. Man, I shit at least say what's happening trade.

1185
01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:57.281
He said,

1186
01:14:57.281 --> 01:15:01.330
I'm just giving the people all of that Canon now my board getting in the way.

1187
01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.160
Oh Wow. You know what I mean?

1188
01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:05.590
But don't you feel that when you walk off the stage, man,

1189
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.080
when you walk off the stage of strange times, man,

1190
01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:13.440
you giving everything all that Joe is at that moment.

1191
01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:16.180
Now what is that you see?

1192
01:15:16.181 --> 01:15:21.181
That is the example of a love supreme that is there to serve the people.

1193
01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:25.240
Now you're going to make a living too. They're going to get paid,

1194
01:15:25.241 --> 01:15:28.000
you're going to get paid and so forth. But that's not the primary thing.

1195
01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:31.200
That's not it seem. Curtis Mayfield sings,

1196
01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:35.650
sings his songs that the radio won't play when he's told not to go to the

1197
01:15:35.651 --> 01:15:40.120
rallies and he shows up with his guitar anyway in plays we a winner.

1198
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.640
That's self giving, self emptying.

1199
01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:48.190
And I tell it to the young musicians these days,

1200
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:51.370
cause a lot of you know in the culture of spectacle nowadays, shoot,

1201
01:15:51.371 --> 01:15:52.540
you get these performers,

1202
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:56.260
they just show up and think they ought to get a standing ovation for 10 minutes.

1203
01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:59.230
Say No Negro sang a song first man, shit

1204
01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:02.410
ain't no spectacle. And Peacock,

1205
01:16:02.411 --> 01:16:05.730
we want you saying something that's going to stir all souls the way Sam Cook and

1206
01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:09.260
John and Taylor and Lou Rawls when the soul stirrers did. It's not,

1207
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:12.010
we respect that genius and so forth, so it'd be yawned.

1208
01:16:12.011 --> 01:16:14.470
Say it's fascinating this regard because she's a genius.

1209
01:16:14.471 --> 01:16:16.060
There's no doubt about it. She's,

1210
01:16:16.061 --> 01:16:18.790
I think she's the greatest entertainer of our day.

1211
01:16:18.791 --> 01:16:23.020
I've been very critical of her because there's a sense in which she's still tied

1212
01:16:23.021 --> 01:16:25.090
to the cultural, superficial spectacle,

1213
01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:28.870
jumped the way she looks and girls in formation and so forth.

1214
01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:33.430
But at the same time she was also grounded in the tradition and this new movie

1215
01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:37.780
that she made. You see that? No homecoming. Now I'm saying, Oh man,

1216
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:40.840
you got to see, that's one of the greatest performance of films ever made man.

1217
01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:42.100
When she goes,

1218
01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:47.100
she goes to Coachella and she shows her Coachella with all of the bands of black

1219
01:16:47.831 --> 01:16:52.831
colleges and performs all of her songs with all of them moving hundred and 5,200

1220
01:16:55.061 --> 01:16:59.530
of them. Wow. And then reflections and Nina Simone and a brief of Franklin.

1221
01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:03.700
I no, Beyonce. See I was wrong about Beyonce in a certain sense.

1222
01:17:03.701 --> 01:17:05.740
Now I'm telling you that sister,

1223
01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:09.950
she brings a tradition with her that the highest

1224
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.970
<v 5>level of both respect and of excellent.</v>

1225
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:18.000
Well maybe she changed who she is because of criticism like yours. Well,

1226
01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:21.820
you just saw, you have never met her, you know, so for sure to say it's,

1227
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:24.260
it really is hard to say. People hear things like that.

1228
01:17:24.261 --> 01:17:27.980
It does make them think that. I think that that could be the case. I mean,

1229
01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:30.810
she married to a genius for sure with Jay z too,

1230
01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:34.590
and of course the kids and her lovely parents and family and things.

1231
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:38.160
You never know what goes on in the mind and heart and soul level.

1232
01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.260
A great artists like Beyonce. When was it that led you to be critical?

1233
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:45.530
Initially? Oh, just because up. I'm very concerned by young folk.

1234
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:50.240
I've made three, three smoking word albums with prince singing with prince.

1235
01:17:50.241 --> 01:17:52.220
He was up, he would not sample any of 'em,

1236
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:55.370
allow any of his music to be sampled by hip hop artists.

1237
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:58.190
He was very hard on hip hop. But when we asked him for spoken word,

1238
01:17:58.191 --> 01:18:01.790
he said yes and thank God we did same as true for the greatest soul singers,

1239
01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:02.301
generation,

1240
01:18:02.301 --> 01:18:06.980
Gerald lavert who really deserves so much more attention a WHO's on the album

1241
01:18:06.981 --> 01:18:09.620
and so forth. So I spent a lot of time with young folk in studios,

1242
01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:12.700
just did a thing with tough pole and one of the great artists coming out of a

1243
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:16.680
Ferguson and American Empire on Black Julian to uh,

1244
01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:21.590
e 40 of 'em coming out of Layo. I have great respect for, uh,

1245
01:18:21.591 --> 01:18:25.460
I've been blessed to do a number of things with the young folk, but I tell them,

1246
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:30.320
I say, I'm old school Yo, you need to know that. See we into originals,

1247
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:31.370
not in the copies.

1248
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:37.330
You see that we into lifting every voice that's so full so that we stir souls.

1249
01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:39.230
We don't want to just titillate bodies.

1250
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:44.640
We don't want just stimulation of body edges. Now,

1251
01:18:44.650 --> 01:18:49.370
I'm not a puritan, so you know, I believe in body stimulation at the right time.

1252
01:18:49.371 --> 01:18:54.200
You know what I mean? They ain't got nothing against orgasm. But the thing is,

1253
01:18:54.201 --> 01:18:56.750
you know, you can't just orgiastic Lee moved to life.

1254
01:18:57.490 --> 01:18:59.670
You've got to have context. You got to have tradition,

1255
01:18:59.671 --> 01:19:04.040
you got to stir souls in that way and so I put a lot of pressure on him.

1256
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:07.840
One of the things that I bring a lot of critique the barriers. See,

1257
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:12.680
I am deeply shaped by the dramatics, the Delfonics,

1258
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:16.760
the main ingredients to whispers, lakeside,

1259
01:19:17.690 --> 01:19:21.320
James Brown's band, George Clinton, Bootsy, his band.

1260
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.640
I'm shaped by the emotions. I'm shaped by the Jones girls, the miracles,

1261
01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:27.560
the temptations, Marvelettes,

1262
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:32.590
all those were groups that expressed their soul full self emptying in a form of

1263
01:19:35.391 --> 01:19:39.050
sweetness. I believe in sweetness

1264
01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.970
and with losing that, I go to the young folk,

1265
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:47.240
where is your dramatics?

1266
01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.840
Why is it we don't have large numbers of groups that sing in tune with a beauty

1267
01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:57.110
and a sweetness and a gentleness and a kindness.

1268
01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:01.130
When you hit a voice of David, referencing ain't too proud to beg.

1269
01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:05.990
The vulnerability, the flexibility of it,

1270
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.040
the intensity of

1271
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.810
<v 2>it in it goes straight to,</v>

1272
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:14.460
so that's why the people keep listening to David reference from why not

1273
01:20:14.461 --> 01:20:15.294
Mississippi?

1274
01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:20.330
I would say the same with Ted meals of blue magic that I get the young folk just

1275
01:20:21.001 --> 01:20:24.540
to stop. Let's just listen to Ted meals at a blue magic.

1276
01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:29.580
Let's just listen to Russell Thompkins jr the stylistic, oh,

1277
01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:31.290
brother West, you just old school.

1278
01:20:31.291 --> 01:20:35.640
You just nostalgic now love sweetness, gentleness.

1279
01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:40.080
Never go. Hasta as my brother would put a clip, never go out of style.

1280
01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:44.970
Everybody needs sweetness, kindness, gentleness.

1281
01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:50.300
Black music used to be the fundamental conveyor of that sweetness.

1282
01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:55.350
So did the bean Crosby's, the Frank Sinatra's. These are great,

1283
01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:59.370
great geniuses themselves. You have frank, who are you inspired by?

1284
01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:04.580
Billy holiday. Oh, you talking about the genius from Baltimore City, Billy.

1285
01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.210
That's trap. You are Italian working class brother from Hoboken. That's right,

1286
01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:14.010
because I'm tied to excellence and sweetness. Now Franks is not true.

1287
01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:17.440
He is saying some sweet, gentle songs now. Yeah,

1288
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:21.090
but the younger generation these days, they've got John Hayman,

1289
01:21:21.091 --> 01:21:23.340
some mothers who can, who are beautiful, don't get me wrong,

1290
01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:25.230
but it's smaller and smaller,

1291
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:29.040
but it's partly a matter of the oligarchs in the recording industry.

1292
01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:31.860
[inaudible] boys, the men in a way,

1293
01:21:31.861 --> 01:21:36.861
as the last great group singing a performative act that connected to the

1294
01:21:39.781 --> 01:21:43.380
dramatics and Delfonics that I'm talking about. He said, well, what happens?

1295
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:46.410
While they think they could make more money with just one negro,

1296
01:21:46.411 --> 01:21:50.580
with a microphone run in their mouth, that you get a genius,

1297
01:21:50.581 --> 01:21:54.690
like Kanye deeply confused politically. We won't go into that.

1298
01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:59.880
All this Trump connection. We need some serious push in on that brother.

1299
01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:03.540
But they'd rather have an individual isolated,

1300
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:05.910
easier to control in the industry.

1301
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:11.300
And the same oligarchs run live performance radio and the music and the

1302
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920
products.

1303
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.550
You know how they've now undergone this fundamental transformation and industry,

1304
01:22:17.551 --> 01:22:21.780
especially given the new technology and social media. So I tell the young folk,

1305
01:22:21.781 --> 01:22:22.614
I say, you know,

1306
01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:28.700
I could not have grown up without the sweetness of those rhythm and blues

1307
01:22:30.301 --> 01:22:33.120
groups. Now I know the circumstances are different,

1308
01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:37.170
but where do you get your sweetness from musically?

1309
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:42.600
What will be the soundtrack of your freedom movement? Genius.

1310
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:47.300
It's like Kendrick Lamar providing some of the soundtracks.

1311
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:52.080
There's no doubt about that. And then there's others as well, but not enough.

1312
01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:57.980
Not enough soul stirring that it is. No. Curtis may feel nobody.

1313
01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:03.330
Nia refund, nobody near smoky, right connected to the peacocking.

1314
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:07.890
Oh Lord Jeff Social. Yes. Loot image. The combs,

1315
01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:12.490
tiny Instagram pushed buttons. The Bentley's, Oh,

1316
01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:17.190
we've got to be in front of the commodity and so forth and so on. Hey,

1317
01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:21.130
jewelry. I made feet up in the grass. He had his sharp cars.

1318
01:23:21.131 --> 01:23:26.110
But when that genius got into the studio with the same love TK, oh,

1319
01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:31.150
you don't give a damn what kind of car he got. I don't touch his soul.

1320
01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.760
You know what I mean? And it's not just on the black side. We've got, we,

1321
01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:37.600
you know, you got a vanilla blues,

1322
01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:42.120
men like Bruce Springsteen and the Jewish brothers genius up yelling from

1323
01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:44.050
Minnesota, Robert Zimmerman.

1324
01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:49.240
All of these folk were involved in the KENOSIS activity of self empty,

1325
01:23:49.241 --> 01:23:52.750
but they were deeply shaped by the sun houses,

1326
01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:55.600
the Robert Johnson muddy water.

1327
01:23:56.230 --> 01:23:59.140
The Morena is the best hit Smith, the blues tradition.

1328
01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:03.730
Do you know Gary Clark Jr Gary Clark, Jr. I've heard that name,

1329
01:24:03.731 --> 01:24:07.240
but I had missed that. I gotta check him out. You.

1330
01:24:07.241 --> 01:24:09.600
I need some education. My brother,

1331
01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:13.380
<v 3>he, he is one of those rare musicians where you hear,</v>

1332
01:24:14.130 --> 01:24:19.130
hear a riff and it's a Gary Clark Jr pull up that pull up that video of when he

1333
01:24:19.771 --> 01:24:23.220
played with my friend Susanne from honey honey, and he,

1334
01:24:23.221 --> 01:24:25.860
they did a midnight rider from the almond brothers,

1335
01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:30.690
but he did it as Gary Clark Jr. He's got a sound of his guitar.

1336
01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:34.620
It really reminds me of Hendricks in a way. It's very different than Hendricks,

1337
01:24:34.621 --> 01:24:38.850
but it reminds me in that it's so distinctively him. Oh, I got to hear this.

1338
01:24:38.970 --> 01:24:41.250
Yeah, he'll pull it up right now. Thank you so much.

1339
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:44.670
He's a brilliant guy and a great guy too, but he's a,

1340
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.730
he's just a unique, unique artists. Like,

1341
01:24:47.731 --> 01:24:51.350
I don't know anyone like him and his sound. It's,

1342
01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.750
it's one of those things where there's no,

1343
01:24:54.810 --> 01:24:59.400
there's no mistaking who's playing the music when you hear him. Oh,

1344
01:24:59.401 --> 01:25:01.920
just sit in the chair. Then when he's playing midnight rider,

1345
01:25:01.921 --> 01:25:06.270
which is a classic. So many pick classic song. Yeah. Put, put this up,

1346
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:11.900
<v 6>give it put up. This is, this is them up there. There's Gary.</v>

1347
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:16.820
Oh, here's Gary a guitar. This is me filming this. Is that right?

1348
01:25:16.821 --> 01:25:21.770
Yeah. It was in the crowd. They did this midnight on a Tuesday in downtown La.

1349
01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.210
How long ago was it year ago or so? Just recently? Yeah.

1350
01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:28.003
This motherfucker.

1351
01:25:29.890 --> 01:25:30.723
<v 7>Oh,</v>

1352
01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:33.000
<v 6>here's what</v>

1353
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.180
<v 7>my favorite artists per shot and hit that Robert Johnson and him already.</v>

1354
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:40.830
He's got everything in there. That's also buddy guy, buddy guy.

1355
01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:45.990
Once you hear more Gary Clark, you realize this is him. This is him. I hear you.

1356
01:25:56.530 --> 01:26:00.580
You could feel it in the air in that club. It was maybe, well in

1357
01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:04.130
<v 6>that club, Suzanne is reading the lyrics from her phone. She didn't even</v>

1358
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.130
<v 8>know the lyrics. They did this totally impromptu. It's bad on the spot.</v>

1359
01:26:07.131 --> 01:26:10.970
Totally on the spot. Totally on the spot. Unprepared. They talked about, I said,

1360
01:26:10.971 --> 01:26:13.790
let's do midnight rider. Okay, we'll go here. So they had, they weren't even,

1361
01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:17.750
they didn't rehearse this. They didn't at all. This is his takes off on it,

1362
01:26:17.751 --> 01:26:22.250
like just takes off on it. Just did his version of it. Austin, Texas. Oh,

1363
01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.170
here from Deli light. Then Hopkins. He's a complete motherfucker. Wow.

1364
01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:29.060
He's a bad motherfucker. Check him. He's,

1365
01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:32.780
he's one of those guys that you watch him and you could just get a tangle like

1366
01:26:32.781 --> 01:26:36.560
he's like, there's an energy that comes out of him. Undeniable greatness.

1367
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:40.340
That's part of that self. Yes. Yes. Domain,

1368
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:44.930
but he's also an incredibly humble guy. No peacocking at all. He's not,

1369
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:46.101
he's an artist.

1370
01:26:46.101 --> 01:26:51.101
A sign of spiritual maturity and moral security is secured.

1371
01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:55.760
It makes you want to pick up. Yes. Yes. He's just devoted to the work.

1372
01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:59.510
Devoted to the art. How is he not Gary?

1373
01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:02.960
He's probably in his thirties he's very young. Yeah, he's,

1374
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:06.290
he's still getting better. Who's his latest shit as his best shit?

1375
01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.030
He lives here in La as it goes back and forth.

1376
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:11.000
The Teddy's around here all the time. 35 yeah. I don't know.

1377
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:15.050
He think he's out here now, right? Isn't he out here? He was just,

1378
01:27:15.970 --> 01:27:17.810
Suzanne just sent me a text message.

1379
01:27:17.811 --> 01:27:21.150
They were just jamming in his house last week, so he must be out here. Hey,

1380
01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:22.760
he's got some shows here in September.

1381
01:27:22.761 --> 01:27:27.110
I think he's opening for the rolling stones. Oh Shit. Oh Shit.

1382
01:27:27.490 --> 01:27:32.050
Caught up. That's a hell of a show right there. Ooh, yeah, he's busy.

1383
01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:35.030
He's, there's a sign poster him over by the kitchen.

1384
01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.370
<v 5>Something for me. Yeah.</v>

1385
01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.280
You got to get somebody to come out to check him out.

1386
01:27:41.281 --> 01:27:44.680
I'll tell you which one to get. It's a, he's got some great, great work,

1387
01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:48.880
but there's, there's those artists that when you hear their thing,

1388
01:27:49.210 --> 01:27:53.170
whatever it is, it literally gives you energy. Like you feel it in your body.

1389
01:27:53.171 --> 01:27:56.920
It's like a drug. It changes your state. Absolutely. No, I mean,

1390
01:27:56.921 --> 01:28:01.540
when w w when you have the very,

1391
01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:02.140
um,

1392
01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:07.140
creative marriage of technique and vision of craft and imagination mediated

1393
01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:13.750
through sound,

1394
01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:18.070
the vibration that I'll say, ah,

1395
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:20.670
just beyond the link. But you know,

1396
01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:24.400
the great John Coltrane had a whole philosophy of vibrations.

1397
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.030
Sun Rowe was part of that dialogue as well.

1398
01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:31.450
Eric Dolphy some of the role geniuses of that time, you know,

1399
01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.020
and these vibrations are just,

1400
01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:39.610
they're as real as a heart attack, but you can never see them.

1401
01:28:40.050 --> 01:28:41.530
It's almost, yeah.

1402
01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:46.630
Joel was bootlegged to find the materialist as someone who was obsessed with

1403
01:28:46.631 --> 01:28:49.840
utensils and afraid of perfume,

1404
01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:56.010
because for fume, you can't touch it, but it's as real as a heart attack. Yeah.

1405
01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.510
Well, the vibrations of deep music,

1406
01:28:58.810 --> 01:29:03.810
Mozart to the miles or Mary Lou Williams,

1407
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:08.550
Jerry Allen, or any of the great artists, it just goes through you. Yes,

1408
01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:12.540
and it's not simply cerebro. It doesn't bypass the brain,

1409
01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.450
but it doesn't stay in the brain. It goes through your whole body. Yeah.

1410
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:20.900
It's like you said, it's like a drug. Got It.

1411
01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:23.500
<v 8>It changes your state. Yeah.</v>

1412
01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:26.780
If there was a drug that you could take that made you feel the way you feel when

1413
01:29:26.781 --> 01:29:30.440
a great song comes on, you would want to take that all the time. All the time.

1414
01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.050
Yeah. If it had no side effects, well,

1415
01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:36.560
in a way you can play that song over and over. You can. I mean,

1416
01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:39.470
eventually you get a little bit tolerant of it, unfortunately,

1417
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:44.030
but who would have major musicians that were shaping your sensibility?

1418
01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.240
I was always in the rock and roll.

1419
01:29:47.241 --> 01:29:50.000
I was always in the classic rock when I was young. You know,

1420
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:54.080
I was always into God from everyone from Queen.

1421
01:29:54.081 --> 01:29:56.510
I was a big queen fan when I was a kid.

1422
01:29:56.990 --> 01:30:01.640
Definitely don't get into Boston yet. Well I left New Jersey when I was seven.

1423
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:03.290
Oh No, seven no, this was boss.

1424
01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:08.300
I lived in San Francisco from seven to 11 that I lived in Florida from 11 to 13

1425
01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:14.170
and then Boston from 13 to 24 so he was mainly that Boston context where you had

1426
01:30:14.691 --> 01:30:19.520
the classic rock. Yeah, a lot of Aerosmith, which was a Boston Ben, of course,

1427
01:30:19.521 --> 01:30:23.810
you know a lot of Van Halen. Oh yeah, yeah.

1428
01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:25.313
There's a lot of that.

1429
01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:29.810
I didn't get into classic rock as much as I probably should have.

1430
01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.260
It's only so much time. Yeah. This is only so much time to listen to music.

1431
01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:34.280
That is an issue, right?

1432
01:30:34.281 --> 01:30:39.120
There's so much great work and every year new great work gets created check of

1433
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:42.290
Oh love. Because it was mainly rhythm and blues on our side of town.

1434
01:30:42.291 --> 01:30:47.120
You know what I mean? Yeah. The Sacramento, California jazz came later.

1435
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:49.220
And then for me, musical theater came.

1436
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:52.800
It didn't classical music cause I played classical violin 20 years. Yeah.

1437
01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:57.080
Oh Wow. And so a classical music was always van pulled to absorb.

1438
01:30:57.081 --> 01:30:59.870
A lot of times you learn hip hop, man. I was first filing

1439
01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:04.100
<v 5>man. I used to conduct two oh man on a clown and knock music with Mozart.</v>

1440
01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:09.180
We play Eg mountain but Beethoven and so forth. And as soon as it was,

1441
01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:13.680
oh, I'd go home and you know, Rockwood odors, red man and uh,

1442
01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:18.840
and when Isaac k's at black moves and great Barry white and others.

1443
01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:23.730
But it's fascinating how you begin to see these connections to broader

1444
01:31:23.731 --> 01:31:27.930
connections. And so classic rock was something that I got to real late,

1445
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:33.250
but late as in, you know, 2122 and in that sense, um,

1446
01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:38.400
and very much so, but uh, a world without music

1447
01:31:39.330 --> 01:31:42.280
<v 8>that would suck. Well it's interesting too when you,</v>

1448
01:31:42.281 --> 01:31:45.490
it's all about the context of when the music was created too.

1449
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:48.460
Because if you go and listen to Robert Johnson today,

1450
01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:50.500
it's still undeniably brilliant.

1451
01:31:50.501 --> 01:31:54.250
But what's interesting is it was so good back then that people thought he sold

1452
01:31:54.251 --> 01:31:58.180
his soul devil. I mean, that was the narrative. That's it. That was the legend.

1453
01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:00.130
But if you to it today

1454
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:04.090
<v 3>in comparison to something like Gary Clark, it's so simplistic. It's so true.</v>

1455
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:08.230
It's true. If Gary car could go back in time to when Robert Johnson was alive,

1456
01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:11.290
they would think he was from another planet. But that's the truth.

1457
01:32:11.410 --> 01:32:12.700
They wouldn't even understand it.

1458
01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:14.530
They wouldn't even understand what he was doing.

1459
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.890
<v 5>That's very real. Now,</v>

1460
01:32:16.891 --> 01:32:21.780
I used to say I was blessed to have dialogue with the BB king on a number of

1461
01:32:21.781 --> 01:32:25.710
occasions is the ability, the king in a lot of ways, king,

1462
01:32:25.711 --> 01:32:28.710
not because he was the greatest blues artists,

1463
01:32:29.250 --> 01:32:31.830
but because he was a great blues artists.

1464
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:37.310
Through his personality and through his generosity was able to create such a

1465
01:32:37.801 --> 01:32:42.480
presence that he becomes the king in that way. I had a chance to see him live.

1466
01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:44.320
You saw him laugh us. He sucked. It.

1467
01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:47.400
Was that at the very end when he was sitting most of the time, no,

1468
01:32:47.401 --> 01:32:51.230
he was still standing. Still standing. Okay. Late nights. Oh yeah, no, no,

1469
01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:55.260
you absolutely. The power out of his voice. Amazing.

1470
01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:58.730
But he used to say that, uh,

1471
01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:03.000
the blues was a kind of high school visa,

1472
01:33:03.001 --> 01:33:07.860
vi the jazz who are those who went to college and by college he meant just

1473
01:33:07.861 --> 01:33:12.190
studying with bird. But Armstrong with Duke, with uh, rough,

1474
01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:17.190
the foot in the Mary Lou Williams and the others. And I always tell him, I said,

1475
01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:18.930
I don't know about that because you know,

1476
01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:21.660
the genius and excellence comes a number of different forms.

1477
01:33:21.690 --> 01:33:25.740
Most jazz musicians don't have the genius of a Robert Johnson.

1478
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:28.140
And yet, you know,

1479
01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:32.610
Charlie Christian's guitar is more complicated in a variety of different ways in

1480
01:33:32.611 --> 01:33:33.780
rapid Johnson too.

1481
01:33:33.781 --> 01:33:37.670
So that you had to be able to be flexible enough to see the differences that

1482
01:33:37.671 --> 01:33:41.520
development building on the genius of those who came before.

1483
01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:46.700
So you can end up being a very good guitar player who plays some unbelievable

1484
01:33:48.631 --> 01:33:53.250
court that Jimmy Hendrix created. Yes.

1485
01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:57.240
But you build it on Jimmy and it becomes almost not taken for granted,

1486
01:33:57.241 --> 01:34:01.650
but something you can use as a launching pad like Stevie Ray Vaughan did. Yes,

1487
01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:04.590
he wrote the great jammies vibration.

1488
01:34:04.591 --> 01:34:09.570
That's a great example of his own feel to it. Absolutely. Absolutely.

1489
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.470
And here again, you see, you have the um,

1490
01:34:13.530 --> 01:34:18.530
that common humanity that cuts across color and there's a lot of controversy

1491
01:34:18.541 --> 01:34:21.720
these days about cultural appropriation. You know,

1492
01:34:21.721 --> 01:34:24.920
can white brothers and sisters really, uh,

1493
01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:28.260
be part of a black genre and so forth and so on.

1494
01:34:28.261 --> 01:34:32.310
I had a dialogue at my class at Harvard this spring.

1495
01:34:32.670 --> 01:34:37.500
I teach a course on black intellectual tradition and I include some white

1496
01:34:37.501 --> 01:34:41.310
intellectuals as part of it. It was a strange career of Jim Crow for example,

1497
01:34:41.311 --> 01:34:45.990
by the great event, Woodward, a history of Jim Crow to the Bible.

1498
01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:48.690
Martin Luther King said, was a Bible of civil rights movement.

1499
01:34:48.691 --> 01:34:52.290
Woodward was a white southern brother and I, and I asked them, they said,

1500
01:34:52.291 --> 01:34:55.620
we don't understand completely by the West. I said, well, let me ask you this.

1501
01:34:55.950 --> 01:35:00.950
Is Eminem a part of the hip hop tradition at the highest level?

1502
01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:05.780
Yes, he is. Yes, he is. That's who we told him about. Hmm. Let me see.

1503
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:10.810
You had to be a fool to deny the genius of m if m and m d c

1504
01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.630
<v 2>But relative, there's no way my name went out, Dr Dre and so forth.</v>

1505
01:35:13.631 --> 01:35:16.100
So he immerses and soaks himself in it,

1506
01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:19.310
but he puts his own distinctive stamp on it.

1507
01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:21.980
Calling oaks would be another righteous brothers,

1508
01:35:21.981 --> 01:35:26.720
another average white band from Scotland. Definitely.

1509
01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:32.060
You know what average white band and the funk that David generate. Oh my God.

1510
01:35:32.061 --> 01:35:34.400
Now of course, no average white band without James Brown. James Brown.

1511
01:35:34.401 --> 01:35:39.290
I took her to places nobody took. But you let those guys,

1512
01:35:39.291 --> 01:35:42.170
brothers plague person to person on you.

1513
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:45.460
Oh Lord have mercy. Pick up the [inaudible]

1514
01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:48.940
<v 5>pieces. A Y mad.</v>

1515
01:35:48.941 --> 01:35:53.941
You had to go a little high and you have to go and make me learn you in a slow

1516
01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.450
magic. I mean it's just so full man. You say Scotland,

1517
01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:06.070
Scotland, Robert Burns, Walter Scott,

1518
01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:13.320
David Hugh colonized by the British empire responding in their own creative ways

1519
01:36:15.190 --> 01:36:18.840
in by the 20th century. They soaked in rhythm and blues too.

1520
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:23.170
Korea is like that today. Really? Oh Man.

1521
01:36:23.171 --> 01:36:26.260
You Know Caribbean pop, k, pop and K. Rhythm and blind. No,

1522
01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:30.580
they've got a lot of break dancers over there. Oh, it was not just bts.

1523
01:36:30.581 --> 01:36:33.340
Not Bts is something else. They pack Madison Square down,

1524
01:36:33.970 --> 01:36:37.640
but I'm talking about like Urban's urban [inaudible] May.

1525
01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:42.160
Oh they you put on coffee man. Oh Lord have mercy.

1526
01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.080
<v 2>I played at the Dan Danny Glover the other day on the Bernie Sanders campaign.</v>

1527
01:36:46.081 --> 01:36:49.230
We traveled way off in the country in South Carolina for brother Bernie.

1528
01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:52.330
<v 5>I say Dan, even Sam Francisco. I said, man,</v>

1529
01:36:52.331 --> 01:36:54.430
listen to these young Korean brothers, man,

1530
01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:59.350
they can remind you the natural for Richmond. And I put it on,

1531
01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.860
Oh man, there could can be Korea. What you talking about?

1532
01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:08.650
<v 2>Sure. That was, Korea's got a soulful sound man at a blow.</v>

1533
01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:12.910
Yo Mine, I'm just reading the book called the birth of the book Korean. Cool.

1534
01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:14.950
Was this the wall? Oh Wow.

1535
01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:20.400
And it shows again how you know that human spirit is always grounded in

1536
01:37:20.531 --> 01:37:24.340
something local and particular light black music. Right? But it travels.

1537
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:27.550
It's the roots and the routes.

1538
01:37:28.090 --> 01:37:32.850
So the roots of black, but the roe u t e s is global. Right.

1539
01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:36.860
It's just I'm immersing themselves. They immersed in the culture,

1540
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.940
like Japanese jazz. Yeah, right.

1541
01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:44.880
You just got back from Thailand was last year. Yeah, last year. Yeah.

1542
01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:48.730
But now, man, it's, it's a, it's, it's a human thing.

1543
01:37:48.731 --> 01:37:51.820
It's a beautiful thing. The momentum of culture.

1544
01:37:51.821 --> 01:37:54.340
So strange cause a to Thailand's a great example of that.

1545
01:37:54.341 --> 01:37:56.370
It's like there's so different,

1546
01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.760
<v 8>there's so in the momentum of culture, like I've just got back from Italy.</v>

1547
01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:04.710
There's so different. But yet they're so similar. But there's so that there's,

1548
01:38:04.810 --> 01:38:07.380
there's a momentum of the way they live their lives.

1549
01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:08.940
It's very unique and unusual.

1550
01:38:08.941 --> 01:38:12.210
And I think that's one of the great things about traveling is you get to see,

1551
01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:15.420
oh, well, the way we live here is that, especially here in Los Angeles,

1552
01:38:15.421 --> 01:38:19.860
which is preposterous. Everybody's, I've never lived there. I grew up,

1553
01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:22.050
but I'd never lived in, where do you live now? I live in,

1554
01:38:22.051 --> 01:38:24.720
been in Cambridge and they half Cambridge as far as to there,

1555
01:38:24.721 --> 01:38:28.320
it's fine until four months of the year when it's just a frozen wasteland.

1556
01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:33.190
I just, it's, I used to perform at catch a rising star. Oh yeah,

1557
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:37.640
yeah. In Harvard Square. Absolutely dead off. It's glow. It's Cambridge is,

1558
01:38:37.710 --> 01:38:39.900
I mean, it's a great place. It's wonderful.

1559
01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:43.680
It's an intellectually that's wonderful things and hang out with the brother

1560
01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:48.720
because a lot of gates and yes, Brendan Perry and Bob Dale B.

1561
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:52.500
Boston's a strange place. It really is. There's so many different flavors to it,

1562
01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:56.490
you know? But it's um, so god damn cold, but it gets cold.

1563
01:38:56.491 --> 01:38:58.680
But that's when it's time to go in the library, read some books.

1564
01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:01.530
It also builds character. But that's true too.

1565
01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:05.250
There's something about people that grow up in cold climates. Come to terms.

1566
01:39:05.251 --> 01:39:09.280
Yeah. Chicago. Yeah. Chicago is a perfect example. Oh yeah.

1567
01:39:09.490 --> 01:39:13.500
They're great people there because they have character, absolute Detroit.

1568
01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:17.370
They deal with that shit. It got that deal with at times. Yeah.

1569
01:39:17.850 --> 01:39:18.860
You're right about that. That

1570
01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:22.560
<v 5>don't mean, I mean, one of the sad or features of our, our moment,</v>

1571
01:39:22.561 --> 01:39:24.660
given all our, uh,

1572
01:39:25.230 --> 01:39:29.850
the joy of reveling in each other's humanity and music and so forth, is that,

1573
01:39:29.851 --> 01:39:33.960
you know, you got impending ecological catastrophe,

1574
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.310
escalating nuclear catastrophe,

1575
01:39:39.630 --> 01:39:43.380
economic catastrophes to grow test wealth, inequality all around the world,

1576
01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:48.270
spiritual catastrophe in terms of intensifying forms of depression,

1577
01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:53.790
suicide, wasted lives, lack of self respect,

1578
01:39:53.791 --> 01:39:58.200
not believing in oneself and thinking that the only way you can really make it

1579
01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:02.550
is by imitating the mainstream forms of conformity.

1580
01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.320
And then the political catastrophes of right wing movements all around the world

1581
01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:11.790
and by right wing movements, what I mean is the rule of big money, big military,

1582
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.110
and then scape goat,

1583
01:40:13.111 --> 01:40:17.040
the most vulnerable and try to convince the most vulnerable that it's their

1584
01:40:17.041 --> 01:40:22.041
fault that they're in the subordinate positions that they are rather than giving

1585
01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:25.970
them a fair chance. You see? And that's the makings of,

1586
01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.600
of new forms of fascism and so on. You see, and you say to yourself,

1587
01:40:32.130 --> 01:40:36.300
you know, how do we hold on to some sense of hope?

1588
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:41.100
And there is no hope without wrestling with despair.

1589
01:40:41.850 --> 01:40:45.760
If you are afraid of despair, you never have hope. What do you,

1590
01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.010
when you say wrestle with it,

1591
01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:49.470
you got to wrestle at and not allow it to have the last word,

1592
01:40:49.471 --> 01:40:52.310
but you got to wrestle with it. When you're talking about the,

1593
01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:56.110
your concern about nuclear catastrophe and pending nuclear catastrophe,

1594
01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.720
yet you talking about what's going on right now with Iran? Well,

1595
01:40:58.721 --> 01:41:00.340
I'm thinking about Russia, Russia,

1596
01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:04.420
[inaudible] missile heads that ran North Korea stability of war,

1597
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:09.160
US bombing a precious Iran, Iranian brothers and sisters.

1598
01:41:09.161 --> 01:41:12.060
I was precious and priceless as anybody else.

1599
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:16.420
It just happened to be under the authoritarian rule that that does need to be

1600
01:41:16.421 --> 01:41:18.460
changed and transformed. There's no doubt about it.

1601
01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:22.860
But you think you know all the hell they'd been through man eight years when the

1602
01:41:22.861 --> 01:41:25.910
United States was on the side of Saddam Hussein. Yeah,

1603
01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:30.920
and they were all alone in the world. I mean very much like a Jewish brother,

1604
01:41:30.921 --> 01:41:35.921
sisters felt in 1973 they'd already undergone a genocidal attack,

1605
01:41:37.181 --> 01:41:39.190
went out, three presses, Jews killed,

1606
01:41:39.730 --> 01:41:42.730
and a 73 [inaudible] there in the world.

1607
01:41:43.150 --> 01:41:46.480
All by themselves other than u s empire and you say, Oh my God,

1608
01:41:46.481 --> 01:41:50.800
who can I rely on? And that brings out the worst in people,

1609
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:55.570
the worst in people because it's all about in crowd,

1610
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:57.190
in group security,

1611
01:41:58.270 --> 01:42:03.270
authoritarian on the inside and distrustful of the whole world on the outside.

1612
01:42:03.850 --> 01:42:06.700
And this is why it's so difficult to have a discussion about the Israeli

1613
01:42:06.701 --> 01:42:09.850
occupation, what are precious Palestinian brothers and sisters,

1614
01:42:09.851 --> 01:42:14.851
because to try to be able to cast a light on how an underdog,

1615
01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:19.070
because that's the history of Jews 2000 years,

1616
01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:23.800
it's basically underdark became an oppressor and how they become top dogs tied

1617
01:42:23.801 --> 01:42:26.820
to the u s top dogs. Now you always have again,

1618
01:42:26.890 --> 01:42:31.780
those Jewish voices in organization that are critical of Israeli occupation,

1619
01:42:31.781 --> 01:42:35.920
critical of any actions of human beings including Jews that are,

1620
01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:37.690
that need to be calling the question.

1621
01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:42.160
But it's hard to keep track of the rich and prices humanity of Palestinian

1622
01:42:42.161 --> 01:42:44.560
brothers and sisters under occupation,

1623
01:42:44.561 --> 01:42:49.561
second class citizenship when it's very clear that Jews have been so viciously

1624
01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:55.150
treated for 2000 years in the history of history of the West,

1625
01:42:55.151 --> 01:42:59.700
as well as the history of the, uh, the Middle East. And yet we have a, a,

1626
01:42:59.701 --> 01:43:03.730
a moral duty to keep track of the preciousness of press,

1627
01:43:03.731 --> 01:43:07.430
Palestinian babies just as we ought to keep track of depression.

1628
01:43:07.650 --> 01:43:12.650
This of Jewish babies and Gaza and Tel Aviv was have, uh,

1629
01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:18.280
a spotlight in terms of what those human beings are going through on both sides

1630
01:43:19.871 --> 01:43:24.340
of that divide as it were even given the asymmetric relation of power and the

1631
01:43:24.341 --> 01:43:26.290
structure of domination. Call the occupation.

1632
01:43:26.291 --> 01:43:29.860
But I'd say the same thing about Tibet. I'd say same thing about cashmere.

1633
01:43:29.861 --> 01:43:34.060
I'd say same thing about the western Sub-sahara under Moroccan domination.

1634
01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:39.560
Uh, there's so many examples that we, human beings, um,

1635
01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:43.940
generate that require our, uh,

1636
01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:49.080
moral and spiritual witness and our analytical attention and our artists who can

1637
01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:50.950
authorize an

1638
01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:56.480
even if only for a moment and alternative.

1639
01:43:57.290 --> 01:44:01.910
What is the art like in Palestine? The Art, the art,

1640
01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:04.490
the art and Palestine. Oh unbelievable.

1641
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:07.970
I mean I would imagine when you're dealing with such an oppressed group of

1642
01:44:07.971 --> 01:44:10.220
people that are living in such areas,

1643
01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:13.640
situation in time in history is unbelievable.

1644
01:44:13.641 --> 01:44:15.890
I was just talking to my dear brother Mark Lamont Hill.

1645
01:44:15.891 --> 01:44:19.430
We just had him at Harvard for dialogue on another Palestinian and black

1646
01:44:19.431 --> 01:44:23.450
situation and he goes back and forth and he talks about the Palestinian and hip

1647
01:44:23.451 --> 01:44:26.360
hop artists. Really? Oh my God,

1648
01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:31.160
they got one of the richest subcultures of hip hop. This isn't always the case.

1649
01:44:31.161 --> 01:44:36.161
When you have a culture that's down tribes solutely you get the Kurds and

1650
01:44:36.791 --> 01:44:41.791
Turkeys to apply the disproportionate amount of influence on Turkish culture.

1651
01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:45.890
What's like a good Palestinian hip hop band to look into?

1652
01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:49.060
It's a good question cause I, you know, I didn't really follow through with,

1653
01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:51.380
I like to listen to that too cause I don't know what they're saying.

1654
01:44:51.710 --> 01:44:54.320
I love listening to music where I don't know the language.

1655
01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:58.060
You can just feel the spirit coming through in the vibrations. Brazilian nation.

1656
01:44:58.130 --> 01:45:02.300
I love Brazilian hip hop because I don't speak Portuguese and it's just amazing.

1657
01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:04.313
I've never heard

1658
01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:08.960
[inaudible] UFC fighters from Brazil,

1659
01:45:08.961 --> 01:45:13.500
they'll come out to their soundtrack is Brazilian artists. Yeah.

1660
01:45:13.570 --> 01:45:17.300
Yeah. No, I mean to me, you know,

1661
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:22.330
one of the lifting features of being rooted in the arts and music is that no

1662
01:45:25.521 --> 01:45:30.020
matter how ugly and vicious and hateful things are,

1663
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:33.590
it never suffocates the human spirit.

1664
01:45:35.170 --> 01:45:39.650
Somebody's going to tell a joke and laugh, somebody's lying and song touches.

1665
01:45:39.651 --> 01:45:41.140
So yeah. Know what I mean? Yeah.

1666
01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:45.980
And it's almost a way of saying I love you.

1667
01:45:45.981 --> 01:45:50.360
Not in a sentimental Hollywood stereotypical way,

1668
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:54.050
but you know that song by Stevie wonder, these three words,

1669
01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:00.530
you got that man we can't play or he can't play. All

1670
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:05.240
right cause that was a video that you put up there before. Yeah,

1671
01:46:05.241 --> 01:46:08.730
but that video was Mary Johnson singing in a concert.

1672
01:46:08.731 --> 01:46:10.580
I definitely know that you did. Yeah,

1673
01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:16.440
we made listen to Stevie man cause he's talking about how an aching heart can be

1674
01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.720
kindled to smile,

1675
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:27.350
open and connect in a world overwhelmed by hatred and distrust that shot.

1676
01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:32.210
It's shot through all of us. And we all contribute to it.

1677
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:34.430
We all contribute to it. You see,

1678
01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:38.060
I mean that's one of the reasons why even when I talk about, you know,

1679
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:40.850
brought the Trump as a, the gangster,

1680
01:46:40.851 --> 01:46:45.851
I call him kind of created a fascist Frankenstein and sees the creation of the

1681
01:46:46.971 --> 01:46:49.740
worst of America and the in which

1682
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:53.640
<v 2>Martin King represents the best. That they are both Americans, Apple Pie.</v>

1683
01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:58.500
But any critique of anybody ought to begin with yourself.

1684
01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:01.080
Hmm. Let it begin with who we are.

1685
01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:06.260
Cause we all got gangsta elements inside of us. No way around us.

1686
01:47:06.710 --> 01:47:08.010
[inaudible] human. No, I've never met.

1687
01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:12.960
I met him one time I think at the end of Anita Baker concert in the casinos in

1688
01:47:12.961 --> 01:47:17.961
the Atlantic city way back in the 80s and it was interesting.

1689
01:47:18.331 --> 01:47:19.500
He was there with Mike Tyson I think.

1690
01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:22.440
And it was interesting because there was a chocolate affair, you know,

1691
01:47:22.441 --> 01:47:25.570
that makes, you don't want vanilla brother there. Right. And you know,

1692
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:29.520
one of the first things that come across to the brother is that he just so glad

1693
01:47:29.521 --> 01:47:33.240
to be there hanging out with the brothers. Cool. It's so funny.

1694
01:47:33.241 --> 01:47:37.520
You could just tell he just squares, rectangles. You sit,

1695
01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:43.140
you go listen to your beach boys, man. Shit, we got James Brown brother,

1696
01:47:43.141 --> 01:47:47.070
we got we Brian Wilson, we love you. But we got JB man and,

1697
01:47:47.370 --> 01:47:52.230
and but it is and it's a cultural dynamic because he was the Richard's one in

1698
01:47:52.231 --> 01:47:54.030
the room though, right? It might touch,

1699
01:47:54.031 --> 01:47:58.500
got a lot of money when don king got that everybody too. But uh,

1700
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:00.810
but it was a different kind of dynamic.

1701
01:48:00.811 --> 01:48:04.010
And so it's a context in which you embrace, you know,

1702
01:48:04.130 --> 01:48:06.900
we embrace him because that's the best of black culture.

1703
01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:10.260
We embraced every body. Right. You know what I mean?

1704
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:15.950
Donald Trump's mother shows up from Scotland and 1930 black people been here

1705
01:48:16.771 --> 01:48:19.830
nine generation. We're going to say go back where you come from.

1706
01:48:20.250 --> 01:48:23.880
Come on in his sister, they bought it as democratic experiment.

1707
01:48:23.881 --> 01:48:27.510
We on the other side, the chocolate side of town. But we welcome you.

1708
01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:30.840
But don't say nothing about our brown brothers and sisters coming in from

1709
01:48:30.841 --> 01:48:31.531
Mexico.

1710
01:48:31.531 --> 01:48:36.450
We live because if anybody's definitive about what is America is going to be red

1711
01:48:36.451 --> 01:48:41.130
and black people because they are the ones who's undergo the monsters,

1712
01:48:41.131 --> 01:48:42.540
crimes against humanity,

1713
01:48:42.541 --> 01:48:47.541
the genocide and stolen land on the one hand and these stolen people's and the

1714
01:48:48.361 --> 01:48:50.520
human bondage on the other. Those are the pillars,

1715
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:52.230
the worst pillars of the country.

1716
01:48:52.530 --> 01:48:55.650
Then you've got democratic visions coming not just from Thomas Jefferson,

1717
01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.680
but they are coming from the slaves like Frederick Douglas

1718
01:49:00.650 --> 01:49:04.420
<v 3>border crisis is a very interesting one, right? Because it's it, it,</v>

1719
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:06.410
it represents the,

1720
01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:11.430
the fear of people from the downtrodden countries where they don't have

1721
01:49:11.691 --> 01:49:15.020
opportunity trying to get into this country. Yes,

1722
01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:18.110
but then it also represents the fear of, of criminals,

1723
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:23.470
of drug dealers and gangsters and gang members make cartel members making their

1724
01:49:23.721 --> 01:49:27.170
way of crossing and victimizing our citizens both days.

1725
01:49:27.650 --> 01:49:28.800
Most things are real to human,

1726
01:49:28.801 --> 01:49:33.510
but if you tell the lies and make it as if the ladder represents the whole ride,

1727
01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:35.120
that's what Trump specializes.

1728
01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:40.430
Did you see the video of pence when he was down there at the detention centers

1729
01:49:40.431 --> 01:49:44.990
and just, just looking away? No. Humanity. Just very disturbing.

1730
01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:47.980
And it's so, it's so sad because here's a brother

1731
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.980
<v 5>who speaks his whole personal identity being a Krish Jess,</v>

1732
01:49:55.660 --> 01:50:00.000
and you say not the Mike. I mean, as a Christian,

1733
01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:04.030
I'm not trying to call into question your Christian faith and nothing.

1734
01:50:04.031 --> 01:50:05.530
I don't have the authority to do that,

1735
01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:10.560
but the Bible says in part by the works,

1736
01:50:10.901 --> 01:50:15.670
you shall know them, the works of love they exemplify.

1737
01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:17.133
You see,

1738
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:21.580
and you know nowadays you've got commodified Christianity and commodified

1739
01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:26.020
culture of a declining empire, and you get Christian evangelicals,

1740
01:50:26.021 --> 01:50:28.600
91% of sofe pro Trump,

1741
01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:33.550
79% sees that he's doing the best possible job. And you say to yourself,

1742
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:34.811
wow,

1743
01:50:34.811 --> 01:50:39.811
Christianity seems to have lost meaning of the cross and has become so

1744
01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:43.330
accommodated to the empire.

1745
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:49.390
And it was the Roman Empire who put Jesus to death, right?

1746
01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:53.680
There's the Roman Empire. You had some Neal colonial elites who cooperate,

1747
01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:56.290
but it was a Roman empire who put Jesus to death.

1748
01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:01.000
It was the greatest empire of its day, very much like the Persian empire,

1749
01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:06.760
the largest greatest empire of its day with Cyrus degree.

1750
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:10.120
Now you've got the Roman empire putting Jesus to death.

1751
01:51:10.450 --> 01:51:14.590
And here Jesus is sent there by the crowd,

1752
01:51:14.591 --> 01:51:19.420
by the mob, and you say to Beth, Michael Pence,

1753
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:23.290
so you gonna accommodate yourself to Donald Trump.

1754
01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:29.310
You're going to accommodate yourself to policies that are so inhumane and bald.

1755
01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:34.920
Barrack just to retain your position and try to then rationalize it as a

1756
01:51:36.341 --> 01:51:37.174
Christian.

1757
01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:44.230
We need some music and some comedy to try to get in contact with his humanity to

1758
01:51:44.231 --> 01:51:47.410
change him. But most importantly, you just need a social movement. You know,

1759
01:51:47.411 --> 01:51:49.870
you need to get him out of the office. He's accountability,

1760
01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:54.340
<v 8>but with pants or just seeing him in reaction to those people,</v>

1761
01:51:54.341 --> 01:51:58.900
it's just a failure of perspective. Cold, dead, Alice.

1762
01:51:59.360 --> 01:51:59.531
Well,

1763
01:51:59.531 --> 01:52:03.640
the narrative is that they broke the law and that they're imposing upon our

1764
01:52:03.641 --> 01:52:08.200
great nation. And you know, this is the, it's crimes of opportunity.

1765
01:52:08.201 --> 01:52:12.180
They're just trying to, they're trying to find opportunity. They're trying to,

1766
01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:15.970
they're coming over here because they want a better life to not have sympathy

1767
01:52:15.971 --> 01:52:16.770
for that.

1768
01:52:16.770 --> 01:52:19.840
<v 5>And, and in other than indigenous peoples and uh,</v>

1769
01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:22.960
and my own African peoples,

1770
01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:28.440
that is the history to come to the open and bring into the country.

1771
01:52:29.951 --> 01:52:34.951
Those who are eager and energy willing to work and sacrifice and the

1772
01:52:35.650 --> 01:52:39.520
unbelievable contribution of, uh,

1773
01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:42.820
voluntary immigrants to the making of American, not American,

1774
01:52:42.821 --> 01:52:43.930
not a nation of immigrants.

1775
01:52:43.931 --> 01:52:47.270
I don't like that language because it overlooks indigenous peoples and

1776
01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:52.660
involuntary movements like black people and slavery was not America's original

1777
01:52:53.031 --> 01:52:53.421
sin.

1778
01:52:53.421 --> 01:52:56.900
That's another Neal liberal line that you hear all the time on the corporate

1779
01:52:57.350 --> 01:53:01.610
media is if indigenous people suffering has to be rendered invisible, right.

1780
01:53:01.611 --> 01:53:02.750
To highlight black people.

1781
01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:07.900
What's one of the least discussed injustices of this nation and their current

1782
01:53:08.571 --> 01:53:13.571
situation where they're in these reservations with extreme alcoholism,

1783
01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:19.170
drug addiction. They still got the rich music and poetry and resistance,

1784
01:53:19.190 --> 01:53:23.150
but the, the social conditions are just, but this, they,

1785
01:53:23.170 --> 01:53:27.290
they are the casualties of a settler colonial enterprise.

1786
01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:30.260
And we rather act as if they don't exist, right? I mean we,

1787
01:53:30.261 --> 01:53:35.261
black people became central because our labor and our imagination and culture

1788
01:53:35.481 --> 01:53:38.140
became central and we had a ball barrack civil war,

1789
01:53:38.141 --> 01:53:42.040
750,000 people dead each life precious. Uh,

1790
01:53:42.290 --> 01:53:45.200
and that has been the central event in the shaping of America.

1791
01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:47.120
So when people talk about race,

1792
01:53:47.250 --> 01:53:51.620
they go straight to blackness as if indigenous people didn't redness,

1793
01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:53.810
not integral to,

1794
01:53:53.811 --> 01:53:57.740
it's just that they'd been written so invisible and divisions attack has been so

1795
01:53:57.741 --> 01:53:58.574
immense.

1796
01:53:58.670 --> 01:54:03.080
What's so complicated too that they have their own rules on the reservations.

1797
01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:06.170
They're allowed to have gambling and they can have all sorts of,

1798
01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:10.790
they have their own sovereignty in a certain way under reservations.

1799
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:12.650
It's very odd. The whole, no, it's true.

1800
01:54:12.651 --> 01:54:16.880
And I was blessed to be there in standing rock on a couple of Decembers ago.

1801
01:54:16.881 --> 01:54:21.881
It was one of the marvelous moments in my life to stand there with the,

1802
01:54:22.730 --> 01:54:24.740
the group there. It was a multiracial group.

1803
01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:29.300
People came from all around the world and I am inclined from Canada for the most

1804
01:54:29.301 --> 01:54:32.390
part, it was a matter of the indigenous peoples coming together.

1805
01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:37.220
Memories of wounded knee, 1890 400 people.

1806
01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:40.370
Could you remind people what there with standing rock standing rock was a

1807
01:54:40.371 --> 01:54:42.920
struggle over that pipe pipeline. Absolutely.

1808
01:54:42.921 --> 01:54:46.880
Trying to put pressure on the Obama administration to ensure that the pipeline

1809
01:54:46.881 --> 01:54:51.881
was not built that would violate the sacred a lands and many of the sacred

1810
01:54:52.821 --> 01:54:55.400
memories of indigenous peoples.

1811
01:54:55.970 --> 01:55:00.290
And it was magnificent because you had to coming together of indigenous nations

1812
01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:03.230
because part of the problem, this is true for all little press people,

1813
01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:08.330
is fighting among themselves and the difficulty of coming together as the first

1814
01:55:08.331 --> 01:55:12.980
time you had the coming together of a significant number of indigenous peoples

1815
01:55:12.981 --> 01:55:13.814
nations

1816
01:55:15.210 --> 01:55:20.210
unify against the greedy corporate elites who were trying to promote this

1817
01:55:20.991 --> 01:55:22.310
pipeline through Canada,

1818
01:55:22.311 --> 01:55:25.160
all the way down to the southern section of the United States.

1819
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:28.490
And it was his steps. Well, we first,

1820
01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:31.820
we got an announcement right when we were there. It was freezing to me.

1821
01:55:31.821 --> 01:55:35.730
It was December and they were hosing people down to, oh Lord Jeff,

1822
01:55:35.850 --> 01:55:39.320
they were hosing people down, wet wetting them down while this was all going on.

1823
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:44.340
And it was about minus 15 or whatever it was. It was freezing update,

1824
01:55:44.450 --> 01:55:46.680
you know, and uh, uh, but no,

1825
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.370
we got an announcement from the Obama administration for a, um,

1826
01:55:50.910 --> 01:55:54.330
suspension of it cause they had planned to do it too. I mean, you know,

1827
01:55:54.331 --> 01:55:56.910
Obama Administration can be very, uh,

1828
01:55:57.670 --> 01:56:00.630
accommodating the Wall Street interests and corporate elite interests and so

1829
01:56:00.631 --> 01:56:02.550
forth. Uh, even given the,

1830
01:56:02.551 --> 01:56:06.390
the image and spectacle of a black president being a progressive and what have

1831
01:56:06.391 --> 01:56:10.590
you, much more progressive than Trump that that's not saying too much. Right.

1832
01:56:11.130 --> 01:56:14.590
But, uh, but we got a suspension and uh,

1833
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:17.190
and the struggle continues really, but it was,

1834
01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:21.180
it ended as sent tremendous ripples through, uh,

1835
01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:25.410
the cultures of indigenous peoples and then nations in terms of coming together

1836
01:56:25.890 --> 01:56:28.140
and the fact that it was successful. Absolutely.

1837
01:56:28.170 --> 01:56:31.560
And it was Lisa relative victory. Yeah. All these victories are relative,

1838
01:56:31.561 --> 01:56:35.040
but very relative victory. It was beautiful just to see again, you know,

1839
01:56:35.250 --> 01:56:39.360
you know, you can't down play the role of joy. No brother.

1840
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:43.290
This is so very important. That joy in struggle,

1841
01:56:43.890 --> 01:56:48.150
the joy in organizing, the joy in fighting for justice,

1842
01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:52.440
the joy in the nightclubs, the joy in the churches at Mazda,

1843
01:56:52.441 --> 01:56:53.730
temple's a synagogue.

1844
01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:59.240
Joy is something that we need to come back to that one of the great secrets of

1845
01:57:00.301 --> 01:57:03.510
the human condition. What are the sources of joy?

1846
01:57:03.511 --> 01:57:05.940
What are the conditions for the possibility of joy?

1847
01:57:06.150 --> 01:57:10.080
We've been obsessed with pleasure for the last a hundred years or so.

1848
01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:13.260
Uh, and there's nothing wrong with, with pleasure,

1849
01:57:13.261 --> 01:57:16.080
but pleasure is not the same thing as joy. You know,

1850
01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:19.620
when you look at the sparkling eyes of your precious daughter,

1851
01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:24.300
that's not pleasure. That's joy. Hmm. You and your wife,

1852
01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:30.000
that's deep, deep joy, that sweat and doors.

1853
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:34.440
You could be broke as a 10 commandment financially,

1854
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:39.570
but that memory will bring you joy. That's a real joint, not peacocking death.

1855
01:57:39.571 --> 01:57:43.060
Exactly right. That's exactly right. Well,

1856
01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:45.220
<v 8>you said so many amazing things today.</v>

1857
01:57:45.630 --> 01:57:48.130
This was one of my favorite podcasts of all time. I just,

1858
01:57:48.131 --> 01:57:50.860
I just want to thank you for being here. Is the time up already time?

1859
01:57:50.861 --> 01:57:51.730
It's already 11 o'clock.

1860
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:55.340
<v 5>No, got up my tea,</v>

1861
01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:59.120
<v 8>but man, this has been a blessing though, brothers. My pleasure.</v>

1862
01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:04.100
You are what? A human being. You are my brother. You stay strong. Don't be too,

1863
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:08.100
sir. Thank you very much. Is it really 11 man?

1864
01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:15.733
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

1865
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.510
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>
