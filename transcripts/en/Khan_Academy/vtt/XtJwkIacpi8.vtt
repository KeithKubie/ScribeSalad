THIAGO SILVA: [SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.260
SALMAN KHAN: Great
question, Tiago.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.150
And to understand it, let's look
at the dimensions of a penalty

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.870
kick.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.740
The kick itself is from 12 yards
away from the goal or 36 feet.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.480
The goal itself is 24
feet wide or 8 yards wide.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.670
And the goal is 8 feet tall.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.070
And so let's think about a
few other dimensions that

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.500
might not be as obvious.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.210
Let's try to figure
out the distance

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.160
from the ball where it's
kicked to the bottom right

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.722
of the goal.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.930
And this, obviously, is
going to be the same distance

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.200
as to the bottom
left of the goal.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.990
And I encourage anyone watching
this to pause the video

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.590
and think about that right now.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.190
Well, the way I've
drawn it, you see

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.870
that this is actually
a right triangle.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.430
And so we could use
the Pythagorean theorem

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.571
in order to figure out what is
this distance right over here.

00:00:57.571 --> 00:00:58.820
And you might say, well, wait.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.903
How do we figure that out?

00:00:59.903 --> 00:01:02.880
Well, we already know that
this length of the triangle

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.510
is 36 feet.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.570
And we know that this
base right over here

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.710
is 1/2 of the width of the goal.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.570
So this is going to be
12 feet right over there.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.250
So the Pythagorean
theorem tells us

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.210
that this distance
right over here

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.870
is going to be the square
root of the square of the sum

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.550
of the squares of
the other side.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.550
So it's going to be
the square root of 12

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.770
squared plus 36 squared.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.120
And let's get our calculator
out and try to answer it

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.990
and figure out what that is.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.270
So that's going to be the square
root of 12 squared plus 36

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:49.076
feet squared-- oops, not 33-- 36
feet squared is equal to 37.9.

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:51.700
So let's just say-- well, let's
just use that number right now.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.690
So 37 point-- we could even
say 0.95, almost 38 feet.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.860
So this is approximately
equal to 37.95 feet.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.860
And that's going to be
the same as this distance

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.119
right over here.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.910
Now, let's figure out
the distance, an even

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.944
further distance, the
distance to the top right,

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:13.610
which is also going
to be the same thing

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.530
as the distance to the top left.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.110
And I'd encourage, once again,
people to pause the video

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.180
and try to think about
that on their own.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.140
Well, let's draw
another right triangle.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.840
And this one might
not be as obvious.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.100
But if I draw the straight
line distance of the ball

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.990
to, in this case, the
top right of the goal,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.410
I have now constructed
another right triangle.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.780
Notice this is a
90 degree angle.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.320
One side is 37.95 feet.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.580
The other side is
eight feet tall.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.260
And so this distance
right over here

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.130
is going to be the
square root of 37.95

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.975
squared plus 8 feet squared.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.600
So let's figure out what that
is, get the calculator out.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.180
So I can square the last
entry on my calculator

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.360
just by typing in
this-- that just means

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.810
take the last answer,
square it-- and then

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.200
add that to 8 squared,
which we know is 64.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.290
And now we want to take
the square root of that.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.150
So take the square
root of 1,504,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.640
gets us to 38, we'll just
say, roughly 38.8 feet,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.750
or let's say 0.78 feet.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.590
So this is approximately
equal to 38.78 feet.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.340
Now the next thing I
want to think about--

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.910
and I think this will be what
we focus on-- to figure out

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.560
how much time does the goalie
have to get here, because one

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.720
could argue that this is
the hardest to get to,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.900
that the goalie, they have
to travel the furthest.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.390
And they have to dive
for this right over here.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.270
So let's think
about the distance

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.247
from this point to
this point here.

00:03:56.247 --> 00:03:58.580
And then we can think about
how much the goalie actually

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.330
has to move because
they have some height.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.572
And their hands, they
can stick up in the air.

00:04:02.572 --> 00:04:04.780
And this one, once again,
is a fairly straightforward

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.220
Pythagorean theorem problem.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.990
You have a right triangle here.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.840
You could also see
it on this side.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.280
It's a little easier.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.220
You have a right triangle here.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.089
We know that this is 12 feet.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.230
And that this right
over here is 8 feet.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.760
So we know that this
distance right over here

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.440
is going to be the square
root of 12 feet squared,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.080
which is 144, plus 8 feet
squared, which is 64.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.100
So let's figure
out what that is.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:40.720
So that's going to be
the square root of 144

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.430
plus 64 is equal to 14.42 feet.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.920
It's equal to 14.42 feet.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.760
Now, we assume that the goalie
isn't traveling all the way

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.476
from here to all the way there.

00:04:58.476 --> 00:04:59.600
The goalie has some height.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.490
And he or she could stick
their hands up in the air.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.460
So we could imagine a goalie
stretched out like this,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.510
trying to dive for that ball.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.520
And so the actual distance
that they have to travel

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.360
is from the tip of their
reach to that corner right

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.360
over there.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.830
So if we assume that the entire,
if a goalie stretched out, is,

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.690
let's say, 7 and 1/2 feet
completely stretched out--

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.050
so this distance, if this
distance fully stretched

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:37.140
out is 7.5 feet and they're
trying to get 14.42 feet away--

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.920
and I could maybe
start rounding down

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.560
a little bit rougher numbers
to, say, 14.4 feet-- then

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.020
they need to travel
about 6.9 feet.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.450
So they need to
travel about 6.9 feet.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.580
So for this top right kick
or this top left kick,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.370
the ball is going to travel
38, almost 39 feet, 38.8,

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.080
38.78 feet.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.080
And the goalie has to
travel-- the goaltender has

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.230
to travel 6.9 feet.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.380
Now that we know the distances
that the ball has to travel

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.610
and that the goalkeeper
has to travel,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.240
we can now think about the time
in which it's going to happen.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.530
And to do that, we're going
to have make assumptions

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.060
about their speed.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.860
So I did some research
on the internet.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.660
And it looks like a penalty
kick can go-- a fast penalty

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.860
kick can be around
60 miles per hour,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.800
although it does look like
there are documented cases of 80

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.920
miles per hour or
even higher than that.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.000
But let's just say 60 miles per
hour for a fast penalty kick.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.460
So this is the kick
speed or the ball speed.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.560
And let's assume
that this person

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.480
can jump at 15 miles per
hour, which is actually

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.930
a pretty good speed
from a standstill.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.170
So it actually might be
a little bit aggressive.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.320
So jump speed--
I'll write it here--

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.620
jump speed of the goalkeeper.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.396
Let's write that as
15 miles per hour.

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:11.770
And so to make sense of it,
because everything else we've

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.010
done in feet, let's convert
these each into feet.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.924
So 60 miles per hour.

00:07:17.924 --> 00:07:19.590
If I want to convert
it to feet, we just

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:25.290
have to remind ourselves
that 60 miles is

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:34.480
the equivalent to
60 times 5,280 feet.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.330
Each mile is 5,280 feet.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.050
So this would give me the total
number of feet in an hour.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.480
But we don't want feet per hour.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.710
We want feet per seconds.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.060
So this is how far you
would go in feet in an hour.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.320
To figure it out in seconds,
you would want to divide

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.420
by 3,600 because there are
3,600 seconds in an hour.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:03.830
So this gets us to 88
feet per second, 88

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.070
feet per second for the ball.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.980
And now let's do the same
thing for the goalkeeper.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:19.710
So 15 times 5,280-- so this is
the feet traveled in an hour.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.410
But we want it in a second.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.530
So we're going to divide
it by 3,600, gets us

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.620
to 22 feet per second.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:36.059
So this is equal to 22 feet in
a second, 22 feet per second.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.789
So now we can use these speeds
to figure out how long will it

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.470
take the ball to
go from this point

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.752
all the way to the
top right corner.

00:08:43.752 --> 00:08:45.460
Well, we'll just have
to remind ourselves

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.340
that distance is equal
to speed times time.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.840
Or if we want the
time, we just have

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.800
to take the distance
an divide it by speed.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:01.750
So the time for the
ball-- so ball time-- is

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.960
going to be equal to
38 point-- let's just

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.410
go with 38.8 feet-- had to
make a lot of rough assumptions

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.710
here anyway-- is going to be
equal to 38.8 feet divided

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:25.030
by 88 feet per second,
which is equal to-- so 38.8

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:30.847
divided by 88 gets
us 0.44 seconds.

00:09:30.847 --> 00:09:31.680
So let's write that.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.790
So that's 0.44 seconds
or 44/100 of a second,

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.586
a little under half of a second
for this ball to reach there.

00:09:40.586 --> 00:09:42.460
Obviously, if the ball
was going even faster,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.668
it would take even less time.

00:09:43.668 --> 00:09:47.100
If it was going slower, it
would take a little more time.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.680
Now let's think about how far
it would take for this person

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.430
to travel the 6.9 feet.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:10:02.210
So the goalkeeper time, goalie
time is equal to the 6.9 feet.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.770
We're assuming he's
kind of already

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.580
in this position, kind
of already starting

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.460
to stretch out.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.550
Or he stretches out while
he's in the air when

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.512
he launches himself.

00:10:10.512 --> 00:10:12.220
So it's going to be--
and, obviously, I'm

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.750
making a lot of rough
assumptions here-- 6.9 feet

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.660
divided by 22 feet per second.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:29.670
So that gets us 6.9 divided
by 22 is equal to 0.31--

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:36.540
I'll just round there--
is equal to 0.31 seconds.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.490
So just based on what
we saw, the ball's

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.890
going to take 44/100 of
a second to get there.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.680
The goalkeeper, if we assume
the 15 miles per hour,

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.860
is going to take 31/100
of a second to get there.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.330
And so they only
have the difference

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.230
to make the decision
where to jump

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.910
and, even frankly,
to start their jump,

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.390
getting into the
jumping position,

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.050
to kind of scrunch up
and jump a little bit.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.810
So the difference
between these two things

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:07.040
is only-- let me write this in
a new color-- this is 13/100

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.750
of a second to
make this decision.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.440
And that's why, frankly,
penalty kicks are successful

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.870
so frequently.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.510
Most people's reaction time--
and even professional athletes

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.250
does not-- professional
athletes get

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.982
close to this in terms
of reaction time.

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.940
I did a little bit of
research on the internet.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.730
Most other people's reaction
time is nowhere near this low.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.270
It's often double
this or higher.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.630
So even if they make
the exact right decision

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.250
and even if they're able
to launch themselves up

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.740
at 15 miles per hour, they have
little over a tenth of a second

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.060
to make that decision.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.580
Now once again, I
want to emphasize,

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.160
this was given all of these
assumptions that I made.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.460
You might want to lower
or higher this assumption

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.127
of how fast they can jump.

00:11:52.127 --> 00:11:53.710
You might want to
increase or decrease

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.240
the assumption about how
fast the ball is going.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.410
And you could also think
about different points

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.990
on the goal to see which one,
based on your assumptions,

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.120
might require different
reaction times.
