00:00:00.668 --> 00:00:02.334
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:05.506
is think about what properties
of a shape are preserved

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:07.177
or not preserved, as

00:00:07.177 --> 00:00:09.677
they undergo a transformation.

00:00:10.558 --> 00:00:12.997
In particular, we're gonna
think about rotations

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:14.652
and reflections in this video.

00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:17.256
And both of those are
rigid transformations

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:20.434
which means that the length
between corresponding

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:22.112
points do not change.

00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:25.418
So for example, let's say
we take this circle A,

00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:27.040
it's centered at Point A.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.998
And we were to rotate it around Point P.

00:00:29.998 --> 00:00:32.424
Point P is the center of rotation.

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:35.404
And just for the sake
of argument we rotate it

00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:37.450
clockwise a certain angle.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.088
So let's say we end up right over

00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:42.343
so we're gonna rotate that way.

00:00:42.343 --> 00:00:45.850
And let's say our center
ends up right over here.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.772
So our new circle, the image

00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:50.739
after the rotation might
look something like this.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:51.791
And I'm hand drawing it.

00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:53.299
So you got to forgive

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.753
that it's not that well
hand drawn of a circle.

00:00:56.753 --> 00:01:00.468
But the circle might
look something like this.

00:01:00.468 --> 00:01:03.084
And so, the clear things
that are preserved

00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:04.704
or maybe it's not so clear, we're gonna

00:01:04.704 --> 00:01:07.105
hope we make them clear right now.

00:01:07.105 --> 00:01:09.305
Things that are preserved
under a rigid transformation

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:11.353
like this rotation right over here.

00:01:11.353 --> 00:01:13.152
This is clearly a rotation.

00:01:13.152 --> 00:01:15.888
Things that are preserved

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:19.075
well, you have things like the radius

00:01:19.075 --> 00:01:20.806
of the circle.

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:23.766
The radius length, I could
say, to be more particular.

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.683
The radius here is two.

00:01:26.518 --> 00:01:28.435
The radius here is also

00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:32.208
is also two, right over there.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.450
You have things like the perimeter.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.372
Well, if the radius is preserved

00:01:37.372 --> 00:01:38.852
the perimeter of a circle

00:01:38.852 --> 00:01:40.483
which we call a circumference

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:42.274
well, that's just a
function of the radius.

00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:45.056
We're talking about two
times pi times the radius.

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:48.453
So the perimeter, of course,
is going to be preserved.

00:01:48.453 --> 00:01:50.087
In fact, that follows from the fact that

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:51.495
the length of the radius is preserved.

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:53.521
And of course, if the
radius is preserved and then

00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:56.238
the area is also going to be preserved.

00:01:56.238 --> 00:01:58.532
The area is just pi
times the radius squared.

00:01:58.532 --> 00:01:59.784
So they have the same radius.

00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:01.078
They're gonna have all of these in common.

00:02:01.078 --> 00:02:03.497
And you could also that
feels intuitively right.

00:02:03.497 --> 00:02:05.613
So what is not preserved?

00:02:05.613 --> 00:02:06.780
Not preserved.

00:02:08.064 --> 00:02:09.752
And this is in general true of

00:02:09.752 --> 00:02:11.302
rigid transformations is that

00:02:11.302 --> 00:02:13.488
they will preserve the distance between

00:02:13.488 --> 00:02:16.306
corresponding points if
we're transforming a shape

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:19.414
they'll preserve things
like perimeter and area.

00:02:19.414 --> 00:02:21.034
And this case, I can set a perimeter.

00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:22.719
I can say circumference.

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:23.886
Circumference.

00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:26.820
So they'll preserve things like that.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.821
They'll preserve angles.

00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:29.545
We don't have clear
angles in this picture.

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.418
But, they'll preserve things like angles.

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:34.081
But what they won't
preserve is the coordinates.

00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:34.998
Coordinates

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:37.524
of

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:38.853
corresponding points.

00:02:38.853 --> 00:02:40.691
They might sometimes, but not always.

00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:43.519
So for example, the
coordinate of the center here

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.151
is for sure, going to change.

00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:48.081
We go from the coordinate
negative three comma zero.

00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:50.142
To here we went to the coordinate

00:02:50.142 --> 00:02:52.396
we went to the coordinate
negative one comma two.

00:02:52.396 --> 00:02:54.144
So the coordinates are not preserved.

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:56.264
Coordinates of the center.

00:02:56.264 --> 00:02:58.770
Let's do another example with a

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.099
non-circular shape.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.582
And we'll do a different
type of transformation.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.832
In this situation let us do

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.331
a reflection.

00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:10.950
So, we have a quadrilateral here.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.533
Quadrilateral ABCD.

00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:16.352
And we want to think about
what is preserved, or not

00:03:16.352 --> 00:03:19.177
preserved as we do a reflection

00:03:19.177 --> 00:03:20.677
across the line L.

00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:23.270
So let me write that down.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.424
We're gonna have a
reflection in this situation.

00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:29.267
And we can even think about this

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:30.918
without even doing the
reflection ourselves.

00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:33.831
But let's just do the
reflection really fast.

00:03:33.831 --> 00:03:37.998
So we're reflecting across
the line XYZ equal to X.

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:41.008
So what it essentially
does to the coordinates is

00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:43.136
it swaps the X and Y coordinates.

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:44.505
But you don't have to know that

00:03:44.505 --> 00:03:46.069
for the sake of this video.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.069
So,

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.738
B prime would be right over here.

00:03:49.738 --> 00:03:52.667
A prime would be right over there.

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:54.000
D prime would be

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:56.957
right over here.

00:03:56.957 --> 00:03:59.345
And since C is right on the line now

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:02.184
its image, C prime, won't change.

00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:03.435
And so our new

00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:05.102
when we reflect over

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.829
the line L.

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.624
And you don't have to
know for the sake of this

00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:13.359
video, exactly how I
did that fairly quickly.

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.682
I really just want you to see

00:04:14.682 --> 00:04:16.195
what the reflection looks like.

00:04:16.195 --> 00:04:18.327
The real appreciation here is think about,

00:04:18.327 --> 00:04:21.123
well, what happens with
rigid transformations.

00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:24.651
So, it's gonna look something like this.

00:04:24.651 --> 00:04:25.901
The reflection.

00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:29.726
The reflection looks something like this.

00:04:29.726 --> 00:04:32.054
So what's preserved?

00:04:32.054 --> 00:04:33.943
And in general, this is good to know

00:04:33.943 --> 00:04:35.364
for any rigid transformation
what's preserved.

00:04:35.364 --> 00:04:36.599
Well, side lengths.

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.587
That's actually one way that we even

00:04:38.587 --> 00:04:40.605
use to define what a
rigid transformation is.

00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:43.456
A transformation that
preserves the lengths

00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:45.073
between corresponding points.

00:04:45.073 --> 00:04:46.945
Angle measures.

00:04:46.945 --> 00:04:48.195
Angle measures.

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:51.748
So, for example, this angle here,

00:04:51.748 --> 00:04:53.900
the angle A, is gonna be the same

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.601
as the angle A prime over here.

00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:57.816
Side lengths, the distance between A and B

00:04:57.816 --> 00:04:59.645
is going to be the same
as the distance between

00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:01.417
A prime and B prime.

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:02.250
Perimeter.

00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:06.197
If you have the same side
lengths and the same angles,

00:05:06.197 --> 00:05:07.608
the perimeter and area

00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:09.025
are also going to be preserved.

00:05:09.025 --> 00:05:10.751
Just like we saw with
the rotation example.

00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:12.252
These are rigid transformations.

00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:14.911
These are the types of
things that are preserved.

00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:16.930
Well, what is not preserved?

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.928
Not preserved.

00:05:17.928 --> 00:05:19.618
And this just goes back to the example

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:20.613
we just looked at.

00:05:20.613 --> 00:05:22.499
Well, coordinates are not preserved.

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.820
So as we see, the image of A

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.980
A prime has different coordinates than A.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.060
B prime has different coordinates than B.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.369
C prime, in this case, happens to have

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:34.052
the same coordinates as C because C

00:05:34.052 --> 00:05:36.213
happens to sit on our, the line

00:05:36.213 --> 00:05:37.781
that we're reflecting over.

00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:39.540
But D prime definitely does not have

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.211
the same coordinates as D.

00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:42.044
So, most

00:05:43.834 --> 00:05:44.876
of

00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:47.645
or let me say, coordinates of AB

00:05:47.645 --> 00:05:49.285
ABD.

00:05:49.285 --> 00:05:50.202
Coordinates

00:05:51.983 --> 00:05:52.816
of

00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:54.700
A

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.715
B

00:05:55.715 --> 00:05:57.048
D not preserved.

00:05:58.254 --> 00:06:00.653
After transformation, or their images

00:06:00.653 --> 00:06:02.513
don't have the same coordinates.

00:06:02.513 --> 00:06:03.346
After

00:06:04.225 --> 00:06:05.475
transformation.

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:10.607
The one coordinate that
happened to be preserved here

00:06:10.607 --> 00:06:12.214
is Cs

00:06:12.214 --> 00:06:13.238
coordinates.

00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:16.345
Because it was right on
the line of reflection.

00:06:16.345 --> 00:06:18.253
And you can also look at other properties

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.562
so how it might relate

00:06:19.562 --> 00:06:21.594
how different segments might relate to

00:06:21.594 --> 00:06:23.359
lines that would not be

00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:25.329
that were not being transformed.

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:27.647
So, for example, right over here

00:06:27.647 --> 00:06:30.730
before transformation, CD is parallel

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:33.405
to the Y axis.

00:06:33.405 --> 00:06:35.191
You see this right over here.

00:06:35.191 --> 00:06:37.473
But after the transformation

00:06:37.473 --> 00:06:39.189
C prime D prime.

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:41.695
So this could be C prime D prime

00:06:41.695 --> 00:06:44.887
is no longer parallel to the Y axis.

00:06:44.887 --> 00:06:47.992
In fact, now it is parallel to the X axis.

00:06:47.992 --> 00:06:49.941
So, when you have the
relationship to things

00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:52.518
outside of the things we're transformed

00:06:52.518 --> 00:06:54.130
that relationship might not.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.461
Those relationships may no longer be true

00:06:57.461 --> 00:06:59.544
after the transformation.
