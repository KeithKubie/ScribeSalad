a lot of these slides today were taken
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.930
a lot of these slides today were taken
from our blink blink on conference which

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
from our blink blink on conference which
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.360
from our blink blink on conference which
was a couple months ago we had something

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
was a couple months ago we had something
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.979
was a couple months ago we had something
around 200 contributors from the blink

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
around 200 contributors from the blink
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.270

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
community come to the San Francisco
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.879
community come to the San Francisco
office it was about half Googlers about

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:58.889
office it was about half Googlers about
 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:02.329
office it was about half Googlers about
half open source folks and we just

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339
half open source folks and we just
 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.640
half open source folks and we just
talked to my blink and the slides and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
talked to my blink and the slides and
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.590
talked to my blink and the slides and
recordings of the main room talks are

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
performance and layout in the future of
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.539
performance and layout in the future of
kind of all these directions so things

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
kind of all these directions so things
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.770
kind of all these directions so things
that are interesting for both blink

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
that are interesting for both blink
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.440
that are interesting for both blink
developers and web developers so I cared

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
developers and web developers so I cared
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.520
developers and web developers so I cared
you to check out the slides in video

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
you to check out the slides in video
 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.120
you to check out the slides in video
yeah definitely so yeah blink has been

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
yeah definitely so yeah blink has been
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.359
yeah definitely so yeah blink has been
around now about eight months I April

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
around now about eight months I April
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.510
around now about eight months I April
for 2013 is when we forked WebKit and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
for 2013 is when we forked WebKit and
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.590
for 2013 is when we forked WebKit and
became blink and we are really a pretty

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
became blink and we are really a pretty
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.090
became blink and we are really a pretty
serious open source product about on the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
serious open source product about on the
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.580
serious open source product about on the
size of the Linux kernel or so about

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590
size of the Linux kernel or so about
 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.289

got companies from Samsung to Intel to
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.399
got companies from Samsung to Intel to
Adobe we even had a commit from

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
Adobe we even had a commit from
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.060

personally I love this slide this is

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579
personally I love this slide this is
 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.810
personally I love this slide this is
shows our size of our source space over

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
shows our size of our source space over
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.069
shows our size of our source space over
the last couple years and you can see

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
the last couple years and you can see
 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.440
the last couple years and you can see
that big discontinuity around april this

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
that big discontinuity around april this
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.020
that big discontinuity around april this
year that was when we blinked blink for

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
year that was when we blinked blink for
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.999
year that was when we blinked blink for
us was a lot of letting go WebKit is

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
us was a lot of letting go WebKit is
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.580
us was a lot of letting go WebKit is
this amazing source space that as you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
this amazing source space that as you
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.960
this amazing source space that as you
say has existed for a very long time and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970
say has existed for a very long time and
 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.970
say has existed for a very long time and
is really everywhere everybody watching

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980
is really everywhere everybody watching
 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.780
is really everywhere everybody watching
this probably has WebKit in the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790
this probably has WebKit in the
 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.339
this probably has WebKit in the
device that they're holding in their

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349
device that they're holding in their
 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.750
device that they're holding in their
hand or their computer that's sitting in

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760
hand or their computer that's sitting in
 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.750
hand or their computer that's sitting in
front of them and WebKit is part of

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760
front of them and WebKit is part of
 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.630
front of them and WebKit is part of
being everywhere has been this square

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640
being everywhere has been this square
 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.479
being everywhere has been this square
peg that has been shoved into lots of

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489
peg that has been shoved into lots of
 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.069
peg that has been shoved into lots of
round holes and although it's beautiful

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079
round holes and although it's beautiful
 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.209
round holes and although it's beautiful
on the inside has had this really

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:33.219
on the inside has had this really
 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.160
on the inside has had this really
difficult time interacting with some

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170
difficult time interacting with some
 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.080
difficult time interacting with some
pizzas and for us it was about letting

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090
pizzas and for us it was about letting
 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.520
pizzas and for us it was about letting
go of a lot of these pieces of WebKit

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530
go of a lot of these pieces of WebKit
 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.819
go of a lot of these pieces of WebKit
that we didn't need so that was blank we

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829
that we didn't need so that was blank we
 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.890
that we didn't need so that was blank we
we have spent a lot of the last say

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900
we have spent a lot of the last say
 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.119
we have spent a lot of the last say
eight months time to take our

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129
eight months time to take our
 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.949
eight months time to take our
integration with WebKit which looked a

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959
integration with WebKit which looked a
 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.080
integration with WebKit which looked a
lot like this to something maybe a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090
lot like this to something maybe a
 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.860
lot like this to something maybe a
little bit more like this and now we've

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870
little bit more like this and now we've
 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.780
little bit more like this and now we've
since that time since blink on been

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790
since that time since blink on been
 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.360
since that time since blink on been
trying to shift our focus more to doing

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370
trying to shift our focus more to doing
 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.309
trying to shift our focus more to doing
new things with blank and so that's a

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319
new things with blank and so that's a
 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.539
new things with blank and so that's a
little bit of what we're going to talk

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549
little bit of what we're going to talk
 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.559
little bit of what we're going to talk
about today great so one of the big

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569
about today great so one of the big
 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.179
about today great so one of the big
things that's changed in the browser

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189
things that's changed in the browser
 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.250
things that's changed in the browser
world in the last five years is that

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260
world in the last five years is that
 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.949
world in the last five years is that
five years ago web developers had the

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959
five years ago web developers had the
 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.649
five years ago web developers had the
question of well do I write for ie do I

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659
question of well do I write for ie do I
 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.300
question of well do I write for ie do I
write for Firefox where do I develop

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310
write for Firefox where do I develop
 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.520
write for Firefox where do I develop
this thing these days developers are

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530
this thing these days developers are
 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.319
this thing these days developers are
making the choice of do i write

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329
making the choice of do i write
 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.949
making the choice of do i write
objective-c or do i write HTML you know

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959
objective-c or do i write HTML you know
 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.770
objective-c or do i write HTML you know
mobile is king and the question is do I

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780
mobile is king and the question is do I
 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.000
mobile is king and the question is do I
write a mobile app or do I write a web

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010
write a mobile app or do I write a web
 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.649
write a mobile app or do I write a web
app and we're really acutely sensitive

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659
app and we're really acutely sensitive
 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.020
app and we're really acutely sensitive
that in the blank world so browser

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030
that in the blank world so browser
 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.610
that in the blank world so browser
compatibility is way better we have way

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620
compatibility is way better we have way
 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.500
compatibility is way better we have way
better standards and mobile is king and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510
better standards and mobile is king and
 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.369
better standards and mobile is king and
that has changed what we think about so

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379
that has changed what we think about so
 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.809
that has changed what we think about so
these days in blink now that we're

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819
these days in blink now that we're
 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.969
these days in blink now that we're
trying to do less as being just blink

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:41.979
trying to do less as being just blink
 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.500
trying to do less as being just blink
and not part of the larger WebKit

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510
and not part of the larger WebKit
 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.210
and not part of the larger WebKit
project we're trying to do less and

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220
project we're trying to do less and
 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.680
project we're trying to do less and
we're going to try to do it better and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690
we're going to try to do it better and
 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.110
we're going to try to do it better and
we're trying to take pieces that were in

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120
we're trying to take pieces that were in
 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.710
we're trying to take pieces that were in
blink for sort of historical reasons or

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720
blink for sort of historical reasons or
 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.240
blink for sort of historical reasons or
we're in the WebKit source repository

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250
we're in the WebKit source repository
 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.949
we're in the WebKit source repository
for historical reasons and move them out

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959
for historical reasons and move them out
 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.319
for historical reasons and move them out
to other places and simplify things so

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329
to other places and simplify things so
 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.360
to other places and simplify things so
that's again simplify and be faster

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370
that's again simplify and be faster
 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.390
that's again simplify and be faster
that's a lot of what we're trying to do

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400
that's a lot of what we're trying to do
 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.589
that's a lot of what we're trying to do
so one of things we talked about it at

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599
so one of things we talked about it at
 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.780
so one of things we talked about it at
blink on again to this this crowded

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790
blink on again to this this crowded
 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.699
blink on again to this this crowded
developers is that this is what the

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709
developers is that this is what the
 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.250
developers is that this is what the
architecture blank looks like today one

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260
architecture blank looks like today one
 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.500
architecture blank looks like today one
gigantic blah looks pretty scary looks

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510
gigantic blah looks pretty scary looks
 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.039
gigantic blah looks pretty scary looks
pretty scared and we'd really like to to

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049
pretty scared and we'd really like to to
 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.099
pretty scared and we'd really like to to
again to simplify in part so we can do

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109
again to simplify in part so we can do
 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.509
again to simplify in part so we can do
some of these things better or faster

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519
some of these things better or faster
 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.129
some of these things better or faster
and so this is a more complicated

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139
and so this is a more complicated
 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.589
and so this is a more complicated
diagram of trying to break out some of

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599
diagram of trying to break out some of
 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.649
diagram of trying to break out some of
the pieces of blink and all of this work

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659
the pieces of blink and all of this work
 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.269
the pieces of blink and all of this work
is actually already underway if you're

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:30.279
is actually already underway if you're
 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:31.649
is actually already underway if you're
following the blinked at mailing list

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659
following the blinked at mailing list
 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:32.610
following the blinked at mailing list
you'll see that the

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620
you'll see that the
 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.980
you'll see that the
platform bubble is already well on its

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990
platform bubble is already well on its
 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.120
platform bubble is already well on its
way to becoming a reality and then we

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130
way to becoming a reality and then we
 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.820
way to becoming a reality and then we
even talked about even crazier you know

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830
even talked about even crazier you know
 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.000
even talked about even crazier you know
crazier to us visions of taking the core

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010
crazier to us visions of taking the core
 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.159
crazier to us visions of taking the core
rendering engine and even breaking that

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169
rendering engine and even breaking that
 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.439
rendering engine and even breaking that
down further and maybe taking parts of

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449
down further and maybe taking parts of
 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.719
down further and maybe taking parts of
that core ndering engine and instead of

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729
that core ndering engine and instead of
 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.180
that core ndering engine and instead of
having it written in really low-level

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190
having it written in really low-level
 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.430
having it written in really low-level
c++ that you know it maybe had to be 15

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440
c++ that you know it maybe had to be 15
 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.200
c++ that you know it maybe had to be 15
years ago maybe we're writing some of

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210
years ago maybe we're writing some of
 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.450
years ago maybe we're writing some of
that in JavaScript and you know moving

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460
that in JavaScript and you know moving
 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.939
that in JavaScript and you know moving
that out to you know higher level

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949
that out to you know higher level
 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.460
that out to you know higher level
abstractions yeah I'm curious one thing

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470
abstractions yeah I'm curious one thing
 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.250
abstractions yeah I'm curious one thing
I see on here is the loader and the

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260
I see on here is the loader and the
 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.080
I see on here is the loader and the
loader i believe is kind of this this

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090
loader i believe is kind of this this
 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.629
loader i believe is kind of this this
thing that there's a lot of mystery

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639
thing that there's a lot of mystery
 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.850
thing that there's a lot of mystery
around how it works but it was curious

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860
around how it works but it was curious
 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.310
around how it works but it was curious
how does that differ from what we're

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320
how does that differ from what we're
 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.000
how does that differ from what we're
seeing here in the fetch what's the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010
seeing here in the fetch what's the
 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.810
seeing here in the fetch what's the
what's the difference between fashion

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820
what's the difference between fashion
 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.850
what's the difference between fashion
later uh it's really just an internal

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860
later uh it's really just an internal
 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.600
later uh it's really just an internal
division fetches actually may have the

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610
division fetches actually may have the
 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.370
division fetches actually may have the
backwards on this diagram but but one is

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380
backwards on this diagram but but one is
 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.960
backwards on this diagram but but one is
the higher level primitives of like

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970
the higher level primitives of like
 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.629
the higher level primitives of like
doing a document level load and I think

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639
doing a document level load and I think
 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.340
doing a document level load and I think
fetches the lower level primitives of

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350
fetches the lower level primitives of
 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.050
fetches the lower level primitives of
like actually talking to the the

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060
like actually talking to the the
 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.629
like actually talking to the the
underlying networking sacks I gotcha so

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639
underlying networking sacks I gotcha so
 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:46.350
underlying networking sacks I gotcha so
yeah so going back to our focus one of

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360
yeah so going back to our focus one of
 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.670
yeah so going back to our focus one of
the things that we hear time and time

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680
the things that we hear time and time
 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.890
the things that we hear time and time
again is that you know we're not fast

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900
again is that you know we're not fast
 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.350
again is that you know we're not fast
enough blank and a lot of that really is

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360
enough blank and a lot of that really is
 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.270
enough blank and a lot of that really is
about getting out of the developers way

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280
about getting out of the developers way
 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.040
about getting out of the developers way
and so we talked again a lot it blink on

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050
and so we talked again a lot it blink on
 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.200
and so we talked again a lot it blink on
about how do we make the web better how

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210
about how do we make the web better how
 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.730
about how do we make the web better how
do we make the book better for for

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740
do we make the book better for for
 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.140
do we make the book better for for
mobile and specifically that's a lot

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150
mobile and specifically that's a lot
 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.279
mobile and specifically that's a lot
about getting out of the developers way

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289
about getting out of the developers way
 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.200
about getting out of the developers way
I guess the important thing here is like

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210
I guess the important thing here is like
 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.620
I guess the important thing here is like
and getting out of developers away a

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630
and getting out of developers away a
 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.050
and getting out of developers away a
good example is like an animation loop

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060
good example is like an animation loop
 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.170
good example is like an animation loop
so every time in an animation loop like

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180
so every time in an animation loop like
 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.339
so every time in an animation loop like
there's a lot of ways to animate a

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349
there's a lot of ways to animate a
 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.439
there's a lot of ways to animate a
common example is you take jquery and

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449
common example is you take jquery and
 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.480
common example is you take jquery and
you grab an element you say anime can

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490
you grab an element you say anime can
 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.279
you grab an element you say anime can
you say like left and you want to move

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289
you say like left and you want to move
 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.040
you say like left and you want to move
it left 200 pixels or something like

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050
it left 200 pixels or something like
 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.460
it left 200 pixels or something like
yeah and in every tick of the animation

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470
yeah and in every tick of the animation
 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.290
yeah and in every tick of the animation
has to happen a lot of things that the

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300
has to happen a lot of things that the
 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.850
has to happen a lot of things that the
browser has to do the browser has to run

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860
browser has to do the browser has to run
 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.460
browser has to do the browser has to run
layout has to run paint maybe s closet

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470
layout has to run paint maybe s closet
 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.159
layout has to run paint maybe s closet
layers but these are operations that

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169
layers but these are operations that
 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:36.719
layers but these are operations that
have to occur from the browser side

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729
have to occur from the browser side
 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.879
have to occur from the browser side
independent of how much JavaScript the

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889
independent of how much JavaScript the
 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.350
independent of how much JavaScript the
developers running sure and so in

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360
developers running sure and so in
 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.000
developers running sure and so in
getting out of the developers way we're

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010
getting out of the developers way we're
 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.220
getting out of the developers way we're
saying we

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230
saying we
 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.740
saying we
we want to just all the time that's

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750
we want to just all the time that's
 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.040
we want to just all the time that's
spent inside kind of the main thread the

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050
spent inside kind of the main thread the
 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.690
spent inside kind of the main thread the
developer should have control out of

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700
developer should have control out of
 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.540
developer should have control out of
control of so that the browser is kind

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550
control of so that the browser is kind
 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.660
control of so that the browser is kind
of stepping back just saying here's a

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670
of stepping back just saying here's a
 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.060
of stepping back just saying here's a
big highway do whatever you want totem

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070
big highway do whatever you want totem
 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.400
big highway do whatever you want totem
we're going to accelerate it totally and

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410
we're going to accelerate it totally and
 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.870
we're going to accelerate it totally and
that is one of the complicated things

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880
that is one of the complicated things
 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.370
that is one of the complicated things

to do fewer things in blink and we're
 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.750
to do fewer things in blink and we're
trying to do them faster and this was

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:21.760
trying to do them faster and this was
 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.450

right on all elements and it it looks
just like you used to with jquery so

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:32.950
just like you used to with jquery so

components though they're smaller so we

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:35.420
components though they're smaller so we
 

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.730
components though they're smaller so we
can understand them so we can make them

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:36.740
can understand them so we can make them
 

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.630
can understand them so we can make them
faster and of course we were working on

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640
faster and of course we were working on
 

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.180
faster and of course we were working on
performance it was very important to you

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:43.190

that one of the things that we also have
 

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:36.910
that one of the things that we also have
an active effort for is that we're

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:36.920
an active effort for is that we're
 

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.110
an active effort for is that we're
moving the page level components a blink

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120
moving the page level components a blink
 

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.010
moving the page level components a blink
up into the browser process so the blink

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:45.020
up into the browser process so the blink
 

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.510
up into the browser process so the blink

really good for security so this is

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.370
really good for security so this is
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.400
really good for security so this is
mostly driven by security this is mostly

for web developers in that regard yeah

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:19.640
for web developers in that regard yeah
 

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.430
for web developers in that regard yeah
great we're also experimenting with you

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:24.440
great we're also experimenting with you

great we're also experimenting with you
know some wild and crazy ideas of

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:25.940
know some wild and crazy ideas of
 

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.450
know some wild and crazy ideas of
unifying the garbage collection so

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:28.460
unifying the garbage collection so
 

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.860
unifying the garbage collection so

sequel spots we're trying to remove a
 

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.060
sequel spots we're trying to remove a
whole host of features some of these are

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.070
whole host of features some of these are
 

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.290
whole host of features some of these are
already gone but there's a lot more to

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:50.300
already gone but there's a lot more to
 

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.530
already gone but there's a lot more to
go yeah and you'll actually see

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:53.540
go yeah and you'll actually see
 

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.420
go yeah and you'll actually see
on blinked up on the mailing list you'll

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:55.430
on blinked up on the mailing list you'll
 

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.759
on blinked up on the mailing list you'll
see intent to remove yeah for a lot of

00:12:57.759 --> 00:12:57.769
see intent to remove yeah for a lot of
 

00:12:57.769 --> 00:13:01.290
see intent to remove yeah for a lot of
these just the most recent one was

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:01.300
these just the most recent one was

display compact maybe something like

00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639
display compact maybe something like
 

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.629
display compact maybe something like
that yeah I had no idea display run in

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639
that yeah I had no idea display run in
 

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:10.090

window back from the Netscape days oh
yeah good so there's active discussion

00:13:19.059 --> 00:13:19.069
yeah good so there's active discussion
 

00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:21.879
yeah good so there's active discussion
of those sorts of things on linkedin and

00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:21.889
of those sorts of things on linkedin and
 

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:22.780
of those sorts of things on linkedin and
again as we talked about before

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:22.790
again as we talked about before
 

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.600
again as we talked about before
rewriting parts of the engine as in

rewriting parts of the engine as in
 

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.660
rewriting parts of the engine as in
javascript or just making them modular

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:28.670
javascript or just making them modular
 

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.090
javascript or just making them modular
components we so that's more stuff that

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:31.100
components we so that's more stuff that
 

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.280
components we so that's more stuff that
we're working on in the medium term and

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:32.290
we're working on in the medium term and
 

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.680
we're working on in the medium term and
of course again performance that remains

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:35.690
of course again performance that remains
 

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.590
of course again performance that remains
our focus and then some more wild and

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600
our focus and then some more wild and
 

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.269
our focus and then some more wild and
crazy speculative things that we talked

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:40.279
crazy speculative things that we talked
 

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:43.389
crazy speculative things that we talked
about again at blink on parallel

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399
about again at blink on parallel
 

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:46.090
about again at blink on parallel
parallel execution threading for the

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:46.100
parallel execution threading for the

parallel execution threading for the
HTML parser worked really well for us

00:13:48.009 --> 00:13:48.019
HTML parser worked really well for us
 

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:49.900
HTML parser worked really well for us
and we've talked about doing some of

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:49.910
and we've talked about doing some of
 

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.150
and we've talked about doing some of
that maybe for layout for style for

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160
that maybe for layout for style for
 

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.189
that maybe for layout for style for
parsing JavaScript so this is happening

00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199
parsing JavaScript so this is happening
 

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:56.860
parsing JavaScript so this is happening
on a separate thread just basically get

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:56.870
on a separate thread just basically get
 

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.620
on a separate thread just basically get
get off in the main thread one of the

00:13:59.620 --> 00:13:59.630
get off in the main thread one of the
 

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.730
get off in the main thread one of the
things that we have to balance with that

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:00.740
things that we have to balance with that
 

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.160
things that we have to balance with that
is that your phone only has so many

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.170
is that your phone only has so many
 

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.519
is that your phone only has so many
cores and so threading doesn't

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:06.529
cores and so threading doesn't
 

00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:07.629
cores and so threading doesn't
necessarily help if you don't have a lot

00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639
necessarily help if you don't have a lot
 

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.400
necessarily help if you don't have a lot
of course but on your desktop you you

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:09.410
of course but on your desktop you you
 

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.800
of course but on your desktop you you
may have lots and lots of course so that

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:11.810
may have lots and lots of course so that
 

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.090
may have lots and lots of course so that
that's balanced and something we're

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:13.100
that's balanced and something we're
 

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.590
that's balanced and something we're
exploring in the longer term there's

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:14.600
exploring in the longer term there's
 

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.000
exploring in the longer term there's
something that like are we able to

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.010
something that like are we able to
 

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.480
something that like are we able to
measure kind of the i guess the HTML

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:19.490
measure kind of the i guess the HTML
 

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.889
measure kind of the i guess the HTML
parser is a good example where that when

00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:20.899
parser is a good example where that when
 

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:23.559
parser is a good example where that when
to the second thread yep and we able to

00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:23.569
to the second thread yep and we able to
 

00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:25.540
to the second thread yep and we able to
mend measure kind of the performance

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:25.550
mend measure kind of the performance
 

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.920
mend measure kind of the performance
impact of that especially in the case of

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:26.930
impact of that especially in the case of
 

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.680
impact of that especially in the case of
a phone with only two cores yeah we

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:29.690
a phone with only two cores yeah we
 

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.870
a phone with only two cores yeah we
actually the HTML parser rewrite them

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880
actually the HTML parser rewrite them
 

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.230
actually the HTML parser rewrite them
that we did a couple years ago now it

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240
that we did a couple years ago now it
 

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.350
that we did a couple years ago now it
turns out was a win it was I think it

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360
turns out was a win it was I think it
 

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.150
turns out was a win it was I think it
was a slight loss for a single core

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160
was a slight loss for a single core
 

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.300
was a slight loss for a single core
machine but like one or so percent but

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:43.310
machine but like one or so percent but
 

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.769
machine but like one or so percent but
for two or more cores it was like an

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:44.779
for two or more cores it was like an
 

00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:46.990
for two or more cores it was like an
eight percent or more win Wow so it was

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000
eight percent or more win Wow so it was
 

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.059
eight percent or more win Wow so it was
pretty serious and we have a lot more

00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:49.069
pretty serious and we have a lot more
 

00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:51.129
pretty serious and we have a lot more
work to do on that a lot of that win

00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:51.139
work to do on that a lot of that win
 

00:14:51.139 --> 00:14:54.100
work to do on that a lot of that win
actually was about getting you to load

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.110
actually was about getting you to load
 

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.470
actually was about getting you to load
parts of the page faster so in case a

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480
parts of the page faster so in case a
 

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.660
parts of the page faster so in case a
more while and crazy stuff just like for

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:01.670
more while and crazy stuff just like for
 

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.170
more while and crazy stuff just like for
a regular expression engine the modern

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:05.180
a regular expression engine the modern
 

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.000
a regular expression engine the modern
technique is to use just in

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.010
technique is to use just in
 

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.580
technique is to use just in
time compiling we could do the same

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:09.590
time compiling we could do the same
 

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.380
time compiling we could do the same
thing for style matching which is also

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:11.390
thing for style matching which is also
 

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.750
thing for style matching which is also
like a regular expression engine you

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760
like a regular expression engine you
 

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.310
like a regular expression engine you
know doing matching we could do you know

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320
know doing matching we could do you know
 

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.360
know doing matching we could do you know
maybe a little something like that

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:16.370
maybe a little something like that
 

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.400
maybe a little something like that
that's while I'm crazy but we have some

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:18.410
that's while I'm crazy but we have some
 

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.330
that's while I'm crazy but we have some
people thinking about it nice we've

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:22.340
people thinking about it nice we've
 

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.550
people thinking about it nice we've
talked about having a fast mode for

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560
talked about having a fast mode for
 

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.610

blank where we turn off a lot of the

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:27.620
blank where we turn off a lot of the
 

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.740
blank where we turn off a lot of the
less used features where do you have

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:29.750
less used features where do you have
 

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.880
less used features where do you have
some of this in the engine so this is

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:30.890
some of this in the engine so this is
 

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.560
some of this in the engine so this is
something like kind of a mode that you

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:32.570
something like kind of a mode that you
 

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.210
something like kind of a mode that you
opt in to kind of like strict mode and

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:34.220
opt in to kind of like strict mode and
 

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.120
opt in to kind of like strict mode and
BA where you just say okay I want to be

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:37.130
BA where you just say okay I want to be
 

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.790
BA where you just say okay I want to be
in fast mode and more stricter feature

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:39.800
in fast mode and more stricter feature
 

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.200

way off into the speculative but it's

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:51.980
way off into the speculative but it's
 

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.320
way off into the speculative but it's
it's something we're thinking about like
