Before we start coding,

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.450
let's take a look at a simple
app that uses geofencing.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.750
You can see it here and
it's very simple indeed.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.380
I've created a geofence for
the location that I'm in.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.350
This is a studio in Mountain View,
California.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.520
And I've created it with
a radius of a mile.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.180
I ran the application before I
drove into the studio today.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.680
And then once I got within a mile of
the studio, a notification was fired.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.330
And you can see the notification
icon in the tray here.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.710
And when I swipe it down,
it says I've entered UDACITY Studios, or

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.870
I've entered that geofence of UDACITY.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.250
Now, were I to leave this
one mile radius on my way

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.510
back to my hotel tonight, I would see
a notification from me having left.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.210
Now of course you don't have
to use your notification tray,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.510
you could have your activity do anything
in response to the geofencing event.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.330
The nice thing about using
the notification trays, now if I'm in my

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.950
general desktop for my Android tablet,
the notification is still there.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.240
So, I was traveling and it showed that
I entered the geofence that I want, and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.150
when I touch that,
it relaunches the application.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.470
So we're going to see next how
to build this application and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950
how to use notifications within
a geofenced environment.
