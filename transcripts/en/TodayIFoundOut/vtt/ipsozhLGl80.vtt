Why Don't Water and Oil Mix?

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.339
olive-oil-in-waterMade of different elements,
and with distinct structures, densities and

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.460
even dissimilar polarities, it’s no wonder
oil and water don’t get along.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.430
They can be forced to cooperate, however,
and there are several examples of this that

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.250
are likely currently sitting in your pantry
or refrigerator.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.860
But why don’t oil and water normally mix?

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.000
Water (H20) is a stubby molecule with a slightly
positive charge on the hydrogen (H) end, and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.100
a slightly negative charge on the oxygen (O)
end (the oxygen atom actually “steals”

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.760
electrons from the hydrogen atoms).

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.720
Called a polar molecule, the negative poles
on each water molecule are attracted to the

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.660
positive poles on other water molecules, and
as a result, they knit tightly together with

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.050
hydrogen bonds.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.620
In fact, oil floats on water because it is
less dense, with these super-tight hydrogen

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.930
bonds between water molecules holding them
closer together than the bonds between the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.580
fatty-acid molecules that primarily make up
oil.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.140
As for oil, it is a non-polar chemical.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.890
Since the atoms in the fatty acids in oil
share their electrons nicely, they (usually)

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.140
have no charge, or at least not enough to
make the whole molecule polar.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.409
Given their lack of positive or negative charge,
they are not attracted to a polar molecule

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.430
like water.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.910
Given that oil essentially “repels” the
water, it is called hydrophobic or “water

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.030
fearing,” as opposed to hydrophilic or “water
loving.”

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.310
As such, eventually all the lipophilic or
“fat loving” oil molecules will join together

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.500
floating on top of the water.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.270
However, although they seem determined to
stay apart, it is possible to mix oil and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.450
water in a more or less stable solution, and
there are several examples of this in your

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.450
kitchen.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.490
One of the more common examples where this
occurs is in salad dressing.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.890
To get the two main ingredients, vinegar (essentially
water with acetic acid) and oil, to combine

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.350
and stay that way for some amount of time
involves two steps: breaking the oil into

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.149
tiny droplets so it can be evenly dispersed
throughout the mixture, and adding a mediator,

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.219
called an emulsifier.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.359
The end solution is then known as emulsion.

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.450
Different emulsifiers work in different ways.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.999
Some, like lecithin (found in egg yolks),
have both a hydrophobic end (that oil likes)

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.670
and a hydrophilic end (that water likes);
thus capable of bonding with both oil and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.670
water.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.790
So, as long as the oil droplets are sufficiently
tiny and thoroughly dispersed (and enough

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.910
emulsifier is used) the combination of oil
and vinegar will remain as a relatively stable

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.659
blend or emulsion.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.430
On the other hand, an emulsifier like tomato
paste has protein molecules that more or less

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.329
coat the oil droplets and prevent them from
bonding together, keeping them relatively

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.250
well dispersed in the water.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.900
While it gets there differently, when well
mixed, the end result is about the same.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.200
So, when making a typical dressing, you first
mix together the emulsifier (or emulsifiers)

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.049
and the vinegar, and then slowly add a thin
stream of oil while whisking or blending vigorously

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.879
and constantly.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.799
Between the thin stream and determined whisking,
the oil will be broken into tiny drops and

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.140
dispersed; and, since the emulsifier is there
to either coat the oil or bind it to the vinegar,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:35.120
it will remain suspended in the mixture for
a good deal 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.549
of time.
