- My mom was a teacher, my
grandfather was a teacher.

00:00:03.658 --> 00:00:06.863
(light string music)

00:00:06.863 --> 00:00:09.250
And then we'll be ready to
move on to actually finding

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.123
missing angels using our
Khan Academy program.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.500
Myself growing up, '80s, '90s kid,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.120
I was like super into video games,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.054
and I really wanted to
make my own video games.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.110
(upbeat video game voice)

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.350
So I got into the computer
programming classes

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.441
and it was really cool.

00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:30.406
So just based on the
diagram you just figure out.

00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:32.260
- Everybody kept saying wow,
you explain things really well,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.580
so I ended up changing my
minor wanted to pursue teaching

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.413
full-time.

00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:36.740
Ever since then I haven't looked back.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.780
Perfect, nice job guys.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.447
(lively instrumental music)
