00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.120
We are multiplying 10a minus
3 by the entire polynomial 5a

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.567
squared plus 7a minus 1.

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:09.900
So to do this, we can just
do the distributive property.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.140
We can distribute this
entire polynomial,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.020
this entire trinomial,
times each of these terms.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.930
We could have 5a squared
plus 7a minus 1 times 10a.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.210
And then 5a squared plus 7a
minus 1 times negative 3.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.890
So let's just do that.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.319
So if we have-- so let
me just write it out.

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:32.360
Let me write it this way.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:43.900
10a times 5a squared
plus 7a minus 1.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.420
That's that right over here.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.180
And then we can have
minus 3 times 5a squared

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.710
plus 7a minus 1.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.190
And that is this
distribution right over here.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.800
And then we can simplify it.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.410
10a times 5a squared--
10 times 5 is 50.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.360
a times a squared
is a to the third.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.820
10 times 7 is 70.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.160
a times a is a squared.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.330
10a times negative
1 is negative 10a.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.070
Then we distribute this
negative 3 times all of this.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.900
Negative 3 times 5a squared
is negative 15a squared.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.280
Negative 3 times
7a is negative 21a.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.380
Negative 3 times
negative 1 is positive 3.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.950
And now we can try
to merge like terms.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.330
This is the only a to
the third term here.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.630
So this is 50a to the third.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.340
I'll just rewrite it.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.660
Now we have two a squared terms.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.810
We have 70a squared minus
15, or negative 15a squared.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.880
So we can add these two terms.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.190
70 of something minus
15 of that something

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.950
is going to be 55
of that something.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.490
So plus 55a squared.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.800
And then we also
have two a terms.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.520
We have this negative 10a, and
then we have this negative 21a.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.430
So if we go negative 10 minus
21, that is negative 31.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.170
That is negative 31a.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.290
And then finally, we only have
one constant term over here.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.520
We have this positive 3.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.610
So plus 3.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.270
And we are done.
