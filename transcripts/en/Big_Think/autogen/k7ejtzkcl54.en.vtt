so Stephanie you asked a great question

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910
so Stephanie you asked a great question
 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.120
so Stephanie you asked a great question
how likely is it that we're gonna find

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130
how likely is it that we're gonna find
 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.280
how likely is it that we're gonna find
life on a planet outside the earth in

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290
life on a planet outside the earth in
 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.470
life on a planet outside the earth in
your lifetime say in the next 40 or 50

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
your lifetime say in the next 40 or 50
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.210
your lifetime say in the next 40 or 50
years and of course this is something

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220
years and of course this is something
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.460
years and of course this is something
that nobody can answer exactly we don't

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
that nobody can answer exactly we don't
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.589
that nobody can answer exactly we don't
know that's that's the answer but I

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599
know that's that's the answer but I
 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.190
know that's that's the answer but I
think it's very likely indeed now when I

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200
think it's very likely indeed now when I
 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.080
think it's very likely indeed now when I
say light there's a lot of ways you can

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090
say light there's a lot of ways you can
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.790
say light there's a lot of ways you can
take that word you know I'm not really

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
take that word you know I'm not really
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920
take that word you know I'm not really
talking about civilizations or

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
talking about civilizations or
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.200
talking about civilizations or
spaceships or things like that I think

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
spaceships or things like that I think
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.490
spaceships or things like that I think
it's much more likely that we're going

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
it's much more likely that we're going
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.340
it's much more likely that we're going
to find microbes simple life but to me

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
to find microbes simple life but to me
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.810
to find microbes simple life but to me
that will be really really exciting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
that will be really really exciting
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.790
that will be really really exciting
there are several places in our own

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800
there are several places in our own
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860
there are several places in our own
solar system right now that we think

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
solar system right now that we think
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.869
solar system right now that we think
might be good environments for life and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
might be good environments for life and
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.180
might be good environments for life and
as I said before we haven't found proof

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
as I said before we haven't found proof
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.430
as I said before we haven't found proof
of life yet but we've found some very

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
of life yet but we've found some very
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.770
of life yet but we've found some very
very interesting things for example on

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
very interesting things for example on
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.259
very interesting things for example on
Mars Mars has an atmosphere it's much

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269
Mars Mars has an atmosphere it's much
 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.059
Mars Mars has an atmosphere it's much
thinner than the Earth's but is still

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069
thinner than the Earth's but is still
 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:00.889
thinner than the Earth's but is still
there we think there might even be water

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
there we think there might even be water
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479
there we think there might even be water
underneath the surface of Mars and

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
underneath the surface of Mars and
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.520
underneath the surface of Mars and
recently we've detected organic

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
recently we've detected organic
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.410
recently we've detected organic
molecules which are sort of the building

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
molecules which are sort of the building
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.200
molecules which are sort of the building
blocks of our chemistry on Mars as well

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210
blocks of our chemistry on Mars as well
 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.820
blocks of our chemistry on Mars as well
it's possible that the surface of Mars

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830
it's possible that the surface of Mars
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.890
it's possible that the surface of Mars
itself is not a very good place for life

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900
itself is not a very good place for life
 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.680
itself is not a very good place for life
but maybe underneath meters under the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690
but maybe underneath meters under the
 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.080
but maybe underneath meters under the
soil in the rock you could find bacteria

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
soil in the rock you could find bacteria
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.390
soil in the rock you could find bacteria
and there are a lot of analogs to this

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
and there are a lot of analogs to this
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.340
and there are a lot of analogs to this
on earth similar things on earth we find

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
on earth similar things on earth we find
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.590
on earth similar things on earth we find
bacteria that can exist it's a mild

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
bacteria that can exist it's a mild
 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270
bacteria that can exist it's a mild
under the earth we find these things in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
under the earth we find these things in
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160
under the earth we find these things in
gold mines very very deep under the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
gold mines very very deep under the
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.200
gold mines very very deep under the
earth you break open the rocks and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
earth you break open the rocks and
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.940
earth you break open the rocks and
there's actually bacteria living in the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
there's actually bacteria living in the
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.280
there's actually bacteria living in the
rocks very far down into the earth and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
rocks very far down into the earth and
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.900
rocks very far down into the earth and
there are other places in the outer

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910
there are other places in the outer
 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.310
there are other places in the outer
solar system that we think are great

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320
solar system that we think are great
 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.560
solar system that we think are great
environments for life - there are moons

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
environments for life - there are moons
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.230
environments for life - there are moons
of Jupiter and Saturn that we know have

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
of Jupiter and Saturn that we know have
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.200
of Jupiter and Saturn that we know have
liquid water oceans for example Europa

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210
liquid water oceans for example Europa
 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.970
liquid water oceans for example Europa
is a moon of Jupiter and we know that

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980
is a moon of Jupiter and we know that
 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.340
is a moon of Jupiter and we know that
Europa has vast reservoirs of liquid

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
Europa has vast reservoirs of liquid
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.470
Europa has vast reservoirs of liquid
water that are protected by a shell of

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480
water that are protected by a shell of
 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.990
water that are protected by a shell of
ice in fact it's one moon of Jupiter

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
ice in fact it's one moon of Jupiter
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.150
ice in fact it's one moon of Jupiter
Europa actually has far more liquid

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160
Europa actually has far more liquid
 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.220
Europa actually has far more liquid
water on it than earth does and there

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230
water on it than earth does and there
 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.450
water on it than earth does and there
are some suggestions that there might be

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
are some suggestions that there might be
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.670
are some suggestions that there might be
interesting chemistry as well there's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
interesting chemistry as well there's
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.140
interesting chemistry as well there's
also a moon of Saturn called Enceladus

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150
also a moon of Saturn called Enceladus
 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.120
also a moon of Saturn called Enceladus
and the same thing applies there's a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
and the same thing applies there's a
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.089
and the same thing applies there's a
liquid water ocean under ice and in the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
liquid water ocean under ice and in the
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.619
liquid water ocean under ice and in the
case of Enceladus you actually have

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
case of Enceladus you actually have
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.539
case of Enceladus you actually have
cracks in the ice that the water is

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549
cracks in the ice that the water is
 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.339
cracks in the ice that the water is
flying out of and turning into ice

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349
flying out of and turning into ice
 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.920
flying out of and turning into ice
crystals we actually flew our Cassini

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
crystals we actually flew our Cassini
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.520
crystals we actually flew our Cassini
space

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
space
 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.740

crafts through these Jets coming out of

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
crafts through these Jets coming out of
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.780
crafts through these Jets coming out of
Enceladus and we detected organic

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790
Enceladus and we detected organic
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.210
Enceladus and we detected organic
molecules so we know that there is warm

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220
molecules so we know that there is warm
 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.100
molecules so we know that there is warm
saltwater there's interesting chemistry

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
saltwater there's interesting chemistry
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.870
saltwater there's interesting chemistry
it's a great place to go looking for

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880
it's a great place to go looking for
 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.610
it's a great place to go looking for
life and there's another moon of Saturn

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
life and there's another moon of Saturn
 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.980
life and there's another moon of Saturn
too called Titan which is very different

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990
too called Titan which is very different
 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.840
too called Titan which is very different
from that it has an atmosphere we

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850
from that it has an atmosphere we
 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.250
from that it has an atmosphere we
actually think that there are lakes of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260
actually think that there are lakes of
 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.410
actually think that there are lakes of
methane not water but actually liquid

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
methane not water but actually liquid
 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.390
methane not water but actually liquid
methane on the surface and below that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400
methane on the surface and below that
 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.979
methane on the surface and below that
there's probably liquid water underneath

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
there's probably liquid water underneath
 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.010
there's probably liquid water underneath
so you have liquid water you have

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020
so you have liquid water you have
 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.199
so you have liquid water you have
organics you have an atmosphere maybe

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209
organics you have an atmosphere maybe
 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.790
organics you have an atmosphere maybe
that'd be a great place to go looking

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800
that'd be a great place to go looking
 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.370
that'd be a great place to go looking
for some microbes so some people say

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380
for some microbes so some people say
 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.199
for some microbes so some people say
that's not very exciting you know we're

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209
that's not very exciting you know we're
 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.360
that's not very exciting you know we're
not gonna find aliens in the sense of

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370
not gonna find aliens in the sense of
 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.820
not gonna find aliens in the sense of
spaceships and you know Klingons and any

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830
spaceships and you know Klingons and any
 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.190
spaceships and you know Klingons and any
science fiction you want I for one

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
science fiction you want I for one
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.710
science fiction you want I for one
though I'm gonna be very excited when we

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720
though I'm gonna be very excited when we
 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.690
though I'm gonna be very excited when we
find any evidence of life outside the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
find any evidence of life outside the
 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.340
find any evidence of life outside the
earth I actually have a bottle of

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350
earth I actually have a bottle of
 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.900
earth I actually have a bottle of
champagne chilling because I think it

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910
champagne chilling because I think it
 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.030
champagne chilling because I think it
could happen almost any day when some of

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040
could happen almost any day when some of
 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.770
could happen almost any day when some of
our Rovers are some of our satellites

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780
our Rovers are some of our satellites
 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.120
our Rovers are some of our satellites
around other planets come back with

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130
around other planets come back with
 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.340
around other planets come back with
really interesting data think about the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350
really interesting data think about the
 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.370
really interesting data think about the
questions we can answer does life even

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380
questions we can answer does life even
 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.440
questions we can answer does life even
if it's at a bacterial level even if

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
if it's at a bacterial level even if
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.330
if it's at a bacterial level even if
it's just a tiny little bit of life does

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340
it's just a tiny little bit of life does
 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.180
it's just a tiny little bit of life does
it have DNA is it similar to us is it

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190
it have DNA is it similar to us is it
 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.150
it have DNA is it similar to us is it
different from us we finally have the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160
different from us we finally have the
 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.880
different from us we finally have the
next example of how life can form and

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890
next example of how life can form and
 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.920
next example of how life can form and
how life can evolve and our view of the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930
how life can evolve and our view of the
 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.360
how life can evolve and our view of the
universe will never be the same again

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370
universe will never be the same again
 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.420
universe will never be the same again
and my bet is that's going to happen in

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430
and my bet is that's going to happen in
 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.970
and my bet is that's going to happen in
the next 50 years

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980
the next 50 years
 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.230
the next 50 years
