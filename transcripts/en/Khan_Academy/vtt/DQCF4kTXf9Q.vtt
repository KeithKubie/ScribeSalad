00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.580
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.420
is talk about significance
levels which are denoted

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.190
by the Greek letter alpha

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.680
and we're gonna talk about two things,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.410
the different conclusions you might make

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.010
based on the different significance levels

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.010
that you might set and also
why it's important to set

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.330
your significance levels ahead of time,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.840
before you conduct an experiment
and calculate the p-values,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.090
for, frankly, ethical purposes.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.420
So to help us get this,
let's look at a scenario

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.230
right over here which tells us

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.650
Rahim heard that spinning,
rather than flipping,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.734
a penny raises the probability above 50%

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.410
that the penny lands showing heads.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.050
That's actually quite
fascinating if that's true.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.680
He tested this by spinning
10 different pennies

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.700
10 times each, so that would
be a total of a hundred spins.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.170
His hypotheses were, his
null hypothesis is that

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.010
by spinning, your
proportion doesn't change

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.520
rather versus flipping, it's still 50%

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.170
and his alternative hypothesis
is that by spinning,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.740
your proportion of heads
is greater than 50%,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.240
where p is the true proportion of spins

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.730
that a penny would land showing heads.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.550
In his 100 spins, the penny landed

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.020
showing heads in 59 spins.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350
Rahim calculated that the statistic,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.570
so this is the sample proportion here,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.330
it's 59 out of a hundred
were heads so that's 0.59

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.410
or 59 hundredths, and he calculated

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.210
had an associated p-value
of approximately 0.036.

00:01:29.087 --> 00:01:33.050
So based on this scenario,
if ahead of time,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.360
Rahim had set his
significance level at 0.05,

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.330
what conclusions would he now make?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.820
And while you're pausing
it, think about how

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.710
that may or may not have been different

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.615
if he set his significance
levels ahead of time at 0.01.

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:53.870
Pause the video and
try to figure that out.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.070
So let's first of all remind ourselves

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.610
what a p-value even is.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.570
You could view it as the probability

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.180
of getting a sample
proportion at least this large

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.200
if you assume that the
null hypothesis is true.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.162
And if that is low enough,

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:12.120
if it's below some threshold,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.770
which is our significance level,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.930
then we will reject the null hypothesis.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.270
And so in this scenario,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.270
we do see that 0.036, our p-value
is indeed less than alpha.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.760
It is indeed less than 0.05

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.660
and because of that, we would
reject the null hypothesis.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.610
And in everyday language,
rejecting the null hypothesis

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.380
is rejecting the notion that
the true proportion of spins

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.170
that a penny would land
showing heads is 50%.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.240
And if you reject your null hypothesis,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.240
you could also say that suggests
our alternative hypothesis

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.060
that the true proportion of spins

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.940
that a penny would land showing
heads is greater than 50%.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.040
Now what about the situation

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.410
where our significance level was lower?

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.643
Well in this situation, our p-value,

00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:12.240
our probability of getting
that sample statistic

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.480
if we assumed our null
hypothesis were true,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.110
in this situation, it's
greater than or equal to,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.650
and it's greater than in
this particular situation,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.190
than our threshold, than
our significance level.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.200
And so here, we would say that we fail

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.200
to reject our null hypothesis
so we're failing to reject

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.640
this right over here and
it will not help us suggest

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.840
our alternative hypothesis.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.530
And so because of the difference

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.420
between what you would conclude

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.760
given this change in significance levels,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.150
that's why it's really important

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.610
to set these levels ahead of time

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.830
because you could imagine
it's human nature,

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.080
if you're a researcher of some kind,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.300
you want to have an interesting result.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.810
You want to discover something,

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.070
you want to be able to tell your friends,

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.410
hey, my alternative hypothesis
it actually is suggested,

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.560
we can reject the
assumption, the status quo.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.140
I found something that
actually makes a difference

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.670
and so it's very tempting for a researcher

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.890
to calculate your p-values and then say

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.670
oh, well maybe no one will notice

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.740
if I then set my significance values

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.300
so that it's just high enough

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.930
so that I can reject my null hypothesis.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.700
If you did that, that
would be very unethical.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.120
In future videos, we'll start
thinking about the question of

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.500
okay, if I'm doing it ahead of time,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.070
if I'm setting my significance
level ahead of time,

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.860
how do I decide to set the threshold?

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.260
When should it be one-hundredths?

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.450
When should it be five-hundredths?

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.560
When should it be 10-hundredths?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.490
Or when should it be something else?
