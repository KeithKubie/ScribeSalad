00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.367
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:08.270
CHADE-MENG TAN: My friends,
thanks for being here.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.940
I recognize a few
faces-- some old friends,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.610
some from last week
when I was here.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.070
I want to start with success.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.340
There turns out to be a
surprising relationship

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.410
between happiness and success.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.460
When I was growing
up in Singapore,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.900
right here in Singapore--
I mean, I'm Asian--

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.720
and I was growing up, it was
drilled into my thick skull

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.810
that the relationship
between happiness and success

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.130
is this, which is when someday,
when I become successful,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.820
I'll be happy.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.670
Therefore, for now, just suffer.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.690
Work hard, study hard,
suffer, suffer, suffer.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.840
Some day, when
you're successful,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.100
then you'll be happy.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.470
Yay.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.710
Things didn't quite
work that way.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.170
I think have a lot
of friends who--

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.470
I'm sure you all do as
well-- I have friends who are

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.849
very successful but miserable.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.780
And then I read the literature,
because all this has

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.110
been researched for a
while, and the studies

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.610
show that success leads
to happiness in only one

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.590
situation, one and
only one situation,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.910
which is escape from poverty.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.350
So if you're poor, and then
you go from poor to not poor,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.340
so go from poor to middle
class, where you don't even

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.039
worry about food or clothing
or shelter and so on,

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.580
you go from poor to
not poor, there's

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.000
a huge difference
in happiness levels.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.220
If you go from poor, sorry, if
you go from not poor to rich,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.530
so go from middle class
to rich, some difference.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.360
Not that much difference.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.101
If you go from rich to very
rich, even less difference.

00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:50.600
Why?

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.683
It turns out there's a
very simple explanation-- b

00:01:52.683 --> 00:01:55.500
because you only
have one body each.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.700
There's a limit to how
much you can consume.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.907
It's like a $2 hamburger
versus $100 caviar.

00:02:01.907 --> 00:02:02.740
Is there difference?

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.630
Yes, some difference.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.700
Not that much difference.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.280
$100 caviar, $1,000 caviar--
not that much difference, right?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.290
So there's kind of
an asymptotic peak.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.200
So a lot of my friends,
when they grew up,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.290
they made sacrifices,
they become successful,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.590
and then they find that
they're sort of peaking

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.990
and they keep earning more
money, but they're not happier,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.980
and in fact they're miserable.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.130
It turns out that
the reverse is true,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.180
which is that it turns out that
happiness leads to success.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.350
And that's fascinating.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.641
And there's even a word for it.

00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:42.480
The word is the
happiness advantage,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.960
which is that, for example,
our [INAUDIBLE] that happiness

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.870
brings about is
conducive to success.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.200
For example, it turns
out that if you're happy,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.900
you are 37% more
effective in sales.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.530
And retroactively, it make
sense, when you think about it.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.530
If there are two guys,
same price, same product,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.890
so everything equal, one guy
you see him, he's always happy,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.110
the other guy seems always
grumpy, who do you buy from?

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.470
You buy from the first
guy 37% more of the time.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.750
So it's been quantified.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.208
I mean, the fact that it's been
quantified was fascinating.

00:03:19.034 --> 00:03:20.450
The other quality
is, for example,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.810
optimism, which relates
to job happiness.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.040
This was an early study
from Martin Seligman, who

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.540
was a famous pioneer
in positive psychology,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.470
and this was the study
that made him famous.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.930
So the study was that
there was a lot turnover

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.030
in insurance agents in MetLife.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.090
So in order to become
an insurance agent,

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.010
you had to take a test, and
then you could pass a test,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.010
and you get a job.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.740
So there are people
who just failed a test,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.840
and Marty convinced
MetLife to hire

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.330
those people, who, among
those people, who score high

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.460
in optimism.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.730
And those will turn out to
outperform those who passed

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.270
the test by a factor of 50%.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.370
That's fascinating.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.230
Happiness also causes you to
be more productive, according

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.740
to studies, by about
30% because they

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.820
seem to be more accurate
on their work by about 19%.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.769
It also correlates with good
health because of popularity,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.170
which is not surprising.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.837
Again, same thing,
your friend was

00:04:23.837 --> 00:04:25.670
always grumpy, your
friend was always happy,

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.044
who do you want
to hang out with?

00:04:27.044 --> 00:04:29.150
That happy guy.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.825
And of course, popularity
also feeds back to success.

00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:34.635
If everybody loves you, long
term, they want to help you.

00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:35.760
They want to work with you.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.920
So you must accept.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.569
So this is the relationship--
success doesn't necessarily

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.610
bring people happiness,
but in general, happiness

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.490
does bring about success.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.040
So it makes sense to
learn to be happy.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.300
And because of-- everything
I just said, by the way,

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.150
will be totally useless if it
turns out that happiness is

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.350
something that we cannot
do anything about.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.450
You're born miserable
or you're born happy,

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.910
and you're born
miserable, then I'm sorry,

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.339
that sucks to be you.

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:09.880
If that's the case,
everything I just

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.880
said is not just
a waste of time,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.640
it's also very discouraging.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.760
So if I'm unhappy, I won't
be successful, right?

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.790
It turns out one of the
most important things

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.410
I ever learned in my
life is that happiness

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.900
is highly trainable.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.900
And the way happiness
is trainable--

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.310
I move this over there so I
can move-- the way happiness is

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.200
trainable is through joy.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.456
So first, what's the difference?

00:05:40.456 --> 00:05:42.080
For happiness, I'm
using the definition

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.850
by Matthew Ricard, who is
known as the happiest man

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.980
in the world.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.742
And he wrote a whole
book about happiness.

00:05:48.742 --> 00:05:51.200
And in his book, he defined
happiness like this-- happiness

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.690
is defined as a deep
flourishing, a deep sense

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.650
of flourishing that comes from
an exceptionally healthy mind,

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.070
not a mode, not a
fleeting feeling,

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.390
not an emotion, but an
optimal state of being.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.730
So there is happiness.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.430
In contrast, joy is
moment to moment.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.830
Joy is an emotion,
joy is fleeting.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.100
So it's a moment to
moment, there's an emotion.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.280
So the relationship
between the two-- happiness

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.030
is something you
take-- it's kind

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.710
of like integrate-- something
you integrate over time.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.560
But for example, you
say, have a happy day.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.930
Doesn't mean every
moment is nice.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.380
There are some moments
which are not so nice.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.020
For example, you kind
of miss your first train

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.270
and you have to wait three
minutes for the next train,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.054
it's kinda annoying.

00:06:44.054 --> 00:06:46.470
And you were just having lunch,
minding your own business,

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.300
and your friend forced you to
come here and listen to me,

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.130
things like that.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.060
But then at the end
of the day you think,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.020
today is a happy day as a whole.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.220
So it's taken as a whole.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.300
In contrast, joy
is moment a moment.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.420
This moment is joyful,
this moment not.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.830
And the relationship is
that, therefore, happiness

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.867
doesn't mean that
every moment is joyful.

00:07:07.867 --> 00:07:10.450
A happy life doesn't mean that
every moment in life be joyful.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.850
However, there is no such
thing as joyless happiness.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.210
Therefore, joy is the
building block of happiness.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.140
Therefore, if you
train to access joy,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.520
then you can build happiness.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.420
And it turns out access to
joy is highly trainable.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.000
And that was, to me, that
was the mind blowing part.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.620
You can train to
access joy on demand.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.120
But with sufficient
training, you

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:47.840
can find it anytime, at
this, at any moment, joy.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.440
The question is, how?

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.290
It turns out there are
very easy steps to do it.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.490
And there are three
steps to do this.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:02.390
The first step is
easing into joy.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:10.350
When it comes to easing,
the idea is to rest the mind

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.270
Come on in, there's
seats over there.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.290
We were a little
worried that we wouldn't

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.831
know enough people coming, so
we didn't have too many chairs.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.397
Now we need more chairs.

00:08:22.397 --> 00:08:24.230
And I can say that
because I'm the chairman.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:32.919
Where was I?

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.870
OK, easing.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.039
So easing is about
resting the mind.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:43.940
And then when the mind is
at rest, joy may arise.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.010
And with enough training,
it becomes reliable.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.700
When the mind is at
rest, joy will arise.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.500
And when the joy arises, you use
the joy to reinforce the ease,

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.480
because a joyful mind is a
mind at ease, easy to settle.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.320
And then, using the ease,
again, to reinforce the joy.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.920
And it becomes a very
powerful, virtuous cycle.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.246
Shall we do a short experiment?

00:09:08.246 --> 00:09:09.620
This will only
take five seconds,

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.210
so if you don't like it,
in five seconds, it's over.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.860
For five seconds,
I want to do this--

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.250
I want to bring forward
tension to one breath.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.630
So here's the instruction--
total but gentle attention

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.270
to one breath, one in
breath, one out breath.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.910
And you're done.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.910
Sounds good?

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.840
OK, beginning now.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.345
Thank you.

00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:44.970
How many of you,
after that one breath,

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.700
find that you're a little
bit calmer, a little bit more

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.277
relaxed than before the breath.

00:09:49.277 --> 00:09:50.360
Let's see a show of hands.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.670
Good, almost everybody.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.510
Question-- why is
it so powerful?

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.900
It's only one breath, how
does one breath already

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.040
have an impact?

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.400
There are two reasons,
one's physiological,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.070
one's psychological.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.070
The physiological reason is
that when you bring attention

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.840
to one breath, do you
notice that you are

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.990
breathing slower and deeper?

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.130
And when you did that, you're
stimulating your vagus nerve.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.590
When you stimulate
the vagus nerve,

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.980
you're activating something
called the relaxation response.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.030
And when you do that,
the relaxation response

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.900
is the direct opposite
of the stress response.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.750
So therefore, in
the first breath,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.550
already your blood
pressure is going down,

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.830
your heart rate is going down,
and your muscles are loosening,

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:36.660
less tense.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.150
So already, in one breath,
you can feel the difference.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.275
That is the
physiological effect.

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:45.400
There's another effect
which is even more powerful,

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.130
and that's a
psychological effect.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:52.600
Psychologically,
to be regretful,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.170
you need to be in the past.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.680
To worry, you need
to be in the future.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.010
When you bring total
attention to one breath,

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.172
for the duration of one
breath, you are in the present,

00:11:07.172 --> 00:11:08.130
totally in the present.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.780
And because you are
totally in the present,

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.696
you are not in the past
and not in the future,

00:11:11.696 --> 00:11:16.330
and therefore, you are
free from worry and regret.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.670
Freedom from worry
and regret, even

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.540
for the duration of
one breath, that alone

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.510
makes a difference, right?

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.690
I think a lot of you are-- let
me see, probably 100% of you

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.510
are high achievers.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.510
And some percentage of you are
people with big responsibility.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.100
So my guess is that
roughly 100% of you

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:42.220
are carrying worry and
regret all day every day.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.160
And in this one breath, you
get to release that load, even

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.410
for just one breath.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.260
Then you bring it
back up, of course,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:56.779
but that one breath allows you
to recover, allows you to rest.

00:11:56.779 --> 00:11:58.320
So if you can do
this, we can sustain

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.194
this for more than one
breath, three breaths,

00:12:00.194 --> 00:12:01.721
make it 15 seconds of rest.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.970
And then you can do it for
more than that, one minute,

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.850
two minutes, and then your
body and mind get to rest.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.390
And that is how you get ease.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:13.000
And then, in the
ease, you find joy,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.200
because the mind is free
from worry and regret,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.500
and there is a joyful
quality to this.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.185
So one question that comes often
is how powerful can this be?

00:12:22.185 --> 00:12:23.310
I'm going to take a moment.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.910
[BREATHES]

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:24.410
OK.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:24.750
I'm a little bit better.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.458
Got back to work.

00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:27.430
Nothing changed.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.960
How powerful is this?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.370
It turns out to be a lot more
powerful than even I expected.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.341
A long time ago, I read this
research on tennis players.

00:12:37.341 --> 00:12:38.840
So these are the
best tennis players

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.160
in the world, those who
win the grand slams.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.410
The question is, what
distinguishes them?

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.490
And the quality that
distinguishes them

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:46.720
was very surprising.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.630
It is the ability to rest
body and mine between points.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.960
So between points
there's 10 to 15 seconds.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.760
And then they're able to use
the technique you just learned,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.660
but they master it
so they can rest body

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.260
so that by the end
of 10 to 15 seconds,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.350
they are more
rested than before.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.890
And because of that, they
can sustain high performance

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:13.080
over and over again, which is
how they win the grand slams.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.870
It was fascinating.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.240
So I read that.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.130
I was fascinated, but I couldn't
really write in the book

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.020
because I haven't actually met
a world class tennis player,

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.250
so I couldn't verify it.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.320
And then one fine
day, I met this guy,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.040
and his name is Novak.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.670
And Novak is, I don't know,
the best player in the history

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.970
of a game or something.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.520
So I met him, we went
to initial courtesies,

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.060
and then immediately, the first
question I asked him was this--

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.380
I told him what I just told
you, and said, is it true?

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.690
And Novak said yes, it's true.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:53.960
And he says, at my level, tennis
is no longer a physical game.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.830
Tennis is a mental game.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.040
And the secret to
winning is the ability

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.460
to stay calm and
clear all the time.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.160
So this skill is a
very simple skill,

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.240
but the implication, at
least for success, is broad,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.880
is very broad and
very deep, right?

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.177
It can make you the best
tennis player in the world.

00:14:14.177 --> 00:14:14.760
Not just that.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.000
It's also even for
office workers.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.670
It's obvious how well
it can do for you.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.570
And I think it does for you.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.690
This faculty is a
faculty of leadership.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.810
One important part of
leadership is the ability

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.810
to think under fire,
especially in the military--

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.640
in the military, and
in the police force,

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.890
literally under fire.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:38.680
But in this case, figurative
under fire, in a crisis,

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.530
if all your colleagues, all
your coworkers are panicking

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:46.150
and you alone can think clearly,
then you are the leader.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.030
Everyone looks at you, and they
say, oh, that guy, [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.285
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.567
Right?

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.150
I mean, some of us
are born with this,

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.060
but it turns out it's
a trainable skill,

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.518
and the training comes from
this-- it comes from an ability

00:15:06.518 --> 00:15:08.930
to calm the mind on demand.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.030
In addition, I think the
biggest impact of this

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:17.880
is a consequence of--
it has to do with joy.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.162
When the mind-- when
you're able to bring

00:15:20.162 --> 00:15:21.870
the mind to a state
that's calm and clear

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:28.160
and you do it on demand, you may
find-- or in my case, reliably,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.280
I find that I'm joyful, happy.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:37.550
And there was a time where even
once I got access reliably,

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.130
so that means that every time
I sit in meditation, in two

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.870
or three seconds,
I can get the joy.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.260
I didn't know why.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.850
It made no sense to me.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.500
Why would a calm and clear
mind always be joyful?

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.200
So I asked around.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.010
One of my teachers gave
me a brilliant answer.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.400
And he said, it's very simple.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.880
Joy is the default
state of mind.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.870
Therefore, when the
mind is calm and clear,

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.130
it returns to default. And
that's joy, simple as that.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.545
No magic, no mystery.

00:16:08.545 --> 00:16:09.440
I It's holy.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.100
That was a life
changing insight.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.760
And specifically--
so later on, I

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.750
read up on the theory behind it.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.010
Specifically, there
is a quality of mind

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.280
and a technical term in the
Pali language-- it's sukha,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:33.380
S U K H A. Sukha is a quality
of mind as defined as quiet joy,

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.279
oh, sorry,
non-energetic joy, joy

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.445
that doesn't require energy.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.290
It has two characteristics--
because it doesn't require

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.850
energy, I compare it
to the hum of the air

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.990
conditioning in the room.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.430
The hum is always there, but
normally you don't notice.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.480
The only way to
notice the hum is

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.932
to quiet down and pay attention.

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:58.390
And once you hear that, you
find it's always there, and has

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:04.520
always been there, and always
will be there-- very annoying

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.280
Sukha is the same.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.260
It's a quality of mind as
always there, always been there.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.000
Are so the first thing
about non-energetic joy,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.550
non-energetic means
it's very subtle.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.300
Because it's very subtle,
the only way to access it

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.710
is quiet down and pay attention.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.510
Second characteristic--
because it's non-energetic,

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.430
it is extremely sustainable.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.550
Once you learn to access it,
you find that it's always there.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.760
It's always there for you.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.410
And then you have a
reliable source of joy

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.720
to-- what do you call it--
it's called bringing water

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.310
from a well.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:46.990
Anyway, to get the benefit
from, any time of day, any day.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.360
And that is life changing,
because we go through life

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.960
thinking we need to
pursue happiness,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.834
and you see even in the
American Constitution

00:17:53.834 --> 00:17:55.130
the pursuit of happiness.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.200
And then when we
go through this,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.690
we realize that happiness is not
something you need to pursue.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.130
Happiness is already
there, it's something

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.670
we just have to allow.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.210
And once you can
access it, we are free,

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.770
we have freedom, we are
free from being bonded

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.320
by what we have to
do to become happy,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.680
because we're already happy.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.220
So now we can do what
is the right thing.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.910
So that changed my life.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.000
And that is only step one.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:25.804
But wait, there's more.

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:27.470
If you buy it now you
get two more steps

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.371
for $19.99 plus
shipping and handling.

00:18:29.371 --> 00:18:32.668
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.965
It's another [INAUDIBLE]
by the way, which is

00:18:37.965 --> 00:18:40.860
it raises baseline happiness.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.370
So for me, my own
experience is--

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:49.380
let me check my time-- my own
experience is when I was young,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.361
I was miserable.

00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:52.360
I think it was genetics.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.370
Genetically, I was born with a
low baseline, a low happiness

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:56.887
baseline.

00:18:56.887 --> 00:18:59.220
And I'm one of those people
who, when they were injured,

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.380
looked at my chart before
I was born, say, sorry,

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.300
sucks to be you, sorry.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:05.880
Goodbye, bro.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.170
So the way I experienced it
is that if nothing happens,

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.967
I was miserable.

00:19:13.967 --> 00:19:15.800
And then something good
had to happen for me

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.350
to not be miserable, but that
only last a short while, couple

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.070
days or whatever,
couple hours, and then

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.910
back to being miserable,
I'm always miserable.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.200
And a couple years later,
I discovered the reverse.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.750
I discover I'm always happy.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.550
My baseline happiness shifted.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.780
Nothing happens, I'm jolly.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.710
In fact, I became a
jolly good fellow.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:37.542
It's fascinating.

00:19:37.542 --> 00:19:38.250
And what changed?

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.940
What change was this,
was finding sukha,

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.819
getting reliable access to
it, and then, eventually,

00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:45.860
my happiness baseline just
kept moving up and up.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.770
And before I knew it,
it crept up all the way

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:51.530
from one side of the
spectrum to the other side.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.490
But anyway, that's
only step one.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.670
Step two is inclining
the mind to what?

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.420
Joy.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.200
So what does that mean?

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.790
The word inclining here
refers to mental inclination,

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.480
changing mental inclination.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.140
So in the old texts, in
the ancient scriptures,

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.860
mental inclination is compared
to the slope of a mountain.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.770
When a mountain is sloped in a
certain way, when water flows,

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:23.260
it flows effortlessly
in that direction.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.910
Same thing with the mind.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:27.790
If the mind is inclined
towards a certain way,

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.820
mental experiences
flow effortlessly

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.530
towards a direction.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.890
For example, if you are
inclined towards anger,

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:40.060
every other thing makes
you angry effortlessly.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.430
But if your mind is
inclined towards joy,

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.370
every other thing
makes you joyful.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:52.430
The question is, is it possible
to change in condition of mind?

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.740
Turns out it's yes.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.490
And the other question is how?

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.670
If yes, how?

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.310
Turns out, again, one
of the surprises for me

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.660
was that the methodology is
actually very, very simple.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.220
One of the most effective
ways, and simplest

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:14.030
and most powerful ways is to
notice thin slices of joy.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:14.700
That is all.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.586
So what does that mean?

00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:18.710
In life, in day to day
life, moment to moment life,

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.590
you notice that thin slices of
joy everywhere, all the time.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:29.150
For example, when I'm
thirsty, I drink water.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.410
That was nice.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.520
I just experienced
a thin slice of joy.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.010
It's thin in two dimensions.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.592
The first is thin spatially,
so it wasn't like, yay,

00:21:39.592 --> 00:21:41.436
it was like, eh.

00:21:41.436 --> 00:21:43.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:48.210
Second, it lasted only two
seconds, maybe three seconds,

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.910
didn't last that long.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.784
And because they're so thin,
we miss them all the time.

00:21:53.784 --> 00:21:55.000
We miss them all the time.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.790
And therefore, we
look at our days,

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.660
say, this day I was miserable,
no joy at all, because we

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.840
didn't see all these things.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.400
What if you see that?

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.250
So let's say we play a
game, right, we play a game.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.375
Let's say we count the
number of blue cars,

00:22:08.375 --> 00:22:11.000
and those who count the highest
number of blue cars in one week

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.110
wins a prize.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.280
I give you a prize.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.915
So, OK, what's the prize?

00:22:14.915 --> 00:22:16.290
At first, I was
going to give you

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.262
a bell, by then I think to
myself, no bell, please.

00:22:20.262 --> 00:22:21.720
So you get a no
bell, please prize.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.934
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:22.934 --> 00:22:25.600
It was very funny when I said it
in front of a Nobel Peace Prize

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.210
winner.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.710
She thought it was very funny.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.330
Anyway, we play the game.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.785
What would happen after that?

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:35.035
If you played the game, you
find that you-- first, you

00:22:35.035 --> 00:22:36.950
start noticing blue
cars, one car, two cars,

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.450
and you find it everywhere,
every time you're in traffic,

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.880
you see blue cars everywhere,
never noticed them before.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.240
Same thing here.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.490
When you start noticing
thin slices of joy,

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.190
you start to find every way.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:53.140
Every drink of water,
there's a thin slice of joy.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.940
Every meal, at least
the very first bite, oh,

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.790
delicious, thin slice of joy.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.340
You meet an old friend,
there's a thin slice of joy,

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.760
and new friend,
thing slice of joy.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.430
Even simple things like
walking, walking without pain.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.549
Seeing the beautiful sight.

00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:15.590
You notice I was standing
there when you came in,

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:16.394
looking at a sight.

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:17.810
I mean, I've been
here many times,

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.640
but still, these lights are joy.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.010
Can I assign
homework, by the way?

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.260
This is the homework.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.740
Homework-- I want you to
notice thin slices of joy

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.480
in daily life.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.150
When you're eating, the very
first bite, the very first bite

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.830
is the most delicious.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.150
So at the very first
bite, bring full attention

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.580
to the joy of taste.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.240
Sounds good?

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.420
Every time you see a friend,
bring one moment of attention

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.330
to the joy of seeing a friend.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:57.140
When you have a shower,
the first contact of water,

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.100
one moment of joy.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.090
When drinking water,
one moment of joy.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.320
Can you do that?

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.700
Let's see what happens.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.533
If you do it for a few
days, I guarantee you

00:24:06.533 --> 00:24:07.620
it will change your life.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.700
You'll be happier.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.750
So the first effect of that
is that if you find more joy,

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.382
your joy doubles--
nothing changes,

00:24:17.382 --> 00:24:18.840
your life remains
exactly the same,

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.190
your joy doubles already
just by noticing.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.920
However, there is
another effect which

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.530
is even more powerful
if you do this,

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.330
which is the familiarization.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.300
When the mind starts
to see joy a lot,

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.450
the mind becomes
familiar with joy.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.860
And the word familiar is
related closely related

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.100
to the word family.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:45.210
So the joy becomes a member
of our family, somebody

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.200
who is always there
for you, somebody

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.620
you can always count on.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:54.420
And then, because of that, joy
becomes an inclination of mine.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:59.672
And once inclined, every
other experience is joyful.

00:24:59.672 --> 00:25:01.380
Fascination-- it
doesn't take extra time,

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.251
doesn't [INAUDIBLE] how
to do and that's step two.

00:25:05.251 --> 00:25:08.130
Step three is
uplifting the mind,

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.610
uplifting the mind
specifically with goodness.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.230
Let's see, shall we
try another experiment?

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:17.040
OK, this one is twice as
long as the previous one.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.835
This one is 10 seconds.

00:25:19.835 --> 00:25:21.460
For 10 seconds-- and
I like to do this,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.370
I like to secretly identify
two people in this room,

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.500
and in secret, think, I wish
for that person to be happy.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.230
And I wish for that
person to be happy.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:36.010
Just think, don't do
anything, don't say anything,

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.330
don't go, like, ooh.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:41.812
No, HR is safe.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:49.310
Just think-- this is an
entirely thinking exercise.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.430
Sounds good?

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.900
OK, 10 seconds beginning now.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.920
And thank you for
your attention.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.220
Anybody notice that when you're
doing this, you're smiling?

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.970
You notice that while
you were doing this,

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.940
you were happy, were joyful.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:21.910
If that's true,
you may have just

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.890
discovered one of the most
important secrets of happiness,

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:30.410
to be on the giving end of a
kind thought is intrinsically

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:31.360
rewarding.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.267
Therefore, all you had to
do is bring up a thought.

00:26:34.267 --> 00:26:35.600
I wish for that guy to be happy.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.350
That alone makes you
a little happier.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:42.630
If you do that a lot, it
makes you much happier.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.770
How powerful is this?

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.180
How far can I scale this?

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.630
I was once giving a talk
on a Monday evening,

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.600
and then I assigned--
so we did this exercise,

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.419
and I assign homework, by the
way, again, second homework.

00:26:56.419 --> 00:26:58.960
OK, I'll tell you what I did,
and then, this is the homework.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.420
The homework is this-- during
the workday, every hour,

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.170
spend 10 seconds on the hour,
spend 10 seconds wishing

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.710
for two people outside
your cubicle or office,

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.764
wish them to be
happy in your head.

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:14.430
So not embarrassing,
right, because they

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.888
don't know what you're thinking,
as long as you don't do it

00:27:16.888 --> 00:27:17.990
like, eh.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.326
Then that would be embarrassing.

00:27:20.326 --> 00:27:21.450
They'll think you're weird.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.750
Unless you're in Google,
then you're not so weird.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.530
Nah, just kidding.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.890
But just thinking, and
then, nobody knows anything,

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.300
and then go back to work.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.720
See what happens.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.470
Shall we try that?

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:34.830
At least tomorrow?

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.010
OK.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.260
So I assigned this
homework on a Monday

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.770
for an audience about twice
this size, I assigned homework.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:43.700
And that was a Monday evening.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.250
Wednesday morning, I received
an email from a total stranger.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.070
And this person
said, I hate my job.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:54.030
I hate coming to work
every single day.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.020
But I did the
homework on Tuesday,

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.960
and Tuesday was my happiest
day in seven years--

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.520
happiest day in seven years.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.270
What do you think?

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.850
It took 80 seconds of thinking.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.840
It's fascinating.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.380
One of the important
things about this thinking

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.380
is that this is easier than
the other exercises, I think.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:17.880
Why?

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.320
Because the other exercises--
like resting the mind,

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.690
you kind of need a little
bit of practice to rest.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:27.950
There people who cannot rest,
like they have to practice,

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.790
but inclining the mind, again,
kind of takes a little bit

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.110
of practice, like, do
it over one or two days,

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.590
and you start to get a groove.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.401
But this exercise,
loving kindness,

00:28:39.401 --> 00:28:41.150
to be on the giving
end of a kind thought,

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.010
all it takes is the
arising of a thought.

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:47.980
And every single adult
I ever knew in my life--

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.152
every adult knows how
to bring up a thought.

00:28:50.152 --> 00:28:52.110
And bringing up a thought
is the simplest thing

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.660
any adult can do.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.050
Everybody think of an elephant.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.340
Everybody can do that,
easily, effortlessly.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.370
So therefore, if all it takes
to have an injection of joy

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:08.610
is to bring up a thought, you
can't get easier than that.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.360
So by the way, this
is so powerful,

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.766
I would say that if you
don't remember a single thing

00:29:12.766 --> 00:29:14.265
in this lecture,
or rather, you only

00:29:14.265 --> 00:29:16.754
remember one thing
from this lecture,

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:18.045
remember how good looking I am.

00:29:18.045 --> 00:29:19.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.500
If you remember two things in
this lecture, remembered this.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.484
No, I'm just kidding.

00:29:23.484 --> 00:29:25.150
Remember only one
thing in this lecture,

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.520
remember this exercise--
wishing for others

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.770
to be happy in your head.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.825
This alone guarantees
an increase

00:29:31.825 --> 00:29:35.720
in happiness and no cost.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.390
So if you do this, this is it.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:40.370
The three steps.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:43.360
If you do this over time,
practicing over time,

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.510
three things happen.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:49.550
The first thing that happens
is that joyful experiences

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.360
in your life gets
even more joyful,

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.430
and by now, it's obvious
why, because you've

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.020
been paying attention to it.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.900
Previously, eating food
is eh, kind of nice,

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.080
but now it's, ooh,
this is delicious.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:01.580
Right?

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.180
Even for one moment,
like, you double your joy

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.840
at no cost whatsoever,
no extra cost whatsoever.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.070
So that's the first
effect, joyful experiences

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.460
become even more joyful.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:16.970
The second effect is
that new true experiences

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.970
become joyful experiences, more
and more so, increasingly so.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:21.860
Why?

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.950
Because you stop taking
them for granted.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:29.140
So it's like suddenly,
simple things

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.160
like having access to water,
at first it's kind of neutral,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.390
water, whatever.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.624
But now it's like, oh my
God, this is so valuable.

00:30:35.624 --> 00:30:37.790
So many people in the world
have no access to water.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.500
I have it.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.090
And then it goes
to something else.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:47.210
You start to find joy
in the absence of pain.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.316
To be free from
pain is so joyful.

00:30:50.316 --> 00:30:51.940
When I have a toothache,
I tell myself,

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.089
if I didn't have this
toothache, I'd be so happy.

00:30:54.089 --> 00:30:56.380
And then I went to see a
dentist, this thing went away,

00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:00.130
and then, three days later,
I forget to be happy.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.900
What if I never
forget I'm happy?

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.280
This moment right here and
right now, I'm not in pain.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.200
This moment, I can walk.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.890
Not just I can walk, I
can walk without pain.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:15.570
Freedom from pain is such a
valuable, beautiful experience.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.600
Suddenly, you stop
taking it for granted.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.220
And that's how
what was originally

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.420
we thought to be
neutral become joyful.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.660
And I think one of the
key words is gratefulness.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.140
We start becoming
grateful for everything.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.520
And I've heard there's
a Mayan practice I just

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.900
learned last week.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.110
The old Mayan practice
is to wake up every day

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.500
and say thank you 400 times.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.580
So a Mayan practitioner,
the moment she wakes up,

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.570
she breathes in the air,
and she says, thank you air.

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.500
She sees the ground,
thank you ground.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.960
I mean, generally thanking
everything 400 times a day.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.610
That's a key to happiness.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:55.100
And this skews
[INAUDIBLE] naturally,

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.820
effortlessly bring you there.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.124
So that's the second effect.

00:31:59.124 --> 00:32:00.540
The third effect
is, I think, even

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.990
more powerful than
the first two, which

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:08.620
is that painful experiences
become manageable.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.180
Why so?

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.580
The first reason is
that all the skills

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:17.510
you learn to increase
joy turn out to also--

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:21.170
you can apply directly
to dealing with pain.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:23.920
For example, in a
difficult situation,

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.750
emotionally difficult,
you can learn

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.240
to calm the mind on demand.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.320
If you can calm the mind,
already half the problem

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.370
gets solved on the spot.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:33.960
That's one.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.100
So everything you learn
is directly applicable.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:41.010
More than that, which is a
very powerful effect, which

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.280
I kind of discovered
by accident,

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.920
and what I did-- I thought
I was going crazy--

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.900
I discovered that I
was able to access joy

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.600
in the midst of great pain.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.180
So I was going through
a long episode of pain,

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:03.370
emotional pain, and I found
that at least once a day,

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:08.650
a couple times a day, I felt
joyful, adulterated joy,

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:12.110
like, yay kind of
joy from nothing.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.750
I was just walking
around, just eating

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:15.580
my food, meeting
friends, saying hi

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.520
to friends, things like that.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.100
Suddenly, I just
became very joyful.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:25.790
And I was like, wait a minute,
one moment I was so miserable,

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:29.180
I'm going to die, and
then suddenly, I have joy

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.780
lasting for about five minutes.

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.520
And then, I was so
miserable, I'm going to die.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.561
I thought I was going
crazy, more than before,

00:33:36.561 --> 00:33:37.560
I mean, more than usual.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.177
What happened?

00:33:41.177 --> 00:33:42.010
I learned something.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:49.010
I learned that joy and pain
are not mutually soluble.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.520
They can displace each other.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.240
So if one is much
bigger than the other,

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.531
there's a lot of joy, but a
little bit of pain, the joy

00:33:54.531 --> 00:33:56.010
displaces the pain,
and vice-versa.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.710
But they are
equally strong, they

00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:59.210
do not dissolve each other.

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:01.420
They exist side by side.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:07.150
And the person I learned
most of this from

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:10.800
is this woman called
Rigoberta Menchu.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.360
Rigoberta is Mayan, so
the mayan thank yous

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.600
I learned from her as well.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.980
Rigoberta is a
Mayan woman, she's

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.659
the first Mayan ever to
win the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.030
And by the way, has anybody
here met a Nobel Peace Prize

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.699
winner before?

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:28.489
I met a few.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:30.139
There's a stereotype.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:34.540
The stereotype is-- I mean, the
guy won a Nobel Peace Prize,

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.010
he must be nice, right?

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.570
So you see this
person, you expect

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:40.920
him or her to be warm and
say, hey, how are you doing?

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.469
To be nice to you and
so on and so forth.

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:49.810
Rigoberta fits the
stereotype to a T.

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.190
You meet her, even
at a distance,

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.909
even with the language
barrier-- she speaks Spanish.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:56.429
You have to go through
interpreter half the time,

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:58.710
even with that, you see
her immediately, you

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.060
can feel her goodness.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.807
And then you ask for-- and
then she sees you, says hey.

00:35:03.807 --> 00:35:05.890
And then you ask for a
hug-- of course, of course.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:08.070
And she's always happy,
she's always nice.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.950
I spent an hour with her.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:16.230
And within one hour, I
realized that there's

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:21.700
something below the surface,
that she has a lot of pain,

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.360
a huge amount of pain.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.245
Her pain comes from her
life, her life trauma.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.030
Her father was burned
alive by the government.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:40.660
Her mom was kidnapped,
tortured, raped, murdered,

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.240
and her body was left on
the side of the street

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.480
to feed the wild animals.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.520
She lost her brother
in a similar way.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.730
She lost her son.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:56.515
And it's like any one of these
events in a life is traumatic.

00:35:56.515 --> 00:35:58.220
It will change a
person's life, right?

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.530
If I have any one of these
things, I'd be bitter,

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.310
be angry, I'd be revengeful.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:03.620
Or I would withdraw.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.920
I wouldn't do anything
in this world.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.640
And you look at Rigoberta-- she
didn't do any of those things.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.190
She's still joy, genuinely
joyful, even despite her pain.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.880
She's still serving the world.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.560
She came to Singapore
last week on invitation

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.930
to speak to young people,
to inspire young people.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:21.820
She came all the way
here for 40 hours

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.680
and flew back just to
speak to young people.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.100
And she's still working.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.970
And then going back to
fight for human rights.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:35.050
This amazing woman-- the
question I had for her,

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.650
how do you do this?

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.490
And I realized what happened.

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.960
So the way she did
it was, I mean,

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.930
my own explanation of
it, not her exact words,

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.960
my own explanation
is she's using joy

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.280
as a container for her pain.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.272
And an analogy I use is
like having a fracture.

00:36:54.272 --> 00:36:56.730
You have a very bad fracture,
a broken leg, what do you do?

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.920
You put a cast around it.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.599
And the cast around
it, what does it do?

00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:01.390
It does two things.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:05.280
First, it limits further
damage, and secondly, it

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.660
allows time to heal,
allows healing to happen.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.260
And she's doing the same thing.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:15.370
She's using her joy, her genuine
joy as a container for pain,

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:17.110
so pain doesn't
cause more damage,

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:21.590
and she can heal
in the meantime.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.320
And it's fascinating.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.060
And my own experience
dealing with joy and pain

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:30.350
is, I feel that my joy
is like-- I always said,

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.420
I feel as if I was
traversing a vast desert,

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.040
and every moment of
joy is like an oasis.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.340
And without an oasis, I was not
able to navigate the desert.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.340
But with an oasis, I went for
months end to the other end.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.650
And I recovered.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:51.680
So this ability to access joy
in addition to a happy life,

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:57.565
it gives you resilience in
the worst circumstances.

00:37:57.565 --> 00:37:59.190
So this is not a
practice just for you.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.300
I wrote this book,
"Joy on Demand."

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:12.900
I wrote this book.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.379
One of my main goals is
to create the conditions

00:38:15.379 --> 00:38:16.670
for world peace in my lifetime.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:18.840
I mean that is my goal in
life, create the conditions

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.131
for world peace in my lifetime.

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:23.460
And this book is one of the
data points towards this.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:29.300
And the way I want [INAUDIBLE]
to contribute is I like to--

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.010
So this book is about
joy, ostensibly.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.610
However, it's also about
two related qualities.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:40.410
It's about inner peace,
inner joy, compassion.

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:45.760
I think that the trigger
point for world peace

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.940
is global compassion.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.300
However, compassion has to
be sustained by inner joy.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.220
Inner joy has to be
sustained by inner peace.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.050
So all three come
together as a package.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:59.690
So by writing a book on
joy, and with practices

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:02.460
that actually work, that
people can actually do,

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.610
because they're easy, I'm hoping
that people will practice this,

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.290
and in doing that,
they will be joyful

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.130
and they will also
have inner peace

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.290
and they will also
have compassion.

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:13.960
And through that, I
hope I'm making-- well

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.920
I'm helping to
make-- inner peace

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.510
and enjoying compassion
understandable, accessible,

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:23.620
and most importantly, practical.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.540
And through doing that, I hope
that everybody will practice

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.620
this, I hope
everybody in this room

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.005
will do that, and
together, we will

00:39:31.005 --> 00:39:33.471
create the conditions for
world peace in our lifetime.

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:33.970
Thank you

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:37.211
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:38.704 --> 00:39:39.870
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.174
We, at Google, talk
about scale and impact

00:39:42.174 --> 00:39:44.162
[INAUDIBLE] products.

00:39:44.162 --> 00:39:48.050
Is there a way that we
can combine [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:53.990
philosophy on how we roll out
our products and world peace?

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.560
How can they come together?

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.010
CHADE-MENG TAN: I think so.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:00.890
It's not entirely clear
what the direct impact is,

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:05.349
but my thinking is, at least
when I was working at Google,

00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:07.265
I think it's still true
now, but at least when

00:40:07.265 --> 00:40:08.750
I was working at
Google, we cared

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:15.680
a lot about user experience,
and also about our goodness.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.510
Our prime directive, I think,
still is, don't be evil.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:20.955
That's our prime directive.

00:40:20.955 --> 00:40:22.330
And when I was
working at Google,

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:26.470
every meeting, every other
meeting-- now everybody

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:27.890
would think what
about this issue.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:29.999
Every decision we
made, is this evil?

00:40:29.999 --> 00:40:31.540
And then every now
and then, somebody

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.810
would raise a
question, is this evil?

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.800
So we really cared about this.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.670
And so that's half of it.

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.870
The other half of it
is serve the user.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:43.980
Do whatever it takes to give
the user the best benefit.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.130
And so if you combine
these two together,

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:49.240
and if we also
personally practice

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.410
peace, joy, compassion,
those qualities will bleed

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.880
into this decision process,
because consciously or

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.540
unconsciously, we say not
just is it the users using

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.970
a [INAUDIBLE], I
mean in [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:04.800
but is it also
promoting compassion?

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.130
And so I'm hoping
continuing doing good

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:11.210
as a corporate philosophy,
and for each one of us

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:14.250
to infuse and practice
peace, joy, compassion,

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:17.779
I think that will
scale our impact.

00:41:17.779 --> 00:41:19.445
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for sharing with us.

00:41:19.445 --> 00:41:23.020
You talked a lot about how
we could seek happiness.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:27.918
What about those people who
are just eternally miserable?

00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:30.710
How do we take
this earned wisdom

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.630
and take that
happiness to people

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.380
who are not really
seeking their happiness

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:39.609
or who didn't know that this
is what [INAUDIBLE] makes?

00:41:39.609 --> 00:41:41.650
CHADE-MENG TAN: So instead
of [INAUDIBLE] for us,

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.850
how do you get it
to other people?

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:47.350
It's very hard.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:50.675
Especially a parent or a
child, those are the hardest.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.940
So, couple answers.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.690
One answer is, I don't really
know any other way to do it,

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:04.660
except to example,
so living that life

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.170
and living--
especially in my case

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.870
because I used to be miserable.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.500
And if people know
my history, they

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.166
say, hey, why are you
so happy nowadays?

00:42:11.166 --> 00:42:11.910
What changed?

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:14.390
But even, despite that,
you're always happy,

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.880
you're always kind to
people, and you're successful

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.500
and so on, somebody will
come to you one day,

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.712
and say, hey, what
is your secret?

00:42:21.712 --> 00:42:23.420
And you can tell them,
this is my secret.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.050
So by example,
that's the main one.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:30.730
In addition, by example, there's
other point I want to make,

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:34.600
which has to do with
batting averages.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.480
So this comes from
this question--

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.450
all the practices we talk about
like compassion, kindness,

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:43.510
does it make a difference
in social relationships?

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.640
Does it make us
less conflicting?

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.750
So if you have somebody
that caused you lot trouble,

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:51.250
does it make that happen less?

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:58.800
The real answer is,
we can control it,

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.570
but the practice will make
a significant difference.

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:02.560
And here's the analogy.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.720
The analogy is, in
baseball, there's

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.274
something called the batting
average, which is roughly,

00:43:07.274 --> 00:43:08.940
for those who don't
know about baseball,

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:13.220
roughly the percentage of
time that the batter hit

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.510
the ball when he's supposed to.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:21.670
So the batting average of a
Major League player in baseball

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:27.180
is about 0.28, roughly,
so about 28% of the time.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:32.970
Babe Ruth is about 34.34,
so about 6% difference

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:35.930
between the average
player and the best player

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:38.279
in the history of the game.

00:43:38.279 --> 00:43:40.820
So if you look at those numbers,
two or three things came up.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.332
The first thing that comes
up is that even the best

00:43:43.332 --> 00:43:45.040
play in history of
the game hits the ball

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.460
less than half the time,
the minority of the time.

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:52.820
And even for a major
league player, even this.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.210
And the second
thing you discover

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.630
is that the difference
between the best and average

00:43:56.630 --> 00:44:00.830
is very small, six percentage
points or something.

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:05.430
So those six percentage point
make meaningful difference.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.230
And it's the same
with our daily life.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:09.660
If you interact with people--
this is a [INAUDIBLE],

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.690
but if I practice
kindness and compassion,

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:16.840
the probability of us
having a better conversation

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.340
increases meaningfully.

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.290
It may be small.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.150
Maybe it goes from
25% of the time

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:24.020
to the 33% of the time,
maybe something like that.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.820
But still, the increase
is significant enough

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.900
to make a deep,
meaningful difference.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.970
That one time that is a
good interaction, maybe

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.020
the one time the
person likes you,

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.780
and he's a future
father-in-law or something.

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.480
So they make a difference.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.240
So therefore, what
this means is when

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.040
you're practicing kindness,
compassion peace, joy-- first,

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.390
if you don't get the intended
result from other people,

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:50.330
don't feel bad.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:51.820
It's expected.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.715
And trust that it does
make a difference,

00:44:54.715 --> 00:44:58.370
a small, but meaningful
difference, and sometimes,

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:01.810
meaningful enough
to be life changing.

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:02.480
Thank you.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.490
AUDIENCE: And you can
buy the book, too.

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:05.240
CHADE-MENG TAN: Yes,
you can buy the book.

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:13.570
SPEAKER: We have time
for about two questions.

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.086
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:45:15.086 --> 00:45:17.826
My question is,
does the principle

00:45:17.826 --> 00:45:23.280
of diminishing marginal utility
that's applicable on pleasure

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:30.600
also applicable on joy,
[INAUDIBLE] joy over time?

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.830
CHADE-MENG TAN: As far as
I know, the answer is no.

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.510
And I'll tell you why.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:40.510
The number one reason why
consumption-- so the joy

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:43.960
that's based on sense and
ego pleasure, the number one

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.250
reason they don't scale
over time is habituation.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:50.510
So you have a lot of stuff.

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:54.090
After a while, to get the same
happiness, you need more stuff.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:59.280
If you have a promotion
to director, three,

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.610
six months later, this
sucks, I'm not VP.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.150
Right?

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:07.140
For the same level of
happiness, you need to be VP.

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.790
We habituate.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:13.570
In the joy that I find,
my discovery, and I

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.280
could be wrong, but
my own experience

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.530
and my sense talking
to other people who

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:21.630
had a similar experience
is that we don't habituate.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:24.590
And because we don't habituate,
the joy is always there.

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:27.090
It's always positive.

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:31.820
So that is why it doesn't--
what's the origin of what you

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.520
use?

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.610
margin-- yeah, that it
doesn't diminish over time.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:38.580
There was a fascinating study.

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:42.310
It did not come from me, but
the data point blew my mind.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:45.544
And this study was on
this idea called dhyana,

00:46:45.544 --> 00:46:46.960
and it's a practice
called dhyana.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.500
So remember us talking
about ease and joy,

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.410
and they calm the
mind [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.420
So dhyana is the
extreme version of that.

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.500
So this is when
your attention is

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:00.270
so stable it doesn't leave
the object of choice,

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:05.360
let's say, the breath, for at
least one hour for amateurs,

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.690
at least, for masters, at
least 4 hours, 4 to 24 hours.

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:11.360
You don't leave-- the
attention doesn't waver,

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.850
and, because it
doesn't waver, the mind

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:18.070
is full of joy,
unadulterated joy.

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:19.620
The description
given by the masters

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:23.940
is this is better than
sex-- that much joy.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:26.950
So somebody has studied it.

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:30.400
There was one and only one study
I know of done on a master.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.990
It was fascinating.

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:34.530
So the study,
among other things,

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:37.230
tested the hypothesis,
the claim, the claim

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.100
that it's better than sex.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.050
So how do you test that claim?

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:47.440
The way it was done--
maybe it came out wrong--

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:52.220
the way the measurement was
done was on the dopamine release

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.860
system, testing the activity
on dopamine systems.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.160
So the hypothesis, or
rather, the prediction

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.060
is that if it's better than
sex, you might find hyperdrive

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.040
in that dopamine.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.259
And then if that's true,
by the way, if it's true,

00:48:06.259 --> 00:48:08.050
then we have a problem,
because the subject

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:10.034
will have habituation.

00:48:10.034 --> 00:48:11.700
Everything else that
depends on dopamine

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.010
will overflow, overdrive.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:17.240
So the test was
done on this guy.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.940
One guy was willing--
one master was

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.450
willing to go through
an fMRI and everything.

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:24.970
And the surprise
was, at the time

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:30.740
he reported his happiness is so
intense, it's better than sex,

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:33.760
his activation of
dopamine was very slight.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:39.360
He was like an eh, kind of
nice, according to the dopamine.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.280
But yet, he says he's so joyful.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.180
Why?

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:46.280
Because his neocortical
activity was very low.

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.220
In other words, his mind
and his brain were quiet.

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:52.170
And because his
mind was quiet, he

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:56.440
perceived a little
bit of joy as huge.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:02.670
And so therefore, that
gives me confidence,

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:04.600
because the
mechanism, therefore,

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.040
is not subject to
habituation, because there's

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.580
no overdrive of the
dopamine system.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.370
And so therefore, this type of
joy is extremely sustainable.

00:49:16.192 --> 00:49:18.067
Maybe one, plus-- I'll
try to answer quickly.

00:49:20.972 --> 00:49:22.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for sharing

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.730
with us a lot of practical tips
on basically how we can explore

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:28.980
joy and how we can
use it to drive sort

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.711
of more sustained happiness.

00:49:30.711 --> 00:49:32.860
In the very beginning
you mentioned, also,

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.760
the link between happiness
and success and productivity.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.669
How can we learn more
about this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:38.669 --> 00:49:40.210
Because I guess,
you know, especially

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.876
for an overachiever
kind of personality,

00:49:41.876 --> 00:49:44.090
this may be the least
intuitive [INAUDIBLE],

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:49.540
because maybe experiencing
joy frequently in our life

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.590
can indeed drive us to be
more happy on average after.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:56.100
But how does it really
connect [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.357
because the process may not
be necessarily pleasant.

00:49:58.357 --> 00:49:59.190
CHADE-MENG TAN: Yes.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:02.820
Two ways to do that--
academic way and direct way.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.700
Academic way, there's
a book I recommend,

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.220
"The Happiness Advantage."

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.480
It talks about the
research that's been done,

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.000
and then, after
you read the book,

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.050
you can go to the bibliography
to look at the papers.

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:15.880
The practical way is to
read "Joy on Demand,"

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.290
try out the techniques,
and see if it actually

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:20.164
makes a difference--
oh, I have to hold it up

00:50:20.164 --> 00:50:22.180
like I'm Vanna White--
and see if it actually

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.522
make a difference to you.

00:50:23.522 --> 00:50:24.730
So these are the two methods.

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:25.620
OK, last question.

00:50:28.857 --> 00:50:30.690
AUDIENCE: I was really
curious in particular

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:35.770
about finding inner quietness
and thinking about that.

00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:41.050
I started meditation about
two or three weeks ago,

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.260
so I'm still trying
to figure out,

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.610
how do you find inner
quietness when you're

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:49.266
an anxious person
who has-- you try

00:50:49.266 --> 00:50:51.724
to take a deep
breath [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:51.724 --> 00:50:53.140
always thinking
on the next thing,

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.608
and you were basically
almost like having ADHD?

00:50:57.769 --> 00:50:59.810
CHADE-MENG TAN: I'll just
give you a short answer

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:00.980
because we're out of time.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:05.510
The short answer is, meditation
is not what you think.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:07.080
So we have this
idea that meditation

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.260
is about quieting the
mind, no thoughts,

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:12.012
then when there is a thought,
I'm afraid, I suck at this.

00:51:12.012 --> 00:51:12.970
But that's the pattern.

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:15.000
And then, not just that,
the thought becomes

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.150
louder and louder, you
suck, you should just stop.

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:22.810
So the key is to know
that that is not true.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:26.350
Meditation is not about
quieting thoughts.

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:29.160
I mean, if you do it,
eventually the thoughts

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.720
quiet by themselves.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.900
In the meantime, the
practice is about attending,

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.320
it's about attention,
it's not about quieting,

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.920
it's not about object,
it's not about sensation,

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:43.680
it's about attention, and
specifically bringing attention

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.070
to an object, basically
the breath, or the body,

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.520
whatever it is.

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.870
And if it wanders away,
just bring it back,

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:52.510
so it's attention.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.310
Every time you bring it
back, it's not a failure.

00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:57.460
It's like when you
do a bicep curl.

00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:00.240
If you only have a heavy
object, you wouldn't grow,

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.110
but if you do this,
you will grow.

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:05.510
Same thing when your attention
wanders away, bring it back,

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.620
bring it back, it's
like you're doing this.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:10.060
Then your muscles, specifically
your prefrontal cortex,

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.040
will grow.

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.870
So every time your
attention wanders away,

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:15.480
it's an opportunity for growth.

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.930
So that's the first thing,
on recognizing that.

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:21.380
The second thing is
recognizing that you don't

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:22.730
have to suppress the thoughts.

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:25.110
The thoughts can just
be there, and all

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:26.580
you have to do--
your only job is

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:30.410
to pay attention to the breath,
regardless of the thoughts.

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:33.190
So they just flow, flow,
flow, yeah, whatever.

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:36.480
I'm just looking at
this, that's all.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:36.980
OK?

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.370
With that, thank you very much.

00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:41.720
[APPLAUSE]
