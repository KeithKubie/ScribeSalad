Blockhead bunnies and disembodied cat
unicorn princesses.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.100
It's episode 40 of IMG!

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.620
You've gotta be careful around ducks.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.799
Seriously. But it's okay to be smug

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.250
with a panda.
If you've got extra time carve Lincoln

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.720
out of Oreo filling.
Or check out more of Sam

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.589
Spratt's work. He recently made some 
awesome mean faces.

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.820
Forever alone is good too. It's also good
as a costume. If you can't afford

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.400
costumes, here's how to be a table.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.020
It really, I mean, it's safer than trying
to sit with a dog around.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.559
But let's move on to a famous photo.
This Windows desktop image

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.710
has a title. It's called "Bliss" and was
taken in 1996 by a man named

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.699
Charles O'Rear in Sonoma County, California.
Now, since the photo was taken

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.230
a vineyard has moved in and today
the hill looks like

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.879
this. Let's get mappy. This map shows what
people call soft drinks.

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.400
Blue is where they say 'pop,'
yellow is where they say 'soda'

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.830
and red is where they tend to call all soft drinks

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.060
'coke.' Now this map bloats up and squeezes
countries based on the size

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.360
of their annual GDP, the total market
value of all goods and services the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.920
country produces in a year.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.300
Notice how small the African continent
is, even though it's actually

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.370
quite large.
Seriously, you could fit

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.230
United States inside Africa along with
Europe, India,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.500
China, Japan and more.
By the way,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.760
the diameter of the Moon is
approximately the length

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.410
of the United States of America,
which means that roughly, to scale,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.590
this is the size of the Moon.
And finally,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.740
this map shows the remoteness of areas of the world.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.730
The darker the region,
the further away it is from a large city.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.730
But if you really wanna get away, 
climb to the top of Chimborazo in

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.350
Ecuador.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.760
It's not the tallest mountain in the
world, but because the Earth

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.750
bulges slightly in the middle and it's
a big mountain near the equator,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.970
its peak is actually the furthest point on

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.750
Earth from the center of the Earth.
Now, a bunch of dogs

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.750
shaking off water.
Enjoy.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.870
Okay, here's a trick. If you wanna know
where an image came from or find other

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.330
versions or sizes,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.370
go to Google Image Search and drag the picture

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.520
right into your browser.
Boom. Success.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.960
And if you wanna lose your mind,
there are plenty of GIFs to do it,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.190
but I'll recommend ScillyMission's Swirl page.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.610
Move your cursor around and feel powerful or

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.100
nauseous.
Of course, the best cure for nausea is

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.780
eating a baby. Right, grandma? Oh boy.
Instead, let's just wear slippers

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.390
shaped like babies. And here's something
huge. In our explosion video I mentioned

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.640
the US's Pacific atomic tests

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.450
and then yesterday I came across this
incredible real photo of the beach

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.990
and in the distance an atomic underwater detonation.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.830
It's pretty terrifying.
Just a few hours ago

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.850
Vsauce surpassed 300,000 subscribers,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.870
which is awesome.
You guys rule and

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.220
the Vsauce team will continue to bring
you exactly what you want,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.780
because...

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.800
As always,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.220
thanks for watching.
