00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.720
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.060
I want to welcome all of
you to the Kluge Center.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.800
Many of you are Kluge scholars
so you don't have to be welcomed

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.360
to the Kluge Center, you're
already at the Kluge Center.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.860
But this is for the Kislak
Fellowship Annual Lecture.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.150
This year's fellow
was Frauke Sachse.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.520 position:56%
She is the professor of Mesoamerican
Studies at the University of Bonn.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.890
But she's a lot more than that.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.200
The description, professor

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.940
of Mesoamerican Studies
doesn't really go far enough.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.950
Frauke, at least in my estimation,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.050
is one of the premiere linguists
working in the world right now

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.800
on a small group of languages,
many of them that are endangered.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.490
Her dissertation focused on a
particular language called Szinca.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.920
It is an extremely endangered
language that only a few people

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920
in the world have worked on.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.290
Frauke used 18th century grammars
in order to reconstruct what

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.120
that language looked
like, how it was spoken.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.200
She spent many years in the field
doing field work to mixed success,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.430
being there were few speakers who
actually could speak the language.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.250
Since her dissertation,
she's continued work on that,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.920
but she has also focused on
other Mesoamerican languages.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.220
The area that we are talking
about, which is this small area

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.930
in Central America, is one

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.170
of the most linguistically
dense in the world.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.500
Just in the Maya languages alone,
depending on who you talk to,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.510 position:56%
there are anywhere from 30 to 36
languages that are currently spoken.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.230
She's going to speak to us
today about her Kislak project,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.530
which she's also working

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.290
on with another researcher whose
name is Gary Sparks who's also

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.300
in the audience, about a manuscript
that is pretty much pretty unknown

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.420
in the Mesoamerican Studies world.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.400
And Frauke and Gary have
made extreme inroads

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.910
into discovering what
may turn out to be one

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.970
of the most important manuscripts
in the Kislak collection.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.400
So without further ado, Frauke.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.260
&gt;&gt; Frauke Sachse: Thank
you very much, John.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.050
It was a very kind, far
too kind, introduction.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.870
I hardly recognize myself.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.880
I would like to start this
with a couple of thanks.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.230
Thanks, first, to the Kluge
Center, the Kislak Foundation,

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.640 position:56%
for wanting me with this fellowship.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.300
I would like to thank my
recommenders Nancy Ferris

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.520
and Kris Lorne-Trexloff [phonetic]
for helping me get this fellowship.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.540
I would like to thank the
staff of the Kluge Center,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.320
in particular Mary Lou Reker

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.940
and Travis Hensley have been
tremendously helpful and full

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.320
of support and assistance.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.590
I would like to thank you,
John, for your great support

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.110 position:56%
and assistance during this research.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.710
And the entire staff of the
geography and maps department.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.370
As you already said, the
project is not my own project.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.840
It's a project that I'm doing
together with Gary Sparks

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.520
from George Mason University.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.620
So all the work and all the
results I'm going to talk

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.060
about today are collaborative.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.170
This is not only my achievement,
this is our joint achievement.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.450
So I'm, we are working on this
manuscript in the Kislak collection

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.920
for which I received this wonderful
fellowship and Gary has been able

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.560
to do this research
based on any-age funding.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.800
So we are both tremendously
grateful for the support.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.270
The plans, what we have plans
for, various publications

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.120
which are coming out of this
research that we're currently doing

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.140
and I'm going to tell you a
little bit about this today.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.120
For once, we hope that
we can produce an edition

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.410
of the entire document that
is in the Library of Congress,

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.080
a proposal for this is
currently under revision here

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.180
at the publications department
and of course we are very,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.470
very hopeful that this is going to
be seen as an interesting project

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.910
and maybe get some support.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.110
So, what are we talking about here?

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.950
Why is this not working.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.250
Can somebody help me?

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.290
It's not working.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.590
That one?

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.190
&gt;&gt; Frauke Sachse: Ah, okay.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.990
So, we are talking about
a 16th century manuscript,

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.300
it's a hand book, that was used by
a missionary in highland Guatemala.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.580 position:56%
And these kinds of handbooks were
called [foreign term], "go with me,"

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.140
a little like what we have
today is a Moleskine handbook,

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.880
a little handbook that
contained various doctrinal texts

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.700
and other documents and textual
materials that were relevant

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.910
to this particular missionary
for his missionary efforts.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.030
And it's particularly interesting
because it contains a collection

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.330
of different texts and
different Mayan languages

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.800
from highland Guatemala.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.900
I would like to give you a little
bit of background information.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.590
Highland Guatemala is the
world's second region,

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.750
or the second major region, that
was conquered by the Spanish

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.410
on the American continent in 1554.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.170
The K'iche' speaking kingdom
of Utatlan was the main power

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.470
in this ethnically

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.740
and linguistically very
diverse Maya highland region

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.560 position:56%
and as John has pointed out already,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.230
there are many different
Mayan languages

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.050
that are still spoken
today and just in Guatemala

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.610
in this region we have
21 Mayan languages

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.530
that are spoken to this very day.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.640
So one-third of the Guatemalan
population today speaks a Mayan

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.680
language, something that
is not very well-known.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.030
From the beginning,
Christian-ization, the mission,

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.250
the conversion to the
Christian faith,

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.060
took place in the indigenous
languages.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.990
And a particular role was played
by Bartolome de las Casas,

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.080
the so-called "Defender of the
Indians," who ended the bloodshed

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.830
of the conquest, which
was particularly violent

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.180
in highland Guatemala, by
replacing the sword with the gospel

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.760
and successfully pacifying the
resisting providence of Tezoatlan,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.690
by reaching to the indigenous
population in their own language.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.980
Guatemala is therefore one of the
best areas to study the encounter

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:15.390
between pre-Colombian and European
religions and word systems,

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.050 position:56%
because there was so much missionary
documentation and so much material

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.740
that was produced by
these missionaries

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.260
in these indigenous languages.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.360
And mostly, for the most part,
this material has been neglected

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:38.610
by researchers and there's
now a small group of people,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.830
more and more research of
linguist theologians, historians,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.050
becoming more and more
interested in doing work

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:51.290
with these missionary text
documents in indigenous languages.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:58.360
And the Kislak manuscript 1015
is one of the earliest specimens

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.040
of such missionary or
doctrinic text documents.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.360
It is, as I already said, a
compilation of various texts

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.360
and different highland
Mayan languages.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.090
And all of these texts in
this manuscript are copies

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.320
of even earlier originals
that were copied or compiled

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.350 position:56%
and then newly bound for the purpose
of this particular missionary.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:27.000
Some pages were also deleted by
the binding, after the new binding,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.520
and we can also see
that some pages were cut

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.190
out by whoever was
using that document.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:37.040
We see a picture of a cut out page.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.550
But we cannot say very much about
the binding and the paper yet other

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:48.330
than we know it's all 16th century
because the analysis of the paper

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.000
and the watermarks are something
that is currently being undertaken

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.940
by the conversation division
of the Library of Congress

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.100
and we are looking forward
to getting these results.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.630
So the document, or the manuscript,
consists of various texts

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.690
by different scribes and copiers.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.720
We can define different hands, you
can see them here numbered from A

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:23.330
to F. The compilation of the texts
is rather eclectic, one must say.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.740
They are of very diverse origin
and of particular interest to us

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:35.470
as Mesoamericanists, are various
sections of Mayan numerals

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:41.950 position:56%
or numbers, lists of numbers, there
are also sections of Latin numerals.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:47.200
There are prayers in Latin
as well as catechisms

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.250
in K'iche' and in Kaqchikel.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:55.930
And the core texts include several
sections done by the same copiers

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:02.750
or by the same hand, which is hand
number F, which include the text

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.670
"Cosas de la Fe Catholica,"
or in English,

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:11.490
"Things of the Catholic Faith,"
a text labeled [foreign term],

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.260
which is K'iche' for "Music."

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.500
And another section which is
called "Sermones," or "Sermons."

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:24.000
There are further texts that are
also done by that same copyist,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.060 position:56%
which is texts for the prerequisites
of marriage, a list of contents

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.920
of the proceeding texts
in the core texts section,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.630
and further marriage
prescriptions and taboos,

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.040
I will come to that later

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.510
because that section's
particularly interesting.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:44.110
So what have we done so
far with this manuscript?

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:51.170
In the fall, we produced a full
transcription of the entire book.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:58.410
Which now amounts to, the entire
book itself, has 100 folios written

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.960
on both sides and in
the transcription,

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.700
that amounts to 150 pages, Times
New Roman, 10 point, single-spaced.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.450
So it's a lot of text
that we are going through.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.240
It's all in these indigenous
Mayan languages, so we have a lot

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.630
of translation work ahead of us.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.050
We are now working on the textual
analysis of these sections and are

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.420
in the process of preparing
several publications.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:30.270
Besides the manuscript edition
that we would like to do,

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.930
we are planning a detailed
translation of this core section

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.860
on the "Cosas de la Fe
Catholica," which I will talk

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.040
about in more detail today.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.850
And we are working on an
article about the numbers section

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.690
and the marriage rules,
which are also topics

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.200
that I will be talking about.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.800
Let's look at dating the
volume, how old is this really?

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.620
It's a bit tricky.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.210
The document, I mean the handbook,
itself is clearly 16th century,

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.510
the handwriting is 16th century,
the binding is 16th century.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:03.810
So far, that' clear.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.110
There are two references
in the handbook

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:11.760
to a compilation date of 1567.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:19.080
The core section includes,
core section of this "Songs"

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.300
that I will be talking
about, ends in a colophon.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:28.020
And the text preceding this
colophon indicates that the copyist

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.880
or scribe completed the copy
on the 23rd of July in 1567

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:38.920
in the Valle de Panchoy, which
is today Antigua, Guatemala.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:44.360
And this particular date of
1567 is repeated further below

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.730
in this colophon.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:54.080
The colophon itself references the
date 1555, which may be a reference

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.110
to the date of the original
from which the scribe copied.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.380
And a bit more enigmatic
is the reference to 1544,

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.220
"the fathers arrived," and
1552, "the book was completed."

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:12.330
We are not quite sure what these
references really refer to,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.260
we are also not quite sure
whether we are reading it correctly

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:21.790
because these texts are
spelled with abbreviations.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.600 position:56%
So we're still studying this section

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:31.160
and don't really know whether these
earlier dates might actually refer

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.530
to an original compilation date.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:40.150
So let's look at these various
sections of the handbook.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.100
I talked about these Mayan numbers.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.980
What's really special about
the Kislak manuscript is

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.020
that it has a unique list
of written Mayan numbers

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.450
which goes from 1 to 70 million.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:00.510
And although we have sections on
Mayan numbers in other dictionaries

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.940
and grammars on highland
Mayan languages,

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.370
none of these go that high.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.630
We've never seen something
going up that high.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:14.180
We could identify the language,
these numbers are written in Ixil.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.840
This is also very remarkable
because there's no other document

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:24.420
to our knowledge from the Colonian
era that is written in Ixil,

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.100
so this may be the only
document in Ixil language,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.510
certainly from the 16th
century if not in general.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.520
The analysis of the numbers
section is really interesting

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.130
as it provides us with
a very detailed example

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.780
of how counting works
not only in Ixil but also

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:50.080 position:56%
in other highland Mayan languages
and this is also of general language

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:58.590
for Mesoamerican Studies because we
do understand the numbers system,

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:03.380
the arithmetics of
Mesoamerica quite well.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.550
There has been, a lot of research
has been done in particular

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:12.630
on classic Maya culture, we
have here a picture of one page

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:18.460
of the codex, here's one of
the four surviving Mayan books

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.570
from the pre-Colombian
time, which is written

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:31.360
in Maya hieroglyphic writing and
full of calendrical information

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:37.280
and then astronomical information.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.370
And we know since the very,
since the 19th century,

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.350
researchers like [inaudible]
and then in the 20th century

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.980
in particular, Sir Ed Thompson

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:52.540
and also Floyd Lounsbury have
produced tremendous detailed

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.480
information and analysis on how
calendrics and mathematics were

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.450
in the classic Maya system.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:05.500
So we do understand that quite
well and I will give you a slide

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.500
for an introduction into this.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.050
Maya accounting is based
on a vigesimal system.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.920 position:56%
Vigesimal is based on the number 20.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.610
So our decimal system that we
are used to, as we all know,

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.410
is based on the number 10.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:35.990
So you count in different steps
of, that are all multiplied by 10.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:42.980
So one times 10 is 10, times
10 is 100, times 10 is 1,000

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.800
and these different cycles
are labeled with names

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.960
like a decade, a century,
a millennium.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.980
And we notate this
and place notation

00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:01.750
so when you see the number 1,983,
this means it's three times 10,

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:07.180
it's nine times 100,
and one times 1000.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.460
And in the vigesimal system, that
works basically the same way,

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.730
it's just the basis is 20.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:18.760
So you start with one and
you take that times 20 is 20,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:25.150
times 20 is 400, times 20 is 8,000
times 20 is 160,000 times 20 is 3

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.120
million 200,000.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:32.740
And each of these cycles in Mayan
languages has their own name

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:39.440
like we have decades and
centuries and millennium.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:50.930
And... These names for these cycles
we do find in this Ixil document.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:57.500
So we have special terms for the
numbers 20, which is "vinac,"

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:02.680
for the numbers 80, which is
"much-ul," for the numbers 400,

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:08.270
"o-much," which is
really interesting here

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:13.830
because the form itself only
occurs with higher numbers.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:18.110
So we do find in the
text here under 800,

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:23.850
and I don't have a pointer, do I?

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.410
No. Oh, I do, okay.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.630
Does that show?

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:35.880
Okay. So 800 is basically
written as two times 400,

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.830
400 itself doesn't
occur as one times 400,

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:42.040
it just occurs as four times 80.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:47.660
So it's a very interact
counting system here.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:57.820 position:56%
We also have terms for the cycles of
8,000, "chuiul," 160,000, "calab,"

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.050
and 3 million 200,000, "tiche."

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.340
The Kislak manuscript is very
special in giving examples

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.120 position:56%
for very complex high numbers as
you can see on this manuscript page.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:18.560
For example, we have numbers
like 369,000, 381,000.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.140
When we were looking
at this at first,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.050
we had doubts whether this was
really a true Mayan numbers system

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.870
or whether this may have been
a scribe, a missionary trying

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:37.900
to translate European
numbers into Ixil.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.680
But we have analyzed it and we find

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.360
that it is indeed a full Maya
vigesimal counting system

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.000
which functions the same way as
the classic Maya system does.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.690
So as an example, the number
357,000 is written out as

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:04.000
"o-chuk-ul t-ox-la-oqob
t-o-chuy t-ox-kalab."

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.290
And that translates into five times
40 into the cycle of 14 times 400

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:15.270
into the cycle of five
times 8,000 into the cycle

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:19.650
of three times 160,000
which is the same

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:29.080
as 200 plus 4,800 plus 32,000 plus
320,000 which amounts to 357,000.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.580
It is a bit complicated and
students of Maya studies,

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:38.080
Mesoamerican studies [inaudible]
a mess to get through this.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:45.040
So I apologize for this being
a bit tedious in this talk.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.290
But just to give you an idea
what we're dealing with here,

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.380
we have to be a bit mathematical.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.370
And we are currently wrapping
up the results of our analysis

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.240
into an article and hope
that we get this written

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.350
and published very, very soon.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:07.300
The next section is a
bit more easy to grasp.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:13.520
Gary and I are also working on
this at high speed at the moment.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:19.180
It's the section that regards
marriage prescription rules.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.480
Very interesting.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.890
You have several pages at
the end of the manuscript

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:27.460
which have these drawings
of these circles with names

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.270
in them and explanations.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.090
And we first thought that
these were genealogies.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:36.650
Because the form of representation
corresponds with what you find

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:40.750
in Renaissance Spanish or
also, up until the 19th century

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:44.270
in Spain, as family trees.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:48.000
This is the way, how these
things are presented.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.100
However, when we were translating
the associated K'iche' texts,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.460
it was revealed that we are
not dealing with genealogies,

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:02.080
but with hypothetical or exemplary
drafts of kinship relations

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.840
and accompanying explanations
of what in Christian

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:11.110
or Spanish thought would be
understood as an illegitimate

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:15.110
or a legitimate sexual
relation or marriage taboos

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:19.610
and their respective
impact on legal inheritance.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:30.810
To give you an example, this is
basically an easier visualized...

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.980
illustration of what we find
in the original manuscript.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.550
So let me translate that for you.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:55.380
"If Pedro has some illegitimate
relation with Maria," which means,

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.780
is spelled here in K'iche' as
"rach ajmak," "He is the companion

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:05.680
of the sinner," so he's
a sinner, that implicates

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.770
that this is an illegitimate
sexual relationship.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:16.280
"If that is the case, then Pedro
must not marry either Maria's

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:22.740
daughter or her mother
or her grandmother,"

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:29.510
which is to European eyes, bizarre.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:35.620
Why would somebody want to marry
the grandmother of a concubine?

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:40.900
It also says that, "Maria
must not marry Pedro's son."

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.110
So that's also forbidden.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:47.640
Pedro's son, however, may
marry Maria's daughter

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.700
or her granddaughter.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.620
So what we are thinking we
are dealing with here is

00:23:54.620 --> 00:24:03.080
that these were drafts that were
used to teach the local population

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:09.370
about understandings of legitimate
marriage and inheritance rules

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:16.040
in Christian European society
which was the new cultural system

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:22.410
which was implemented by the
conquistadors and missionaries.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:28.410
It may also reveal, the section
may also reveal indirect clues

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.610
about what was cultural
practice in highland Guatemala

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.090
because obviously the
missionaries saw a need

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.600
in making people understand

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.860
that they couldn't marry their
mother or their grandmother.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:46.920
Which at first appears bizarre, but
it may not be that bizarre at all

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.880
because very often marriage
doesn't have anything to do

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:56.770
with sexual relations but with
making sure that somebody survives

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.360
and maintaining and
feeding somebody.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:07.050
So in other cultures this,
the concept of marriage,

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:11.040
has different implications.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:21.370 position:56%
So we are working on that and we are
also drafting an article on this,

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.740
so you see there's a lot
of research that comes

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.240
out of this particular document.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.820
But now finally to the text that
is really the focus of this talk,

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.630
and which is the oldest part of the
compilation of the [foreign term]

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:39.130
which dates to at least 1555.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:43.470
And this text includes
songs or hymns

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:52.160
and is the reason why I gave
this talk the title that I chose,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.510
"Songs of Faith and Devotion"

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.310
because it's really
about these songs.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:00.240
They make a big section
of the manuscript.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.040
So let's look at this.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.310
The Spanish heading in
the original text reads,

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.910
"Beginning of the succession of
things regarding the Catholic faith

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:15.950
from the beginning to the
end in form of hymns or songs

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:20.780
so that the Indians would sing them
in their festivals or holidays."

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:27.740
The following paragraph in K'iche'
specifies that the text is a

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.780
"chanalibal vuh bixabal," "...is
a cantation book, and a bishop,"

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:37.500 position:56%
a "vuh" or a songbook, "Which serves
the purpose of narrating the word

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.860
of God in form of songs
that shall be sung

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.150
at the annual Christian holidays."

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:54.770
If we look at the contents of this
text, the text spans from 17 recto

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.950
to 59 recto, so that's
more than 44 years

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:01.460
with very tiny writing,
as you can see here.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:08.210 position:56%
It comprises a total of 50
chapters and an additional 12 hymns.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.530
And Gary was suggesting
that that may be related,

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.830
that 50 chapters might be
related to the weeks of the year,

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:22.860
that it is songs that are
sung in each week of the year.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.530
Though we're still
working on establishing

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.960
that that is really the case.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:35.970
Each section has a title,
or each chapter has a title

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.120
or a heading, which is in Spanish.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.700
But the texts and the
songs are in K'iche'.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.170
The chapters of variable length.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:54.950
So some are just half a page and
others are several pages long.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:28:01.060
They're divided into stanzas, which
you can see here in the image.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:05.120 position:56%
Which are marked by a
colonial-style paragraph sign, yeah.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.030 position:56%
Which divides the different stanzas.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:14.960
And to give you an example for
the stanzas, we have now put them

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.760
into a more rhythmic pattern.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.660
I read the first one in English,
"The truth I shall remember

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:27.020
and the faithfulness I shall
tell," and then literally,

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:33.300 position:56%
"Much evil I feel for the fabricated
word," which is very metaphorical

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:39.170
in K'iche' means as much
as, "I despise the lie."

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:43.360
There are no indications that these
stanzas are following any kind

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.050
of old world model of
rhyme or metric system.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:52.560
However, when you look at the
next stanza, "Oh, much I despise

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:58.180
that was lost the truth of being,
great is my tremble, my lament,

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.840
because it was lost
the truth of being."

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.830
You can see that, you can
see in this reputation here,

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:13.280
the "Great is my tremble, my
lament," "nim nucic, nim voeqel,"

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:19.340 position:56%
that the author follows Maya poetics
by using couplets or parallelisms

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:25.070
and in this case, this particular
phrase, which is something

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:31.340 position:56%
that we know from ingenious
language documents by Mayan authors,

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:35.760
and is a pattern which is
very well-known from the

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.170
"Theologia Indorum"
by Domingo de Vico

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:43.850
about which I will say
something in a few seconds.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:49.250
If we look at the contents of the
chapters with their many stanzas,

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:53.670 position:56%
we find detailed treaties of ethical
narratives including Genesis,

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:59.080 position:56%
the fall of man, the banishment from
paradise, the division of language

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:04.190
at Babel, Sodom and Gomorrah, the
story of Moses, saint stories,

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.790
and of course the life of Jesus
from his birth to the passion,

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:14.110
including all miracles
and it's very detailed.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:18.540
Based on the terminology
that is used in the text,

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.090
we can attribute authorship
clearly to the Dominican Order

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:25.030
or the Order of Preachers.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:31.210
As I have shown, doctrinal
texts produced by Dominicans

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:35.050
in highland Guatemala
systematically adopt terminology

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:41.790
from highland Maya ritual
language, while Franciscan

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:45.720 position:56%
and other authors prefer to
introduce their own words from Latin

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.990
and create neologisms or new terms.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:53.480
There are certain key
terms that are indicative

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.640
for 16th century Dominican
doctrinal literature in Guatemala.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.820
And these terms have today
been primarily associated

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.710
with Domingo de Vico's
"Theologia Indorum."

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:08.480
And this is where I have to mention
another project that is going

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.970
on at the moment and is
parallel to the work that Gary

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:16.480
and I are doing here on
the Kislak manuscript.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.980
Which is a project that
is led by Gary Sparks

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:26.750 position:56%
who actually is the utmost
authority on the "Theologia Indorum"

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:30.750
and Domingo de Vico in
the world, I would say.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:35.750
It's a project which is headed
and led by him on the translation

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.330
of this particular document.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:41.290
And I'm happy to be
part of this project.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:44.650
The "Theologia Indorum" was the
first theology of the Americas

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.490
that was entirely written
in K'iche'.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:50.500
It comprises two volumes
of 700 folios.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:55.350
It's a very abundant source
and summarizes all basics

00:31:55.350 --> 00:32:01.090
of the Christian faith written
for K'iche' speaking audience.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:04.950
And this Domingo de Vico
incorporated a lot of terminology

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.750
and concepts from pre-Colombian
religion

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:12.400
to make the Christian concepts
understood to the K'iche' speakers.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.600
And some of these terms that we
find in the "Theologia Indorum"

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:24.400
and that have been identified in
Gary's research, we now also find

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:29.430
in the Kislak manuscript, which
makes this Kislak source very,

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:33.330
very interesting for us because
we think it is earlier than the

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:37.770
"Theologia Indorum" and that
changes the picture a little bit.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:41.760
So terms that are referenced
for example are

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.730
that the Christian god is referred
to as "Tz'aqol B'itol," the framer

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:52.360
and the former, which is a
reference to a Mayan creator god

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.630
that also occurs in
indigenous documents.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:00.040
And he's referred to as "Dios
nim Ajaw," the great lord,

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.050
which is a term that according
to the "Apologetica Historia"

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:08.890
by Bartolome de las Casas, was used
before the arrival of the Spanish

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.840
to refer to the most
powerful creator deity.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:17.020
It's, what's particularly
fascinating is something

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.500
that Gary pointed out
in his research,

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:25.800
that the Christian god is referred
to as "our mother and our father,"

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.830
which is a very Mayan concept.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:32.490
Christian, we all know in
Christianity, god is male.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.680
Yeah? God is not female.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.650
In Maya thought it is both,
yeah, it is female and male.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:43.160
And the female is always
referenced first.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:49.270
Another concept which I have
done some work on is the concept

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:53.690
of "q'anal raxal," the abandons,
the green, the yellowness

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:58.830
and the greenness, which refers to
abandons from a rich maize harvest

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:04.840
and is a topic or a
concept that is used

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:10.470
in Maya religion, Maya
ritual terminology.

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:13.690
And it is here used
in order to refer

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:16.090
to the glory of the Christian god.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:21.590
So there are several indications
here that we are dealing

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:28.420
with a Dominican source because
these are terms that are indicative

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.580
of Dominican translation practices.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:36.200 position:56%
With respect to the Dominican origin
of the text, it is also interesting

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:41.860
to note that the scribe
uses very unconventional

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:47.630
and not otherwise used
orthographic forms and letters

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.780
to represent the sounds of
the K'iche' phonetic system

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.570
that are not part of the
Spanish or the Latin alphabet.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:59.680
He does not follow conventions
that are used by other missionaries

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.920
and that have been
established by the Franciscan,

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.210
Francisco de la Parra, which you
see in the box down here below.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.510
Francisco de la Parra
defined that the [inaudible]

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:17.660
"k'" would be represented
by the sign "4."

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:25.060
And the [inaudible] "q " by what we
call "k," and the [inaudible] "q'"

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:29.940
by the turned around 3,
or the [foreign term].

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.700
And our scribe here uses
completely different conventions

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.150
to represent these sounds.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:43.910
Which we interpret a little bit
as maybe that Dominicans were also

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:47.230
in these texts and were competing
with the Franciscan missionaries

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.700
because this really in
the very early stages

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:55.440
of when these conventions were
defined and that they said,

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.700
"We are not going to follow
Franciscan conventions,

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.950
we are doing our own
orthographic style."

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.270
So this is from that point

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:07.120
of view paleographically a very
interesting source as well.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.950
The strongest connection to
Dominican authorship however comes

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.470
from the contents of the text.

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:19.320
In 1619, the Dominican chronicler
Antonio Remesal gives an account

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:23.380
of the peace for conquest of
Tezoatlan by Casas and his group

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.140
of friars that I mentioned before.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:32.000
Tezoatlan, in today's K'iche'
speaking region of Guatemala,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.270
had resisted the Spanish
invasion well into the 1530's.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:44.280
And las Casas, when he heard
that there was another attempt

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:50.250
to conquer this region by
military force, he requested

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:54.810
and received permission from
the crown to conquer this region

00:36:54.810 --> 00:37:01.150
by mission rather than by sword and
thereby end the terrible bloodshed

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:05.140
that had occurred in
highland Guatemala.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.730
For this purpose, las Casas
recruited a team of [inaudible]

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:14.360 position:56%
and linguistically versatile
Dominicans, who dedicated themselves

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.700
at writing doctrinal
texts for the mission

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:20.480
in the ingenious languages
of the region.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.590
And text in Remesal
reads as follows,

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:28.800
"The friars were the friar
father Bartolome de las Casas,

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.770
father Rodrigo de Ladrada,
and friar Pedro de Angulo

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:36.040
and friar Luys Cancer.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.190
All of them knew the language
of the province of Guatemala,

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:43.270
which includes all of Quiche
and Zacualpa very well.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.490
And among them, they wrote
some strophes, or verses,

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:48.660
in a manner permitted
by the language

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.900
with their consonants and rhythms.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.220
And in these they describe
the creation of the world,

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.610
the fall of man, his
banishment from paradise.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:01.180
They included all the life and
miracles of Christ our lord,

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.990
his passion, his death,
his resurrection,

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.400
his ascension to heaven, and when
his second time will come again

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:12.210
to judge mankind and the end of
his coming, which is the punishment

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:16.280
of those who are evil and
reward for those who are good.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:23.110
This work was a very long work and
as such, they divided it by pauses

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:26.800
and different verses in the
style of the Spanish ones,

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.990 position:56%
which as these were the first to be
made in the language of the Indians,

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:36.960
deserve not to be forgotten for the
many more that were written later."

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:42.200
To summarize what Remesal says,

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.210
these writings were
the first translation

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:51.280 position:56%
of the Christian doctrine into the
language of Guatemala by Dominicans.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:57.090
It was a very comprehensive
and long work in form of songs

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:01.340
that were divided in
strophes or stanzas and,

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:06.190
and this is the most significant,
the contents correspond one-on-one,

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:09.320
including the order, with
the contents of the text

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.860
in the Kislak manuscript.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.840
So what does Remesal tell
us about what happens

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.190
with these songs and these stanzas?

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.280
They were written, what
happened with them?

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:25.700
He goes on and he writes that
las Casas found four indigenous

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:29.830
merchants who traveled to
Tezoatlan on a regular basis

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.140
and were known to the local lot.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:36.120
And Remesal writes that with care,

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.040 position:56%
the friars taught these four
merchants, who had already converted

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:46.110
to Christianity, how to sing
these "coplas," or verses.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:50.620
Las Casas then sent the merchants
to Tezoatlan to sing the songs

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:55.230
of Christianity to the people and
their [foreign term], or lord.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:59.570
And Remesal writes, "The
merchants sang and preached

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:02.210
and all the people came
to hear the coplas.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:05.150
Almost for eight days they
were singing about the creation

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:10.060 position:56%
of the world, about the fall of man,
about the incarnation of Christ,

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:16.170
about the resurrection of Lazarus,
the merchants tried to sing a lot."

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:20.500
The songs and the music excited
the population of Tezoatlan

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.420
and the local lord and
they asked the merchants

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:26.530
to explain the contents
of the songs.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:31.770
These then asked the lord to
invite the friars to explain

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:34.360
to them the contents of the faith.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.830
The first friar who went to do this
was mentioned, friar Luys Cancer,

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:44.090
who went to Tezoatlan
and sang and preached.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:48.250
And then as a result, the
lord converted to Christianity

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.520
and he signed a peace treaty
with the Spanish crown.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.230 position:56%
The province did not have to pay
any tribute or tax for several years

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.100
for accepting the king of Spain.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.470
So that is basically the story

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:04.440
of the peaceful conquest
as told by Remesal.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.240 position:56%
Now you're already guessing it, is
that Gary and I assume that the text

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.340
in the Kislak manuscript is
a copy of these very coplas

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:17.700
that are mentioned by Remesal.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.250
Which is exciting on its own.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.410
But it's getting more complicated.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:28.760
Because there's another
manuscript that has been identified

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:33.040
as the very text referred
to in Remesal.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:39.180
And this is this one here from
the Newberry Library in Chicago,

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:50.080
which Basu [phonetic] suggested
to be this very coplas manuscript

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.340
that was written in Q'eqchi',
the language of the region

00:41:54.340 --> 00:42:00.390 position:56%
that was missionized by las Casas
and Cancer, and contains those songs

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:01.840
that were mentioned in the Remesal.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:08.090
So at first, we thought
there's a problem here.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:14.450 position:56%
But when we looked at this in more
detail, we found that Basu is right.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:18.680
Because we found that the Q'eqchi'
coplas that Basu wrote about

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.720
and the text in the Kislak
manuscript are two versions

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.060
of the same text, one in
Q'eqchi' and one in K'iche'.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.770
And if we compare these two texts,

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:34.440
we can see that the Q'eqchi'
text is a bit more concise

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.240
and a bit more abstract
but in terms of contents,

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.230
both texts are identical.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.840
Comparing it in more detail,

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:50.390
we see that the Kislak text
is far more comprehensive

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.680
and includes chapters and
hymns that are missing

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.240
in the manuscript from Chicago.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.610
And in addition, the
individual chapters

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.760
in the Kislak manuscript
include more stanzas

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.470
and are much more detailed
in the K'iche' manuscript

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.890
than in the Q'eqchi' manuscript.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:11.510
So this suggests the following.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:16.470
We believe that we have
re-discovered the very coplas

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.910
that were mentioned in Remesal
in their original language

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:23.170
and we think it is K'iche'.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:28.100
And thereby, we may have identified
the earliest doctrinal text

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:32.860
from highland Guatemala that
may originally go back as far

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:39.800
as into the 1530's, when las Casas
began his mission in the Verapaz.

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:45.130
So this document is in the Library
of Congress, it's a treasure here.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.710
And with this, I would like to
thank you for your attention

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:50.510
and I'm happy to take questions.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:44:00.510
[ Applause ]

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:08.740
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.040
That's a good question.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:15.150
I know it was acquired by Arthur
Dunkelman [phonetic] on behalf

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:20.560
of Jay Kislak for the
Kislak collection

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.290
where it was originally was where
Arthur Dunkelman acquired it

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:28.880
and under which conditions
I don't know.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:45:23.140
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:31.940
Yeah, the missionaries were really
taking a lot of care in thinking

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.800
about which terminology to use.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.200
And when we compare the
doctrinal literature that we have

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.330
from highland Guatemala, we see
that it's not standardized at all.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:43.760
It's very eclectic.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:48.170 position:56%
Missionaries from different orders
use different translation techniques

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:50.140
and different strategies.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:54.780
And what we can see is that
there are particular differences

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.920
between Franciscans and Dominicans.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:05.270
Franciscans prefer to use
neologisms, so the prime example

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:09.460
for this is that they
refuse to re-use any kind

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.260 position:56%
of indigenous term for labeling god.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.490
They would introduce
the Spanish term "dios."

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:22.860
And maybe change that to the
Mayan sound system a little bit

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.440
so it sounds like "kiosh."

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:30.680
Yeah, but they would not introduce
any indigenous terminology,

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.600
which is something that
the Dominicans did.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.240 position:56%
And they did that very deliberately.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:41.450
And we can see that also in
documents from other Dominican

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:46.530
or areas in which the Dominicans
had a lot of missionary activity

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:49.870
like in Quechua documents
from the Andes.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:55.440 position:56%
Anna Dorsen [phonetic] has written
about those in quite a detailed way.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:01.080
And yeah, we have very
different approaches here.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:05.000 position:56%
The Dominicans, this is what makes
the Dominican materials interesting.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.520
And this is what makes highland
Guatemala a very interesting place

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:13.310
for researching the mission and
the production or the creation

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:17.070
of Christian terminology
and Christian concepts

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:20.870
in Mayan languages because
we have these two regions,

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.620
we have the K'iche' speaking region

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.730
and we have the Kaqchikel
speaking region,

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:26.620 position:56%
two languages which are very similar

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:32.450 position:56%
but the Kaqchikel region was mostly
dominated by Franciscan missionaries

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:34.930
and the K'iche' region
by Dominicans.

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:37.870
And they have very different
approaches to translation.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:41.800
And you see in the Dominican
material all this re-use

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:48.480
of terminology and Gary has written
quite extensively about the re-use

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.350
of couplets and parallelism.

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:58.210
So Domingo de Vico is someone who
has adopted the ritual language

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:03.170 position:56%
that was used in highland Guatemala,
and is used to the present day,

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:08.790
Mayan ceremonial specialists
use a specific form

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:14.210
of ceremonial discourse which
has a lot of parallelisms

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:19.260
and couplet structure and this
very couplet structure you find

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.070
in these Dominican documents.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:28.680
And as I have to reference this
to Gary, I mean this is his work.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.510
Just [inaudible].

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:50.350
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:52.980
I don't believe so.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.750
I think, I don't where this is,

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.580
I must honestly say
I must blank on this.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:01.970 position:56%
I don't know whether this was a
strategy that missionaries had tried

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:04.570
in other parts of the world before.

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:09.550
But it was certainly very
successful and had a good effect

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:14.030
because Remesal writes
in much detail,

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:20.070
I mean I've given you a very short
account of this very detailed

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:22.430
and colorful description
that he has,

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:29.350
about how the people really loved
these songs and loved this music

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:34.780
and the harmonies and wanted
to learn how to sing those.

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.980
And they love the outfit
of the Dominican friars

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.010
with their shaved heads
and their black

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:44.680
and white gowns, which
were interesting.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:48.950
It was just exotic, it
was something interesting.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:53.430
And that probably did have the
mission, if you were confronted

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.270
with something that
you find exciting,

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:59.050
you're probably also interested
in learning more about it

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:02.000
so I think it was a very
successful strategy.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.510
Wherever it came from, I don't know
whether it has been applied before.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:50.520
[ Inaudible ]

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:54.530 position:56%
I think this text was solely
compiled for the missionary himself.

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:58.540
We have originally called
him the highland Maya priest,

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.510
but we don't do this anymore

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:03.370 position:56%
because we don't really know whether
it was really used by a priest

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:06.280
or by a missionary
of some other order.

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.290
But it was certainly something
that somebody, I mean,

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:12.440
because we have several texts,
eclectic different texts,

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.560
that were copied by the same hand.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.240
So there was somebody in the
convent who probably sat down

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:24.920
and either copied this for himself
or had it copied for someone

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:29.620
to be used in the field,
to be used on his mission.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:35.100
He probably carried this book
with him and these songs were,

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:38.770
likely these songs, these
original songs that were drafted,

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:42.660
and they had been sung, they had
been sung all over the highlands.

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:46.020
They were a part of the
general-- oh, I'm sorry--

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:51.080
of the general law that
was produced in order

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:56.820 position:56%
to missionize and preach the gospel.

00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:01.450
And every missionary who came into
highland Guatemala probably wanted

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:04.550
to know these songs and
thereby wanted a copy of it.

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:08.240
So this copy was probably
primarily for the missionary

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.150
so that he would have
this in writing,

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:14.230
since also all the
missionaries who came from Spain,

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:16.590
they had to learn the languages.

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:20.430
They came, they knew Spanish
and they obviously knew Latin

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:26.030
and maybe Greek, but they did not
know the highland Mayan languages.

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:29.910
So they came and they first learned
the languages and these handbooks

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:38.120 position:56%
with all this material helped them
to learn and to memorize these songs

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:43.510
and sing them to the people
who could then repeat them.

00:52:43.510 --> 00:53:00.780
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:06.170
Yeah, the region of
Tezoutlan was really fierce.

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:10.830
The people there really resisted
the conquest and the Spanish

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:15.650
and it took several attempts
to defeat this region

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:18.290
and always never succeeded.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:24.080
But the conquests in the rest of
the regions had been so bloody,

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:27.490
that there was, in particular
from Bartolome de las Casas

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:31.570
and other missionaries, a
lot of resistance to this.

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:40.590
And I think the choice to use
merchants was a pragmatic one.

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:44.380
Because these were the only
people who could get in there.

00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:49.390 position:56%
I guess that the people in Tezoutlan
were so defensive the only people

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:54.120
who they would let in were
probably the merchants who came

00:53:54.120 --> 00:54:00.570
from other provinces and knew the
languages and brought in products

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.050
from other highland Mayan areas

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:10.510
that were not necessarily
controlled by the Spanish.
