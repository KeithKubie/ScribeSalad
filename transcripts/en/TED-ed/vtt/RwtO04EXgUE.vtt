00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:13.246
It has no taste, color or smell,
and we often look right through it.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.147
It covers over 70% of the Earth,

00:00:16.147 --> 00:00:21.086
cycling from the oceans and rivers
to the clouds and back again.

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:24.754
It even makes up about 60% of our bodies.

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:27.933
With all this water around and inside us,

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:31.182
it's easy to take 
its presence for granted.

00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:36.678
But in the rest of the solar system,
liquid water is almost impossible to find.

00:00:36.678 --> 00:00:40.236
So how did our planet end up 
with so much of this substance

00:00:40.236 --> 00:00:42.684
and where did it come from?

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:44.063
As you probably know,

00:00:44.063 --> 00:00:47.273
a water molecule consists 
of two basic parts.

00:00:47.273 --> 00:00:49.971
Hydrogen, the simplest of all elements,

00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:54.021
has been around since close 
to the beginning of our universe.

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:57.559
Oxygen entered the scene 
several hundred million years later

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.001
after stars began to form.

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:05.139
The massive pressure at the center
of these fiery infernos was so great

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:09.377
that hydrogen atoms 
fused together to form helium.

00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:12.915
Helium, in turn, fused 
to form heavier elements,

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:21.144
like beryllium, carbon and oxygen
in a process known as nucleosynthesis.

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:25.603
When stars eventually collapsed
and exploded into supernovas,

00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:29.239
these new elements 
were spread across the universe

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:34.990
and combined into new compounds,
like the now familiar H2O.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.113
These water molecules 
were present in the dusty cloud

00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:40.326
that formed our solar system

00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:43.826
and more collided with our planet
after its formation.

00:01:43.826 --> 00:01:46.706
But there's a big question 
that we don't have the answer to:

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:51.007
how much water arrived on Earth, and when?

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:52.778
If, as one theory goes,

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:57.278
relatively small amounts of water were
present on Earth when the rock formed,

00:01:57.278 --> 00:02:00.934
the high temperatures 
and lack of any surrounding atmosphere

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:04.017
would have caused it 
to evaporate back into space.

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:06.510
Water would have been unable 
to remain on the planet

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.003
until hundreds of millions of years later

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:13.437
when our first atmosphere formed
through a process called outgassing.

00:02:13.437 --> 00:02:15.982
This occurred when 
molten rock in the Earth's core

00:02:15.982 --> 00:02:18.867
released volcanic gasses to the surface,

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:22.173
creating a layer 
that could then trap escaping water.

00:02:22.173 --> 00:02:24.904
So how then did water 
get back to the planet?

00:02:24.904 --> 00:02:26.642
Scientists have long suspected

00:02:26.642 --> 00:02:30.081
that much of it was brought
by ice-bearing comets,

00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:35.128
or more likely asteroids that bombarded
the Earth over millions of years.

00:02:35.128 --> 00:02:37.564
Recent research 
has challenged this theory.

00:02:37.564 --> 00:02:40.785
In examining carbonaceous 
chondrite meterorites

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:43.867
that formed shorty after the birth
of our solar system,

00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:47.296
scientists have found 
that not only did they contain water,

00:02:47.296 --> 00:02:51.377
but their mineral chemical composition
matched rocks on Earth

00:02:51.377 --> 00:02:56.152
and samples from an asteroid that 
formed at the same time as our planet.

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:58.544
This suggests that the Earth 
may have accumulated

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:02.621
a substantial amount of water early on
that was able to stay put,

00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:04.672
despite the lack of an atmosphere,

00:03:04.672 --> 00:03:08.270
though asteroids may 
have brought more over the eons.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.785
If this turns out to be true,

00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:14.316
life may have formed much earlier
than previously thought.

00:03:14.316 --> 00:03:17.564
So we do not yet definitively know
whether the water on Earth

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.487
came from its initial formation,

00:03:19.487 --> 00:03:20.995
later impacts,

00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:23.349
or some combination of the two.

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.416
Regardless, the water that runs from our
showers, drinking fountains and faucets

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:32.007
is something that didn't just come from
a nearby lake or river,

00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:37.022
but first underwent a cosmic 
and chaotic journey to get here.
