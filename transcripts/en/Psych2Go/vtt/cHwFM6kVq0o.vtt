00:00:00.725 --> 00:00:01.725
 

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:02.965
 

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:05.345
 

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.465
Working toward long term achievements can be mentally and

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:11.375
physically exhausting. It can be a

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:14.005
let down to work towards a goal and not see results as

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.015
quickly as you were hoping for. But if you work smart

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:20.065
achieving your goals is possible. No matter your goals,

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:23.700
here at psych2go we have 7 tips to help you achieve them.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.265
One, write your goals down. Even if you

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:31.305
know what you want, actually writing down your goals has proven

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:34.315
to be more effective. Make sure that it's visible

00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:37.415
so you have a continual reminder on what you've set out to achieve.

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:40.455
try putting a note on your bathroom mirror or your fridge

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:42.105
so you'll see it everyday.

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:45.300
Two, be patient with yourself.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.785
Rome wasn't built in a day

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:49.745
and reaching your goals won't necessarily happen super fast.

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:53.025
It will likely take hours and hours of hard work.

00:00:53.105 --> 00:00:57.800
The best things in life often take time and that makes them more rewarding

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:00.895
Three, make time in your week for goals.

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:03.715
Instead of trying to rush through your project, allow

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:06.615
yourself an hour a day or a day a week to work on small

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:09.115
sub-goals that will contribute to your overall vision.

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:12.465
Doing things weekly in small segments will help prevent

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:15.965
you from feeling stuck or frustrated in your attempt to achieve your goal

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.800
Four, celebrate your acheivements no matter how small.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.300
Sometimes if can feel like you're so far from reaching a milestone

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.700
and you're more only closer than where you started

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.700
But if you're actively working towards something, that's not true.

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:33.775
Remember that these goals are called long term for a reason.

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:36.435
Find a way to reward yourself with a favourite snack or

00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:38.545
activity when you finish a part of your goal.

00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:43.200
Five, remember that roadblocks aren't failures.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.200
We all know the phrase 'when one door closes, another one opens'.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.200
Well, it's not just inspiring, it's factual.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.700
Sometimes life has a different plan for how we achieve our goals.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.100
So next time you hit a wall, remember to be kind to yourself.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.400
You never know what could be around the corner.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.060
Six, listen to criticism and do not take it personally.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.300
Criticisms are not personal attacks on your work.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.240
They aren't a chance for you to get defensive and possessive of your work and goals.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.100
Instead, take the criticism and use it to refine and improve upon your goal

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.580
and the methods of getting there.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.280
Critisism allows us to double check our work with new eyes

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.500
and create something even more amazing.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.600
Seven, work with like minded people.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.100
This is an especially important tip

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.300
because it's easy for you to feel like you're alone in your endeavours.

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:35.185
There's also other times where you'll feel stuck in your efforts to

00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:38.720
figure out solutions to the hurdles that sit between you and your achievements.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.400
Talking and collaborating with those who share similar goals

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.200
is actually a great way to see things in a different way,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.080
getting inspired and maintain drive.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.180
Climbing the mountain of success

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.540
is always easier when you're working as a team.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.795
