00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.879
Your body is made up of many atoms...around
7 octillion to be exact. These make up the

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.410
37 trillion cells in your body, which are
actually much younger than you think. The

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.679
cells that line your stomach regenerate every
5 days - which makes sense as stomach acid

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.250
can dissolve metal; Your skin's outer layer,
known as the epidermis, is shed every two

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.449
to four weeks, meaning after one year you’ll
shed roughly 0.7 kg (1.5lbs) of dead skin;

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.710
and only some cells have been with you your
entire life - those of the inner lens of the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.460
eye, the muscle cells of the heart, and the
neurons of the cerebral cortex in your brain,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.120
which is is largely responsible for your memory.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.719
And while the brain may seem small, all those
wrinkles are for a good reason. Spread it

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.219
all out, and the brain would be about the
size of a pillowcase! Which is great for the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.949
trillion nerves powering your memory. In fact,
studies have shown that after viewing 2,500

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.210
images for only 3 seconds, participants could
recall if they had seen one of the images

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.890
with 92% accuracy.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.969
Don’t believe your eyes? Maybe it’s because
you spend 10% of the day blinking - but they

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.220
can actually distinguish between 2.3 to 7.5
million colours. Your nose is able to discriminate

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.159
between 1 trillion different smells, meanwhile
your fingers can feel a ridge as small as

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.850
13 nanometers in size - that’s 7500X smaller
than the diameter of a human hair. And while

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.189
you may not think much of your pinky finger,
without it, you’d lose 50% of your hands

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.369
strength. Sure, the index and middle finger
are essential to help pinch and grab with

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.600
the thumb, but it’s your ring and pinky
that give your hand power.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.200
Now clasp one hand into the other - that’s
roughly the size of your heart! It beats 100,000

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.829
times per day, pumping 5.5 litres with each
pulse, which is close to 3 million litres

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.140
of blood a year. If you live to 75, it would
fill 90 Olympic size swimming pools.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.130
When it’s all said and done, human decomposition
begins around 4 minutes after death. This

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.070
process is known as self-digestion, in which
your enzymes and bacteria eat you away. In

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.640
fact, three to five pounds of your body is
made up of bacteria. In a an unclean mouth

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.310
alone, 100 million to 1 billion bacteria can
grow on each tooth – with 32 teeth each,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.720
some of us have more bacteria in our mouth
than there are people in the world.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.690
If that leaves you weak in the knees, don’t
worry - your bones are incredibly strong!

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.090
When testing compression strength for a rate
of 1 sec, an 83kg person with US shoe size

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.540
11 could have 16,000 people stand on their
bone at once - that is of course, if there

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.980
was room!

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.040
From the bones of our ancestors, we can extra
DNA to learn about them. But if we were to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.540
take all of your DNA from your entire body
and uncoil it, it would stretch about 10 billion

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.920
miles, which is from here to Pluto and back!
And if you took all of your veins, capillaries

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.400
and arteries, and laid them

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.500
end to end...you’d die. So...don’t do
that!

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
