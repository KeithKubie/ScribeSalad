00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.710
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Thank you
for having me, first of all.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.780
It's an honor to be here,
and I'm excited to do this.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.330
I looked up some of the other
conversations that you've had,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.090
and this is very cool
for me to get to do this.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.350
JASON ANDREAS: Thank you.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.770
MICHAEL SCHLOW: It
starts when I'm a kid.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.287
I needed a job, and
I was 14 years old.

00:00:25.287 --> 00:00:25.870
I grew up in--

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.870
I was born in
Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.062
And when I went to high
school, my parents,

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.520
we moved to
Somerville, New Jersey,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.689
and that's where I
went to high school.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.740
JASON ANDREAS: And
to clarify, Brooklyn

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.750
was very different back
then than it is now, right?

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.625
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:38.660
Brooklyn, you know, the
cool parts of Brooklyn

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.159
today were parts
you weren't allowed

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.330
to go to when I was a kid.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.240
You were shot and
killed, basically.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.380
And now they're all really
high-end, super cool places.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.190
But my dad was an attorney,
and he was the kind of guy

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.490
who just believed in
hard work and good ethics

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.120
and good morals, and you've
got to work for what you want.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.700
And so there was this
stereo that I coveted,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.129
and I wanted him
to buy it for me.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.920
And he said, well, I'll
pay for half of it.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.930
And I'm 14, you know,
making no money,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.716
and my allowance was just
barely covering lunch, you know?

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:15.090
So he said, you
should get a job.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.250
And I was 14, and I lied
to get my first job.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.040
I told them I was 16 so
I could work extra hours.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.450
And I was a dishwasher.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.850
And as much as it
was hard work--

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.110
hot, sweaty, gross work--

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.610
I loved it.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.580
There was a connection
to the guest,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.610
and there was this interaction
between the staff that just

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.290
called me, and I just loved it.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.610
And I worked in that restaurant
all through high school.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.810
And they allowed me--

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.170
I remember, I'll never forget--

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.410
the bartenders were
old school bartenders.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.640
They said, in order to
be a good bartender,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.181
you have to read
two newspapers a day

00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:51.380
so you can talk about sports and
politics and the stock market,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.190
and you could have
a little something

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.420
to say about a lot
of different things.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.700
And at the end of the night
when I was closing up,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.790
they'd be sitting there
counting their piles of money,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.290
and they'd say, hey, Michael.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.727
Do you want to get behind
the bar and pour us a beer?

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:04.310
And I just thought
it was the greatest

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.029
honor to pour the
bartenders their beer

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:07.820
at the end of the night
while I was putting

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.139
glasses and whatnot away.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.180
And that was sort of the start
of just being interested.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.330
And I always was interested
in cooking, even as a kid.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.080
I was a jock who
played all sports,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.360
but I also loved cooking.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.360
My mother and my
grandmother, great cooks.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.120
And the kitchen was a very
central part of the house,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.782
for sure.

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:29.240
JASON ANDREAS: I was going to
ask you-- sorry to interrupt.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.890
I was going to ask you the
name of that first restaurant

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.400
if you recalled it.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.120
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Of
course, I remember it.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.650
JASON ANDREAS: Well,
they hired a 14-year-old,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.340
and they were also letting
you serve them beer,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.550
so maybe we should leave
that off the record.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.830
MICHAEL SCHLOW: No,
it's not there anymore,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.780
so they can't get in
that much trouble.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.560
JASON ANDREAS: So then
throw it out there.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.670
MICHAEL SCHLOW: It was
called The Newsroom.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.190
JASON ANDREAS: The Newsroom.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.560
Oh, very appropriate.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.351
MICHAEL SCHLOW: It was
called The Newsroom,

00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:47.400
and it was the precursor to
what "Cheers" was, sort of like.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400
You walked in, and everybody
did know your name,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.608
and they knew what you drank.

00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:52.820
And you know, once I
got old enough to drink,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.182
you know, you walked in
there, and whatever you liked

00:02:55.182 --> 00:02:57.640
was sort of sitting at your
seat before you ever got there.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.056
It was a special
place, and that's

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:00.950
what sort of got me going.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.636
And I kept in touch with
the ownership there forever.

00:03:05.636 --> 00:03:07.010
The owner was the
one that helped

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.759
me get into culinary
school, and I decided

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.250
that's what I wanted to do.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.833
JASON ANDREAS: You
had mentioned too--

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:14.980
so you were a jock who was
also interested in food.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.680
And I believe-- maybe you're
right at this fork in the road.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.460
But you had the opportunity to
go on and play baseball, right?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.725
And you made the decision to--

00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:25.850
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Well, the
decision was made for me.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.247
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:26.746
OK.

00:03:26.746 --> 00:03:28.070
Fair.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.000
MICHAEL SCHLOW: I was
a very good athlete,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.420
but I got hurt also.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.265
So I went to college and
I played ball in school,

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:36.890
but I got hurt.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.847
And you know, listen.

00:03:38.847 --> 00:03:41.180
There's a million people that
have a similar story to me

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.660
where they did decently as a
high school or college athlete

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.007
and got hurt, and
couldn't play any longer.

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:49.340
So I actually did-- the funny
thing is that the culinary

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.910
school that I went to called
the Academy of Culinary Arts,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.310
you were allowed to take--

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.800
or you're not allowed, you
had to take extra classes

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.460
in a local junior college.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.580
And you got all the sort
of rights and privileges,

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.660
if you wanted to be in a play
or you wanted to do something.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.910
So I had gotten hurt, and I
really couldn't pitch anymore.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.460
I was a pitcher.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.970
But I could still
hit really well.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.217
So I went out for the baseball
team at this junior college.

00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:14.300
JASON ANDREAS: The ringer.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.760
MICHAEL SCHLOW: And they
thought I was a joke, because I

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.839
was in the culinary
school, and they'd never

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.980
had anybody from the culinary
school try out for a team

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.360
before.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.943
And they would tease me and say
things like, oh, what are you,

00:04:22.943 --> 00:04:24.320
in the Betty Crocker league?

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.590
And I swear to God.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.215
Or then they would tease me
and say, oh, in the summer,

00:04:28.215 --> 00:04:30.090
you play in the continental
breakfast league?

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.215
And they would come up with
all these names for me.

00:04:32.215 --> 00:04:33.860
And then I tried
out, and showed them

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.943
that I was actually a
really good baseball player,

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.940
and they wanted me
on the team then.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.690
But you know, the whole thing
is when you're lucky enough

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.410
to find that thing, that if
you're going to-- you know,

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.832
work takes a lot of time
out of our day, obviously.

00:04:47.832 --> 00:04:49.790
And when you find that
thing that just clicks--

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.092
and I hope people are lucky
enough to find that one thing.

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:54.300
I didn't know what I wanted--

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.008
my dad wanted me to
be a lawyer with him.

00:04:56.008 --> 00:04:57.350
I didn't want to do that.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.690
I had other friends
that said with the way

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.300
that I just sort of behaved
and whatnot that I should maybe

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.089
go into finance and economics.

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:05.130
I didn't want to do that.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.921
I wanted to do something
that was creative.

00:05:06.921 --> 00:05:11.520
And what I love about my job is
that it encompasses everything.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.089
It's art.

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.630
It's history.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.860
It's geography.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.970
You're a cheerleader.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.160
You're a psychiatrist.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.140
You have to be a
business person.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.660
You get to be an artist as well.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.210
But at the end of the day,
you're taking care of people,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.560
and you're teaching.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.137
And that's the
part that really--

00:05:27.137 --> 00:05:29.220
once I got to a certain
point in my career, that's

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.770
the part that I think sort
of gets me up every day

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.957
and makes it so exciting.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:35.290
And plus, I get to deal with
lots of different cuisines.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.832
So it's not like I'm only
making hamburgers all day long.

00:05:37.832 --> 00:05:40.040
So I get to play around with
lots of different foods.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.980
JASON ANDREAS: Well,
what was it for you?

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.140
You talked about this
idea of clicking.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.550
What was it for
you that clicked?

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.175
Obviously, you were
in culinary school.

00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:48.600
What was it for you that
drove you to say, OK, I want

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.250
to continue to pursue this?

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.629
And then ultimately,
you started working.

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:55.170
You toured, and you worked in
a lot of different restaurants.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.800
Some of the best restaurants
around the country.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.860
And then ultimately-- and
talk about that piece.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.940
But also then, what took you
from maybe the next click that

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.060
took you from working in other
people's restaurants to now

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.630
your own?

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.880
MICHAEL SCHLOW: So there's
several questions in there.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.490
So the early part really is--

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.900
JASON ANDREAS: We like
multi-part questions here

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.240
at Google.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.000
MICHAEL SCHLOW: And just to see
if I'm paying attention also.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.700
JASON ANDREAS: You forget any
of the parts, I'll remind you.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.270
MICHAEL SCHLOW: So the
early part certainly

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.730
was that at a very
early age, I realized

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.080
that girls thought it was
cool that I liked to cook.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.700
I could not play the guitar.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.070
I really am not good with
mechanics and stuff like that.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.380
But I can cook for you.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.410
And that's how it
sort of started.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.837
I started cooking for
girls I was interested in,

00:06:33.837 --> 00:06:35.170
and they thought that that was--

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.120
JASON ANDREAS: That's as
good a reason as any, right?

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.995
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:37.749
And it was funny.

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:39.540
I recently ran into an
old friend of mine--

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.710
not somebody I dated.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.300
And she said, do you
remember that you

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.550
would come over in college and
make us omelets in the morning?

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.390
I was like, yeah.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.730
I loved your roommate, you know?

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.730
I wanted her to like me.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.390
So that was the start of it.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.172
And I swear, that's
the real reason.

00:06:53.172 --> 00:06:55.005
JASON ANDREAS: That's
a great story for her.

00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:56.640
When I was in college,
Michael Schlow

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.630
would come over and
cook us omelets.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.280
MICHAEL SCHLOW:
Exactly, you know?

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.690
JASON ANDREAS: Not bad.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.381
MICHAEL SCHLOW: But
then there was something

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.100
that's sort of unspoken.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.940
And you know,
whatever it is you do,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.250
and when you find
your passion in life

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.130
and you're lucky
enough to realize

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.550
that this is that moment where,
this is the thing I want to do,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.900
the light bulb goes off.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.479
And you just think, what's the
real definition of success?

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:21.520
You know, is it how much
money is in your wallet?

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.399
I don't think so.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.940
It's, are you getting
to do something

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.495
that you love every single day?

00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:27.870
And do you wake up energized
every day to go and do this?

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.000
Because I do work
a lot of hours,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.710
and my personal and
my business life

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.870
are really blended together.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.910
But it has been a
fascinating life

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.460
that's given me the opportunity
to travel around the world

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.280
and meet some of my
heroes and cook for them.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.100
And one of my great
passions in life

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.350
other than cooking
and my family,

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.141
obviously, is I love music.

00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:52.890
And I've gotten to
meet some of my heroes,

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.990
and ultimately become
friends with some of them

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.010
and travel with them.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.020
And I've just got--

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.187
I've had the most amazing
experiences because of it.

00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:01.853
You know, as far as
what you were asking

00:08:01.853 --> 00:08:04.260
about the restaurants and
the cooking and sort of how

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.030
it goes, some of it's just
dumb luck also, you know?

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:07.530
[LAUGH]

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:07.920
It is.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.510
I mean, sometimes you're
just in the right place

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.120
at the right time.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.661
And somebody doesn't
show up, and you

00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:15.920
know, you think about that
path and how you move forward.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.420
And sometimes you think, oh,
was this the right move for me?

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.410
But then you look at sort
of the cataclysmic jumps

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.900
of each thing that happens,
and it worked out for me.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.360
It's been a bumpy road at times.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.700
I mean, it hasn't just been
this beautiful line straight up.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.970
There's lots of bumps in
there and restaurant closings

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.164
and a divorce, and there's all
kinds of stuff that's happened.

00:08:36.164 --> 00:08:37.539
But that's what's
life, you know?

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:38.914
That's what makes
it interesting.

00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:41.715
And then work hard and
come out on the other side,

00:08:41.715 --> 00:08:42.960
and be successful.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.360
But you know, I think the most--

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.050
not the most-- well, one of
the most important takeaways

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.940
is about good mentorship.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.430
I was lucky enough to
have really good mentors.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:57.120
They yelled and screamed at me,
which I don't do to my staff,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.380
but it was a different time.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.954
I would have food thrown
at me or screamed at.

00:09:02.954 --> 00:09:04.620
JASON ANDREAS: Any
knives pulled on you?

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.020
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Never a knife.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.800
JASON ANDREAS: We've heard that
before at our Chefs At series.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.716
MICHAEL SCHLOW: I've
never had a knife pulled,

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.360
but I've had people
throw things at me.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.434
And you just want to say,
you know, go fuck yourself.

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:17.100
I'm not staying here
for this, you know?

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.300
This is abusive.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.270
And today's world
is about-- for me,

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.860
I learned a long
time ago that it's

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.279
got to be about teaching
and dedication, commitment,

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:27.820
and getting the people, the men
and women that work with me--

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.280
and they never work for me.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.080
That's the big difference also.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.940
I used to work for my chefs.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.484
The people that work with me
work with me versus for me.

00:09:35.484 --> 00:09:36.900
And it's just a
different approach

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.756
as to how to be a good teacher.

00:09:38.756 --> 00:09:40.380
If you want to be a
good leader, you've

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.500
got to be a good teacher.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.580
And if you want to
be a great leader,

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.600
you have to be a great teacher.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.475
JASON ANDREAS: Why do
you think that's changed?

00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:46.766
Because we've had a lot of
chefs who have come in here,

00:09:46.766 --> 00:09:49.590
and they talk about chefs of old
like the Charlie Trotters who

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.480
used to scream and
yell and throw things.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.179
And these chefs who would come
in and practice under them

00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:56.470
and learn, they were terrified.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.190
And now the chefs
that we have come in,

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.960
the most recent
ones we've had come

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.874
talk as part of the series,
it's more to what you're saying.

00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:05.040
And it makes a lot of sense.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.915
Why do you think that
was-- first of all, why

00:10:06.915 --> 00:10:08.430
was it like that in the past?

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.900
I think we know why it changed.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.330
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Well, I
think I knew, because I used

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.685
to be a yeller and a screamer.

00:10:14.685 --> 00:10:18.277
I came from that school,
and so I did the same thing.

00:10:18.277 --> 00:10:19.110
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.630
MICHAEL SCHLOW: And I used
to have this internal message

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.940
to myself.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.370
If I haven't made you cry yet,
you probably haven't heard me.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.537
It was horrible, and
it's no way to live.

00:10:28.537 --> 00:10:30.870
It's like, you're going to
give yourself a heart attack.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.869
And there was this guy--

00:10:31.869 --> 00:10:33.260
I was working in New York City.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.910
I've worked a good portion
of my life in New York

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:36.930
before moving to Boston.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.430
And there was a guy
who used to come

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.380
in every single day
for lunch by himself.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.370
And he was just--

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.050
I think it was his
only moment of peace.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.697
He would come and he'd eat lunch
in this restaurant by himself.

00:10:45.697 --> 00:10:47.280
And one day I come
out of the kitchen,

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.490
and I'm all pissed off.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.779
One of the young cooks was not
doing what I wanted him to do.

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:55.320
And the guy's reading
the newspapers.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.040
His name was George.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.000
I'll never forget him.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.064
And he would always say to me,
I make decisions all day long.

00:11:01.064 --> 00:11:03.730
You make the decision about what
I want to have for lunch today.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.660
And he'll say fish, or chicken
or whatever, and I'd go back,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.160
and I'd cook him something.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.150
And so anyway, I
come out one day,

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.250
and I said, how was
your lunch, George?

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.310
And he said, it was
really delicious.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.060
Thank you.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:12.740
And he said, what's the matter?

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.140
You look upset.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:13.770
I was like, ugh.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.460
I don't even want
to talk about it.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.600
I'm so pissed off right now.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.391
This kid Shane, he's
not doing what I want.

00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:20.430
I start ranting, and I'm
getting more and more worked up.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.692
And he said, what
is Shane's job here?

00:11:22.692 --> 00:11:24.150
And I said, well,
he's a line cook.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.890
And I start sort of
just bitching about it.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.174
And he said, well,
you're the chef, right?

00:11:31.174 --> 00:11:31.840
And I said, yep.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.630
And he said, well, I don't know
what you're so upset about.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.690
It's your fault.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.530
And I was young.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.779
I said, my fault?

00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:40.070
George, how can it be my fault?

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.199
I told him what to do.

00:11:41.199 --> 00:11:43.490
He said, well, you're going
to learn this the hard way,

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.990
I'm sure.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.870
And there's two ways.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.880
You really have
two choices here.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.930
Either train him to do his
job or deem him untrainable

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:51.934
and let him go.

00:11:51.934 --> 00:11:54.350
But you can't let him go until
you've looked in the mirror

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.180
and say, I have done
every single thing

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.754
I know how to do to
train this person.

00:11:58.754 --> 00:12:00.170
And I know it
sounds simple today,

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.840
but back then, it
was, again, one

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.170
of those light bulb moments
where I was like, you know,

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.899
he's right.

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:05.690
I need to change the
way that I'm training.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.550
And I've been
working my whole life

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:13.010
on perfecting ways to train my
team, but not just train them.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.510
Mentor them and
communicate to them,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.090
meaning these four
basic pillars.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.070
And I talk about
it every single day

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:23.000
to my executive team and the
people, the men and women that

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.587
are the GMs and the
chefs, because they really

00:12:25.587 --> 00:12:27.920
hold all the power and all
the cards in the restaurants.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.570
I can't be in 12
places at one time.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.140
So I need to train you, mentor
you, teach you, coach you

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.056
that this is what we
want as a company.

00:12:35.056 --> 00:12:36.180
And it's very, very simple.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.260
It's tell, show,
practice, validate.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.720
If you do those four
things yourself,

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.550
not give it off to
somebody else to do,

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.320
but as the person that is the--

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.990
whether it's the founder
or the keeper of the keys,

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.900
you know, the holder of all
the information, if you do that

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.952
and you do it 100%,
how can we have

00:12:53.952 --> 00:12:55.160
any sort of miscommunication?

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.040
Or if they're not willing to do
those four things after you've

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.710
shown them and you've validated
that this is the way we put

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.730
the cup of coffee on the
plate or on the table,

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.900
and they want to go
outside those guardrails,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.470
then they're not the right
person for your company,

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.810
and you have to let them
go, because it's not

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.040
fair to everybody else
that is doing it that way.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.780
And it also will
lose the consistency,

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.320
which is the number one reason
restaurants are successful,

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.300
I think, or any business,
for that matter.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.530
Consistency's everything.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.613
But you know, to go back
to your original question

00:13:20.613 --> 00:13:22.730
about why did it change,
it had to change.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.680
It couldn't sustain itself,
this yelling, screaming.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.570
You know, and also forget about
just court decisions and things

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.760
like that, the legalities of it.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.260
It's just a different world,
and people won't tolerate that.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.720
And also I think there's
another thing that's

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.811
sort of a crossroads, which is
there was a time when I would

00:13:41.811 --> 00:13:44.060
have-- like at Radius, for
example, the restaurant you

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.768
were starting to talk
about earlier where

00:13:45.768 --> 00:13:49.590
a lot of our awards came from,
I would have a stack of 20, 30,

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.210
40 people always willing to
work for free or for next

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.490
to nothing just
for the experience.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.650
And as the restaurant
population has exploded,

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.580
and as retail has
gone e-commerce

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.240
so you don't have as many bricks
and mortar retail operations,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.880
an incredible pressure's
put on our industry

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.640
to fill all those vacancies.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.830
Banks, coffee, food and
beverage, and fitness.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.810
Those are the four
things that are taking up

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.501
a lot of the retail space today.

00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:23.000
You don't see people building
Macy's anymore, Lord &amp; Taylors

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.833
or things like that.

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:25.080
It just doesn't happen.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:30.626
And so as that sort of
changed, the pool of talent

00:14:30.626 --> 00:14:31.750
became thinner and thinner.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.099
And so again, we
go back to things

00:14:34.099 --> 00:14:35.390
that we look at in our company.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.840
And when we look at the
characteristics of what we're

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.860
looking for to hire somebody,
at no point in the seven or 10

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.555
key characteristics is
the word experience.

00:14:46.555 --> 00:14:47.930
You don't have to
have experience

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:48.950
to come work with me.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.159
But you have to be happy,
you have to be trustworthy,

00:14:51.159 --> 00:14:53.366
you have to have a certain
amount of self-confidence.

00:14:53.366 --> 00:14:55.010
You have to be
committed, dedicated.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.551
Those are the things
I'm looking for.

00:14:56.551 --> 00:14:59.990
I'll teach you how to carry a
tray or make a bowl of pasta.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.180
But yeah, experience
isn't necessarily

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.830
the top thing for me anymore.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.246
JASON ANDREAS: How
does that-- you

00:15:05.246 --> 00:15:08.270
talked about the four pillars
and kind of these teaching

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.680
experiences.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.014
You've got 11
restaurants, correct?

00:15:12.014 --> 00:15:14.097
MICHAEL SCHLOW: I think
something like that, yeah.

00:15:14.097 --> 00:15:14.730
[LAUGH]

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.520
JASON ANDREAS: You have a lot
when you're not even sure.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:16.830
I like that.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:17.540
I wasn't sure too.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.270
I was counting them.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.640
MICHAEL SCHLOW:
Well, it's 11 or 12.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.870
Depends on-- there's
this one restaurant

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.220
where we've split it in
half, and one side's Italian.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.320
We have this little,
tiny restaurant,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.820
and we have Japanese
next to it now.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.904
It was a pop-up space.

00:15:26.904 --> 00:15:28.820
JASON ANDREAS: How do
you apply these concepts

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.580
to kind of managing all--

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.330
again, you can't be
in all places at once.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.246
You can't be in all these
restaurants at once.

00:15:34.246 --> 00:15:36.950
How do you find the right
people to manage these for you

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.380
and kind of take some of these
kind of cultural aspects,

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.350
as you talk about it,
and sprinkle them down

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.390
through the business
from executives down?

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:44.510
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.218
It's a team sport, I
mean, like anything.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.250
In Boston, I would go into
the Apple store, for example,

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.000
and I would say, how is it that
I'm getting the same experience

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.185
at every Apple store?

00:15:57.185 --> 00:15:59.810
Or how is it that you go into a
McDonald's and you get the same

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:00.830
experience at every McDonald's?

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.300
These are big companies.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:01.840
JASON ANDREAS: That
consistency, right?

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.420
MICHAEL SCHLOW:
That consistency.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.710
So where is it?

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.466
Like, what are we
not doing well,

00:16:05.466 --> 00:16:06.590
and what are we doing well?

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.135
So we're a big fan of something
called appreciative inquiry

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:10.760
in our company.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.760
And that is we look at
what we're doing well

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.732
and we try to
populate more of that.

00:16:14.732 --> 00:16:16.190
It's easy to walk
into a restaurant

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.630
and say, that's wrong,
that's wrong, that's wrong,

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.921
that's wrong, and that's wrong.

00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:20.670
That's what most managers do.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.150
So compliment sandwich is a
big deal for us, you know?

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.059
To say, hey.

00:16:24.059 --> 00:16:25.100
You're doing a great job.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.500
Last night went so well.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.830
We do need to do a better
job on whatever it might be.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.107
And then you finish them
up with another compliment.

00:16:31.107 --> 00:16:33.440
As I said, it's a team sport,
so I'm not by myself here.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.380
We have a CEO, a CFO,
directors of operations.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.690
And we meet on a weekly
basis, number one.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.930
If we can't all be in the same
room, then we do a Google Chat,

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:42.590
a Google Meet.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.180
So go Google.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.880
It's changing my life, you know?

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.580
It really has.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.680
I mean, I'm not
technologically advanced,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.669
but Google is changing my life.

00:16:51.669 --> 00:16:53.210
I'm not saying that
because I'm here.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.470
It's the truth.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.039
We have our CEO who
is a huge fan of all

00:16:57.039 --> 00:16:58.580
the different Google
products, and he

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.486
has changed our company
in a way that we're all

00:17:01.486 --> 00:17:02.360
communicating better.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.069
So communication is still--

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.240
doesn't matter what business
you're talking about--

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.380
is the number one--

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.480
whether it's business or even
in your friendship or your love

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.896
life, communication's
always going

00:17:09.896 --> 00:17:13.850
to be the number one
thing to help drive goals

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.210
and objectives.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:18.390
So we do a couple of things.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.530
We promote from within, which
is a very important thing to us.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.660
If we can't find the
person from within,

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.190
there's probably a
chance that somehow,

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.550
some way, if we're
looking to the outside,

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.430
that person has a connection to
somebody on our executive team

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.470
often, if it's a top level job.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.650
So it might be, hey,
we're looking for a new GM

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.750
at a restaurant and say,
you know who's looking?

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.041
I used to work with them at
such and such a restaurant.

00:17:41.041 --> 00:17:45.320
I know they're really good, and
I think they'd be a good fit.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.060
But you know, the
same could be said

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.010
for quite the opposite
where somebody says,

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:50.390
I know so-and-so's looking.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.210
Don't hire them, because I
know they won't be a good fit.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:56.180
You have to be cut from similar
cloth, I think, as far as--

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.540
not everybody brings the
same skill set, obviously.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.564
And not everybody
has necessarily

00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:04.980
the same experiences or in the
same place in their career.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.380
But what we hope is that you
all have the same key ingredient

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.540
to being part of our
company, and that

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.780
is to have a
predisposition to serve.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.280
And that's something we talk
about endlessly in our company.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.954
Are you the type
of person to hold

00:18:17.954 --> 00:18:20.120
that door open just a few
extra seconds for somebody

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.109
when they walk into
an office building?

00:18:22.109 --> 00:18:23.900
Are you the type of
person to say bless you

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.050
to a stranger on the subway
who's sneezed, you know?

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.180
Are you the type of person
that says, excuse me,

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.780
you dropped this, and you
go chase after somebody

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.154
because they
dropped their scarf?

00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:34.040
If you're not, and you're
that type of person

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.664
that when the elevator
door is closing,

00:18:35.664 --> 00:18:38.810
and you're in a office building,
and you press it to close it,

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:39.740
I don't want you.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.250
You know?

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.750
Yeah.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.352
[LAUGH]

00:18:41.352 --> 00:18:42.110
AUDIENCE: Google [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.410
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:43.370
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.160
So I want the one that
says, I'll hold that door.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.900
We've all been in
those situations.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.100
And you know what you do
and what you don't do.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.620
And so, again, it goes back
to that inner monologue of,

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.760
did you do the right thing?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.081
And the same thing can be
said about a hard day's work.

00:18:59.081 --> 00:19:00.830
You know if you mailed
it in today or not.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.520
Did you try your hardest?

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.645
And so those are the people
that we're looking for.

00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:09.147
And if we can find the
sort of right human being

00:19:09.147 --> 00:19:10.730
and then give them
the proper training

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.050
and the proper
guidance of what it

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.320
is that we want
from our company,

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.390
we can have a
consistent practice.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.310
You can go into any
restaurant in the country

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.050
that we're involved
in and hopefully have

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:18.924
a similar experience.

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:21.890
There will always be a little
difference because of location

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.030
and there will be a
little difference because

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.870
of a management style
or what have you.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:30.600
But overall, the sort of heart
of it needs to be the same.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.825
And I think that's what
people come to expect.

00:19:32.825 --> 00:19:35.780
That's why chains are
successful, or some chains are,

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.480
is that you know when you
go into McDonald's, you

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.496
are never going to get a
medium rare juicy hamburger.

00:19:41.496 --> 00:19:42.620
It's never going to happen.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.880
They all smell the same.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.320
They all look the same.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.400
Hopefully, they have salt
on their French fries.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.480
I don't personally eat
a lot of fast food,

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.480
but when I go to look at
these-- and it's funny.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.700
I'll go for research just to
see, have they changed at all?

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.970
And McDonald's-- I use
that as an example,

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.190
because it's the most
successful food company.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.070
And if you think
about it, they've

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.820
tried at times to convince
us that somehow there's

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.590
something healthy there, right?

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.570
They're putting
salads and doing this.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.430
But at the end of the day, what
do people go to McDonald's for?

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.096
They want a Quarter
Pounder with cheese.

00:20:15.096 --> 00:20:16.570
You don't say, oh, I'm starving.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.795
I want a salad.

00:20:17.795 --> 00:20:19.170
Let's go to
McDonald's, you know?

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.150
You might get one
when you're there,

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:21.170
but it's not the first thing.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.753
And so it's so
ingrained in your head.

00:20:22.753 --> 00:20:24.950
So what we're trying
to do is obviously,

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.372
we're not that sort of size.

00:20:26.372 --> 00:20:28.580
But what we're hoping to do
is that our company, when

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.770
you think of our
restaurants, you think of,

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.050
these are going to be
quality experiences.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.140
I don't necessarily have to pay
an arm and a leg to go to them.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.540
They're not on
the super low end.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.642
They're not on the
super high end.

00:20:39.642 --> 00:20:41.600
I have one restaurant
that's on the higher end.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.270
But the rest of them are trying
to be part of a community,

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.530
and that's what's
interesting to me also.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.090
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.590
MICHAEL SCHLOW:
Which leads me to,

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:49.410
why did you come
to Detroit, right?

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.390
[LAUGH]

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.460
JASON ANDREAS: I didn't even
have to ask the questions here.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.490
You just lead me on.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.990
I like this.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.180
Yeah.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:53.680
Absolutely.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.740
Please, tell us why.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.823
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Community.

00:20:55.823 --> 00:20:58.970
I mean, so we built this
restaurant in Birmingham

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.410
called Adachi.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.370
And it was bred from friendship.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.519
So what happened was one
of my partners in DC--

00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:10.310
we have five restaurants
in Washington, DC.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.800
And one of the partners
there grew up here.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.360
And he had some
friends visiting him,

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.360
and they brought him to
some of our restaurants.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.630
And they're developers.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.300
They're hotel guys, and
they own parking lots,

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.730
and they own some restaurants.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.280
But more like chain restaurants
and things like that.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.780
They own gas stations.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.340
They own cell phones.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.220
They're like serial
entrepreneurs, these guys.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.084
But they're really
nice, good guys.

00:21:36.084 --> 00:21:37.500
So they come into
the restaurants,

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.900
and they look, and
they're like, wow.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.630
Holy shit.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.845
Like, this is what we want.

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:44.922
This is exciting.

00:21:44.922 --> 00:21:46.630
It was one of my
restaurants called Tico.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.170
And my wife is a
mixed media artist.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:54.480
And my wife Adrienne went to
Tico and did all the painting,

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.250
did all the distressing
of the place.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.010
Built these incredibly
super cool glass

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.290
panels that have her
artwork inside of them.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.000
And she did it eight
months pregnant too,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.060
so I'll never forget
that, and she'll never

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.929
let me forget that that
she did that work pregnant.

00:22:08.929 --> 00:22:11.220
We have pictures of her,
like, on a ladder with a belly

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.594
out to here, and she's painting
and doing all this stuff.

00:22:13.594 --> 00:22:16.050
But when you see the restaurant,
it's an exciting place,

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:19.159
and it's because of her work
that it was so exciting.

00:22:19.159 --> 00:22:21.450
And when they came in to see
it, they immediately said,

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.640
this is something we would
love to see in Detroit.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.380
Now we didn't want to
do Tico in Detroit.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.060
The developers
were very specific

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.640
that they wanted a
Japanese-inspired restaurant.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.480
So they said to me, you've got
Italian, you've got American,

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.370
you've got Latin
American, you've

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.782
got a California restaurant.

00:22:36.782 --> 00:22:38.490
Have you ever done a
Japanese restaurant?

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.030
Oh, yeah.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.160
Of course, we've done Japanese.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.285
Which, I have not.

00:22:42.285 --> 00:22:43.860
[LAUGH]

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:49.480
But I am of the attitude that
I'm not a master of everything,

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.080
but if I put my mind to it and
my heart to it, then I will--

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.796
and I had made food
like this before,

00:22:54.796 --> 00:22:56.670
but never built a whole
restaurant around it.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.500
So I had some
time, and I started

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.720
to work with some
people that I really

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.990
enjoyed working with, and just
learning some more techniques.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.551
I had already worked with
these kinds of products before.

00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:08.050
But when they said
Japanese, I said,

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.633
well, let's call it
Japanese-inspired,

00:23:09.633 --> 00:23:12.330
so it gives us a little bit
of room, a little wiggle room.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.810
And they allowed me to help
pick the designer, a woman named

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.540
Molly Allen from Washington, DC.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.370
And if you haven't
been to Adachi yet,

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.160
it's a real push and
pull sort of experience

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.240
in that you go down South
Woodward in Birmingham,

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.600
and there's this old,
beautiful, Peabody Ford mansion,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.680
it's called.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.349
And it's on this corner.

00:23:33.349 --> 00:23:34.890
And you look at it,
and it could have

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:39.210
been a lovely old
French restaurant

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.169
or American restaurant.

00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:41.585
JASON ANDREAS:
Victorian-inspired.

00:23:41.585 --> 00:23:42.957
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah, exactly.

00:23:42.957 --> 00:23:44.790
JASON ANDREAS: Our
office now is in Detroit,

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.070
but we used to be in Birmingham,
so we're two blocks from there.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.860
MICHAEL SCHLOW: So
you know where it is.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.050
JASON ANDREAS: So we know
the mansion very well, yeah.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.091
MICHAEL SCHLOW: And so
you walk in today, though,

00:23:51.091 --> 00:23:54.420
and it's super cool
with this mural.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.412
And I've got the music.

00:23:56.412 --> 00:23:57.870
As I said, music's
important to me.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.730
I do all the music for
all the restaurants.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.530
And you walk in,
and you're changed

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.066
with this energy
that is unexpected,

00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:04.940
which is what I like.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.410
I always like a little
surprise here and there.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.140
And we have a
fantastic chef that I

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.320
was able to hire named
Lloyd Roberts who is just

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.180
doing a beautiful job there
and making really consistent,

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.130
really good food.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:21.114
But when I came to visit
them, when I first came here,

00:24:21.114 --> 00:24:22.530
it was really with
the thought of,

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.060
like, I'm just going to
help out these friends

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.320
and give them some advice.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.934
And advice turned into, well,
how about if you consult?

00:24:27.934 --> 00:24:29.850
And consult turned into,
why don't you design?

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:31.190
And design has now
turned into, well,

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.000
why don't you manage
the property for us?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.970
So the restaurant business
is a tough business.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.090
It's a game of inches.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.820
And so I'm happy to
be here, and we're

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.070
going to do more projects
with them, because we've had

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.540
such a good experience so far.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.100
And the place is
packed, which is--

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.950
[KNOCKING]

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.750
--knock on some
metally, plastic thing--

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:49.870
that's it's really busy.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.330
So I'm super happy with it.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:51.570
JASON ANDREAS: That's great.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:52.510
Well, congratulations.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:56.890
And thanks for
considering Michigan.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.400
The city of Detroit
in particular

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.980
has seen its ups and downs.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.980
And food has been
a huge cornerstone

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.561
and a lot of the
reason that people

00:25:07.561 --> 00:25:08.810
are moving back into the city.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.380
So it's great to have you here.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:15.990
What have you learned through
the process of consulting,

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.581
then now managing the
restaurant and adding it

00:25:18.581 --> 00:25:19.330
to your portfolio?

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.750
What have you learned being in
the city of Detroit about kind

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.120
of what's going on in Detroit?

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.950
Have you found any
favorite restaurants?

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.250
What's your outlook now on
the city of Detroit, now

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.060
being part of the culture here?

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.835
MICHAEL SCHLOW: So
it's a great question,

00:25:32.835 --> 00:25:34.140
and I would say
the first thing I

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.848
tell people, anybody
who'll listen to me,

00:25:35.848 --> 00:25:38.040
is that I do believe
having grown up

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.555
in Brooklyn that Detroit
is the next Brooklyn.

00:25:41.555 --> 00:25:42.930
I really believe
that to be true.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.390
And that's not some sort of
lip service because I'm here.

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.190
I believe that Detroit
and Brooklyn have

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.610
a certain odd synergy,
and I can't necessarily

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.990
nail what that
is, but I feel it.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:58.220
There's this movement of young,
entrepreneurial, cool ideas,

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.510
creative-- you know, it's
all based around that.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.360
But without that
Manhattan skyline,

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.320
which when you
lived in Brooklyn,

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.766
Manhattan always sort of got
center stage and be like, oh.

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:08.640
You live in Brooklyn.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.341
Now it's, oh, you
live in Brooklyn?

00:26:10.341 --> 00:26:11.340
It's cool now, you know?

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.430
It was never cool back
then, but now it's cool.

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.250
And Detroit was, I think for--

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.520
candidly, obviously,
for many, many years,

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:25.620
downtrodden and had gone
through such financial issues

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.550
and problems.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:30.430
And now you see
this gentrification.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.999
You have beautiful,
beautiful architecture here

00:26:32.999 --> 00:26:34.290
people are taking advantage of.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.706
The problem was
the buildings were

00:26:35.706 --> 00:26:37.050
just empty and dilapidated.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.508
But now they're
being brought back,

00:26:38.508 --> 00:26:39.850
or new buildings are being done.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:44.120
So there's this beautiful
very interesting to me

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.647
combination of old and new here.

00:26:45.647 --> 00:26:47.480
You have a lot of chefs
that are coming out,

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.800
some that have Michigan roots.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.200
So like Anthony from SheWolf.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.960
I don't know if you guys have
been to that restaurant before,

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.880
but he just came to
visit me on Monday.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.820
You know, I knew him
from Washington, DC.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.350
And the fact that
he comes back here

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.840
and is just crushing it
with beautiful Italian food

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.160
and handmade pastas.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.900
And you could be
in any major city

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.540
in the world and hope
for an experience

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.130
like you would get at SheWolf.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.250
And so the one thing I would
say that's been surprising to me

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:18.090
is when I heard about Detroit,
I thought, oh, there's

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:21.419
going to be so many people
that will need jobs.

00:27:21.419 --> 00:27:22.710
And that's not really the case.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.410
The unemployment's
fairly low here.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.080
And so the restaurants are
all, like in any other part

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.340
of the country, struggling
to fill all the positions.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.600
But we've been lucky.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.485
In Birmingham, we've got a
decent crew there that started.

00:27:36.485 --> 00:27:37.860
You have a little
bit of turnover

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.060
at the beginning
of any restaurant.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.018
But the crew that's there
today is really good.

00:27:41.018 --> 00:27:42.930
So better and better and better.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.231
The service has been good.

00:27:44.231 --> 00:27:45.730
I've been to a bunch
of places here.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.060
I got stuck here in
a blizzard last year.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.037
JASON ANDREAS:
That happens, yeah.

00:27:50.037 --> 00:27:51.495
MICHAEL SCHLOW:
Just a little note.

00:27:51.495 --> 00:27:54.210
I'm not speaking
poorly about Detroit.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.250
You can plow before
the snow ends.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:56.760
[LAUGH]

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.726
It's allowed.

00:27:57.726 --> 00:28:00.100
We do it in Boston all the
time, and it works out really,

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:00.570
really nicely.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.810
But apparently here, they
wait till it stops snowing.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:03.240
JASON ANDREAS: They do.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:03.450
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:04.500
But it snows a lot
here, doesn't it?

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.100
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, it does.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.558
MICHAEL SCHLOW: So
really piled up,

00:28:06.558 --> 00:28:07.870
and nobody could go anywhere.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.825
So I just walked everywhere
that I wanted to go to.

00:28:11.825 --> 00:28:14.910
But I had great drinks
and a great experience

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.072
at Wright &amp; Company,
Apparatus Room.

00:28:18.072 --> 00:28:20.280
I'm trying to remember all
the places that I went to.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.470
But it's been a great
experience here.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:24.700
And the people are
nice here, you know?

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.920
I think where I grew up, there's
just an incredible amount

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.790
of sarcasm.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.780
Everybody's so
sandwiched together.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.749
Not that they're mean,
but there's a jab all

00:28:34.749 --> 00:28:35.790
the time that's going on.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.620
Your friends, your best
friends are the ones

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.911
that make fun of you, you know?

00:28:38.911 --> 00:28:41.030
And I don't sense that
here in the same way.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.310
You know, maybe it happens.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.090
But I certainly get
the sense that people

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.100
are very, very nice to
each other and pleasant,

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.162
and it's lovely.

00:28:48.162 --> 00:28:50.370
JASON ANDREAS: Still the
Midwest spirit we have here.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.090
MICHAEL SCHLOW: I
think that's nice.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.940
I mean, probably the East Coast
could use a little bit of that

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.600
every once in a while.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.527
JASON ANDREAS: Can you talk a
little bit more about Adachi

00:28:58.527 --> 00:29:00.360
and kind of where the
inspiration came from?

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.710
I know that the proprietors
initially wanted

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.300
a Japanese-inspired restaurant.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.680
Where did it go?

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.655
How did it go from just
this idea to Adachi?

00:29:11.655 --> 00:29:12.930
What's the name represent?

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:15.555
What type of food did you decide
to bring into that restaurant?

00:29:15.555 --> 00:29:17.180
MICHAEL SCHLOW: So
one of the partners,

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.650
a guy named Ken Koza--

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.587
and Kenny is just a
great guy who just wants

00:29:22.587 --> 00:29:23.670
to take care of everybody.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:28.290
He owns all this stuff, and he's
in part of a family business.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:33.510
But he singularly just said, I
really, for personal reasons,

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.250
want a Japanese-inspired
restaurant.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.900
He had lived in Japan
for a little while,

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.130
and he was enamored by
the Adachi gardens there.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.250
But also, Adachi's a
fairly common last name.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.380
And he stayed with this
family for a little while

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.690
that their last name
was Adachi as well.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:52.800
And he liked the sound of it,
and so there's a museum there.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.930
There's the Adachi gardens.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:56.040
And that was a name
he had always had.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.260
And so when he came to me,
he said, can you do this?

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.660
So I said, I can do
this, but if I'm not

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.090
going to move to
the Detroit area,

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.200
we need to have a
killer chef, you know?

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.440
We need something that
really can understand

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.450
what I'm going to
tell them food-wise,

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.150
and then execute it
on a daily basis.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:17.220
So I started to do
a search for staff,

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:21.000
but specifically for my chef.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.800
And I wasn't getting the
responses that I had hoped for,

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.300
and I quite frankly was
like, I am fucked, you know?

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.690
Sorry for my language, but
I am totally screwed here.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.690
And I don't know how I'm
going to pull this off,

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.577
because if I don't have the
right chef, I can't move there.

00:30:36.577 --> 00:30:37.660
And what am I going to do?

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.930
Because my name's on the door.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.560
I have to have the right person.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.947
And so this resume
comes in from Indeed.

00:30:44.947 --> 00:30:46.530
And I think somebody's
pulling my leg.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.280
I think it's a joke.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.710
And I read it, and
it comes from Dubai.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.480
I was like, somebody
in Dubai's applying

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.316
for a job in Birmingham?

00:30:56.316 --> 00:30:57.440
Somebody's messing with me.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.730
And I look a little further,
and I say to my assistant,

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.854
you've got to set me up
with a Skype call for this.

00:31:01.854 --> 00:31:03.330
Just email this person first.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.100
See if they're
really interested.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.685
And on the resume was
New York City, some

00:31:08.685 --> 00:31:09.810
of my favorite restaurants.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:14.130
Jean-Georges, the Modern
with Gabriel Kreuther

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:15.690
when he was the chef there.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.370
Nobu, one downtown.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.642
Then Nobu Fifty Seven.

00:31:18.642 --> 00:31:20.100
And then it says,
this person who's

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:25.650
named Lloyd Roberts has
moved from Nobu Fifty Seven

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:28.770
and is the executive chef
of Nobu Budapest, then

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.350
Nobu Moscow, and
then goes to Dubai

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.020
to become the executive
chef of Wakame in Dubai.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.510
And I just think it's a total--

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.540
you know, somebody's
playing with me.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.524
So then we set up a Skype call.

00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:42.690
And now I'm really convinced
that somebody's playing

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.990
with me, because
on my Skype call

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:53.610
is this large African American
man who was born in Jamaica.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:54.660
And I'm like, OK.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.830
Who are you?

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.607
He's like, I'm Lloyd Roberts.

00:31:57.607 --> 00:31:58.690
And I was like, all right.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:31:59.727
Let's start talking.

00:31:59.727 --> 00:32:01.560
And I immediately fall
in love with the guy.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.540
He's so sweet, so nice,
but super talented.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.400
And we start talking
about food, and he

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.790
understands everything I say.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.460
Like, that doesn't
happen every time.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.293
You know, sometimes
I'll bring something up,

00:32:13.293 --> 00:32:15.290
and somebody's like, I
don't know about that.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.130
He knew everything.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:20.420
And we had sort of similar
parallel lines in New York.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:25.030
And I said, well, I can't fly
to Dubai to taste your food.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.050
And do you want to move
back to the States?

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:30.899
He has two kids and he
met his wife in Russia,

00:32:30.899 --> 00:32:32.690
I believe, or maybe
when he was in England.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:33.820
I can't remember where they met.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.240
But he said, we want to
come back to the States,

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.490
but I don't want to work in New
York, San Francisco, Chicago.

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:38.230
I don't want to
be in a big city.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.110
I said, oh, have I
got the place for you.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.600
I said, this is
going to be great.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.720
I've got this great town where
you can bring your kids up.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.940
Your kids can run around,
and you're going to love it.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.810
And I convinced him to look this
place up and talk to people.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.229
And he moved--

00:32:53.229 --> 00:32:54.770
I hired him without
tasting his food,

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.811
and he moved here without
ever seeing Birmingham.

00:32:56.811 --> 00:32:57.620
JASON ANDREAS: Wow.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.203
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Which
is crazy, right?

00:32:59.203 --> 00:33:01.659
And so he gets here,
and the restaurant's

00:33:01.659 --> 00:33:03.950
delayed a little bit, so I
bring him to Washington, DC,

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:07.160
and we start to do pop-ups in my
restaurants to promote Adachi.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.840
And they sell out one after
another after another.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.030
And there was an
immediate synergy

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.640
and understanding as
soon as we got together,

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.910
and I'm so proud of him.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:20.000
Today there was this
beautiful review

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.215
that we got in one
of the local papers.

00:33:22.215 --> 00:33:23.590
And when we saw
each other today,

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.770
we just hugged each other.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.110
And we're so proud of
what they're doing.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:32.110
And he was working in all these
major cities, and he said, oh.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.434
And he's got this great accent.

00:33:33.434 --> 00:33:34.850
It's like a little
bit of Jamaica,

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.101
a little bit of New York
City, a little bit of London,

00:33:37.101 --> 00:33:39.558
and then something else that
I can't figure out what it is,

00:33:39.558 --> 00:33:40.580
but it's mixed together.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.780
And when I talk to him
on the phone sometimes,

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.920
he'll say, oh, chef--

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.587
and I can hear--

00:33:46.587 --> 00:33:49.128
even though we're on the phone,
I know he's shaking his head.

00:33:49.128 --> 00:33:50.930
I goes, I'm not in New
York anymore, am I?

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:51.888
I said, no, you're not.

00:33:51.888 --> 00:33:54.290
You have to treat-- and
every place is different.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.581
And everybody eats differently,
funny enough, you know?

00:33:56.581 --> 00:33:59.780
That's another thing that's
sort of worth talking about.

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.010
I can put the most popular
dish on, say, Alta Strada, one

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:07.100
of our Italian
restaurants, on every menu,

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.409
and it won't necessary
become the most popular dish

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:10.880
in other restaurants.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.380
And I find that
sort of fascinating.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.170
Like, what sells
in Washington, DC

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.500
may not sell in
Wellesley, Massachusetts,

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.937
and it may not sell in LA.

00:34:18.937 --> 00:34:20.520
But what sells in
LA won't necessarily

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.769
sell in the other places also.

00:34:21.769 --> 00:34:24.800
So that's sort of fascinating
to watch how people eat

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.109
and how they behave.

00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:28.400
Obviously, the people here
are the best behaved people.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.000
[LAUGH]

00:34:29.312 --> 00:34:30.770
JASON ANDREAS:
Couldn't agree more.

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:31.460
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yes.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.389
JASON ANDREAS: Well, thank you
for all of that information.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:35.530
And yes, the reviews have
been awesome on Adachi.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.280
Thank you, again, for
considering Detroit.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.820
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Except for--

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.389
can I ask you--

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:40.280
Google doesn't-- they
don't own Yelp, do they?

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:40.810
JASON ANDREAS: No, we don't.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:41.350
MICHAEL SCHLOW: OK, good.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:42.290
JASON ANDREAS: I was
going to get there, too.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.870
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Let's do--

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.040
let's talk about Yelp.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.269
Let's talk about Yelp.

00:34:45.269 --> 00:34:47.060
JASON ANDREAS: So you
gave a glowing review

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.580
of Google technology
helping you and your staff,

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.900
so thank you for that.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.699
I'll slip you the
$50 bucks I owe you.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:53.440
MICHAEL SCHLOW: I only need $5.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.020
It's fine.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:54.870
JASON ANDREAS: OK.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:55.760
Normally, I give $50.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.510
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Oh, $50's good.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.870
OK.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:57.786
JASON ANDREAS: No, $5.

00:34:57.786 --> 00:34:59.372
We've got it on film.

00:34:59.372 --> 00:35:00.330
But thank you for that.

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.274
And we obviously try
and make people's lives

00:35:02.274 --> 00:35:04.190
easier through some of
the technology we have.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:08.100
And technology in general is,
I guess, supposed to do that.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.660
But when we have chefs
and restaurateurs in,

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.510
we always get this conversation.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.600
How do you deal with the
positives of technology

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:24.620
with also some of the challenges
that reservation apps and food

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.540
delivery services now--
the folks aren't even

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.100
going out as much anymore,
because they're just

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.350
having food delivered to them.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:31.781
So what's the balance that
you find between the positives

00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:34.280
that you have with also some
of the challenges that you also

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.540
have to consider now
that maybe you didn't

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.650
have to consider 20 years ago?

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.030
MICHAEL SCHLOW: You didn't
have to consider those things.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.270
Right.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:40.061
I mean, takeout was
you called up and said,

00:35:40.061 --> 00:35:41.780
I'll have a quart of
hot and sour soup,

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.238
and you went and got it, and
that was the end of it, right?

00:35:44.238 --> 00:35:47.180
So all this is an
ever-changing world,

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.020
and we have a few people on our
team that specialize in this.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.430
And so they stay
current on this.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:56.810
There's a couple of things
that the end result user,

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.630
the guest probably
doesn't even know.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:03.560
Like, when you call, for
example, Uber Eats or Caviar,

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.322
the rev share on
that as an example

00:36:06.322 --> 00:36:08.030
is not a good model
for the restaurateur.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.850
We're already dealing
with really slim margins.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:14.026
And so when Uber Eats, for
example, or somebody like that,

00:36:14.026 --> 00:36:14.900
a company like that--

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.524
I don't mean to name
them specifically,

00:36:16.524 --> 00:36:17.860
but they're very popular--

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.029
A, I can't control the product.

00:36:20.029 --> 00:36:20.570
I don't know.

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:22.903
If you're the Uber driver and
you come and pick that up,

00:36:22.903 --> 00:36:25.440
I don't know how long
you are leaving that,

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.560
say, sushi in the
backseat of your car

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.250
before you bring it over to
the person that ordered it.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.710
So I can't control the
product once it leaves.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.860
But also, the rev
share is a percentage

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.547
that I don't really
understand the model.

00:36:39.547 --> 00:36:41.630
And when you think about
Uber as an example, which

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.340
I use all the time and
I love the product,

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.745
the product is I'm charged
based on how far I go, right?

00:36:47.745 --> 00:36:48.620
JASON ANDREAS: Right.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.820
MICHAEL SCHLOW: So
you get in the car

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.319
and you're going
this far, it's $10.

00:36:51.319 --> 00:36:52.440
You go that far, it's $20.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.590
And you go that much
further, it's $30, right?

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:58.124
But for Uber Eats, they charge
me based on how much you order.

00:36:58.124 --> 00:36:59.540
Not how far they
have to drive it.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.910
So if you're just
going across the street

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:06.560
and you order $200 worth of
food, I have to give them $60.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.600
30%.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.220
If you order $10 worth of food
and you're going 10 blocks,

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.706
I only have to give them $3.

00:37:15.706 --> 00:37:17.330
That part doesn't
make any sense to me.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:20.320
So if you're watching, Uber
Eats, let's work on that.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.640
We can work on that one.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.510
The systems, though,
of making sure

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:29.750
that you are technologically
easy for the--

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.370
is also very important.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.370
So making sure the
apps that we have,

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.180
the online ordering
apps are super

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.185
fast and super easy
and not too complicated

00:37:37.185 --> 00:37:38.770
I think is a big play.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:40.780
Because I know when I'm
doing it for-- you know,

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.670
if I'm going to order something
for my wife and kids online--

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.340
and I don't shop from clothes
online or things like that.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.650
My wife does, but I don't.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:51.520
I still go to a store and I want
to touch the pants or whatever

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.500
it is, and feel them and try
stuff on, because I'm too lazy.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.930
I don't want to send it
back if it doesn't fit.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:56.590
JASON ANDREAS:
It's too much work.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:57.190
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.390
Just don't take it out
of the store, you know?

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:00.490
And then you don't
have to bring it back.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.674
But for food, which
you can't return,

00:38:03.674 --> 00:38:05.840
I want to make sure that
it's super easy for people.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.941
And so that if they are
doing it-- but I mean,

00:38:08.941 --> 00:38:10.690
if they want delivery,
they want delivery.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:12.310
And you know, there's that ease.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.167
But part of the
beauty of a restaurant

00:38:14.167 --> 00:38:16.000
is that interaction,
that social interaction

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.291
that even if it's just with
the bartender or the waiter

00:38:18.291 --> 00:38:20.100
or somebody and
you're not eating

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.470
in your house, over your
computer, watching TV,

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.720
whatever-- there's times
for that, of course.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.720
But I also think that one of
the things that we provide

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.340
is that social interaction--

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:30.930
JASON ANDREAS: Experience.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:31.150
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:32.500
So it makes it so interesting.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:39.230
The part about reviews,
when I was a young cook

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:45.040
and when I started in the
business, and even as my career

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.730
sort of kept going, there
were certainly plenty

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:50.740
of times where I thought, OK.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.465
There's a food
critic, and you have

00:38:52.465 --> 00:38:53.840
to take care of
that food critic,

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.890
because that food critic
yielded incredible power.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.560
And so in "The New York
Times" if Ruth Reichl or--

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.370
I'm going way back.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:02.680
Bryan Miller, whoever
it might have been

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.510
wrote a good review,
that restaurant

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.167
was busy for years off
of that good review.

00:39:07.167 --> 00:39:09.750
And the reality is that you all
have the power of the pen now.

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:10.540
It's different.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.910
So you go on Yelp and
say, this place sucked.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.440
I'm never going back there.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.142
My food-- it didn't come
out for seven minutes.

00:39:17.142 --> 00:39:19.100
My first thing is I'm
thinking like, all right.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.730
Well, what could you make
at home in seven minutes

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.200
that you're getting
mad at me for?

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.924
But we have a
certain expectation

00:39:24.924 --> 00:39:26.590
when we go out to
dinner that the food's

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:28.756
going to be delivered in a
prompt, reasonable amount

00:39:28.756 --> 00:39:29.540
of time.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.420
And what I would
say to anybody who's

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.020
going to write a review
online is, did you

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.090
give the operator
the opportunity

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.855
to fix whatever the issues are?

00:39:38.855 --> 00:39:40.480
Now nobody ever came
over and said, hi.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.220
I want to come over
and check and see--

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.510
I hope you enjoyed your meal.

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:44.930
We've all done this before.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:47.630
I've done it for sure, and
that is, how's everything?

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:48.130
It's good.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:49.079
It's fine.

00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:49.870
Everything's great.

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:50.260
JASON ANDREAS: Thanks.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:50.620
MICHAEL SCHLOW: And yeah.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.677
And then you walk out.

00:39:51.677 --> 00:39:53.010
They're like, well, that sucked.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.384
I'm never going
back there again.

00:39:54.384 --> 00:39:56.320
Give the person a
chance to fix it.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.135
So some of my favorite
Yelp or Google reviews

00:40:00.135 --> 00:40:01.510
are the ones where
somebody said,

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.880
you know, we had an
issue with blank,

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.070
but the manager came over
or the chef came over,

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.900
and they fixed it.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.840
That's the opportunity to
really win over a guest

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.832
for a long period
of time is when

00:40:12.832 --> 00:40:15.040
you have those opportunities
presented to themselves.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.000
Did you act on it?

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.690
But everybody's a critic
now, and they always were.

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.975
They just have way more power.

00:40:21.975 --> 00:40:23.350
But when somebody
says, like, I'm

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:24.933
going to go online
and write a review,

00:40:24.933 --> 00:40:26.757
and I'm going to ruin
you, it's like, OK.

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:27.590
It's food, you know?

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.470
We're just trying--
it's a human business.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.317
There's going to
be error at times.

00:40:32.317 --> 00:40:33.650
We try to minimize those errors.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:35.380
But when there is
an error, we make

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.260
sure that we go above
and beyond, anything

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.239
that we could do
normally to make

00:40:39.239 --> 00:40:40.530
sure you had a good experience.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:42.960
And in reverse, when somebody
writes something glowing

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.460
and something really nice, we
make sure we reach out as well

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.150
and say, hey.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.900
Thank you so much.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.750
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.291
Please say hello
next time you're in.

00:40:49.291 --> 00:40:52.750
And again, it's about connection
more than anything else.

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.050
JASON ANDREAS: Reviews aside,
because there is some--

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:57.050
other than the participation
you just mentioned,

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:58.849
there is some lack
of control there,

00:40:58.849 --> 00:41:01.390
which is what they're meant to
be, I suppose, from the ground

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.060
up, when we go back to some
of the other technology

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.030
like the reservation systems,
like the food delivery,

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:09.670
we've talked to some chefs,
and I've read a few articles

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:12.336
where some newer restaurants are
actually shying away from that.

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:14.620
So they're not
participating in technology

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.100
from a reservation perspective.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.400
You have to actually pick up the
phone and call the restaurant.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.650
And they're not participating
in delivery because--

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.050
whether it's issues
with rev share or just

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:26.620
losing control of the food
between pickup and delivery

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.310
to the person who's ordered it.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:30.310
Have you ever thought
about something like that,

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:32.280
or is it too important
to the community

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.669
to stay involved in that?

00:41:33.669 --> 00:41:35.960
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Especially
with the reservation system,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:41.200
it is an ongoing conversation
and ongoing, like, battle,

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.870
basically.

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:45.677
You have one 800-pound
gorilla in OpenTable.

00:41:45.677 --> 00:41:46.510
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:47.980
MICHAEL SCHLOW: And
there's almost this threat

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.790
that you feel--

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:49.990
not by them.

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.547
As an operator, you
feel this pressure.

00:41:52.547 --> 00:41:54.130
I sort of have to
go with them, right?

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.380
Because if you're scrolling
and you're in a new city

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.280
and you're looking at OpenTable
for restaurants in my area

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.780
where I want Italian food and
you're scrolling and scrolling

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.700
and we're not on
OpenTable, does that

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.750
mean you're never
going to find us?

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:05.958
How are you going to find us?

00:42:05.958 --> 00:42:07.405
And so there's that fear.

00:42:07.405 --> 00:42:12.220
Well, OpenTable, which
is a great system--

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.430
it provides a service, for sure.

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:16.910
But there's a cost
to us as well.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:20.410
And it's not as simple as
just one size fits all.

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:23.080
If you make the
reservation on OpenTable

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.550
through my website, the
restaurant's website,

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.000
it costs $0.25 per guest.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.300
If you make it through
OpenTable, it's $1 per guest.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.360
So I'm not sure why, but it is.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.077
And so when you see
the checks that I

00:42:36.077 --> 00:42:37.660
write to OpenTable
every single month,

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.330
you start to scratch your head
and say, is this worth it?

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:42.107
Because it's a lot of money.

00:42:42.107 --> 00:42:44.440
But they provide a service,
and they provide information

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:44.940
to you.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.950
And so I could find
out, you know, oh, Jason

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.290
ate in this
restaurant 400 times.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.240
It's time we bought
Jason a meal, you know?

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.274
Or it's his birthday.

00:42:53.274 --> 00:42:54.940
They give you a lot
of good information,

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.370
so you're paying for that too.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:00.895
So there's a couple of
other systems out there

00:43:00.895 --> 00:43:02.500
that are interesting,
and they're

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.164
a little bit more
cost-effective,

00:43:05.164 --> 00:43:06.580
but they're not
as big, and so you

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.640
don't have some of the
bandwidth that OpenTable has.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.400
But it's an interesting
conversation,

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.770
and I'm not sure where
it will ultimately go.

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:18.740
For us right now, we have
OpenTable in our restaurants.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.860
Now a funny thing is
at Adachi, we don't.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.240
But Adachi's really small.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.710
It's 65 seats.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:29.274
And we leave half of the
restaurant for reservations

00:43:29.274 --> 00:43:30.190
and half for walk-ins.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.020
So going back to
community, I want

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.177
you to feel like you
can walk in at any time

00:43:34.177 --> 00:43:35.260
and hopefully get a table.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.610
Luckily, it's been really
busy, so the first people that

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.510
walk in get the table, and
then so everybody else has

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:40.385
to wait a little bit.

00:43:40.385 --> 00:43:42.240
But it seems like
it's a fair way

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.370
to do it that half the
restaurant's for reservation

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:45.240
and half is not.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.400
JASON ANDREAS: It's
finding a balance, right?

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.830
MICHAEL SCHLOW: I'm
trying to, you know?

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:49.204
And the end of
the day, listen, I

00:43:49.204 --> 00:43:52.140
have a financial,
fiduciary responsibility

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.210
to the investors,
to the business

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.070
itself to make sure
that we're making

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:57.537
as much money as possible.

00:43:57.537 --> 00:43:59.370
But you have a
responsibility to your guests

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.912
to provide a really enjoyable
experience and not just think--

00:44:01.912 --> 00:44:03.578
you don't want your
guests to ever think

00:44:03.578 --> 00:44:04.680
it's just about the money.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.013
Like, when you come and see
the fish that we have there,

00:44:07.013 --> 00:44:07.690
it's pristine.

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:08.895
It's perfect.

00:44:08.895 --> 00:44:11.520
It's as good a fish as
I could possibly get.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.042
And it's been one of the
overriding comments, which

00:44:14.042 --> 00:44:15.000
I'm really happy about.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.540
So if you like sushi and
sashimi, you come there,

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.360
and the first thing
I've heard over and over

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.840
and over again is, where
are you getting this from?

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.220
Because this is really
spectacular fish.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.520
So that makes us feel good
that the guest is recognizing

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.670
the quality of the product.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.690
And you know, over
a course of time,

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.250
if you can continue to do that,
you'll build up a loyal base.

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:36.930
JASON ANDREAS: Right.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:38.370
I want to go back to
something, because I'd

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.750
be remiss not to touch on this.

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:41.821
I let it go by earlier,
but I've been thinking

00:44:41.821 --> 00:44:42.820
about coming back to it.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.580
And I'm using
technology as a bridge,

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.890
because we talked about
technology just now.

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.860
You've done some YouTube videos,
some how-tos, things like that,

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:51.310
which are really fun.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:53.132
And you also have a
great website, truly.

00:44:53.132 --> 00:44:54.840
And I found some really
interesting stuff

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.673
on your website that
you touched on earlier.

00:44:56.673 --> 00:44:59.354
You talked about how much
you enjoy music and travel.

00:44:59.354 --> 00:45:01.020
You've got two sections
on your website.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.667
One is for travel
recommendations.

00:45:02.667 --> 00:45:04.000
So let's say you go to Portland.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.094
Here's a bunch of places
that you recommend.

00:45:06.094 --> 00:45:07.760
MICHAEL SCHLOW: I'm
doing a terrible job

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.676
of keeping up with it.

00:45:08.676 --> 00:45:10.930
To be honest with you,
I love what's on there.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:12.060
JASON ANDREAS: This
is the reminder.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:12.710
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Well,
I'm going to do it.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:13.500
JASON ANDREAS: Let's
get a Detroit one.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:13.920
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah, OK.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.280
For sure.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.696
I'll definitely
get a Detroit one.

00:45:15.696 --> 00:45:17.310
I suck at keeping up on it.

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:21.010
And we're redoing my website,
keeping the same ideas

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:22.219
but revamping the look of it.

00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:23.093
JASON ANDREAS: Great.

00:45:23.093 --> 00:45:25.480
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Because thank
you for your compliments,

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.510
but I think it needs to
look a little different,

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.010
and we haven't kept up with it.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:30.170
So music.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:31.170
Like, I have this thing.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:31.990
Music to cook with.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:34.654
Like, download this stuff,
and you turn the music on.

00:45:34.654 --> 00:45:36.320
JASON ANDREAS: That's
where I was going.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.455
That's my favorite section.

00:45:37.455 --> 00:45:40.165
I love to cook with my wife,
and we always throw music on

00:45:40.165 --> 00:45:41.040
while we're doing so.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.870
And I followed some of yours,
and they're quite good.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:43.620
They really are.

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:44.320
MICHAEL SCHLOW: I need
to update that too,

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.240
because there's a lot of music.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.400
I mean, some of it's older
music and some of it's newer.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.360
But one of the things--

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.270
I wrote a book years ago
called "It's About Time."

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:56.600
And the subtitle is
"Recipes for Everyday Life."

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.450
And what the book was
about was that I realized--

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.400
and we could talk
about technology

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.890
and fold this into
the conversation

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.630
is that I was doing some
research for the book.

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:09.960
I didn't want to write a book
that was about appetizer,

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.780
soups, salad, entrée, or
the seasons, or about me.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.940
I mean, I had to
put me in it, but it

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.379
wasn't going to be this
egotistical chef's tome

00:46:18.379 --> 00:46:20.170
that was going to sit
on your coffee table,

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:21.570
and nobody was ever
going to cook from it.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:23.486
I wanted something that
you were going to use.

00:46:23.486 --> 00:46:25.950
And so at the time
I wasn't married,

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:28.680
and I was watching my sister,
who has a bunch of kids.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.272
And she was literally running
a mini restaurant in her house.

00:46:31.272 --> 00:46:33.480
And she's like, Zachary,
what do you want for dinner?

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.646
Joshua, what are you having?

00:46:34.646 --> 00:46:35.760
I was like, what is this?

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.100
You know, what are you,
a short order cook?

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.308
I'm like, what are you doing?

00:46:38.308 --> 00:46:41.970
When we were kids, there was
one meal that everybody had,

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:43.080
and there was no ordering.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.910
The only ordering
was on your birthday,

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:46.800
and that's where you ordered
something that your brothers

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.841
and sisters didn't like
so that you could torture

00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:49.930
them a little bit, right?

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:53.570
And so I started to come
up with this notion of,

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:57.197
time is the most precious
commodity we have.

00:46:57.197 --> 00:46:58.780
Nobody has enough
of it, and we're all

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.160
trying to make more of it.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:05.230
And food, other than for
just basic sustenance,

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:06.280
is the center of our day.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.950
You know, things happen
around the table.

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:11.600
And whether it's the
morning coffee table,

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.060
it's the dinner table--

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:16.090
you know, for my family,
6:30, quarter to 7:00,

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:17.950
your ass was in that
seat, and you'd better

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:19.660
be ready, because
dinner's coming,

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.180
and everybody had to be in it.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.096
And there was no getting
up early or anything.

00:47:23.096 --> 00:47:25.930
That's where we learned
about how to behave

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:29.170
and how to talk about
politics just in general

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:31.120
was at my parents'
kitchen table.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.430
And we don't have that
anymore, you know?

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:35.830
It's sort of gone
from everyday life.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:37.630
It's a rare treat.

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.490
And so I thought,
why not write a book

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.320
that the chapters
be broken into,

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.820
what's happening to you today?

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.980
What do you need
today from food?

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.475
And so it's everything
from a chapter on speed,

00:47:47.475 --> 00:47:49.810
in getting food on the
table in 30 minutes or less,

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.060
to all the way
through where it's

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.820
time to celebrate and relax,
and turn off your phone

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.280
and turn off your computer
and turn on the music,

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.140
and open up a bottle
of wine and cook

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.980
for the basic tactile
pleasure, the smells.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.476
Everybody's got
that certain thing

00:48:04.476 --> 00:48:06.100
that takes you back
to either grandma's

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.330
house or your mother's house.

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:08.163
And you're like, ah.

00:48:08.163 --> 00:48:10.540
The smell of a roasted
lemon garlic chicken

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.800
makes me think of my
grandmother's house.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:17.170
And so when I was
doing this book,

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:19.900
I was looking up things that
I could find that maybe I

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:23.500
could throw into the book that
were different pieces that

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.857
were written a long time ago.

00:48:24.857 --> 00:48:26.440
And I didn't include
this in the book,

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.760
but I always talk about it.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.843
There was this article
that was from the late '50s

00:48:29.843 --> 00:48:30.700
or early '60s.

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.350
Sort of a Jules
Verne kind of thing

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:33.925
that's said, by the year 2000--

00:48:33.925 --> 00:48:34.920
[LAUGH]

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.350
--you know, by the year 2000,
automation and technology

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:41.410
will do everything for us, that
the average American will only

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:43.344
have to work 20 hours a week.

00:48:43.344 --> 00:48:45.760
And I thought, well, that would
have been great, you know?

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.660
It's quite the opposite.

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.640
JASON ANDREAS: We're
about 4x that right now.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:47.920
Yeah.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.461
MICHAEL SCHLOW: But
that is because I

00:48:49.461 --> 00:48:51.430
think the one part
about technology

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.287
is we continue to use it
to become more productive.

00:48:54.287 --> 00:48:55.870
And so we're never
turned off anymore.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:58.640
You know, when our parents
were off for the weekends,

00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.920
they were off, you know?

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.764
When my father
came home from work

00:49:02.764 --> 00:49:04.930
and the phone rang when we
were at the dinner table,

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.100
my father would
pick it up and say,

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.516
Michael's having
dinner right now.

00:49:07.516 --> 00:49:09.391
Call back at 7:30, and
hang up on my friends.

00:49:09.391 --> 00:49:10.932
Sometimes he didn't
even say goodbye.

00:49:10.932 --> 00:49:12.380
He'd just hang up on them.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.990
And that's just different.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:16.251
Like, the phone rings and
me or my wife or-- you

00:49:16.251 --> 00:49:17.500
know, we're always, oh, sorry.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:18.291
I'll be right back.

00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:19.210
I've got to take this.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:22.120
We don't really have to take
it, but we're like Pavlov's dog.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.190
The thing buzzes in our
pocket, and we like, ah,

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.690
I've got to answer it.

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:25.606
I've got to answer it.

00:49:25.606 --> 00:49:28.780
And I'm not sure why we
did that to ourselves.

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.684
And what we've done
is the technology

00:49:30.684 --> 00:49:32.350
is great, because we
are more productive

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:33.640
and we get more stuff done.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.380
But we're never
stopping, and it's

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.900
hard to turn your brain off now.

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:37.750
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:38.680
It's balance, right?

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.370
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Well, you
need it, and I don't have it.

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:41.110
I mean--

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:41.780
JASON ANDREAS: Most of us don't.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.050
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.550
[LAUGH]

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:43.390
I don't have it.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:45.730
But at the same token--
but I'm happy, you know?

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:49.515
I mean, I love the feeling
of getting stuff done.

00:49:49.515 --> 00:49:54.606
And all of the different things
that I use for keeping track--

00:49:54.606 --> 00:49:56.230
you know, when you
check something off,

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.729
there's a sense
of accomplishment.

00:49:57.729 --> 00:49:59.770
The list is long, but
every time you can say, oh,

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:00.940
I just got six things done--

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:01.550
you know, I'm in the car.

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:02.390
What am I doing?

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:03.070
I'm working.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:04.000
I'm in the car.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.840
I'm not relaxing.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.300
I'm not taking a nap, you know?

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.690
Getting stuff done.

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.250
JASON ANDREAS: I love your
idea from the cookbook

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.660
and also just kind
of in general,

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.750
the idea of food being
a staple of the day

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.930
and bringing things together,
bringing people together.

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.260
Food is huge at Google, right?

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.781
Everyone, the first
question I always

00:50:20.781 --> 00:50:22.530
get when people find
out I work at Google,

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:24.610
oh, you guys get free food?

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:25.930
We do, and it's amazing.

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.190
A shout out to our team.

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.970
One of the reasons that that
was done from very early on,

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:33.556
though, is as a part of the
day to bring people together.

00:50:33.556 --> 00:50:34.930
Especially in
today's day and age

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:36.730
where you're working
80 hours a week,

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:39.412
it's so easy just to bring a
sandwich, sit at your desk,

00:50:39.412 --> 00:50:40.120
and keep working.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.550
Whereas if you've got delicious
food just down the hall

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:46.055
and you can smell it wafting
through the hallways,

00:50:46.055 --> 00:50:48.430
it's much easier for me to
grab a couple of my teammates.

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:49.570
Say, hey, let's go
have a lunch meeting.

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:50.290
Let's sit there for an hour.

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:52.780
Let's actually just enjoy the
food and talk and catch up.

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.910
And some of Google's
best ideas have

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:57.252
come about over lunch
meetings that maybe you

00:50:57.252 --> 00:50:59.210
wouldn't have had if you
didn't have that food.

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:02.180
So it is a fantastic perk, and
we're very lucky to have it.

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:04.180
But there's also some
meaning behind it as well.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.650
MICHAEL SCHLOW: I
think that's great.

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:06.150
Yeah.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:08.129
I mean, I'm in
the food business,

00:51:08.129 --> 00:51:09.670
so I wish you came
to our restaurants

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:10.930
instead of staying here
for your lunch meetings.

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:11.440
[LAUGH]

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.280
I'm teasing you.

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.120
I think it's very
cool that Google--

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.970
JASON ANDREAS: You said
65 seats in Adachi?

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:18.437
We've got about-- roughly about
65 Googlers in this office.

00:51:18.437 --> 00:51:20.270
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Well,
what we should do is--

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:21.110
why don't we do one day?

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:23.455
Why don't I come here and
cook you all lunch one day?

00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:23.890
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:24.530
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Why
don't we do that?

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:25.170
JASON ANDREAS: You guys in?

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:25.450
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:26.141
[LAUGH]

00:51:26.141 --> 00:51:27.140
I would love to do that.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:27.809
That's easy.

00:51:27.809 --> 00:51:29.350
JASON ANDREAS: We
would never say no.

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:30.550
MICHAEL SCHLOW: No, I mean,
I did that-- it was funny.

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:32.190
You had mentioned Condé Nast.

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:35.260
But way back when, I used
to go once in a while,

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.750
and they had this chef for
the day kind of thing in Condé

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:38.250
Nast.

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.090
And I would go there and
cook something for them.

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:43.630
And that was hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:45.140
of people, so it
was kind of crazy.

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.550
But 65 people, we could
come and have some fun.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:48.050
Yeah.

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:48.910
That would be good.

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:49.910
I'd be happy to do that.

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:50.770
That would be fun.

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:51.640
JASON ANDREAS: We'll
take you up on that.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.530
MICHAEL SCHLOW: But
food, it's the connector.

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:57.620
And you know, I feel bad for
people that don't like food.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:00.200
You know, when people say,
like, yeah, it's not my thing,

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:00.700
you know?

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:01.200
I eat.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.490
I like to-- but again,
just to fill their belly.

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:04.490
Like, I'm into it.

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:05.980
Like, I dream about it.

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:06.860
I think about it.

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.400
When I'm planning my
travels, it's all about food.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.410
And my wife, my wife likes food.

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:12.800
My kids like food.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.590
But I mean, I'm obsessed.

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:16.946
So yeah, it's not probably
healthy to the point

00:52:16.946 --> 00:52:18.070
that I'm obsessed about it.

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:22.060
But I haven't been able
to keep up with it.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.800
You talk about
technology, but there's

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.400
been some changes in
traditional periodicals

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.070
that we've lost, unfortunately,
over the course of time because

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:31.360
of technology.

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.460
And so you no longer
in your restaurants

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:35.627
get-- like, there was a
magazine called "Food Arts."

00:52:35.627 --> 00:52:37.126
And when the "Food
Arts" would come,

00:52:37.126 --> 00:52:39.490
everybody would fight over
who got to read it first,

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.310
because it also kept you up
to date on who was moving,

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:44.680
who was changing, who was
going where, who was making

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.060
the latest and greatest things.

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:48.580
And I would play a game
with myself to say,

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:51.490
I am going to know where every
chef that's in "Food Arts"

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:52.510
is headed to.

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:56.934
I'm doing this thing in San
Diego in the next month,

00:52:56.934 --> 00:52:58.850
and it's the San Diego
Food and Wine Festival.

00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:01.167
And I'm part of this
week-long celebration

00:53:01.167 --> 00:53:02.000
of different things.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.580
So there were all
these names that

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:07.870
got sent to me as to who the
participating chefs were.

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:10.510
And I sent to my
assistant, I said,

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:12.130
I only know three
of these names.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.620
And that was upsetting
to me that I didn't

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.981
know who these people were.

00:53:16.981 --> 00:53:19.480
And so I said to my assistant,
here's what I want you to do.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.580
I want you to Google
every single one of them

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:24.080
and send me a little report.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:24.580
Not long.

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:26.650
Just a couple
sentences so I can look

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:28.990
at, know where they came
from, where they work,

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:31.240
and who they are so
that I don't look like,

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.760
A, that I'm ignorant when I
walk in there to say, oh, hi.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.760
Where are you from?

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.820
And instead, how
nice is it to be

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.520
able to be recognized
by a peer--

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.780
in this case, me--

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.830
that I know what you're doing.

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:44.170
I know what you're up to.

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:45.586
It always made me
feel good when I

00:53:45.586 --> 00:53:49.220
was a young cook, a young
chef to go to these events

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:51.810
and somebody said,
oh, Michael, yes.

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:53.410
You know, Cafe Louis, Boston.

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:54.452
I've just read about you.

00:53:54.452 --> 00:53:57.076
I've been dying to come try your
restaurant, or whatever it is.

00:53:57.076 --> 00:53:58.400
It makes you feel good.

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:03.070
The peer-to-peer thing is really
important in our industry.

00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:04.884
Not just being
recognized, because you

00:54:04.884 --> 00:54:06.050
don't have to be recognized.

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:07.841
But any man or woman
that is willing to put

00:54:07.841 --> 00:54:11.110
on the white jacket and cook and
sit over a hot stove, you know,

00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:13.900
80 hours a week, there's
a fraternity, a club,

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:17.080
whatever you want to call it
that you immediately belong to.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.499
And it's a lovely thing
to be able to go anywhere

00:54:19.499 --> 00:54:21.790
in the country or anywhere
in the world for that matter

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:22.874
and say, yeah, I'm a chef.

00:54:22.874 --> 00:54:24.498
They don't have to
know the restaurant.

00:54:24.498 --> 00:54:26.950
Immediately, a little
something extra comes out.

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:28.570
There's that
professional courtesy.

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:29.770
It's beautiful.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:31.690
I was in Italy last year.

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:33.620
I was in this little
tiny town, and there

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:36.230
was a woman running around
this restaurant by herself.

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:37.450
She didn't have any help.

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:40.780
And I speak enough Italian
that I was talking to her.

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:41.920
And she's running around.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.530
I had ordered a bottle
of wine with the people

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:44.530
that I was sitting with.

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:47.956
And I knew she was too busy to
even open the bottle of wine,

00:54:47.956 --> 00:54:49.080
because she was by herself.

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.560
And I said to her,
you know, here.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.280
I'll help you.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.070
Give me the bottle of wine.

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:52.800
I'll open it for myself.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.500
And she's like, no, no, no.

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.620
I was like, it's OK.

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.450
Go do your thing.

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:58.570
So when the night cleared
out and we were by ourselves,

00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:01.540
basically, me, my colleagues
that I was traveling with,

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.629
and the woman--

00:55:02.629 --> 00:55:04.420
so she says-- she didn't
speak any English.

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.878
And she's like,
where are you from?

00:55:05.878 --> 00:55:07.360
And I told her,
the United States,

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:08.879
and I'm in the
restaurant business.

00:55:08.879 --> 00:55:09.670
And she's like, oh.

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:10.840
That's why you opened
the wine for me.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.631
You know that I was in
the weeds, you know,

00:55:12.631 --> 00:55:13.960
which is the term.

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.970
And next thing I know, her
dad comes out of the kitchen,

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:18.284
this old man.

00:55:18.284 --> 00:55:20.200
And I said, oh, can we
go back in the kitchen?

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:20.699
I'm looking.

00:55:20.699 --> 00:55:22.630
I'm like, where-- and
the food was delicious.

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:24.144
I'm like, where's your cooks?

00:55:24.144 --> 00:55:25.060
Where's your-- oh, no.

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:26.320
It's just me and my daughter.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.200
And the two of them
ran this restaurant,

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.950
and they did 16 tables
every single night.

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:31.366
Now 16 tables, I
would never allow

00:55:31.366 --> 00:55:32.744
one server to have 16 tables.

00:55:32.744 --> 00:55:34.160
But they got away
with it somehow,

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.130
and the food was delicious,
and everybody loved it.

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:37.350
But that connection immediately.

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:37.870
Like, oh.

00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:39.286
You're in the
restaurant business?

00:55:39.286 --> 00:55:41.240
And that part's really great.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.010
I love that part.

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:44.740
JASON ANDREAS: You had
mentioned music and getting

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:48.512
to meet some of your idols as
to rock stars, things like that.

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:51.834
As a last question, I
guess, any rock star moments

00:55:51.834 --> 00:55:54.250
in doing some travel with some
of these folks, or anything

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.670
that you can share with us?

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.930
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:56.680
I mean, there's--

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.580
[LAUGH]

00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.910
I'd be gloating.

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:01.960
I don't want to make you--

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.210
well, it's weird, because
these people become friends.

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:05.293
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, sure.

00:56:05.293 --> 00:56:07.750
MICHAEL SCHLOW: So when you
say their names, you're like,

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:09.520
you're friends with them?

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.895
It's weird, because when
I see them on stage,

00:56:11.895 --> 00:56:14.020
they're my friends doing
what they do for a living,

00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:17.440
just like when I think they come
see me cook, I'm just cooking.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:21.520
So some of my highlights,
there's a lot of them,

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:25.090
but great moments would
be traveling through Italy

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.525
with REM.

00:56:26.525 --> 00:56:28.425
They're dear friends
of mine, so getting

00:56:28.425 --> 00:56:30.550
to see Michael Stipe and
Mike Mills and Peter Buck,

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:33.400
and traveling literally
from Venice all the way down

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.700
to Naples for a couple weeks
with them, that was cool.

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.200
When I lived in New
York-- and we're

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.425
still dear friends
with Billy Joel.

00:56:40.425 --> 00:56:41.800
And you know, you
get a shout out

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.540
when he says, like,
this is for Michael.

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.610
"Scenes From An
Italian Restaurant"

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.560
he sings, and you're
like, what just happened?

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.200
JASON ANDREAS: Is that me?

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:47.880
[LAUGH]

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:49.770
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Like,
Michael who, you know?

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:54.640
But I've gotten to meet
all of my rock heroes

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.990
and become friendly with them.

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:59.515
I'm friends with the guys
from U2 and The Stones.

00:56:59.515 --> 00:57:01.390
JASON ANDREAS: These
are not small rock bands

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:01.930
you're talking about.

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:02.320
MICHAEL SCHLOW: No, no, no.

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.180
They're big ones.

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:03.936
Yeah.

00:57:03.936 --> 00:57:04.750
They're big ones.

00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:06.190
And it's all through
food, though.

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:07.960
That's how we met,
was through food.

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.402
And they would joke
and say, listen.

00:57:10.402 --> 00:57:11.860
There were times
in our lives where

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.420
we would sing for our suppers.

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.274
And all the rockers
say the same thing.

00:57:15.274 --> 00:57:16.190
Sing for their supper.

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:17.290
It's just, I guess, a line.

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:18.570
JASON ANDREAS: Maybe
that's the connection.

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:20.140
Working at bars, you
sing for your drinks

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.150
and suppers back in the
day, and it was always

00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.600
a special part of it.

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.490
MICHAEL SCHLOW: I think so.

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:24.824
JASON ANDREAS: It's interesting.

00:57:24.824 --> 00:57:26.906
MICHAEL SCHLOW: So I've
gotten to meet all of them

00:57:26.906 --> 00:57:28.232
and become friends with them.

00:57:28.232 --> 00:57:30.190
And there's times where
we won't see each other

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:31.990
for a year or two,
but if they're either

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:34.420
blowing through town or I'm
somewhere where they might be,

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:35.390
I'll go see them.

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:39.830
And I often would bring food
backstage for after the show.

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:41.830
Or if they were staying
in a hotel or something,

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:43.315
we'd go cook at that hotel.

00:57:43.315 --> 00:57:44.815
JASON ANDREAS: Maybe
that's the key.

00:57:44.815 --> 00:57:47.092
If we put Chef
Schlow on the list,

00:57:47.092 --> 00:57:49.300
we'll give him free tickets,
he'll bring food for us.

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:50.780
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Basically,
that's what I was.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:51.790
JASON ANDREAS: Everyone wins.

00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:53.664
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Well,
there's one story where

00:57:53.664 --> 00:57:56.440
I was only, like,
24 or 25 years old,

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.380
and I was living
out in East Hampton,

00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:02.410
Long Island, which is
where Billy Joel lived.

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:04.900
And he called me up one day,
and he was out on the road.

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:08.020
And he would go
to this restaurant

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.820
that I was the chef
at three times a week.

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.380
Especially in the off season,
he'd go three times a week.

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.040
And he said, hey,
you know-- we had

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.570
become a little friendly at
that point, but not friends,

00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:18.070
friends.

00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:20.740
We just knew each other fairly
well, but nothing crazy.

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.320
And he calls up one
day, and I thought

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.920
he was home and wanted
something special.

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.384
So the kitchen phone rings,
and they said, hey, Michael.

00:58:28.384 --> 00:58:29.800
Billy Joel's on
the phone for you.

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.100
I'm like, sure he is, you know?

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:32.335
I was like, no, he's not.

00:58:32.335 --> 00:58:34.210
I'd answer the phone,
and his voice is on it.

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:34.930
He's like, hey, Michael.

00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:35.250
It's Billy Joel.

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:36.160
I'm like, oh my God.

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.160
It really is Billy Joel.

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.590
I was like, hey.

00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:39.460
Yes?

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.580
What can I do for you?

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:41.340
What's up?

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:44.410
And he said, well,
I'm wondering.

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:48.166
He goes, we're out on the road,
and to be honest with you,

00:58:48.166 --> 00:58:49.290
we don't get fed very well.

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:51.970
Like, so a big star
like that, you know,

00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:55.720
when you go backstage, he
would never eat before a show,

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:58.719
and they didn't have a lot of--
they had catering everything,

00:58:58.719 --> 00:59:00.010
but he didn't want to eat that.

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:03.274
And when you get done with the
show, especially when they were

00:59:03.274 --> 00:59:04.940
all earlier on in
their careers and they

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.510
would play longer encores
and things like that,

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.800
everything's closed.

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.110
So you're stuck with
room service in a hotel.

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:14.560
You get back to the
room at 11:30 at night.

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:17.995
So he said, do you have
a day off next week?

00:59:17.995 --> 00:59:20.980
And I said, yeah, I think I'm
off Tuesday and Wednesday.

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:21.490
Why?

00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:23.590
And here I'm, like,
muffled, going, hey, Max.

00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:25.810
Where are we next
Tuesday and Wednesday?

00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:29.740
And it was like, Albany or
Buffalo or something like that.

00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:32.150
It was Albany, in fact, the
first time I ever did this.

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:36.649
And he said, would you
consider coming to our show?

00:59:36.649 --> 00:59:38.440
You know, come see the
show and everything,

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:40.617
but we could cook
dinner afterwards.

00:59:40.617 --> 00:59:42.200
I was like, of course
I would do that.

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:43.408
That would be amazing, right?

00:59:43.408 --> 00:59:45.730
So I flew to Albany
with all, like, 300

00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:47.320
pounds of food or something.

00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.439
And I was a kid--

00:59:48.439 --> 00:59:49.480
as I said, I'm by myself.

00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.540
And this is before technology,
so I can't record it.

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:54.040
I don't have a cell
phone back then.

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.430
There's no cell phones.

00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:58.000
And I'm sitting up
on the riser where

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
the soundboard is and the
lighting board and everything.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.310
And I'm sitting up there,
minding my own business,

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:05.830
and the guys are like, would
you like a beer or something

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:06.110
to drink?

01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:07.120
I was like, yeah, sure.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:07.740
I'll go get a beer.

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:08.110
They're like, no, no.

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:08.860
We'll have it brought to you.

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:10.870
And I'm thinking I'm going to
get, like, a bad stadium beer,

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:11.440
you know?

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.010
And this metal tub comes down
with all these cold beers.

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:16.581
And I was like, this
is nice up here.

01:00:16.581 --> 01:00:17.080
Chh!

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.380
And I'd have a beer.

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.900
And he starts to play.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.910
And halfway through the
show, he literally--

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.868
I'll never forget this
for the rest of my life.

01:00:23.868 --> 01:00:25.660
He asked the audience,
did everybody

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.640
have a nice dinner tonight?

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.010
And they cheered
for whatever reason.

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.600
He said, oh.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.090
He said, well, I never
eat before a show.

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:35.920
And he's, like, just
playing on the keys

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.180
and he's fooling around.

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.530
And I have no idea
what he's going to do.

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:42.167
And he said, if you ever get
to Long Island-- he goes,

01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:43.000
that's where I live.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.310
He said, my friend
Michael's here today.

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:47.650
And I'm like-- and I
still don't think it's me.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:48.610
[LAUGH]

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:54.190
And he said, he is the chef at
my favorite restaurant called

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:55.690
Sapore di Mare.

01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:57.100
And we're going to have it all.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.900
And he starts to list all
the things that I brought.

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.200
He starts telling
people, we're going

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.050
to have spaghetti aglio,
olio con pomodoro.

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:02.980
We're going to
have broccoli rabe.

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:03.670
We're going to have
all this stuff.

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:06.460
And he starts to literally
list the menu that I brought.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.080
And he's like, I can't wait.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.610
So Michael, thanks for coming.

01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:12.920
And then he plays "Scenes
From An Italian Restaurant."

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.630
I'm like, there's nobody here
to validate this and verify

01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:18.006
that this actually happened.

01:01:18.006 --> 01:01:19.630
Nobody's going to
believe me, you know?

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:22.000
And then years
later, he would play,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.910
and I would always get a nice
little shout out or something.

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:26.090
Then I did have a cell
phone, and my cell phone

01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:26.923
would just be like--

01:01:26.923 --> 01:01:27.650
[BUZZING]

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:32.020
Did you just get a shout
out at Gillette Stadium?

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.915
So that to me--

01:01:33.915 --> 01:01:35.740
and you can hear it
in my voice hopefully

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:38.170
is that one of the
great pleasures

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:40.450
is getting to meet
my musical heroes,

01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:43.330
becoming friendly with them,
and getting to feed them.

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:46.400
And there's something amazing
about that, because I'm

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.630
in awe of musicians.

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:52.720
I don't play an instrument,
but I love music so much.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.320
And I'm constantly listening
to music, surrounded by it,

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.710
thinking about how it
interacts with your experience

01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:00.640
in the restaurants.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.280
I think the restaurants
are absolutely

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.344
a five-sense experience.

01:02:05.344 --> 01:02:06.760
It's not just what
you eat, but it

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.320
is what you see,
what you hear, what

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.540
you smell, what you put your
hands on, everything like that.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.457
And so for me to be able
to meet them and then

01:02:13.457 --> 01:02:15.540
play some of their music
once in a while when it's

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.275
appropriate in our
different restaurants,

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:20.301
there's a pride there that's
sort of difficult to explain

01:02:20.301 --> 01:02:20.800
sometimes.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.590
But that is a very,
very cool part

01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:24.799
of what I've been able to do.

01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:27.173
JASON ANDREAS: Well, they say
music is a great connector.

01:02:27.173 --> 01:02:28.440
Food is a great connector.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.220
I feel like they go
hand-in-hand very well together.

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:31.261
MICHAEL SCHLOW: I do too.

01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:32.890
You know, I have
a friend of mine

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:36.280
who-- we were talking
about different rock stars.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.900
But a guy named
Peter Wolf, who is

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.580
the lead singer of The J. Geils
Band, is a dear friend of mine.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:41.950
And he lives in Boston.

01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:46.840
And he's also sort
of mixed media.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.700
He's a painter also.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:49.540
He's a poet.

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:50.980
He does all sorts of things.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.780
Really interesting guy.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.720
And he's one of those people
that really understands

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.844
about food and people and
connecting them, and trying

01:02:58.844 --> 01:03:00.010
to do it also through music.

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:02.080
But also just relationships.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.010
You know, listen.

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:07.180
Every business-- doesn't matter
if it's Google, restaurants,

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.549
the music business--
every business has

01:03:09.549 --> 01:03:11.590
really wonderful people
in it, and every business

01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:12.881
has some assholes in it, right?

01:03:12.881 --> 01:03:15.585
So the trick is to
weed out the assholes

01:03:15.585 --> 01:03:17.710
and make sure you're dealing
with the best people--

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:18.250
JASON ANDREAS: Words to live by.

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:18.760
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.725
Weed out the-- if there's one
thing I'm going to leave you

01:03:20.725 --> 01:03:21.910
with, weed out the assholes.

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:23.130
JASON ANDREAS: We can
title the talk that.

01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:23.210
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Yeah.

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.922
[LAUGH]

01:03:23.922 --> 01:03:24.880
JASON ANDREAS: Perfect.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.750
Well, Chef, thank you
so much for coming.

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:28.854
I can talk about this
forever, literally.

01:03:28.854 --> 01:03:30.520
Maybe we can share
some time afterwards.

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.167
Or there's no question.

01:03:33.167 --> 01:03:34.750
We will take you up
on the opportunity

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:35.690
to have you come and join us.

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:36.960
MICHAEL SCHLOW: And if
anybody has questions,

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.690
I don't have to be
anywhere for a few minutes.

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:39.190
JASON ANDREAS: Absolutely.

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.430
Great.

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:40.610
Well, thank you so
much for coming in.

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:41.390
We really appreciate it.

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.600
Thank you.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:41.850
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Thank you.

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:42.520
JASON ANDREAS:
Thank you so much.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:42.910
MICHAEL SCHLOW: Real pleasure.

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:43.410
Thanks.

01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:44.760
JASON ANDREAS: Thank you.
