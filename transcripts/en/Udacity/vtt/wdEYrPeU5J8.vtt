00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In order for our grandfather clock to keep the same time on the moon than it does on the earth,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we needs its period to be the same on both the earth and the moon

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so that I can plug in the equation for the period of a pendulum for both the earth and the moon.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And fortunately lots of things cancel like the 2Ï€ here and I'm going to square both sides,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and doing that I get this nice ratio here and do a little more algebra,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I get that the length of the pendulum on the moon

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
should be equal to the length of the pendulum on the earth times the ratio

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of the values of g on both the moon and the earth.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And plugging in our known values for g on the moon and g on the earth,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I get that the length of the pendulum on the moon should be equal to

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
1.6 times the length of the pendulum on the earth--great work!
