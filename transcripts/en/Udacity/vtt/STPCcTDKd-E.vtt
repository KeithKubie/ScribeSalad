The studio is 14 feet by 14 feet.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.338
So, the area of the room equals 14
by 14, which equals 196 square feet.

00:00:13.338 --> 00:00:16.930
Carpet is $2.25 per square foot.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:24.640
So the total cost of the carpet
is 196 x 2.25 which equals 441.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.580
441 is less than 475, so
she's within her budget.
