00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:05.686
&gt;&gt;Cantor: There are certain foundational
skills like executive function,

00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:10.066
self-regulation, that are
pre-requisites for the formation

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:14.226
of more complex skills, like
perseverance and self-direction.

00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:18.026
A child can become a
productive and engaged learner

00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:21.536
from any developmental
starting point as long

00:00:21.536 --> 00:00:23.976
as we intentionally build those skills.

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:35.226
&gt;&gt;Catherine: Any volunteers? Go up and
do a priority list? Abdi, thank you.

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:39.566
&gt;&gt;Cantor: The most active research
right now is actually about adolescence.

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:43.706
There are skills that develop
uniquely in adolescence

00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:47.016
that can't develop in earlier periods.

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:51.956
An example of one of those is executive
function skills, which enable us

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:54.456
to organize and prioritize.

00:00:54.456 --> 00:00:59.316
By asking students to prioritize
their tasks the teacher builds

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.226
that skillset in an entire classroom.

00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:03.756
&gt;&gt;Catherine: In eighth
grade there's a ton

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:06.346
of different deadlines
and work to manage.

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:09.716
So, we do the ABC priority list in order

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:12.976
to help them manage all
those different deadlines.

00:01:15.386 --> 00:01:17.286
&gt;&gt;Abdirahman: Somebody always goes
up to start our priority list.

00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:20.506
It helps us categorize everything
that we have and organize

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:22.916
from most important to least important.

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:24.566
&gt;&gt;Student: We have the West Virginia

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:28.766
versus Barnette case
questions for social studies.

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:30.576
&gt;&gt;Catherine: When is that due?

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:31.536
&gt;&gt;Student: Today.

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:32.866
&gt;&gt;Catherine: So, it's a high priority.

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:36.566
&gt;&gt;Student: We have a practice clot [ph?]
that we need to do for science class.

00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:37.946
&gt;&gt;Abdirahman: They tell
me each assignment

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:40.996
and when it's due or
how important it is.

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:43.796
&gt;&gt;Student: We have the JIAS
observation for science.

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:45.146
&gt;&gt;Catherine: Oh, wow. Jeez.

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:48.186
&gt;&gt;They share out all the different
deadlines that are roaming

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:51.196
around in their head and
then they know how to go

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:54.716
through the protocol of prioritizing.

00:01:55.336 --> 00:01:59.816
&gt;&gt;Catherine: Can you help Abdi
to figure out what the A1 is?

00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:00.976
&gt;&gt;Student: JIAS observation?

00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:04.716
&gt;&gt;Catherine: I think so, because it's
overdue, right? So, if it's overdue,

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:05.746
you've got to get that done first.

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:08.546
And then what would be in A2?

00:02:08.546 --> 00:02:11.586
&gt;&gt;Student: The West Virginia
versus Barnette questions.

00:02:12.636 --> 00:02:14.966
&gt;&gt;Cantor: It wasn't a
teacher saying, "You should."

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:19.826
It was a student saying,
"Here's what I think are the ways

00:02:19.826 --> 00:02:22.506
in which these activities
should be prioritized."

00:02:22.946 --> 00:02:26.196
So, in effect what this
teacher was doing was modeling

00:02:26.236 --> 00:02:28.566
and teaching executive function skills.

00:02:29.146 --> 00:02:32.966
&gt;&gt;Arius: If you're kind of overwhelmed
by your work, then you can kind

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:39.126
of like know what to do first and
then just kind like categorize it

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:42.006
and get it done efficiently.

00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:43.906
&gt;&gt;Catherine: Okay, so, which one

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:45.916
of those things is probably
going to be your frog?

00:02:48.706 --> 00:02:52.216
&gt;&gt;Catherine: Mark Twain said if you
wake up every morning and eat a frog,

00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:53.626
everything else will taste great.

00:02:54.426 --> 00:02:57.806
So, I taught them to take
their frog from the list,

00:02:58.176 --> 00:03:01.276
which is the thing they want to do
the least, and get it out of the way,

00:03:01.736 --> 00:03:03.406
because everything else will seem easy.

00:03:03.556 --> 00:03:05.516
&gt;&gt;Abdirahman: Our frog is like
the most important assignment,

00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:06.956
like the one I'm really worried about.

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:09.336
&gt;&gt;Catherine: Dry ice. So, okay, you've
got to do that. What's your frog?

00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:13.516
&gt;&gt;Abdirahman: It helps me realize I
need to get this done faster than I need

00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:16.616
to get this done, so even though
this is more fun I need to get this

00:03:16.616 --> 00:03:17.716
out of the way before I can do this.

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:20.176
&gt;&gt;Catherine: So, as soon as we're
done with that priority list,

00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:22.166
I notice everyone gets right to work,

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:25.046
because they have it spelled
out very clearly for them.

00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:30.406
&gt;&gt;Cantor: This is the building of
executive function skills in kids.
