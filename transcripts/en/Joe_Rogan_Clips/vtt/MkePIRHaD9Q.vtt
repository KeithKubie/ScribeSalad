00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.180
Do you remember like when you first started out there was like a way you thought

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:05.110
you had to be?
Yeah.
You know,

3
00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:09.210
when did you do anything like cringy that you look back on now and you go,

4
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:12.140
what was I doing back then?
I made,

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.100
I used to come out like I used to dance a lot.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.750
I was the Hickory dance machine,
hickory dance machine.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.560
I would come out dancing really across line.
Okay.

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.490
All I interviewed here,
what kind of music?
Whatever was popular,
you know,

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.710
something from jock jams volume to,

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.000
you know,
snap.
I got the power.
Oh,
I got the,
again,

11
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
it's getting kind of hectic.
So I'd come out dancing,

12
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.650
I made up the stupid little a,
I'd do a shovel dance or rake dance,
a mob dance,

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.900
and then I would stop and do to comedy and then I would get bored with myself

14
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.110
and then I dance to get in the middle.
This is what I was featuring.

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.720
And then that would dance again at the end.
Hickory dance machine.

16
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:00.870
My favorite one though,
this was,
I'm actually proud of this dance.

17
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.520
It was any guy washing women's laundry in the 18 hundreds dance.

18
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.840
It's a very specific,
a guy won't look at you.
Oh,

19
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:14.020
turn it off.
So he smells it.
Oh,

20
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.010
that's before the beard.
Look at those chins.
Look at that baby phase.

21
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.190
How long were you back then?
Oh,
this was a week ago,
I think now.
Cute cancer.

22
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.040
This is like pretty much sure.
Russia,

23
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.290
that's the theater in,
uh,
right outside of Hickory.
Placed it in a little nowhere.

24
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.300
I was like 700 people.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Out of shape right there.
