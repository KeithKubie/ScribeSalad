00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.989
It’s dangerously easy to forget to take
medication on time, but what if your pills

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:11.769
reminded you to take them? The future is now!

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.280
Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.240
Ingestible technology is exactly what is sounds
like: tiny sensors embedded in pills made

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.260
of metals that are safe to ingest, like copper
or magnesium. The coating dissolves in stomach

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.220
acid, which activates the metal sensor, starting
it’s tracking of your vitals like temperature

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.390
and heart rate. It sends that information
outside your body via an adhesive patch worn

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.820
on your skin straight to your smartphone using
bluetooth. And because it’s in your digestive

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.090
tract, you pass it just like you would anything
else.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.160
There are a few of these devices under development
right now, but the closest to launching is

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.130
a digital pill from Proteus Digital Health.
Sanctioned by the FDA in 2012, the company’s

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.720
Ingestible Sensor marks the time of ingestion
then monitors how many steps you take, rest

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.670
periods, and heart rate, and sends all that
data to your smartphone. Another device called

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.200
Proteus Discover takes it even further. These
sensors are packed inside each pill of a prescription,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.900
logging the time you take each dose along
with how it’s working inside your body.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.560
These devices can monitor medication intake
and check for dangerous mixes, potentially

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.170
preventing complications that stem from mixing
certain drugs. And these ingestible devices

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.630
are actually in use today.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.140
Both these Proteus products focus on patient
monitoring with an emphasis on chronic patients,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.590
because some people don’t always tell their
doctors the truth about their habits. Patients

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.729
may neglect to mention other drugs they’re
on, or lie and say they’re taking their

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.200
medication when really they’ve left the
bottle unopened on a night stand. These situations

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.369
all bring danger of complications leading
to more serious -- and more expensive — illnesses.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.689
And these medication-based problems don’t
just affect the individuals, they affect the

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.630
whole country. The economic cost of medication-based
problems, including costs to nursing homes,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.450
hospitals, and ambulance care, total nearly
$85 billion annually.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.490
But digital pills aren’t just about monitoring
patients. Some ingestible devices are also

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.520
used for screening and preventative medicine.
PillCam COLON is a miniaturized camera embedded

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.170
in a disposable capsule to non-invasively
check colon health. It’s the size of a vitamin,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.310
you swallow the pill and as it passes through
your digestive system doctors get an up close

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.540
up look at the colon, checking for polyps
or other early signs of colorectal cancer

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.790
without having to do an invasive exam involving
sedation or radiation. And it's an FDA-approved

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.959
screening method for patients who for whatever
reason can’t submit to a regular colonoscopy.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.510
Even though these micro sensors pass through
your body harmlessly, the technology does

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.819
raise some interesting ethical questions.
This comes with the territory when you have

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.090
a sensor or camera inside your body transmitting
images and information. But those are questions

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.400
that will be raised as the technology becomes
more widespread.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:49.489
If swallowing a camera pill sounds daunting,
we’ve got the answer on how to properly

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.370
swallow pills right here.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.319
So what do you guys think: would you be ok
with your medication monitoring you?
