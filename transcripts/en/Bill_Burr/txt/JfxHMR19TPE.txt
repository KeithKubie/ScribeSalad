Speaker 2:          00:01:41       Every person I've ever seen jogging down the street, like not everyone, but most of them, they look like they should acquit.

All right. And I just see, here you go. Alright, here you go. Leave me alone and then I'm gonna, I gotta like eloquently come off the wagon. I'm still on the wagon. I got 15 weeks in. All right. I'm already a third of the year in 26 weeks is half a year, but that takes me into February and I'm going to the rose bowl so that, that's the next tough one. That's the next hurdle I have to get past is if I could somehow go to the rose bowl and not get all fucked up, which I've done before. I've done it. I've done, I think I've done a couple of times. I've done the Rosebowl sober.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       Um, I don't know what, but, uh, I'm actually, I was thinking the other night, like when I come back to drinking, all right? When we rekindle our relationship, you know, like you have a c, there was a particular person out here in Hollywood, had an abusive relationship. Skye was beating the shit out of her and stuff, and then she went back to him, you know, being like, no, we fixed it this time. And I remember the talk show hosts were like going like, are you sure you know what you're doing? This is me going back to Boosie. Um, with my little barbed wire tattoo, um, I think I'm just going to go straight to heroin. Like I for some reason feel like I can handle it at my age, you know, cause I know how stupid it is to do. I would just do it like one time and just be sitting there like right in the living room to just don't, don't have the shame that most junkies have.

Speaker 2:          00:05:22       You just sit down with your family. You just say, listen, this is something that I want to try. I'm just gonna do it once and I would appreciate it if you guys would hang out during my entire high and make sure that I don't tip over and bust my head open on the coffee table with, even though we have the kid proof things around it, it'd be actually a lot of that kid proof shit becomes junky proof after a while. You know, I'm, I'm kidding and I'm not making light of the nationwide heroin epidemic, but we all know that the nationwide heroin epidemic is not the biggest story in the country right now. That's not the biggest story. It's not that they've poisoned our food supply fellow Americans. It's not that. It's not that after all the protests, they're still gonna put that fucking pipeline and it's not that. What is the biggest story? Huh? Matt Lauer buying a fucking Dildo for the stand in weather person. It's not that

Speaker 2:          00:06:22       having a president who's out of his fuck. Nate's not debt. The biggest story in the United States of America right now is Eli Manning is being sat on Sunday and it's 210 game streak is coming to a close and all of New York shot down. They couldn't believe that Alicia Manning, I didn't know his name was Alicia. I have never seen such a fucking ridiculous reaction while ignoring real fucking problems. There's like 30,000 fucking tornado or whatever the fuck we had. Hurricanes, Eh, fuck all that. Miami is giving you on the water like Dilla. The fucking texts that I got from New York sports fans, my friends, like the level that they were having a fucking meltdown, you know, fuck the rope. A dope that's going on in the Middle East right now where you got a fucking band, a fucking 3,500 nitwits bankrupting a billion dollar company is they got a bag of rocks that were flying. F eighteens, Adam blowing all our cash. Fuck all of that. Eli Manning is being sat on Sunday.

Speaker 2:          00:07:32       I got a buddy of mine. He flipped out so bad. He's actually betting against the giants. It's like, dude, if Gino sucks, which I don't think he's going to, no one knows how good Geno Smith is. He played on the jets. No one knows how good anybody is when they play for the jets. The jets, sorry, everybody out in Queens. But you know there's an element of truth to that. Okay. The patriots used to be like that. All right, so there is hope for you guys. God knows bill Belicheck is 70 years old and we all saw Tom Brady try to recover that bad snap last week. Right. You saw when he was running after that thing, he looked his age. He looked like a guy who forgot to set his parking brake and was still hobbling after his fucking car and then realize like, I'm not going to break my leg.

Speaker 2:          00:08:14       I don't fuck it. I got insurance on this car and it just flopped on the ground. Um, deaf geno Smith shits the bed. Eli's going to be back in the second quarter. All right. And by the way, this happens to every quarterback. No matter how good they were, no matter how good of a class act they were, this happens to everyone to fuck happened to Peyton manning after all those years of standing there with at least 19 inches of his 42 inch neck exposed between his helmet in his shoulder pads, it finally fucking gave out. And what did that fucking Guy Jim or say,

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       ah,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       the fucking national enquirer of fucking sports owners. He turned his fucking back on him. Okay. It Peyton manning, he went to fucking eastern Europe. He went to Transylvania, right? And he got fucking child's blood pumped into his fucking do whatever the hell it virgin blood pump did do his fucking neck. And he comes back to Jim Rsa and says, [inaudible] right, whatever that whatever the fuck he talks,

Speaker 2:          00:09:23       why don't you put me in this week? Whatever the fuck he said to them, you know, probably make more money doing that. And I had a board larger. Right? What did Jim or say say he said Peyton, with all due respect, fuck you and your fucking three feet and neck. We'll move on on bore tank in the rest of this season so we can get Andrew Luck. That's what the fuck happened. Look what happened at Brett [inaudible]. Right? Be fucker. He actually had to go to the jets. Eli Manning, all these guys with his quiver and bottom lip. All he's gotta do is sit on the fucking bench for a couple of place. That's it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:02       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       It's all you got to do. Everybody losing their fucking minds. How could they do this? How could they do the exact same fucking thing that they don't? Everybody. You remember the end of Derek Jeter, his career when all those sports writers will fucking bitch and a bottom. Sandy's a, he's costing the team. He's too fucking old. Should they move him over to first base? This happens to everybody. You know. You don't think that talking about me right now?

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       The way I'm fucking look in these days. I have like three friends of mine that are are, I love the, the, the biggest New York fans ever. And I, I got like fucking phone book level texts about what was going, you think it's going to end pretty with Tom Brady? This guy wants to play to least like 60. It's some 0.0 fucking Bob Kraft is going to have to sit down and be like top, it's you're too old. I mean, look at yet you still have a Beatle mania haircut. What fucking year did you come in the league?

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:06       You got a fucking Moe Howard haircut with the fucking part. I mean, I don't even know what to tell fucking Bill Clinton was still president when you came in.

Speaker 1:          00:11:17       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       MMM. I don't know what to tell you. Uh, this happens to everybody. Yeah. It's obviously a shame. Eli's fucking great. Uh, I got to tell you, it's sucks is a patriots fan watching the giants just fucking dismantle. And I wanted one more crack at them. We had nothing to lose. You already kicked our ass fucking twice. We'll come back like tex Cobb for a third one. And I was loving and there would always be an asterick even if the giants made the Superbowl. And even if with the Patriots made the Superbowl this year, if came back without Tom Kauflin and we won that one, that still would be at, that still wouldn't be the same. They went. That's the level of respect that I have for fucking the giants organization, Tom Kauffman and Eli, Alicia Manic. I'm just breaking your balls. New York fans. I know. It sucks. You know what? It really is all you guys flipping out and you're acting like you love Eli Manning, but you really are, is you're a bunch of selfish cons because watching Eli gets benched, it's just reminding you of how fucking old you're getting. And now we're all gonna die. It reminds you of your own mortality. So rather than deal with that, you call in sports shows losing your fucking voice,

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       you know? And meanwhile we're fucking blown $1 billion a month fighting people who have slingshots and a bag of dynamite. Um, anyway, um, I swear to God, if I was running, this is how I would handle isis. I would just fucking take, I would, I would, whatever those fucking gamers are that actually got to play on the giant TV screen in Dallas Cowboys Stadium. If you're good enough to do those guys with those drone races in, in that stadium, like that would be my defense against Isis, some intelligence and that I have those fuckers sitting in cowboys stadium where the cowboys didn't have a game and I just have them flying around, you know, blowing up at jungle Jim's. I mean, that's how I would handle it. Okay. And considering I haven't even physical fiscally researched this on any level. I haven't talked to anybody who is even remotely informed about what's going on over there. The fact that I did this in my own self contained think tank, I cannot even begin to describe to you how much this makes sense to me. You know, come on dude, you got, you don't sit by yourself sometimes and just start solving all the world's problems. You start walking around your house whispering, pretending you're getting interviewed by Oprah. Come on. We all do this though. We,

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:48       Oprah sitting across from you, do you consider yourself a hero? Um, is you sit there and muttering to yourself and then somehow you come into your fucking present, need you to sit in this scrubbing like a fucking old rice checkoff a bowl, and you have that split second of just really stepping outside of yourself. It'd be like, well, I'm really, I'm a fucking crazy person.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:10       And then all of a sudden the front door opens and your family walks in and you go right back into character and they have no idea. Could you stand in there with this phony smile and awareness sweater? I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:14:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:22       Anyways, a happy trails. Matt Lauer, you know, you did a hell of a job waking everybody up, uh, for the last 20 years. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:33       Yeah, you got a little sideways. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:14:42       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       How do you buy a sex toy for somebody you work with and then write a letter? I mean, Jesus for when it's just walk around with a fucking neon sign around your goddamn neck. I swear to God, did people get this successful? And they just like want access avatars their own fucking career. Although maybe he's just like old school. He came in, he came in the league when that he was, I don't know when you could do that because you've got to think when he first started buying like fucking shit like that. If it was the late nineties when you think about the cell phone technology, texting didn't even exist. There was none of that shit. There was no Facebook, there was nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:15:21       I mean, what could, that won't pull a woman. Do Rick run off a bunch of copies, put them on telephone poles? It just, you know, and then you just have an assistant run out and tear them down. Matt Lauer screaming from the window. I said, turned out right?

Speaker 1:          00:15:38       Um, I dunno. I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          00:37:10       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:37:11       the best part is he goes to cover his face and then he makes it look like he's rubbing his hands together. He's thinking maybe this will fly after all, so I got to cover up. I just fucked up the whole time he's got his chest, his pecs, doing that, moving up and down. This one's good because it's taken, like when they do smack down, they'd tape it to rebroadcast and they edited sometimes. Yeah, but if you have a satellite dish, you can pick up the satellite feed and watch it live. So they got the satellite feed of Hong Kong and just completely like fucking starting over, but okay.

Speaker 8:          00:43:23       Yeah, right. Great. I'm going to carry the cards for awhile, but I do and I view all right,

Speaker 7:          00:43:30       a little too visual because [inaudible] this, someone's been a, this is, this sounds really good, but there's a couple of things coming in. A botch mania on youtube and shock master. Yeah, shock master. You've seen it before. I think shock master roster mania is very visual, but a, okay, 10 labs in my life, I'm shocked. Master's up their shop. It might be in the top five. Shock Master. This is my favorite one. It's Cyco city. He doesn't realize he's live. Okay. All y'all fans, but there are a lot of skeptics that think that perhaps you can't take it. How do you address those skeptics? All the skeptics and all the people that have a little bill five house. Sorry, live pal or answer tonight. Well, they're here to man or keyword. Psycho said back to you.

Speaker 7:          00:44:25       You're live is as, let me do that again. Yeah. We covered. Phoned our man of few words. You start words. This is a the shock master. What does it look, man? What's the set up on that? Basically they were the first version of it. Oh Rick flair. They were supposed to, uh, they had a mystery partner and you were supposed to be like the next big, a good guy in WCW. Yeah. And he was supposed to bust through the wall but nobody told him there was a support to buy for under like at the base of the wall. Yeah. So he trips right over the two by four falls flat on his face. Got Ahead staying the entire thing is the funniest thing you've ever seen. It's staying in the British bulldog or horrendous. They were supposed to big this big pump up the shot master.

Speaker 7:          00:45:19       But when he fought, I'm Tom when ric flair, cause he's one of the greatest of all time at this surrounded by five bombs. Awful. And his reaction to what happened, I watched this 700 times in the Shag cry every time. Shock Master. He was just an old wrestler from the date of UAE, from, he was tugboat and Dadada I remember you said they put a storm trooper helmet, literally a storm trooper helmet. Did they covered in glitter? All sparkles and always make sure you have the, the, the, the sting lead in Iowa Soda. You know, this was actually so bad. Did this guy had a whole gimmick. He was going to be the next main event guy. They changed his entire gimmicks so that he was just a Klutz that always lost. They couldn't do anything with it after that because of his debut. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:46:12       Our partner is going to be none other than, hey miss, please tell me what happened. All ready. I'll like go on the wall and then he lost his helmet and how to go get it and put it back on his head. He covers his own face, so it's like, that's his gimmick. The way is there. The waffle, like a pot of glittered potted plants on top was fucking head. Do you think other wrestlers laughed at him for this? Gone voice was done. His voice was done by a guy who

Speaker 7:          00:47:11       the said who had a live Mike all, they didn't tape it. He did it live. So when he trips you can hear them go, Oh God no. That was ric flair. He goes, let me tell you something. If

Speaker 10:         00:47:31       you watched the whole thing would at home, you gotta understand the Harlem Harlem, he who would just fuck. He was doing a promo. Vicious, vicious was going to band from it. Now we just watched too bad promos. British bulldog and staying. We'll awful and ric flair had, this was like the Rick flesh show so he was trying to put this together and Rick Flash turn them. But, but when, when he fell through the wall, ric Flair, when, Oh God, that fall, the greatest thing that has forever and slow shit. How bad the promo with up to that point panicked grabbing for that helmet. This is in front of an audience, Yo Yo this a live audience and it's live on TV. It's like this is their big thing leading up to a paper view. Live television by the paper view. So you could see this guy make you think that was supposed to be his debut. He fits this perfectly clear. They're expecting big things from the shock man. But you have state maybe the next hole, Stengel for a shock, right it completely chin. Yet. For the most part it ended. Just get to stay on. If you have it wrestles, he wrestled.

Speaker 10:         00:48:57       Click the audio is a little low on this. This is the best. Yeah. Bare with us around it a little further. She could get some more lead up admissions. Bad Promo. Yeah. No, they're all nervous cause flares there where it's just like disgusting. Oh my God. Is he yelling? That's the brace boob. I'm talking about. The worst outfit I've ever seen you have is listed. It looks like he's wearing a pumpkin on his head. Fuck. You have to understand what? Oh he said what? Tough. Oh my God is held up shaking his head. He's gotta put his helmet on because the other guy's going to do his promo forum so you can see his mouth shot.

Speaker 10:         00:50:49       It's in the top left just because it's like, it's not even a regular rest. If statements, the shock master Paul is supposed to break through. I watched, I watched this live in 1993 it's the greatest moment in pro wrestling history. There's never been a better time. It's killing me. Eight different things that are making you think. They watched this and just laugh. They did. It completely destroyed his career. Now not only do you have to, you have to be as quiet as you can because you can hear Rick flair say, Oh God. Then you can hear offset where he's supposed to. We're getting ready to do his promo for them. You can hear them making fun of him. Okay, let's try to be funny to laugh to yourself if you can. Just fucking fat. Gut of day. I've been through them. I was trying to drill a hole I made.

Speaker 10:         00:51:58       You know what, and we're doing his costume of injustice. Yeah. He had a, for a giant fur vest that was three quarter lane with no buttons, giant sparkly helmet and jeans and boots and no shirt shop master. The shock pastor was in the ass. They literally, after this show, they changed his entire gimmick. He became a construction worker that constantly falls down. That was his career on bell's Palsy. The stroke master tapes, having them. Okay guys, shock mess the rules. I don't think I give you her license and she's the greatest thing I've ever seen. Tony Smoke. Okay. Everybody contained so high. We'll try. It's like big Jack, our partner.

Speaker 10:         00:53:09       You're my boy. His voice has started yet. You see him, you see them motioning with his hands, but his voice didn't start yet. The guys behind stage isn't talking yet. He's just motioning like he's talking like he's a mine. None of them said you fell through the wall. I'm like, Yo, she impressed with this guy to be able to yell without laughing. He's so bad. He probably didn't know. Still don't know muscles at all. He's just heritable shots. Reducer on tight. Get chickens. I had to have my stomach stapled. I keep breaking the wall and falling.

Speaker 10:         00:54:09       I wish we could hear the audio better. I was trying to nail a foundry logo to the Ali's pummel you with how cupcakes are made. Dvds. He fell and this is the thing too, if you, you fell no hands on his head like flat on his fucking fucking stupid helmet and his elbow and fallen. He's got down on the fucking floor like a fish sand pail on his head. Oh No. Stopping him to do when he put the helmet back on. I love the fact that he's staying at, he has to wipe the grounder off his head hurt and look at staying is bad. All I have to say is he's calming everybody down. Here's the moment. All I have to say is all part is going to shock. So word my ro ro was off. Timing was I got to see it again. You get to talk Yo. Yeah. Do you want to hear it was good. It's really hard in here. The whole outfit. Everything a mistake. He doesn't ever been body terrible. Hello. Wait, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. I'm sorry. You gotta understand too. If this was sid vicious in Harlem heat and they were beaten up British bulldog, a sting for like months and this is the guy who Dan is going to match the intensity. These are the top three guys, the top bad guys in the company versus the top good guys. They had no one with him. And then the day. Then this is the guy. They fucking got to stop it on slide Doron foot

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       or less. Most of them do you? I would love to know what they're, what, like what is the shock best you're thinking after his helmet goes on, he's like, I just ran the big ball all. I wish I could see that from behind him. Shot red zone is the best on somebody tweeted that. They made fun of this on raw recently. Yeah, we get it with the club show. I can get you to clap right here. All right, good. Yeah. Supposedly they went real inside and made fun of this one wrong. It's about a year ago. Less than a year ago. All right. Here's one more from the shock master. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:57:12       None other than, hey, he just felt there's no two by four that he just fell and everybody, we got to, we got on here.

Speaker 7:          00:57:37       Wait a minute. This is what he's doing. He's waiting for that guy to start driving and when he yells, he thinks it's his voice. Pantomiming the was yelling at him. He thinks that it's his voice. His uh, backstage voice guy, but it's not if the guy, and he can't even pay to mind is this five seconds, which seems like a million years where everyone is collecting themselves. So for 10, this shit did audience, the front flap, the shot master, hello. Everybody went holy Shit. His helmet. So discombobulated. What he's hearing is where he's supposed to be saying they're all, here's a storm trooper helmet. He got that down a Halloween. Yes. Yes. It's not an exaggeration. It's the storm, the storm trooper helmet with Glen Brown. Anyway, until the next style, he got the captain caveman and cap as genes that he drove to the arena. And I think I heard a better version from the guy that just tweeted me.

Speaker 7:          00:58:47       Hey Man, I gotta I gotta pick up at nine 45. I got to go to the airport. You've got to go bill. Yeah. I, Bob Gilbert came by to say hi and we bring in La.

Speaker 13:         01:11:14       first, but it's turned around and work happier than we could possibly.

Speaker 11:         01:11:18       No Way. Your job, when you see t shirts, here's what he said, he's here when he said we're happy. A happy man is a happy relationship. A happy woman is a miserable man. Wow.

Speaker 11:         01:11:33       That's what fucking point is. You got to do a one shot deal, a relationship advice show for the shot, like one hour, two hours, whatever you want to handle it. This is just simple. We'll, we'll, we'll work that out with Washington. We'll get Patrice on on the show by himself. Just taking calls. Why your relationships? Here's why you can and here's why. You should always understand why is legitimate. I'm a fucking mess physically.

Why is she fucking me? I would never give me no pussy and it's like I'm looking at it going, what's she up to? This is like my low self esteem.

Speaker 11:         01:12:18       He gotta be an ulterior motive. My self esteem is so low is high. I go, what is this bitch after? But I started realizing it's a mind thing. All they want, all they want is just a motherfucker they can look at and blink, slow and respect and anyway, it's not about beating them in and subjugating them. It's about they look at you and feel like they don't need to be your Mama. That's it. They go, wow this motherfucker is in my corner. He handles his business, you know said this is what I'm saying. You'll house situation. You become a million times sexier cause that's a man. Shit you did is buy a fucking mansion. That's a mansion. You bought a mansion Anthony. So it's like your girl can't help it go this mother fucker when you're renting, she can kind of that other half of her voice that tries to put you down. She can look at you and go this faggot in Renton. It 59 but now it's like snake written a house pussy ass N***a, you bought a mansion again. Clothes.

Speaker 11:         01:13:42       Yeah man, it's my shit. Dude is mine. I'm telling you. It's like, it's like it's pimping without beaten. I'm Megan to sell pussy. It's just stay one back dude. Don't ever let him convince it on one day. What will they do without like a man's guidance? You haven't seen a woman at once. Like they try to, you see how did success to a woman is doing is being like a guy. It's like, I, I do this, I do Vat, I do listen vac and, and, and we can care less like a sexy man. Like fuck it. I'm a female ob like a woman, a woman as in same position that is always in, is not any sexier than the bitch that works at Mcdonald's. If she's cute. That's the thing about us. We don't point. Very good point. I'll see a woman walk. A lot of people are calling you the black doctor, Phil black doctor.

Speaker 11:         01:14:31       That's the name of your show. We're going to get to choose like one or two hours. How it goes. Black seal. There's black doctor Phil with Patrice O'neil as Philip. Alright, Don's listening. We got to set that up. You want to do a, I don't know when, when would it make sense? It sounds like get my fucking hole, my straight like that. Just go off with a on an improper turn on the freaking channel and just let the phones rang and see what happens for an hour. Yeah, we'll we'll set that up in the very near future. Let's go to turtle from WAC. Pag. Turn off.

Speaker 13:         01:15:00       Hey guys, listen. Patrice, you're absolutely right. I've been jumping through hoops ever since I met my wife trying to get the pussy and once you got it, they put up more hoops to jump through. I got to go home and implement the o' Neil standard in my own,

Speaker 11:         01:15:13       the Neil standard. Wow. She knows eventually you're going to figure out if she doesn't constantly apply pressure that you're going to figure out. Holy Shit. What? Like my man, he was nervous that his wife was going to leave him and I go, let me ask you a question. Like if you really, if we really sit down, if my woman left Yo woman left Illumina, you go, what would you really miss them exactly like what would you miss? It's your own arrogance. Our arrogance is men because their possessions and if they leave it's like, um, it's like losing your favorite pencil, but it's like Penn is waiting, waiting, a relationship, loving relationship in years. Maybe your favorite favorite print doesn't even sound like it's a number two pencil stuff.
