00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.560
OH MY GOD, THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.700
THE PARTS MY DOMINANT LET ME WATCH!

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.220
Uh, Dominant Mistress, am I allowed to tell the good people spoilers?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.720
"You are."

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.320
SPOILERS!

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.700
There's this woman named Anastasia Steele!

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.380
Oh, c'mon, what's her real name?

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.380
Come on, that's like saying I'm Cinderella Diamonds.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.720
And she's sent in as a substitute to interview a man named Christian Grey!

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.380
And he's like:

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.880
"I imagine you're not a real journalist."

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.460
"No, I work in a hardware store. I'm just subbing for my roommate."

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.680
"Couldn't your roommate have gotten another journalist to sub?"

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.220
"Yes, but they wouldn't be as quiet, shy, or inexperienced."

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.560
"I find those qualities attractive in you for some reason."

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.220
"And I find your lack of any likable identity attractive for some reason."

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.680
"I invite you to join me in an elevator shaft that'll be used as an obvious metaphor for later."

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.180
"Okay."

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.740
"Symbolism."

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.500
"Obvious."

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.700
So Christian Grey, one the most photographed and famous millionaires in the world...

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.080
...walks into a hardware store without ever being recognized.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.500
In fact, he walks into a LOT of places without being recognized.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.080
He's kind of like an internet celebrity that way.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.320
And he asks Ana for rope, duct tape, and zip ties!

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.620
Oh, isn't that cute, he's a guy on tumblr about to ask someone on a date.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.000
But then one night, Ana does something that Grey sees as incredibly dangerous!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.720
*gasp* SHE GETS DRUNK!!!

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.880
Dude, if that's dangerous, I must be this guy's Evel Knievel.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.760
And Grey is like:

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.640
"Stay there! I'm gonna bring you to a safe place!"

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.920
"Oh yeah, where's that?"

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.720
"A dungeon where I can tie you up and beat you!"

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.140
"Oh, well, that sounds-- wait, what?"

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.180
So Grey tells her that he wants her to be his submissive sexercise!

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.100
And Ana is like:

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.480
"I can't agree to do this, I know nothing about you!"

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.560
"Well, will you have sex with me even though you know nothing about me?"

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.060
"Yeah, okay."

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.740
But Grey still wants her to indulge his fetish!

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.780
...even though there's about a million other people in the world who would do so willingly...

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.660
And Grey is like:

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.780
"You must sign this non-disclosure agreement that you'll tell nobody that we are dating."

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.280
"Eh, I'm gonna cross out this part that says 'tell nobody' and replace it with 'tell everybody, but you will not get angry for some reason'."

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.960
"I think that's fair."

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.500
"Wonderful! Now, will you love me?"

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.140
"I'm sorry, I don't do love!"

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.220
"What?! Then why don't you hire a prostitute or something?"

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.600
"Because there's something that draws me to you! Something the writers obviously forgot to put in but nevertheless it draws me emotionally to you!"

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.640
"Even though you just said you don't get emotionally involved."

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.820
"Hey, sorry, baby! I'm just not a 'flowers and candy' kind of guy."

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.640
"But you do seem to be a 'helicopter, airplane, and buying me cars' kind of guy."

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.980
"Those are two totally different things."

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.480
"Yeah, one's a lot bigger."

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.080
"Don't question me! I'm complex."

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.980
So Grey admits he was a submissive when he was only 15 years old!

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.460
And also admits he was born from a woman who was a crack addict!

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.720
And invites her to meet his family while he also goes to meet her family...

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.300
...yet does not get emotionally involved.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.160
And Ana is like:

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.120
"You make NO sense whatsoever."

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.720
"Of course I don't! I'm complex."

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.170
"Yeah, I think you're confusing 'complex' with 'inconsistent and lazily written'."

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.020
"It's no more inconsistent than you hating my gifts, but still taking them!"

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.920
"Well, I, uh..."

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.560
"And not filling out the paperwork, but still being tied up and spanked anyway!"

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.640
"Well, I, uh..."

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.440
"And no more inconsistent than going to a relationship I clearly said would have no love and yet you constantly trying to get love out of it!"

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.520
"What can I say, we spawned from Twilight fanfiction, there's really no direction to go but down."

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.240
"Oh, let's just give the horny middle-aged ladies the bondage that they want!"

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.740
"Okay."

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.000
But Ana still wants to find out more about him!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.460
So she asks him to confess why he likes all this weird ass crap!

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.120
And Grey is like:

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.700
"I can't tell you, it's too painful!"

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.760
"Yeah, I know, you seem to be a guy who's kinda into that."

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.380
"But not this time! I'm complex."

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.160
"But you confessed to me all that other difficult stuff you never told anyone!"

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.380
"That was different! At that point, I was at this level of complex, now I'm at this level of complex! I'm complex."

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.420
"Okay, then show me the pain you feel!"

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.100
"What, really?"

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.560
"Yes, don't hold back! It's clearly the only way!"

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.720
"Well, no, I think we clearly established I can tell you. I'm just being stubborn."

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.940
"No! I'm giving you permission to beat the living crap out of me!"

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.900
"You're sure? You are talking to a sadist here."

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.400
"Yes!"

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.740
"Okay, well, I'm just gonna do what I've always done to you except a lot harder and I want you to count with me."

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.400
"Really, that's it?"

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.060
"Yeah, for someone as messed up as I am, you think it'd be worse, but eh."

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.140
"Alright, you have my full permission to do so!"

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.400
"OW! What are you, crazy?!"

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.740
"But you're the one who wanted me to--"

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.700
"You are never to do that again, you monster!"

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.980
"Okay, I will clearly not do what you tell me directly to do the next time you directly tell me to do it."

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.220
"You're a psychopath! And a fiend! And I love you."

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.980
"Wait, what?"

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.920
"Say you love me back."

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.140
"Uh, we've gone over this, I'm not gonna say that. Even though I confusingly go back and forth between saying it and everything but words."

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.300
"You should've made it more clear what this relationship was about!"

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.610
"Well, what do you want, a written document that has everything spelled out for you?"

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.440
"Oh, wait! There is!"

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.720
"I'm going away, leaving the ending open for sequel books!"

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.820
"Well, can you at least join me in the elevator for a lame attempt at book ending the film?"

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.320
"Of course."

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.900
"This ending--"

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.780
"--makes no sense."

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.600
The end!

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.840
So Fifty Shades of Grey was really complex.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.280
Even though we didn't really see fifty shades of grey. It was more two, a jerk and a little less of a jerk.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.240
And a whole generation of women have been introduced to a world of sex they never even knew about!

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.700
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have one who's paying me quite well to help her explore her kinky side.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.010
"Oh, Chester~. It's playtime~."

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.960
*whip crack*

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.840
T-This is Chester A. Bum saying...

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.520
BAND-AIDS!! YOU GOT BAND-AIDS?! OH C'MON, THESE LASHES REALLY HURT, MAN! C'MON, BAND-AIDS!!

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.760
"QUIET, SUBMISSIVE!" *whip crack*
OHHHH! THANK YOU, MISS, MAY I HAVE ANOTHER?!

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.980
*whip crack*
OH GOD, I FEEL SO EMPOWERED!
