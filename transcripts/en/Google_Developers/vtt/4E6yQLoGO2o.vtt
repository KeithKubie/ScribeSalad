DAVE THAU: Hi, I'm Dave Thau
from the Google Earth Engine

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:02.760
team.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.930
And I'm here to tell you
about Google Earth Engine.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.513
Earth Engine is a
platform for running

00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:08.730
planetary-scale,
geospatial analyses using

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.877
Google infrastructure.

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:12.210
In this video, I'll introduce
Earth Engine and the tools

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.679
you can use to access it.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.720
Satellites have been
collecting Earth observation

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.970
data for decades, but it's
been difficult to access

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.864
that information.

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:21.280
And there's so much data that
even if you could access it,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.940
it's very difficult to analyze.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.780
At Google, we've overcome
these difficulties

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.850
by downloading petabytes
of satellite data,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.190
putting them on spinning
disk in our data centers,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.980
and providing tools and an API
for analyzing the data quickly

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.120
and easily.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.760
All analyses are run in
parallel across many machines

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.830
in the Google Cloud.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.660
Our data catalog
includes over 40 years

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.850
of public satellite
data, elevation data,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.449
atmospheric data, and more.

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.990
We also provide tools to let
you upload your own private data

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.910
or share it as you'd like.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.740
We've used Earth
Engine internally,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.110
where we've analyzed almost
a petabyte of data using

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.370
thousands of CPUs to create the
15-meter-resolution, cloud-free

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.400
image of the Earth that acts
as the satellite-based map

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.370
for Google Maps
and Google Earth.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.120
Now we're providing
the same tools and API

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.420
to developers and
researchers outside of Google

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.460
who have been using it to do
things like monitor forest

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.950
cover change globally, detect
surface water, also globally,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.511
and estimating the risk of
infectious disease outbreaks.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.910
Earth Engine can be accessed
using a graphical user

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.790
interface at
explorer.earthengine.google.com,

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.010
which you see here.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.590
And it can also be accessed
using an integrated development

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.606
environment available at
code.earthengine.google.com.

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:36.330
And it can be accessed
via a Python API.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.800
Here's the development
environment.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.620
As you can see, the developer
environment has four panels.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.500
The upper left panel provides
code samples, documentation,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.490
and a place where you
can upload your own data.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.160
The center panel is where you
type and run your Earth Engine

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.170
scripts.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.900
And the upper right panel is a
place for debugging information

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.970
and a place to view charts.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.220
Finally, the map below is
where you can instantly

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.900
see the results of your
analysis on the map.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.400
Let's look at the linear fit
example in the Code Samples

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.520
section.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.530
Clicking on the code
sample brings up

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.090
the code in the center panel.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.000
As you may be able to tell,
this code is JavaScript.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.400
While the Earth Engine API
has both JavaScript and Python

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.590
bindings, the code
editor is targeted

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.840
towards JavaScript development.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.600
Clicking on Run in the
center panel runs the script.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.264
This particular
example shows how

00:02:20.264 --> 00:02:21.930
the brightness of
global lights at night

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.320
have changed between
1991 and 2016.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.300
Red areas have become
increasingly bright,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.260
and blue areas have
become increasingly dim.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.000
This example applies
a simple statistic

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.070
to measure change
over time globally.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.020
The Earth Engine API
supports operations

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.480
that range from basic math
to complex machine-learning

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.299
algorithms.

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.090
We'll go more deeply
into both Earth Engine

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.300
API and the development
environments

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.110
in future tutorials.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.735
Earth Engine is available for
free for noncommercial use.

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:50.360
For commercial applications, see
our Frequently Asked Questions

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.889
page.

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.430
If this all sounds
interesting to you

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.554
and you think you have a
good use for Earth Engine,

00:02:54.554 --> 00:02:57.830
please sign up for access
using the sign-up link here.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.920
Thanks for listening.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.253
I'm Dave Thau, and I'll see
you in the next Earth Engine

00:03:01.253 --> 00:03:01.970
tutorial.
