00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:02.600
Let's get some practice
solving some equations,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.342
and we're gonna set up some equations

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:05.967
that are a little bit hairier than normal,

00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:08.127
they're gonna have some
decimals and fractions in them.

00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:12.585
So let's say I had the
equation 1.2 times c

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.998
is equal to 0.6.

00:00:15.998 --> 00:00:17.298
So what do I have to multiply

00:00:17.298 --> 00:00:20.851
times 1.2 to get 0.6?

00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:23.405
And it might not jump out
immediately in your brain but

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:24.960
lucky for us we can think about this

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.818
a little bit methodically.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.281
So one thing I like to do is say okay,

00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:30.277
I have the c on the left hand side,

00:00:30.277 --> 00:00:32.483
and I'm just multiplying it by 1.2,

00:00:32.483 --> 00:00:34.875
it would be great if this just said c.

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:37.638
If this just said c instead of 1.2c.

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:39.217
So what can I do there?

00:00:39.217 --> 00:00:41.237
Well I could just divide by 1.2

00:00:41.237 --> 00:00:43.118
but as we've seen multiple times,

00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:45.114
you can't just do that
to the left hand side,

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:47.808
that would change, you no longer could say

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:51.639
that this is equal to that if
you only operate on one side.

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:54.797
So you have to divide
by 1.2 on both sides.

00:00:54.797 --> 00:00:57.931
So on your left hand
side, 1.2c divided by 1.2,

00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:00.091
well that's just going to be c.

00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:02.250
You're just going to be left with c,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.250
and you're going to have
c is equal to 0.6 over 1.2

00:01:07.637 --> 00:01:08.844
Now what is that equal to?

00:01:08.844 --> 00:01:10.911
There's a bunch of ways
you could approach it.

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:12.908
The way I like to do
it is, well let's just,

00:01:12.908 --> 00:01:14.301
let's just get rid of the decimals.

00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:16.832
Let's just multiply the
numerator and denominator

00:01:16.832 --> 00:01:19.641
by a large enough number so
that the decimals go away.

00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:20.848
So what happens if we multiply

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:23.217
the numerator and the denominator by...

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:25.817
Let's see if we multiply them by 10,

00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:29.486
you're gonna have a 6 in the numerator

00:01:29.486 --> 00:01:31.668
and 12 in the denominator,
actually let's do that.

00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:35.592
Let's multiply the numerator
and denominator by 10.

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:37.845
So once again, this is the
same thing as multiplying by

00:01:37.845 --> 00:01:41.049
10 over 10, it's not changing
the value of the fraction.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.049
So 0.6 times 10 is 6,
and 1.2 times 10 is 12.

00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:53.134
So it's equal to six
twelfths, and if we want

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:55.952
we can write that in a
little bit of a simpler way.

00:01:55.952 --> 00:01:57.902
We could rewrite that
as, divide the numerator

00:01:57.902 --> 00:02:01.803
and denominator by 6, you get 1 over 2,

00:02:01.803 --> 00:02:04.427
so this is equal to one half.

00:02:04.427 --> 00:02:08.443
And if you look back at
the original equation,

00:02:08.443 --> 00:02:12.948
1.2 times one half, you could
view this as twelve tenths.

00:02:12.948 --> 00:02:14.504
Twelve tenths times one half

00:02:14.504 --> 00:02:17.545
is going to be equal to six tenths,

00:02:17.545 --> 00:02:18.706
so we can feel pretty good

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:20.866
that c is equal to one half.

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:22.561
Let's do another one.

00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:27.561
Let's say that we have 1 over 4

00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:33.085
is equal to y over 12.

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.337
So how do we solve for y here?

00:02:35.337 --> 00:02:37.845
So we have a y on the right hand side,

00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:40.492
and it's being divided by 12.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:41.653
Well the best way I can think of

00:02:41.653 --> 00:02:44.044
of getting rid of this
12 and just having a y

00:02:44.044 --> 00:02:49.044
on the right hand side is
multiplying both sides by 12.

00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:51.683
We do that in yellow.

00:02:51.683 --> 00:02:54.632
So if I multiply the
right hand side by 12,

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:57.000
I have to multiply the
left hand side by 12.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.835
And once again, why did I pick 12?

00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:00.808
Well I wanted to multiply by some number,

00:03:00.808 --> 00:03:03.177
that when I multiply it by y over 12

00:03:03.177 --> 00:03:04.218
I'm just left with y.

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:06.169
And so y times 12 divided by 12,

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.910
well that's just going to be 1.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.720
And then on the left hand
side you're going to have

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.204
12 times one fourth,
which is twelve fourths.

00:03:13.204 --> 00:03:18.204
So you get 12 over 4, is equal to y.

00:03:19.868 --> 00:03:24.868
Or you could say y is equal
to 12 over 4, y is equal to,

00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:27.798
let me do that just so you
can see what I'm doing,

00:03:27.798 --> 00:03:31.446
just flopping the sides, doesn't
change what's being said,

00:03:31.446 --> 00:03:33.233
y is equal to 12 over 4.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.671
Now what is twelve fourths?

00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:37.599
Well, you can view this
as 12 divided by 4,

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.896
which is 3, or you could
view this as twelve fourths

00:03:40.896 --> 00:03:43.287
which would be literally, 3 wholes.

00:03:43.287 --> 00:03:45.284
So you could say this would be equal to 3.

00:03:45.284 --> 00:03:47.908
Y is equal to 3, and you can check that.

00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:52.389
One fourth is equal to 3 over 12,

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:53.480
so it all works out.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.688
That's the neat thing about equations,

00:03:54.688 --> 00:03:58.612
you can always check to see
if you got the right answer.

00:03:58.612 --> 00:04:02.071
Let's do another one, can't stop.

00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:07.071
4.5 is equal to 0.5n

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.104
So like always, I have my n
already on the right hand side.

00:04:11.104 --> 00:04:13.124
But it's being multiplied by 0.5,

00:04:13.124 --> 00:04:15.097
it would be great if it just said n.

00:04:15.097 --> 00:04:16.003
So what can I do?

00:04:16.003 --> 00:04:19.857
Well I can divide both sides,
I can divide both sides

00:04:19.857 --> 00:04:22.852
by 0.5, once again, if I do
it to the right hand side

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:24.733
I have to do it to the left hand side.

00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:26.312
And why am I dividing by 0.5?

00:04:26.312 --> 00:04:29.098
So I'm just left with an
n on the right hand side.

00:04:29.098 --> 00:04:31.699
So this is going to be,
so on the left hand side,

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.180
I have 4.5 over 0.5, let me just,

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.388
I don't want to skip too many steps.

00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:42.388
4.5 over 0.5, is equal to n,

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.170
because you have 0.5 divided by 0.5,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.144
you're just left with an n over here.

00:04:48.144 --> 00:04:50.210
So what does that equal to?

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.368
Well 4.5 divided by 0.5,

00:04:53.368 --> 00:04:54.575
there's a couple ways to view this.

00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:56.247
You could view this as forty-five tenths

00:04:56.247 --> 00:04:58.151
divided by five tenths,
which would tell you

00:04:58.151 --> 00:04:59.985
okay, this is going to be 9.

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:01.680
Or if that seems a little bit confusing

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.141
or a little bit daunting, you
can do what we did over here.

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:05.883
You could multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:05:05.883 --> 00:05:08.367
by the same number, so that
we get rid of the decimals.

00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:10.643
And in this case, if you multiply by 10

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.965
you can move the decimal one to the right.

00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:15.102
So once again, it has to be multiplying

00:05:15.102 --> 00:05:16.755
the numerator and the
denominator by the same thing.

00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:19.101
We're multiplying by 10 over
10, which is equivalent to 1,

00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:20.703
which tells us that we're not

00:05:20.703 --> 00:05:23.234
changing the value of this fraction.

00:05:23.234 --> 00:05:27.738
So let's see, this is going to be 45

00:05:27.738 --> 00:05:32.738
over 5, is equal to n.

00:05:33.427 --> 00:05:35.191
And some of you might say wait wait wait,

00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:37.327
hold on a second, you just
told us whatever we do

00:05:37.327 --> 00:05:41.019
to one side of the equation,
we have to do to the other side

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:42.552
of the equation and here you are,

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:44.758
you're just multiplying the
left hand side of this equation

00:05:44.758 --> 00:05:46.336
by 10 over 10.

00:05:46.336 --> 00:05:48.217
Now remember, what is 10 over 10?

00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:49.773
10 over 10 is just 1.

00:05:49.773 --> 00:05:52.281
Yes, if I wanted to, I could
multiply the left hand side

00:05:52.281 --> 00:05:55.392
by 10 over 10, and I could
multiply the right hand side

00:05:55.392 --> 00:05:58.225
by 10 over 10, but that's
not going to change the value

00:05:58.225 --> 00:05:59.548
of the right hand side.

00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:02.009
I'm not actually changing
the values of the two sides.

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.401
I'm just trying to
rewrite the left hand side

00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:07.303
by multiplying it by 1 in
kind of a creative way.

00:06:07.303 --> 00:06:10.415
But notice, n times 10 over
10, well that's still going

00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:11.599
to just be n.

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.805
So I'm not violating this principle

00:06:13.805 --> 00:06:15.198
of whatever I do to the left hand side

00:06:15.198 --> 00:06:16.196
I do to the right hand side.

00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:18.750
You can always multiply one side by 1

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.584
and you can do that as
many times as you want.

00:06:20.584 --> 00:06:22.651
Like the same way you can add 0

00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:24.926
or subtract 0 from one side,

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.993
without necessarily having to show

00:06:26.993 --> 00:06:28.177
you're doing it to the other side,

00:06:28.177 --> 00:06:30.151
because it doesn't change the value.

00:06:30.151 --> 00:06:33.076
But anyways, you have n
is equal to 45 over 5,

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:34.284
well what's 45 over 5?

00:06:34.284 --> 00:06:35.932
Well that's going to be 9.

00:06:35.932 --> 00:06:40.414
So we have 9 is equal to,
why did I switch to green?

00:06:40.414 --> 00:06:45.414
We have 9 is equal to n, or
we could say n is equal to 9.

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:47.658
And you could check that:

00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:52.658
4.5 is equal to 0.5 times
9, yup half of 9 is 4.5

00:06:54.484 --> 00:06:57.201
Let's do one more, because
once again I can't stop.

00:06:57.201 --> 00:07:00.126
Alright, let me get some space here,

00:07:00.126 --> 00:07:04.747
so we can keep the different
problems apart that we had.

00:07:04.747 --> 00:07:09.747
So let's do, let's have
a different variable now.

00:07:09.832 --> 00:07:14.832
Let's say we have g
over 4 is equal to 3.2.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.914
Well I wanna get rid
of this dividing by 4,

00:07:16.914 --> 00:07:18.562
so the easiest way I
can think of doing that

00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:21.743
is multiplying both sides by 4.

00:07:21.743 --> 00:07:23.438
So I'm multiplying both sides by 4,

00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:26.573
and the whole reason is 4
divided by 4 gives me 1,

00:07:26.573 --> 00:07:31.573
so I'm gonna have g is equal
to, what's 3.2 times 4?

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:36.743
Let's see 3 times 4 is
12, and two tenths times 4

00:07:36.743 --> 00:07:41.665
is eight tenths, so it's
gonna be 12 and eight tenths.

00:07:41.665 --> 00:07:45.241
G is going to be 12.8, and
you can verify this is right.

00:07:45.241 --> 00:07:49.601
12.8 divided by 4 is 3.2.
