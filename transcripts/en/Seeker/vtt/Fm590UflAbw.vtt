00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.360
It’s Christmas, which means it’s the time
of year for cornering your crush under mistletoe.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:13.960
Here are some things you might not know about
the plant you’re gonna smooch under.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.930
Mistletoe might look pretty, but the plant
you’re likely to see strung as a Christmas

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.790
decoration in the United States is actually
a parasite.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.830
It grows on a tree’s branches or trunk and
actually plants roots in its host to take

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.830
in nutrients.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.900
There are strains of the plant that can grow
on its own, getting its own nutrients through

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.680
photosynthesis like any other plant.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.230
But the parasitic type usually kills the tree,
but there’s a bit of a silver lining: that

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.690
dead tree makes a spot for birds to nest.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.190
And that’s actually where mistletoe gets
its name.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.510
Anglo-Saxons noted that the plant usually
grows where birds poop.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.110
In Anglo-Saxon, “mistel” means “dung”
and “tan” means “twig.”

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.739
“Dung-on-a-twig” then roughly translated
to mistletoe.

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:49.990
And those berries?

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.100
Mistletoe berries are poisonous to cats and
other small animals and toxic to humans, though

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.900
there’s some debate over whether they’re
toxic enough to kill.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.400
Which is strange when you think that mistletoe,
the berries and the leaves, was historically

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.680
used as a remedy.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.680
In the 17th century, it was prescribed as
a cure for nervous disorders, epilepsy, and

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.680
spasms.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.420
It has also been used as a digestive aid,
a heart tonic, a sedative, a treatment for

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.159
arthritis, hysteria, asthma, bed-wetting among
other things.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.420
It was even used as a treatment for cancerous
tumours.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.530
More recently, a study has shown that Korean
mistletoe can help fight obesity-related liver

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.530
disease.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.760
At least, in mice.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.950
The study was published in the Journal of
Agricultural and Food Chemistry.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.810
According to the study, Korean mistletoe contains
a compound called “viscothionin” that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.010
affects fat metabolism in the liver.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.060
Obese mice who were treated with it saw their
body and liver weights drop.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.100
So the researchers hope viscothionin could
someday be used to treat nonalcoholic fatty

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.510
liver disease in humans.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.360
It’s precisely because of its healing properties
that mistletoe made its way into Christmas

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.799
traditions, but the kissing bit came a little
later.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.250
It’s thought that the ritual started with
servants in England before spreading to the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.260
middle class.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.480
Men were allowed to steal a kiss from a woman
if she was caught standing underneath mistletoe,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.740
and for her to refuse was bad luck.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.510
Some traditions say that a berry had to be
taken from the plant for every kiss, effectively

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.570
capping the number of potentially unwanted
holiday smooches.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.430
So does knowing all this give you a different
perspective on mistletoe?
