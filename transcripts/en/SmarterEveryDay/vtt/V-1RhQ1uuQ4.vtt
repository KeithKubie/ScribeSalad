00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.830
- You've probably heard
a lot of talk lately

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.600
about bots on Twitter or
even foreign involvement

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.030
in our political process.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.620
For example, the president
of the United States

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.420
publicly thanked a Twitter account

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.240
which we now know was
run by malicious actors

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.910
located somewhere in Russia.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.920
Now, depending on what
your political views are

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.550
you might be inclined to roll your eyes

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.410
and make some kind of joke

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.040
about the president being tricked,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.850
but this is far more than that.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.170
This reply is totally
something I would do.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.030
If an account with over 100,000 followers

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.320
Tweeted something nice to me

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.470
I think an appropriate
response would be thank you

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.060
because that person is
clearly very influential.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.700
When you look closer at this tweet

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.120
and really start to think about it

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.930
with an unbiased point of view you start

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.640
to realize the incredible
act of deception here.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.473
And I'm not just talking

00:00:42.473 --> 00:00:44.920
about deceiving the president to reply,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.283
I'm talking about the 100,000 people

00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:49.530
that signed up to follow this account

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.310
thinking that it was a
group if like-minded people

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.720
located in Tennessee,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.990
when it was actually a malicious puppeteer

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.810
sitting somewhere across the globe.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.000
Twitter is under attack.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.190
It's a beautiful platform made for free,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.630
open discussion about different ideas.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.510
But the people that are
attacking Twitter every day

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.470
are trying to control the discussion

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.030
so they can ultimately
control those ideas.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.890
The goal is to promote tribalism

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.820
and sow discord in society.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.010
This is the second part
of a three-part series

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.190
we're doing on SmarterEveryDay

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.750
about attacks against our
social media platforms.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.610
And we're gonna address today

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.070
what Twitter calls platform manipulation.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.000
Today we're gonna look at
data and we're gonna talk

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.210
to experts face to face
so we can understand

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.400
what these malicious
people are trying to do,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.537
how they're trying to do it

00:01:32.537 --> 00:01:34.130
and the most important thing of all,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.370
how you can get smarter

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.950
so that you don't take the bait?

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.130
We're going straight to the source

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.330
so let's go to Twitter
Headquarters in San Francisco

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.760
and speak to the team in charge

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.010
of protecting the platform

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.170
against these types of attacks.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.003
I'm Destin.

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:46.836
- I'm Del.

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:48.210
- Del, nice to meet you.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.480
So you're over Trust and Safety,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.313
is that right?

00:01:51.313 --> 00:01:52.146
- That's correct.
- At Twitter

00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:53.200
and trust and safety in general

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.890
is keeping people safe on the Internet.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.723
- That's the goal.

00:01:55.723 --> 00:01:57.068
- Okay, first question,

00:01:57.068 --> 00:01:59.273
are we under attack on the Internet?

00:01:59.273 --> 00:02:01.240
Are there people actively trying

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.180
to do things to change the way we think?

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.150
- Absolutely, right.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.850
That's what advertising is.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.110
- Yeah, good point, yeah.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.260
- And even when you get past advertising

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.825
there's this whole fascinating world

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:14.280
of things that people do

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.490
and the reason that I kind of pause

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.250
when people say attack is
that people who are trying

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.870
to get the word out about
something they believe in

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.230
or who are trying to raise
awareness of something,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.210
engaged in a lot of the same behaviors

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.850
that you might think of
when you're actually talking

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.140
about somebody who's
trying to maliciously skew

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.090
the information available
on a given topic.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.530
- There's another issue
you're probably hearing

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.810
a lot about on Twitter these days

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.300
and that's accounts getting
censored or suspended.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.500
The first reason is
Twitter's value system.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.800
You can go read about
that on their website

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.220
if you want but I'm just
gonna tell you straight up,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.050
that's beyond the scope
of what I wanna get into

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.460
in this episode of SmarterEveryDay.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.890
If Twitter is censoring people

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.960
because of their ideas,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.180
Twitter has to own that.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.690
However, on the flip side I also need

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.940
to understand that there
is a battle going on

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.660
behind the scenes to try
to keep the platform usable

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.170
and free from manipulation.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.200
If you were to make your
own social media platform

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.970
you'd have to make a decision
between two extremes.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.070
On the one side you could
run it like the Wild West,

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.620
which kind of sounds nice at first

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.900
until you realize that anything goes

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.260
and stuff starts to clutter
up like your spam folder.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.010
On the other side you
could be a totalitarian

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.020
but that's not good for
liberty or free expression.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.500
So the trick here is
to do a balancing act.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.190
You wanna make the most amount of people

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.950
on the platform happy but at the same time

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.060
have just enough rules

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.730
so you keep the platform usable.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.090
- So back in the day we
had the trending topics

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.070
and the original way that
we did trending topics

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.540
was that it would be what are the things

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.940
that are being talked
about the most on Twitter?

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.370
In a way,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.200
they were under attack,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.240
if you will,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.630
because the top trend every
day was Justin Bieber.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.463
- Yeah.

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:51.940
- We were under attack.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.529
- The Beliebers were...

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.279
- Specifically the Brazilian Beliebers

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:58.360
(man laughing)

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.320
who wanted Justin Bieber
to come to Brazil.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.153
- Really?

00:04:02.153 --> 00:04:03.800
- So what they would do is every morning

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.633
they would wake up,

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:05.760
they would log onto Twitter

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.857
and they would start tweeting.

00:04:06.857 --> 00:04:08.730
@justinbieber I love you,

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.830
come to Brazil one.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.860
@justinbieber I love you,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.693
come to Brazil three.

00:04:11.693 --> 00:04:12.680
And they were doing the number

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.380
because we'd already made the fix

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.320
that you couldn't do
exactly duplicate text.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.080
So now they were adding a number onto it.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.350
And you would look at these

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.183
accounts...
- It sounds

00:04:20.183 --> 00:04:21.160
like a joke but it's not.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.993
- It's totally not.

00:04:21.993 --> 00:04:23.500
These were real people.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.880
This was not automated.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.420
We ended up going,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.300
this is not actually a reflection

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.630
of what we want trending topics to be.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.470
So we made the change,

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.810
the first change,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.860
which was we're going to actually

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.920
rather than just saying, okay,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.130
well this is the topic that's
being mentioned the most,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.860
we're going to shift to
trying to really focus

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.650
on how fresh a topic is?

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.630
- Now, these fans weren't
automating their tweets

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.610
but automation is actually allowed

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.070
by Twitter's terms of service.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.700
This leads to all kinds of really fun

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.180
and useful automation accounts,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.210
Year and Progress,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.280
Medieval Death Bot.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.610
A guy named Jeff and I run an account

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.840
called WhoIsInSpace and
we occasionally operate

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.050
that in autonomous mode.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.880
But these bots can get
out of control quickly.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.050
If they're allowed,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.840
how do you filter out the bad ones?

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.760
So we've all seen these nasty bots, right?

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.350
They've got suggested pictures on there

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.600
and they try to get you to click a link

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.640
so they can get all your money.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.050
I used to see these all the time

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.550
but I don't really see them anymore.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.310
I'm freaking impressed that you guys

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.390
are doing as well as you are

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.604
because I guess it was two years ago

00:05:18.604 --> 00:05:21.240
I could see all this bot content

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.450
and you've fixed that,

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.670
at least in my feed.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.980
So I imagine there was

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.720
a great amount...
- Hopefully not just yours.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.040
- Yes, but there was a great amount

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.873
of engineering effort

00:05:28.873 --> 00:05:30.500
that went into that, I'm assuming.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.990
Those bots had a certain countermeasure

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.550
to get around your gates and safeguards.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.220
You fixed that so now the bots

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.300
are doing counter, countermeasures.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.220
And so now what you're about

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.250
to do is a counter,

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.366
counter, countermeasure.

00:05:42.366 --> 00:05:44.040
- Eventually you just get up

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.670
to an absurd number of counters.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.870
There are all sorts of additional things

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.703
that you can do,

00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:51.130
speed bumps that you can
put in to do little checks

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.580
to test what behavior
happen when you try X.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.760
So for example,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.420
there's an account and we're just like,

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.190
something about this doesn't seem right.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.180
Maybe it's automated.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.460
We can throw a CAPTCHA at it.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.920
Did it pass the CAPTCHA?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.790
It passed the CAPTCHA,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.120
that doesn't mean it's not automated.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.260
It could mean that they've just purchased,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.210
having somebody who's going to do CAPTCHAs

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.043
that are thrown at it.

00:06:11.043 --> 00:06:13.240
Okay, let's go ahead and have them confirm

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.840
that they have access to the email address

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.870
associated with the account.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.360
We're gonna send them
a password reset link.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.193
Did they get there?

00:06:18.193 --> 00:06:19.130
How fast did they get there?

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.650
How long did it take them
to verify that, right?

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.880
So you have to maintain access

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.750
to email addresses
associated with your account.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.250
You can't just use burner emails.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.970
You have to be able to
go back and log into it.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.510
And look, friction can take

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.377
any number of forms, right.

00:06:32.377 --> 00:06:34.610
- That's the term you use, friction?

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.746
- Yeah, friction.

00:06:35.746 --> 00:06:38.310
And there are things that
are necessary friction.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.480
There are things that are
unnecessary friction, right.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.450
There's things where we really need

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.600
to make this experience easier for people.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.600
- I personally experienced this friction

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.660
that Del is talking about.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.460
I recently signed up for
a new Twitter account.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.970
It's for something I
wanna do in the future

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.930
and I went to tweet for the
first time after two weeks

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.700
and the account was already suspended.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.420
I hadn't done anything
so why am I suspended?

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.980
That's kind of weird and irritating.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.230
So to try to get a better picture

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.400
of what's going on let's speak

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.750
to a technical engineer
to try to understand

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.583
what they're doing?

00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:06.970
So this is Joel here at Twitter

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:07.910
and what team are you on?

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.880
- We're the Site Integrity
Team in Trust and Safety.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.050
- The Site Integrity,

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.910
so by site integrity

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.950
you basically sniff out bots

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.783
and you knock them down,

00:07:18.783 --> 00:07:19.616
kind of thing.

00:07:19.616 --> 00:07:20.730
- We obviously are focused

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.600
on removing malicious
activity from the service.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.290
We have taken really substantial steps,

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.920
especially in the last few years

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.620
to address some of the most common forms

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.820
of platform manipulation,

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.570
like bots and automation.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.960
We're challenging eight and a half

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.000
to 10 million bots a week

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.760
of which about three quarters of them wind

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.310
up removed totally
automatically from the service.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.143
So it's not like I'm sitting there

00:07:42.143 --> 00:07:42.976
and I'm like
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:07:42.976 --> 00:07:44.870
I'm sorry, how many a week?

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.260
- Eight to 10 million accounts a week

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.890
are challenged automatically

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.300
and more than three
quarters of those accounts

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.240
wind up removed automatically
from the service.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.490
- That is a stupid big number.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.910
I mean, think about this,

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.580
congratulations, welcome to
the team here at Twitter.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.550
You've got the job.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.600
Here are 10 million accounts,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.580
go figure out which ones are humans based

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.570
on their behavior.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.810
I just realized that you
might be doing things

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.570
far more subtly than I realized.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.450
Okay, for example,

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.283
if I get my phone,

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:13.320
I'm grabbing my phone.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.340
I'm scrolling my tweet feed
and they're loading below.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.400
The rate at which they load is correlated

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.260
to a physical thumb movement of a human.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.364
Do you factor that in,

00:08:24.364 --> 00:08:25.450
that kind of stuff?

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.030
Like when you say human behavior,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.101
are those the types of
things that you look at?

00:08:29.101 --> 00:08:31.270
- I don't wanna reveal too much.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.030
- Okay, got it, got it.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.460
And to be clear,

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.990
the reason you don't wanna reveal too much

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.510
is you need to keep all

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.430
of your countermeasures secret

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.330
because the moment someone understands

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.950
your countermeasures
they could exploit those.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.580
- I think it's very real
that there's an arms race

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.201
around platform manipulation.

00:08:49.201 --> 00:08:51.610
And it's our job as a company

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.550
and it's my team's job to try

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.576
and stay one step ahead of attackers.

00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:59.010
But whenever you get really
good at cracking down

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.920
on a certain pattern of behavior

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.070
an attacker is going to adapt some

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.160
of what they're doing to try

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.810
and exploit something that they perceive

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.910
as a weakness.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.010
And so it can't just be one person

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:10.970
or one team of people.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.730
Our top priority as a company

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.142
is combating these issues

00:09:14.142 --> 00:09:16.110
and there's a lot of
people who are working

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.240
on every angle of it.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.270
- Twitter's free, all
you need is an account

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.280
and attackers are trying
to manipulate Twitter

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.420
by using computers to
automate the sign up process.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.590
Twitter's forced to use
artificial intelligence

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.620
to defend the platform

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.360
because these computers never sleep

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.370
and there's not enough
humans to do the job.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.900
The problem is these bad guys

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.733
are starting to make themselves

00:09:33.733 --> 00:09:36.010
as authentically human
as possible in order

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.270
to sneak on the platform.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.070
Heck, in some cases they are human.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.750
Add to this deception the sheer number

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.360
of signups and you can start to see

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.880
how it's possible to miss some of these

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.870
and let them slip past the defenses.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.100
Speaking of defenses,

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.920
after the first episode in this series

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.760
I was contacted

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.240
by the NATO Strategic
Communications Center

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.330
and yes, I'm talking

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.640
about the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.040
I was given a report
written by Sebastian Bay

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.980
who works with the NATO
Strategic Communication

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.080
Center of Excellence to track all kinds

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.000
of stuff related to NATOs interests.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.870
Okay, I'm on Skype with Sebastian Bay.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.240
Happy 70th birthday of NATO,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.130
by the way.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.900
Sebastian has worked on this report,

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:11.980
Manipulating Social Media,

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.100
The Black Market for
Social Media Manipulation.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.130
Do you mind introducing
yourself so everyone knows?

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.570
- Yes, my name is Sebastian Bay.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.030
I'm a Senior Expert with NATO Strategic

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.340
Communications Center of
Excellence in Riga, Latvia.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.100
- You've basically infiltrated
these black markets

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.470
and you understand how they
work at this point, right?

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.800
- So we've mapped the market.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.310
We've looked at all the
different resellers out there.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.410
We've looked at prices.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.540
We've looked at methods.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.090
We've basically seen what are they selling

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.570
and how are they trying to
manipulate social media?

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.420
How easy is it to buy a
click or a like out there

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.660
and how effective are they?

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.220
- When it comes to Twitter profiles

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.150
what are you seeing on the black market?

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.010
- So I should take one step back,

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.130
so we've been looking at Twitter

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.350
for quite some time actually

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.180
and we published a report
called Robotrolling,

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.215
which is a quarterly product where we look

00:10:57.215 --> 00:11:01.070
at manipulation of Twitter
when it comes specifically

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.300
to NATO issues in the Baltic's.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.450
And when we started looking specifically

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.020
at this topic two years ago,

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.550
as much as 70% of all activity relating

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.220
to NATO and the Baltic's
was actually manipulated.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.910
It was done by inauthentic bot accounts.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.070
That has gone down significantly though.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.680
Today it's down to the low tens.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.513
- What?

00:11:24.188 --> 00:11:26.257
So 70% of all,

00:11:26.257 --> 00:11:28.130
on that specific topic online,

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.210
because yeah, why are
people tweeting about NATO?

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.460
And the answer is.
- And the Baltic's, yeah.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.600
So when we looked at NATO and the Baltic's

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.010
and especially in Russian,

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.130
we could see that that environment

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.383
was extremely polluted.

00:11:41.383 --> 00:11:44.830
Most of those accounts
are very simple bots.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.670
They don't have a history
and they're only there

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.710
to inflate the account

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.968
or to make a certain topic trend, etc..

00:11:51.968 --> 00:11:54.760
Twitter's done a lot
actually to sure-up this

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.058
but we can still see that
these very simple accounts

00:11:57.058 --> 00:12:00.050
and these very simple
bots can live as long

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.920
as five to six thousand tweets

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.580
before they get taken down.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.715
- So in your estimation,

00:12:04.715 --> 00:12:07.820
the new countermeasures
that Twitter is developing,

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.751
is it being effective?

00:12:08.751 --> 00:12:11.680
- Yes, in terms of it has removed a lot

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.300
of the simple bot activity.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.440
But we're seeing different

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.000
kinds of manipulation instead

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.600
where we see more of
these anonymous accounts

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.120
that are pushing content.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.760
So these are more developed
inauthentic accounts

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.300
that are used for different

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.590
kinds of social media manipulation.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.610
But when it comes to Twitter's response

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.640
to these simple Twitter manipulation,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.953
that has been effective.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.810
That has gone down over
the past few years.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.490
- How do these fake people get around

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.525
those countermeasures
that Twitter's developing?

00:12:44.525 --> 00:12:46.110
- Loads of different ways

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.410
but when we talked to these people,

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.440
because we've interviewed people

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.320
that sell these things,

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.090
they'd say that when
social media platforms

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.850
put new regulation into
account, into effect,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.900
it takes them about two or three weeks

00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.120
to counter those new speed bumps

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:00.953
that they put in,

00:13:00.953 --> 00:13:01.900
if you wanna use that word.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.280
And they do that by being inventive,

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.810
simply by trial and error.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.530
If they put in a CAPTCHA service,

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.841
well, they do ways to break that.

00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:13.520
If they put geofencing on IP addresses

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.980
they use proxies, etc., etc..

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.600
So it's become more difficult

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.433
but we're seeing,

00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:23.350
so far we don't see any
limitation on the supply side.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.560
So you can buy fake activity

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.889
on Twitter for an example

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.413
within 15 minutes if you
have a PayPal account.

00:13:29.413 --> 00:13:32.040
Many of the people we have spoken to

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.900
that do these engineering,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.020
they are people that live
in developing countries

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.700
but also in developed countries.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.580
- So the people that buy
and sell these services

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.630
on the black market are
obviously intelligent

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.870
and they're there with intent.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:44.800
There's automated bots,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.630
there are actual humans.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.100
What is it they want
to do on the platform?

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.500
To try to figure this out let's go back

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.160
to talk to Renée DiResta.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.260
She's an expert

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.910
in understanding social
media manipulation.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.180
So my understanding is the game on Twitter

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.640
is to try to amplify inauthentic behavior

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.940
using a bot or an account
that you've taken over

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.773
or something like that,

00:14:06.773 --> 00:14:07.606
is that how the game works?

00:14:07.606 --> 00:14:09.110
- Yes, so what you wanna do

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:10.210
is you wanna get your message

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.690
to reach the greatest number of people.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.230
And so you'll have bot accounts

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.800
that just do it in an automated way,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.550
but Twitter's gotten
better at detecting those.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.820
So then you have people
who literally sit there

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.720
and operate the account
some percentage of the time.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.870
Sometimes it's an agency,

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.363
sometimes it's just a regular person.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.130
One of the main things
that Twitter's great

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.150
for though is there's
tons of journalists on it,

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.150
which means if you
wanna manipulate a story

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.370
out of the social ecosystem and get it

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.300
onto the nightly news,

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.890
Twitter's a great way to do that

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.430
if you wanna get it into a newspaper.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.390
'Cause once something
gets a sufficient amount

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.650
of attention on Twitter,

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.040
- Critical mass.
- yep, then the press

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.122
will pick it up.
- Clearly this is news,

00:14:44.122 --> 00:14:45.119
I should put it on my news

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:46.370
channel that I have.
- You got it.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.600
And it's hard because for a long time,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.170
especially through 2016 you would see

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.460
stuff would just trend,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.820
just show up in the trending algorithm.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.394
And then if the press wrote about it

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:57.070
it was giving it more attention.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.110
If they were debunking it

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.540
they were still giving it attention.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.930
And then if they didn't write about it

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.870
you'd have this next wave of accounts

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.690
speculating about why the mainstream media

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:05.750
was ignoring it?

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.980
So there was really no winning.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.080
The whole game was if
you could get something

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.860
to critical mass on
Twitter you could just gain

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.810
that attention economy
and get massive lift,

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.160
reach millions and millions of people.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.710
- Trying to get something
to trend in the news

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.360
is more than just trying to
make money on the platform.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.825
This is a malicious, clever thing.

00:15:24.825 --> 00:15:27.270
Sebastian said he is seeing those types

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.470
of services reflected
in the black markets,

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.920
something he calls meta manipulation.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.000
I understand everybody now thinks

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.361
about the Russian bots
and the 2016 election

00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:38.740
but I have to understand
that the countermeasures

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.818
have been developed and
people know about that now,

00:15:40.818 --> 00:15:43.310
so they're already moving on

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.500
to a different type of manipulation.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.700
What's going on now?

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.940
- And what we're seeing now is a lot

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.160
of focus on meta manipulation.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.730
So that means that you
inflate the view counts

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:55.990
to trick the algorithms

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.408
of different social media platforms

00:15:57.408 --> 00:16:01.020
to make your own content
trend on those platforms.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.370
So we've run experiments

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.020
where we've bought bot activity.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.853
When we do that,

00:16:04.853 --> 00:16:07.300
that attracts real viewers

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.800
because the platforms think
that they are trending.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.327
So this sort of meta manipulation,

00:16:11.327 --> 00:16:12.690
that's what we're seeing now.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.780
That's what many of these
resellers are promoting.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.480
- So this is alarming obviously

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.313
but there's something

00:16:18.313 --> 00:16:19.880
that's even more disturbing about this.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.960
These accounts are the low tier accounts.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.270
There's a higher tier account that exists.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.260
That one is more expensive to create,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.920
more expensive to operate
and is more devious.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.400
It's specifically tailored

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.370
to misrepresent to misrepresent

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.030
a specific group of people.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.350
Accounts like this may actually

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.337
have several thousand
actual human followers.

00:16:37.337 --> 00:16:39.810
- And you can actually buy almost any kind

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.340
of custom made account.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.930
If you want a Swedish
female who's been online

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.150
for 10 years that has several friends

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.300
with specific interests you can request

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.570
that from these vendors
that sell accounts.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.200
- Really, so you can tailor
the specific demographic

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.570
of the inauthentic account that you want

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.010
to use for manipulation?

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:58.843
- Sure.

00:16:58.843 --> 00:16:59.676
- If you're trying

00:16:59.676 --> 00:17:01.420
to attack the African American community

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.800
and create divisiveness

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.330
in the African American community

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.010
you can buy that kind of account online,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.090
or if you're trying

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.000
to attack a specific political group,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.833
you can do the same?

00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:12.670
- Yeah, it's exactly like that.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.300
- These specialized accounts
are hyper interesting

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.780
social media weapons.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:17.613
Think about it,

00:17:17.613 --> 00:17:18.750
they're like a Trojan Horse

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.480
because they can get you access to places

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.500
that you're not expecting.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.060
They're like a false flag operation

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.070
because they're
misrepresenting what they are

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:27.490
in order to blame
something on somebody else.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.950
And with these weapons you can perform

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.050
precision strikes because you can target

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.540
a very specific individual
on a very specific issue.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.420
- Twitter is also an incredible way

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.390
to reach influencers because celebrities

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.160
are all on there with
millions of followers,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.370
and if they retweet you your message

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.920
just hits millions of people
or to reach the press,

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.960
which is also on there.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.040
And so that's how you have,

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.440
if you get something trending on Twitter

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.550
reporters will pick it
up and then it winds

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.490
up on the front page of
The Times the next day.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.860
- So the idea is to
trick influential people

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.310
and then use those as a vehicle

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.700
to get this inauthentic
information out there?

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.912
- Yep, Twitter is a...

00:18:02.912 --> 00:18:03.880
- So if you have more followers you

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.630
have a higher standard,

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.360
you have to be even more
serious about what you tweet.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.193
- Absolutely, yeah.

00:18:09.193 --> 00:18:10.230
You've gotta be really careful.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.939
When you think about if
you retweet something

00:18:12.939 --> 00:18:16.940
that's wrong you have just pushed it out

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.387
to potentially hundreds
of thousands of people

00:18:19.387 --> 00:18:21.840
and they're not gonna
see you necessarily push

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.840
out the correction.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.810
- So when Twitter finds
some of the bad guys

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.740
they collect all the
data and then they'll do

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.070
one big data release so
you can pour through it

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.100
and see what's going on?

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.270
People in academia are studying this stuff

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.160
to try to develop AI methods
to detect these people

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.250
and counteract them.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.600
It's a cat and mouse game.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.220
One of the most interesting
thing that's happened

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.440
is congress released a
report with thousands

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.610
of the actual Twitter
account names on them.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.510
If you pour through this
data you'll figure out

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.180
that there's three basic categories.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.670
There's accounts on the left,

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.790
accounts on the right and
then there's this weird

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.430
local news category.

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.010
I think it would be helpful to explain

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.700
what an attack against
you would look like?

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.460
It's gonna come in the form of a retweet

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.293
from a friend.

00:19:00.293 --> 00:19:01.490
It's gonna be something funny

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.770
that you resonate with.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.710
There's a single moment
you need to be looking for

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.543
and this is the tell,

00:19:05.543 --> 00:19:07.650
because you're not going
to detect these accounts.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.020
Even the CEO of Twitter retweeted one

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.020
of these accounts when they're
tweeting all this stuff,

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.080
the feel good stuff.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.960
But the moment you're
looking for is a nudge,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.440
the nudge to think a negative thought

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.180
against another group of people.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.970
If you belong to a certain demographic set

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.641
or like a value system or belief system

00:19:25.641 --> 00:19:27.950
and you see someone saying something like,

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.675
oh well, they always think that,

00:19:30.675 --> 00:19:32.633
we don't do that,

00:19:32.633 --> 00:19:35.060
or something like that, that's it.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.540
That nudge to think
something against them,

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.100
that's what you're looking for.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.213
- With terrorism there's
a more clearly defined

00:19:44.213 --> 00:19:46.500
set of things that are bad

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.410
or there's a clearly defined organization.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.410
- 'Cause there's a literal

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:51.620
battlefield.
- There is, yeah.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.200
(lady laughs)
- And this is the battlefield

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.320
of the mind.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.153
- Right.
- This is

00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:56.420
a battlefield of the mind

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.090
where the enemy hides behind civilians.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.860
And the enemy has the added advantage

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.500
that when they are
revealed as being an enemy

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.530
you basically start to
distrust those around you,

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.340
which was one of their
goals to begin with.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.190
They're trying to get
you to not trust people

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.450
in your own community.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.315
It's very subtle but it's very complex.

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:18.650
- Right now there's a really strong fear

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.152
of false positives leading
to unfair take downs.

00:20:21.152 --> 00:20:22.940
I mean, you're a content creator, right.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.071
This is never a thing
that you wanna see happen

00:20:25.071 --> 00:20:27.140
and so the question becomes

00:20:28.391 --> 00:20:32.420
how do you send up a flair saying we think

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.370
that this account might be

00:20:35.893 --> 00:20:37.710
something that we should have a look at?

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.640
We think this account
might be inauthentic.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.125
We think this account might be foreign,

00:20:43.125 --> 00:20:44.032
pretending to be
- because the minute

00:20:44.032 --> 00:20:44.865
- something else.
- you have a

00:20:44.865 --> 00:20:46.050
false positive,

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:46.883
- The Internet explodes.

00:20:46.883 --> 00:20:50.420
- The Internet explodes
because Chubbywabs385

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.770
or whatever, surfing
engine 385 gets upset.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.340
If you rewind to what
I said at the beginning

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.120
of the video and think
about the suspension,

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.770
this yes, some of these are as a result

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.170
of management-making policy decisions

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.040
about how people are
interacting on the platform

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:02.873
and things like that.

00:21:02.873 --> 00:21:04.400
But there's this other category,

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.540
engineers are literally
taking out malicious accounts

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.093
at a rate of over 12 per second.

00:21:09.093 --> 00:21:11.670
Against an enemy that's
constantly adapting,

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:12.503
I can tell you,

00:21:12.503 --> 00:21:14.700
these tools they're
developing are not perfect

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.750
so it is not unreasonable to expect

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.460
that every once and a
while, unfortunately,

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.840
there's gonna be an
innocent bystander caught

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.150
in the crossfire.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.240
- The diversity of behaviors that we see

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.530
are more wild than you
can possibly imagine

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.750
and it's international,

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.260
it's different communities
of people on Twitter.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.650
I'll give you an example from last night.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.310
We have been working on developing

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.180
some new machine learning models

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.830
to help us identify potential groups

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.570
of accounts engaged in
political manipulation.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.730
- Okay, it's an election year.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:45.563
Got it.
- Yeah.

00:21:45.563 --> 00:21:47.110
- Or it's election season starting.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.953
- It's always, it's an election somewhere,

00:21:48.953 --> 00:21:50.720
all the time, forever.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.880
So this is obviously a big priority for us

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.560
and we were looking at some of the output

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.330
of this model and we identified
this group of accounts

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.610
that looked like they were impersonating

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.620
local police departments
and mayors of towns.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.710
- Holy crap.
- And I was looking

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:06.670
at them and I'm like,

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:07.920
what is happening here?

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.630
There's like 50 of these accounts.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.660
This is like clear manipulation.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.265
This was a problem.

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:15.430
And then I saw that one of the mayors

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.750
was tweeting about being in a K hole

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.220
and I'm like hang on a second,

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.600
why is this mayor on ketamine and talking

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.220
about that on Twitter?

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.940
And then I realized that
all of these accounts

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.900
were operated by somebody
who was role playing

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.160
as characters from the Grand
Theft Auto video games.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.290
All of the cities that they were operating

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.930
these accounts from were
places where a GTA game

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.370
has been set and they
built up this elaborate

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.160
fantasy role playing
community with accounts

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.997
on Twitter that were talking to each other

00:22:44.997 --> 00:22:48.230
as if they were in the GTA Universe.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:49.630
- Something negative happens,

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.240
you make a decision and you take

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.300
down Aunt Suzie's gymnastics
class or whatever.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.500
- Sorry, Aunt Suzie.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.490
- You take that down
because it gets rolled up

00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:59.410
in some of these attempts

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.620
to take down legitimate manipulators,

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.988
so they hate you because
you're big, corporate Twitter.

00:23:04.988 --> 00:23:07.610
And at that point in time you,

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.250
an engineer, sitting there saying,

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.853
I just wanna help people.

00:23:11.815 --> 00:23:13.880
That's hard, how do you deal with that?

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.880
Because people love to hate you

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.350
and you are trying to help them,

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.140
how do you deal with that?

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.793
How do you sleep with that?

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.140
- We treat all those moments of outrage

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.650
as learning opportunities.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.592
I think when people are mad
at a company like Twitter,

00:23:29.592 --> 00:23:31.020
and this is hard,

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.090
I spent my first couple
of years at Twitter

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.530
struggling with how angry people are

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.950
if you get it wrong
and how to manage that?

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.810
But ultimately, I think the majority

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.180
of them are mad because
they want us to be better

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.370
and they want Twitter to be a community

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.460
where they can really
participate and engage

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.790
and get informed and they want it

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.410
to be the best platform it can be.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.240
And so as a company I
think we take a mindset

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.180
of wanting to learn from that,

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.540
to be humble about it,

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.480
to understand where we can do better

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.790
and if we take down Aunt
Suzie's gymnastics class

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.416
because something about
it seemed like spam,

00:24:09.416 --> 00:24:11.350
we're gonna really dissect that moment

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:14.000
and try and figure out what
tripped this algorithm?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.670
What caused us to do that?

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:16.730
Do we think that's right?

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.780
And this is a 1% error
rate that we think is just

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.440
in the interest of everyone on Twitter.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.760
- It's millions of people.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.370
- Right, the challenge of
scale is 1% of 300 million

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:28.462
is a lot.

00:24:28.462 --> 00:24:32.200
So we're always trying
to balance those things.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.270
- Speaking of balance,

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.980
if you watch this video
and your whole takeaway is,

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.660
we'll, I'm just not gonna trust anybody

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:38.880
on the Internet,

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.342
then there's an argument to be made

00:24:40.342 --> 00:24:43.330
that I just played into the enemy's hand

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.810
by making this video.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.300
If they hide behind civilians

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.380
and then when we figure it out the result

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.290
is to not trust anybody around you,

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:51.250
that is not good.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.390
These are our neighbors.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.010
That is next level psychological warfare

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.090
that they're hitting us with.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.530
I'm gonna podcast and my cohost Matt and I

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.720
have this phrase that we
use a lot, political grace.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.331
If the point of these
attacks is to divide us

00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:09.340
then proactive, intentional
unity has the potential

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.020
to be an effective countermeasure

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.690
on the personal level.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:14.440
Maybe we should just not assume the worst

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.273
of each other.

00:25:15.273 --> 00:25:16.880
And that extends to the people

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.880
that are developing these
countermeasures at Twitter.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.870
Their job is to perfectly
protect a platform

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.609
and never make a single mistake.

00:25:23.609 --> 00:25:28.250
And frankly, it's an
impossible job that never ends.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.600
Do you feel like in some
cases you're over matched?

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.160
- I think that we always try to assume

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.360
that we are not as advanced as the people

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.610
who are trying to attack us,

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.810
because assuming otherwise
basically puts you

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.962
in a position where it's
easy to develop blind spots.

00:25:42.962 --> 00:25:45.060
If we are always assuming that this

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.970
is an arms race and that we should never

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.472
be patting ourselves on the back going,

00:25:50.472 --> 00:25:52.260
we got all the countermeasures in place,

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.790
we're always going to
assume that it's evolving,

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.530
that it's evolving
quickly and that we have

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.363
to stay on top of it.

00:25:58.363 --> 00:25:59.380
And that's really the only way

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.213
you can think about it.

00:26:00.213 --> 00:26:01.046
(test tone)
- So in this

00:26:01.046 --> 00:26:01.917
episode we talked about Twitter

00:26:01.917 --> 00:26:04.910
and the specific technical
engineering countermeasures

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.520
they use to protect the platform.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.010
Sometimes when people talk about a sponsor

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.750
at the end of the video
they just give you a URL

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:11.830
and tell you to go support,

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.350
in this case SmarterEveryDay,

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.800
but thought it would be more fun

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.320
to tell you the specific
technical engineering details

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.110
about how ExpressVPN protects your data?

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.430
When you go to a site on the Internet

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.870
you leave a trail of
metadata about yourself

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:26.550
for your ISP to collect.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.750
I explained in the last
video that when I connect

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.890
to the ExpressVPN server with one click,

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:31.723
just like this,

00:26:31.723 --> 00:26:33.300
now my data is protected.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.440
Now, I read your comments
in the last video

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.340
and a lot of you said, well,

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.490
if all of my data is going to the server

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.390
doesn't that mean they have my data there?

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.340
Here's the thing, they don't.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.930
They don't log any of your traffic

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.350
and they don't keep any of your data

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.290
and they way they do it is genius.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:48.730
This is a Solid State Hard Drive.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.517
Most laptops and
computers today have these

00:26:50.517 --> 00:26:53.040
and you can read and
write to these things.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.170
It's a form of non-volatile memory.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.300
This is called RAM.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.120
It's different, RAM memory is volatile.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.178
If you ever lose power while using RAM

00:27:01.178 --> 00:27:02.660
all the data is lost.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.100
ExpressVPN has specifically engineered

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.760
their VPN software to run entirely in RAM

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.600
on their servers.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.490
That is genius.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.400
It's such a simple, elegant design.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.780
They cannot keep logs of your data

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.810
because it all goes away
after you disconnect.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.240
They can't mishandle your information

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.380
because it doesn't exist.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.420
No one can hack into the
system and get your data,

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.360
it's not there.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.390
And at this point you're
probably thinking,

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:23.990
well, how do you know this Destin?

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:25.210
They're not saying this.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.280
A foreign government is.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.500
A foreign government tried to seize

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.640
an ExpressVPN server in 2017
and extract data from it

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.180
and their investigation failed.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.510
It yielded no data.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.930
I personally get excited every time

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.620
there's a technological solution

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.180
to giving me more personal liberty.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.140
If you want to take your
online data seriously today

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.710
you can do that by going
to ExpressVPN.com/smarter.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:47.543
If you get 12 months,

00:27:47.543 --> 00:27:48.990
you get an additional 3 months for free

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.010
and there's a 30 day money back guarantee.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.420
It is an intelligent
way to encrypt your data

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.680
and protect yourself online.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.690
So big thanks to ExpressVPN
for helping us make

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.350
this social media manipulation series.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.870
This is the second video.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:00.703
We've done YouTube,

00:28:00.703 --> 00:28:02.930
this is Twitter and of
course we're gonna do

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:03.763
Facebook after this.

00:28:03.763 --> 00:28:05.470
I'm thinking about expanding it to Reddit,

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:06.660
what do you think about that?

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.870
Anyway, big thanks to everybody.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.010
I noticed on the last
video you were commenting

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:10.843
on the video,

00:28:10.843 --> 00:28:12.620
specifically to boost it on the algorithm,

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:13.670
that means you get it.

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:14.850
Thank you so much.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.300
Also, I'm gonna do something weird.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.710
I've never done this on SmarterEveryDay

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:19.940
but I'm gonna tell you
about my Twitter account.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.630
I normally don't talk
about my Twitter account

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:22.463
but come on,

00:28:22.463 --> 00:28:24.620
I mean, if there's ever
a video to tell you

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.940
about my Twitter account this is it.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.051
So I think if I align this
neon head up right there

00:28:30.051 --> 00:28:31.570
you should be able to click on it

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.040
and go to a page where I've set up

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.040
all my Twitter accounts.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.460
I've got @smartereveryday,

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.980
which is the channel, of course.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.640
We got @destinsandlin and a couple

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.180
of other surprise ones I
don't normally talk about.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.196
So there you go,

00:28:42.196 --> 00:28:43.667
you can go click on the Twitter stuff.

00:28:43.667 --> 00:28:46.300
I hope this video earned
your subscription.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.970
This is a lot of work,

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:48.980
that's an understatement

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.990
so I hope you enjoyed this content.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:52.490
Please feel free to share it.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.650
I'm Destin, you're
getting smarter every day.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.363
- Have a good one, bye.
