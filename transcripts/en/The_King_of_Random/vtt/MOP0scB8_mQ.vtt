Hey, guys! Welcome back, I'm Nate.

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.439
Thank you for joining me today on the King of Random

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.740
Recently we posted a video showing our new mini solar scorcher. In that video

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.250
there are a few ideas that several people asked to see us do. So today

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.980
we're gonna try out five of those ideas

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.420
and see how they turn out. Here are the five experiments

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.209
we'll be trying today, because so many of you asked for them!

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.609
First we'll try focusing the giant solar scorcher

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:25.049
through the mini solar scorcher to see how that affects the shape of the beam the power and the heat

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.869
that it puts out. Several of you wanted to see if the

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.348
mini solar store could melt metal the same way the giant solar scorcher did.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.449
We're gonna try a few different types of metal and see how it performs.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.919
Next lots of you wanted to know if the mini solar scorcher got hot enough to ignite thermite

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.749
We tried lighting thermite with the big solar scorcher, and it ignited almost immediately, which was pretty cool.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.119
So we'll see if the small version can ignite it and how fast it does in comparison to the giant one. Next several of you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.739
wanted to see if we could cook food with the mini solar scorcher so we have a couple of recipes plans that should be just

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.269
the right size! And lastly, several of you for whatever reason wanted us to destroy the little solar scorcher using the giant solar scorcher,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.600
so we're gonna do that as well.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.739
Let's take this outside, set up the mega solar scorcher,

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.018
and let's get started. You all remember the mega solar scorcher;

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.710
and now we have our mini solar scorcher as well. Before we line them up with each other

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.529
let's try and take a look at the difference between their focal points.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.500
I have this baby powder, which I'll spray into the air to try and light up the focal point of the mega solar scorcher.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.100
There you have it.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.750
Right there

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.879
See if we can-- it's a little bit windy out here today, which is not making it easier.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.720
But up here the light is widely dispersed and as you get down here. It gets brighter and more focused.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.749
So it looks like our focal point here

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.329
Is right about there.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.119
And I'm not gonna put my finger in it because it would burn. Even just getting

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.868
near the focal point-- like my finger is very warm right here. Just the excess radiating heat

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.350
Now let's see how it looks on the miniature solar scorcher.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:03.029
Oh, beautiful! You can see that really well because this is a smaller lens and it's closer to the focal point you get a lot more

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.689
focus out of it. You can really see how it comes down in a cone

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:13.169
hits in the middle and then spreads out in a cone again. Now our goal is to set up the miniature solar scorcher in the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.370
focusing path of the mega solar scorcher.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.779
We don't want to put it where it's focused because I'm pretty sure that would just melt the lens very quickly

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.900
We're going to try and line it up so that the focal point of the mega solar scorcher is the same size as the lens

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900
on the mini solar scorcher.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.200
Alright that looks like it's about the right spot,

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.080
still projecting a little bit onto the wood of the solar scorcher, but it's not bad.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.260
Woah-p!

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.760
Well I can definitely light it through one screen and then through the next screen.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.269
I now have a little bit better of an idea of how far down

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.070
I put the miniature solar scorcher.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.079
So I'm gonna try and lower it into place until I can see that the focal point is right on the edges of the wooden

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.359
frame then. I'm gonna try spraying the baby powder underneath it so we can try and capture what the focus light is doing.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.530
There!

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.760
You see it's darker around the edges of the frame warm in the center-- see if we can get some baby powder spraying.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.490
It's a narrower, shorter focus usually the miniature solar scorcher focuses maybe eight inches away from the lens and now it's focusing

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.149
barely four. It's cut the distance probably in half.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.130
I also don't think that it's quite as clean of a focus as when it's just filtering sunlight.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.670
I'm going to try and put this stick right into the focal point of our mega solar scorcher.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.620
Yep. Very, very hot lights pretty much instantly.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.420
Lined it, up there we go.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:53.300
Now with that lined up, let's try and put our stick in that focal point. Well, it is clearly hot. It's still igniting very fast;

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.630
but, I would say it is taking a little bit longer to light on fire.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.080
than with the big solar scorcher by itself. So the sunlight is coming in through the mega solar scorcher,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.899
focusing onto the miniature solar scorcher, and then being focused again. A lot of people were hoping that you would get sort of a

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.350
you would get sort of a super, extra, hot heat.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.679
But let's talk about why that might not be the case.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.269
The fernell lens that makes up the mega solar scorcher is taking all of the sunlight

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.289
over a giant area about two feet wide by four feet long

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.659
and it's condensing that much sunlight down into a single point. That gets really, really hot.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.650
There's a lot of heat coming out of the Sun.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.700
When I try and focus all of that light through the miniature solar scorcher

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.279
it doesn't really get any more intense because there's no

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:43.869
additional sunlight coming through the miniature solar scorcher. All of the sunlight that would have hit the miniature solar scorcher is being intercepted by the

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.160
mega solar scorcher. All that really happens is I lose a little bit of sunlight from the

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.429
distortion on the lens on the mega solar scorcher. There's also the fact that any light coming from the Sun is traveling in almost a

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.739
perfectly straight line between the Sun and the mega solar scorcher. At that point, it goes in an extreme angle

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.650
And so it's already highly angled going into the miniature solar scorcher instead of all of the light coming in one direction

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.919
we have light coming in sort of a cone shape from all directions. As a result instead of the light coming through mostly straight and

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.819
focusing about eight inches away; it's coming through at an angle and focusing even closer

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.999
I think that makes it harder for it to get a nice pinpoint of light.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.729
The next thing we're gonna, try is melting metal.

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.979
I have a few different types of metal and we'll try them all. I should also note that today is not quite as warm and

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.959
sunny as some other days that we've tested melting metal with the mega solar scorcher. So your results may vary.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.430
First up is a penny.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.370
Which is almost entirely made of zinc at least this one from

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.320
1984 is. I've chosen a fairly, dirty old one because it won't reflect as much light.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.300
Have some smoke, I think the penny might be just transferring heat into the board below it.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.859
Look the copper is bubbling like peeling away.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.439
Holy cow! I think it's actually melting it. Look at that. It's kind of collapsing in places. It's

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.249
bulging up in the middle right where it's focused.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:10.810
I'll be honest,

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.540
I did not think the mini solar scorcher was gonna have enough power to do anything to a penny, but slowly, but surely

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.140
It is destroying it.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.280
Look down at the base of the penny where the light isn't quite as focused it's still hot enough that it's starting to

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.280
bulge. I think the zinc

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.980
inside the copper might be melting. Like, I think the heat is enough to melt the zinc

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.380
But not the copper and so it's all pooling down at the bottom of the penny.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.720
I've got my board on a little bit of a slant, and so I think there's liquid zinc

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.099
inside there. Aww-- that's insane. I didn't think this was gonna work at all.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:53.049
I love when I'm wrong! You get the coolest experiment results when you're wrong all right. Let's see how that has turned out-- holy cow.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.469
Alright, I'm gonna. Spray some water on this. It should be nice and hot.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.030
Yeah all the water right around it just immediately evaporates.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.500
Whoa

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.500
Wow, that is one

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.310
Destroyed penny. That is so cool. I did not think the mini solar scorcher could do that!

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.840
Look at the back of this thing.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.460
Let's see what's next. This is lead fishing weights. Lead has a pretty low melting temperature

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.609
So I'm fairly optimistic that we can at least get these to soften up.

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:37.179
That is starting to melt yep

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.019
Okay that took all of like five seconds.

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:53.579
And yep, and it's liquid and there's a little hole in the bottom of this pot, and it just fell right down through the hole

00:07:54.279 --> 00:08:01.229
Under the brick below, so lead melts extremely fast with the solar scorcher. Well one melted pretty quick;

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.240
let's see what we can do with six!

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.840
Whose instructional integrity there we go, that's collapsed.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.800
A little shake every few seconds to try and get it to puddle more.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:33.340
There you have it I would say that the solar scorcher absolutely can melt lead. That melted easily in fact.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.489
All right, I've got one more metal I want to try. This is a block of pewter

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.419
I'm gonna see how the solar scorcher does with it. I'm not gonna try and melt the whole block

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.889
I'm just hoping that it will melt a little bit in the center it might dissipate the heat too fast

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.050
So it won't do that, but let's give it a try.

00:08:56.579 --> 00:09:01.699
Doesn't even feel warm. I can't get a spot of the block to melt and I think it's because it's just dissipating the heat

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:07.309
Too quickly into the rest of the brick so what I'm gonna try doing is slicing off a small bit of our pewter block

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.489
Putting it on the terracotta pot and then trying to melt that instead.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.680
Oh! Immediately something starts happening

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.040
Yep, melting... melting... melting.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.860
It all just kind of shriveled up.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.959
Now that actually fused onto the terracotta pot a little bit. That's interesting.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.719
Many people wanted to know if the miniature solar scorcher could light off thermite as easily as the mega solar scorcher.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.310
So I've mixed up a small batch of thermite

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.070
I'm gonna pour it into these terracotta pots and try and light it.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.279
I am a little nervous that this could just go off really suddenly

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:44.148
So I'm just gonna try and focus it and then as soon as I see anything. I'm kind of gonna

00:09:44.148 --> 00:09:46.148
just jump out of the way.

00:09:46.148 --> 00:09:48.140
Here we go!

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.240
Well that is just neat!

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.760
Gonna kick it over.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.000
I think they're all fused together with thermite, oh, there's one. I think that's it

00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:20.298
I think it's just a puddle of iron at the bottom of that. Now up next several

00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:23.179
of you wanted to see us try and cook with the mini solar scorcher.

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:26.779
So we've got some mini recipes that we're gonna cook today. Now first up

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:29.058
We have a hot dog, but this is a mini solar scorcher

00:10:29.059 --> 00:10:31.668
So a whole hot dog seems like it might be a little too much.

00:10:31.669 --> 00:10:35.959
So instead we're gonna go with one little slice. Let's get a nice cross-section piece here.

00:10:36.749 --> 00:10:38.069
There we go.

00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:39.689
Little slice of hot dog.

00:10:39.689 --> 00:10:42.738
I'm going to try and focus the solar scorcher down on to it.

00:10:42.739 --> 00:10:48.619
Not all the way because that would just burn it, but just until the focal point is the size of the hot dog slice itself

00:10:49.739 --> 00:10:54.379
There is some steam rising off of it. Oh, and it's starting to get a little bit up

00:10:54.379 --> 00:10:59.298
Oh too much! Too much!! Too much heat. Now that spot is burned

00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:04.128
It's black and it absorbs a lot more of the heat. It's sort of a-- an ongoing

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:07.039
self-sustaining problem.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.960
Oh-- another burn spot

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.240
Well, I think that side is pretty well done as well.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.500
That's actually fairly warm. So that's a good sign that it's cooked all the way through

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.760
Serve with one potato chip.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:40.349
You can really taste the sunshine. For our next recipe nacho! Just one. We've got one corn chip here

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:49.530
Add some cheese. Let's see if we can melt our cheese with our lens. All right now. Let's melt some cheese

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.850
Oh, no!

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.409
Almost lit my chip on fire had some good, melty cheese!

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:04.379
I think I'll call them sunlight nachos!

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.169
Nacho, just nacho. There ya go.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:17.459
It's a good nacho. I wonder if the mega solar scorcher could make a whole plate at once. Let's find out

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.899
That works considerably better, I'm just moving the focal point

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.459
Around at different unmelted bits of cheese, and that melts them pretty fast.

00:12:36.579 --> 00:12:39.089
Of course it also almost lights the chips on fire.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.379
There ya go, that's some good melty, stringy cheese right there.

00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:50.189
That's pretty good.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:55.949
If you've ever made nachos in the microwave. It makes your chips kind of chewy. This doesn't-- makes crunchier if anything.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:59.369
Well, one more thing I have to try.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.850
I call these flaming hot nachos

00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:15.899
Anyone want a bite? it's a little much for me. I can't handle hot food very well.

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:20.578
Now there is one more thing that a few of you wanted to see and that was me burning the small solar scorcher

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.980
with the mega solar scorcher.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.589
All right! That's about where I had it focused when I was trying to focus one through the other

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.170
Let's take it down a little more

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:41.279
It's melting! It's burning! Mmm! *Sarcastic tone* I love that burning plastic smell, that's the best!

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:53.969
Oh man don't burn these lenses smells awful. Well, the frame is made of wood. I bet it lights on fire really nice

00:13:55.029 --> 00:13:58.289
It does! It does light on fire very easily!

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.290
How not surprising!

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.720
Perfect!

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:19.399
Well there you have it! We have tried focusing the mega solar scorcher through the mini solar scorcher

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.780
We successfully melted a few different types of metal with our mini solar scorcher.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.070
We are able to ignite thermite with our mini solar scorcher and cook some delicious food.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.550
We had a single serving of hot dog. And one nacho

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.990
And then we use the mega sole torture to completely destroy one of the mini solar scorchers.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.580
Rest in pieces.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.889
I really hope you've enjoyed seeing these projects today and learning some new things that you can do with your mini solar scorcher

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.980
Thanks for joining us for this video today, and we'll see you in the next one talk to you then!

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:52.280
Bleh, solar scorcher is tough to say when you try and say it a hundred times

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.680
