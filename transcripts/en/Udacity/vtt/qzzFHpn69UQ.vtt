So to practice the definition of functional properties, here's our next quiz.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.480
I have here five potential functional properties and actually, I would like you to tell me

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.380
which of these are functional properties and which of these are not.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.420
The possibilities are a program is a computer program, a program always returns 1,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.640
a program solves vertex cover, a program is a computer virus, and a program requires O(n) time.

00:00:23.640 --> 99:59:59.000
So which of these are functional properties.
