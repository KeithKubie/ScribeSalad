00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.190
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.340
How is everyone doing?

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.180
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.770
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR:
That is amazing,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.450
because usually I have to tell
people, hello good morning.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.080
This, I love the energy.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.570
So thank you all for coming.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.370
I feel totally
excited and humbled

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.940
to stand in front of a
room full of amazing women.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.050
How often does it happen
in our industry, isn't it?

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.970
So before we get started, can we
give one more round of applause

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.216
for Women Techmakers,
the amazing organization

00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:39.424
that has brought us together.

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:45.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.330
Thank you.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.820
Today I want to talk
about building bridges.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.190
Building bridges has shaped
me both professionally

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.570
and personally.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.460
And I want to share
with you my journey

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.130
from a little
rural town in India

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.010
to where I stand here today.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.600
If each one of us takes a
little moment to reflect,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.710
I'm sure we can all find that
moment in time that shaped us.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.650
Can you take a
moment to do that?

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.410
Sometime very early on that had
made a great impression on you.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.440
For me, it was my
father walking back

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.610
from an academic conference
with a mechanical set.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.600
My dad taught civil
engineering for 35 years,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.240
and his specialty
was soil mechanics.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.390
An expert in his field,
he was constantly

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.040
asked to come in to test the
viability of big structures

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.820
that were being built
all around us in India.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.560
And so I grew up watching
him with huge plans,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.290
looking at structures, mostly
bridges that looked big

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.800
and magnificent.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.610
So holding this
mechanical set that I

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.160
could build my own bridges
seemed like the best gift

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.200
in the whole world.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.850
Little did I
realize at that time

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.060
that the very act of a dad
giving a six-year-old daughter

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.060
a mechanical set was
actually remarkable,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.030
not just for the
little town in India,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.730
but anywhere in the world.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.490
And just like that, that moment
told me that I could be anyone

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.170
I wanted to be.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.580
I could build amazing
things, dream big dreams,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.749
solve big problems.

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:51.624
Does that make sense?

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.810
But looking back, I realize
that it was not just

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.240
physical bridges that
shaped who I was.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.220
My grandfather fought
for Indian independence.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.030
He espoused the values of
human rights, gender equality,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.190
and women's education
very, very strongly.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.620
I never met him.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.930
He passed away
before I was born.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.660
But the home that I was
in embodied his values.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.910
All around me, I saw
adults doing things

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.430
that needed to get
done, rather than

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.570
what was defined by gender.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.280
My aunts fixed electrical
appliances, my dad sewed

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.755
buttons, and everybody played
a mean game of cricket.

00:03:39.755 --> 00:03:41.500
Do you know what cricket is?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.420
Yeah, and they were competitive.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.410
No my aunts were like
not any pushovers.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.290
They played a mean
game of cricket.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.380
We had intense debates and
discussions on everything

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.650
from social topics to politics.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.730
My parents also build bridges.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.480
In our home were
people from all walks

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.140
of life, all faiths,
every economic strata,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.770
coming in and participating.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.130
I thought it was completely
normal for my very spiritual

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.930
mom to have a close
friend who was an atheist.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.700
I thought it was completely
normal for my mom

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.560
to spend less time in
the kitchen and more time

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.990
reading and telling me
that I should do the same.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.100
But all around me,
there were girl skills

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.150
that were being taught.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.900
I thought it was completely
normal for my aunts

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.570
to pursue professional careers.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.840
All around me, stereotypes
were being broken.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.210
I saw adults taking
responsibility

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.840
for what needed to get
done, and more importantly,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.870
is really exhibiting
true empathy.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.240
So let's take a moment
to ask this question.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.600
Whose world view are
we shaping around us?

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.130
Who's looking at us today?

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.610
Is it a little girl
or boy in your life

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.130
that is looking to
you for inspiration?

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:26.580
And are we exhibiting the
amazingness that's inside us,

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.480
breaking the stereotypes that
tells girls they cannot do

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.900
things, breaking the stereotypes
that tells boys that doing

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.420
certain things is girly.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.380
What is our role?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:50.190
Take a moment to think about
the people around you that

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.370
could do with a little bit of
inspiration, for whom you could

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.470
build a bridge from what is
being defined on the outside

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.203
to a better reality.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.070
Now this is not all
about altruistic,

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.900
let's go save the world.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.570
What I discovered is
that building bridges

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.320
and this bridging mindset gives
you negotiating superpowers.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.210
How many of you
think that you're

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.710
better at negotiating
for others than yourself?

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.080
Yeah, me too, right?

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.660
Why is that?

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.990
Why is that?

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.990
There you are, passionately
negotiating for your team,

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.120
asking somebody to give
your employee a raise,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.530
even maybe negotiating
for a sibling

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.290
to be able to go do something
but not for yourself.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.860
Why is that?

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.370
And how can we tap
into our ability

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.550
to negotiate for
others for ourselves?

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.730
I discovered that
by just sheer chance

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.020
when I was a junior in college.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.960
So when I was a
junior in college,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.230
I was introduced to computers,
and the very act of coding

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.170
opened up my world.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.700
I fell in love.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.090
Yes, I'm a geek.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.820
I totally fell in love with
the act of writing code,

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.030
so I was super
excited when I heard

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.240
that a local businessman
in my little town

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.260
was planning to start a
computer training institute.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.490
I was convinced that
computing would open up

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.230
amazing opportunities
for the kids in my town,

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.960
that it would open up my town
to new and amazing businesses

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.600
or new ways of thinking about
how to solve local problems.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.860
So convinced that I set up
time to go meet this person

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.540
and talk to him about using
computing to change the town,

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.410
to teach college students, to
create new jobs, et cetera.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.000
And for whatever reason,
he said yeah, come join me.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:09.450
I was so focused on telling
why it is good for others

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:15.500
that I never paused to think
about my lack of skills

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.910
or my lack of experience or
do I know all these things,

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.070
everything that holds
us back typically

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.960
when you are negotiating
for yourself.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.170
So let me challenge you now.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.540
What is the big
thing that you have

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.740
that you are trying
to go ask next week,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.460
next month in your jobs?

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.320
Can we rephrase it?

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.919
Can we reframe it?

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.150
Can you reframe it in a way
that you are thinking about it

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.240
as a benefit to the business,
benefit to your team,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.600
benefit to someone else.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.255
Can you retell that story?

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.190
Something to think about.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.220
Now fast forward.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.420
A couple months after I
join, the senior person

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:12.905
on that institute left and I
found myself running the place.

00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:13.840
I know.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.480
You get thrown into
things, isn't it?

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.700
And so, all of a sudden, I was
thinking not just about coding

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.280
but about marketing
the courseware,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.700
figuring out target segment,
understanding cash flows.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.250
And suddenly, bridges
were being built

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:34.280
between tech and applications,
tech and business.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.070
Figuring out how not only about
knowing what your product is

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.320
but how to make it
a feasible business.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.530
It also introduced
me to my husband.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.070
Vivek walked into the
institute to learn coding,

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.284
and we got into a very
big technical argument.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.400
And then I learned that
within three months,

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.620
he was going to go to the
US for further studies.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.480
And all of a sudden
just then and there,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.430
I had to ask myself,
what do I do.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.550
What do I do?

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:14.413
How does one compute this
risk-reward situation?

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.030
How does one do this?

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.540
How do you leave the comfort
of a little town where you are

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.456
sort of like a little big fish,
you're running this institute,

00:10:25.456 --> 00:10:26.580
you're getting the strokes.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.765
On a whim that this guy is
annoying and intriguing.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.300
Yeah, what do you do?

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.420
What do you do?

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.900
I decided I'll use what
I learned in coding

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.750
and create a pilot.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.400
So I applied for an exchange
program and came to the US

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.350
for a four-week exchange with
the Rotary International.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.970
I said, OK let me go to the US.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.600
Let's see what the
country is like.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.090
Let's see what's going on.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:03.280
Let's see if the boy still is
interesting, and then decide.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.530
And so I landed in the United
States in the summer of '92.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.530
It was beautiful
on the East Coast.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.240
They say April showers give
May flowers or whatever?

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.780
It was abloom.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.380
It was gorgeous.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.360
Each week, I spent with
a different host family,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.300
and their homes were gorgeous.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.130
They had white picket fences.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.180
They came in fancy
cars to pick me up.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.290
I was like, wow, this is grand.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.870
I could do this.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.120
The boy was still
interesting, so I

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.060
said OK, let me figure
out how to come here.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:38.860
Small problem.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.790
I had no money, right?

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.130
So I met a couple of professors,
pitched them the fact

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.960
that I've been teaching
coding, maybe I

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.880
can get an assistantship,
and they said OK.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.260
One of them thought he
could sort of give me

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.370
an assistantship.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.270
So armed with a letter that
I would get an assistantship,

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.150
I go back to India, six
months of getting paperwork,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.610
get to the consulate,
visa, et cetera.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.618
I land in the Blizzard of '93.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:12.030
No fancy cars to pick me up.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.740
No sunshine and blooms.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.120
I had never seen a tree with
no leaves that was not dead.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.650
I had never seen snow.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.062
And there I was
with this passion

00:12:24.062 --> 00:12:25.770
that I was going to
learn more computing,

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.645
teach more computing.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.990
I realized that my pilot
design was completely flawed.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.130
Not only did I have no
skills to figure out

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:43.210
how to live in this country
that was gray and white,

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.922
I had no skills even
to take care of myself.

00:12:45.922 --> 00:12:46.880
You have to understand.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.750
I grew up in an extended family.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.660
Everything was taken care of.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.280
Everything was taken care of.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.640
I didn't know how to cook.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.790
I thought clothes got
clean by themselves.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.110
I mean, bathrooms, ooh
do I have to clean that?

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.890
Right?

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.480
But I also realized
that I did not

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.960
have the skills to navigate.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.520
I did not have the
skills to navigate.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.860
I didn't know how to
ask, how to figure out.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:26.220
And so I took the time to really
think about what are the places

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.170
that I really need to focus on.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.460
And that experience I'm
distilling into three points.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.544
One, every new world,
and this doesn't matter.

00:13:35.544 --> 00:13:37.710
You don't have to go 10,000
miles to another country

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.210
to do this.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.190
It could be just a new job.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:48.090
Every new environment has
a way people communicate.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:53.230
You need to learn that
underwritten rules

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.840
of communications.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.230
Google is very data centric.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.110
If you don't have data to
back it up, it doesn't work.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.700
Make sense?

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.810
That's number one.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.270
So I learned that how I was
saying and some of my jokes

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.640
were falling flat, because
nobody understood it.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.560
So I joined Toastmasters.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.830
I joined Toastmasters
and really worked

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.530
on being able to speak,
speak up, speak up

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.950
with very little notice.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.470
Number two.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.540
You really need a guide.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.460
For me, thankfully, it was
the assistant of my professor

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.700
who was giving me
this assistanceship.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.360
She coached me about how
to get basic stuff done.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.390
And that was number two.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.140
Find a guide.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.980
Find somebody who
knows the situation.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.760
And number three.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.770
You need to have fun.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.240
It's amazing how much
when we're overwhelmed

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.790
we put our heads down
thinking it's problem solving.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.410
Find friends.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.690
Find something that
gets your head up,

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:02.360
shows you all the wonderful
things that's inside of you.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.380
These skills have
helped me make it

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.240
through countless transitions
from a student to a software

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.600
engineer, from a
software engineer

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.266
over to getting an
MBA, from an MBA

00:15:12.266 --> 00:15:13.640
to going into
product management,

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.910
from product management
to where I am today.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.740
Today, as Kurishma
pointed out, I

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.050
head a team that works with app
and game developers globally.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.410
Building bridges across
technologies and cultures,

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.030
helping people achieve their
dreams on an amazing platform

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.970
called Android through
a distribution mechanism

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.920
called Google Play.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.560
And every day, I'm amazed
by the immense creativity

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.570
and humbled by the
opportunity to tap into it.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.430
So standing in
front of you, I am

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.340
as excited as when
I was a six-year-old

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.770
with the mechanical set.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.560
Then, I was building
make-believe bridges,

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.040
but today, looking
at all of you,

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.870
I know we can build bridges
that will defy gravity,

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:11.060
that will defy rules, that will
defy things that people have

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.540
told us we cannot do.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.820
So I have one challenge for you.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:21.610
Before you leave here, I would
like you to take the time

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.430
to do three things.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.190
One, write down
something that you want

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.020
to accomplish in the near term.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.490
And figure out what bridges
you need to build to get there.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.520
Do you know the rules
of communication?

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.130
Do you have a guide?

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.490
Do you have somebody
who can show you

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.150
a different perspective?

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.920
Number two.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.670
Look around you and
find at least one person

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.210
you have never met and
truly get to know them

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.840
before you leave here today.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.580
Most of our bridge
building is finding

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.380
the next node in your network.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.260
And number three,
be a little bit more

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.500
aware about the
people around you

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.560
who are looking at
you for inspiration.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.869
I know there are days, and
I go through this every day,

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.859
when you feel oh my
god, I'm overwhelmed.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.440
There's so much to do.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.579
But the very fact
that you are here,

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:28.420
you are light years ahead
of most people out there.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.440
You're amazing.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.170
You're a role model.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.280
You're an inspiration.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.870
You're a bridge to a lot of
people to a better tomorrow.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:38.460
Thank you.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.010
[APPLAUSE]
