before so this was beginning of computer

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240
before so this was beginning of computer
 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.589
before so this was beginning of computer
science robotics but also Carnegie

Mellon was a very strong in polymer

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140
Mellon was a very strong in polymer

science so Paul flurry Nobel laureate

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110
science so Paul flurry Nobel laureate
 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.659
science so Paul flurry Nobel laureate
was a director of Mellon Institute

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669
was a director of Mellon Institute
 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.260
was a director of Mellon Institute
before going to Stanford and there was a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270
before going to Stanford and there was a
 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.610

many polymer scientists here in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620
many polymer scientists here in
 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.200

chemistry department so this was very

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210
chemistry department so this was very
 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.730
chemistry department so this was very
easy choice for me

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740
easy choice for me
 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.170

one side it is very interdisciplinary

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
one side it is very interdisciplinary
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.220
one side it is very interdisciplinary
institution but it's very easy to

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230
institution but it's very easy to
 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.830

collaborate and I think the essence of

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840
collaborate and I think the essence of
 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.180

the science in 21st century is really
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.440
the science in 21st century is really
bridging between different areas

is even more because polymer chemistry

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590
is even more because polymer chemistry
 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.149
is even more because polymer chemistry
can be really seen in some sense that

you can make macromolecules which can be
 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.219
you can make macromolecules which can be
really so large and so special but you

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229
really so large and so special but you
 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.500
really so large and so special but you
can see individual molecules and they

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510
can see individual molecules and they
 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.899
can see individual molecules and they
can be used for special actions they can

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909
can be used for special actions they can
 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.240

temperature to pH to many others so
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.160
temperature to pH to many others so
polymers are probably in that case my

excitement because there are also much
 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.170
excitement because there are also much
larger molecules and much more powerful

chemistry is a lil bit more than just
 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.770
chemistry is a lil bit more than just
chemistry because it deals with the

chemistry because it deals with the
 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.560
chemistry because it deals with the
large molecules with macromolecules and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570
large molecules with macromolecules and
 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.410

improving surface properties of various
materials so this is really challenge

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190
materials so this is really challenge
 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.670

so it's a huge amount of polymers but

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769
so it's a huge amount of polymers but
 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.920
so it's a huge amount of polymers but
still they are you would defined they

would like to have so the reason for

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750
would like to have so the reason for
 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.430
would like to have so the reason for
that is that the radical polymerization

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440
that is that the radical polymerization
 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.379
that is that the radical polymerization
proceeds with free radicals and free

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389
proceeds with free radicals and free
 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.110
proceeds with free radicals and free
radicals whether in chemistry or in

politics I extremely difficult to be

controlled they killing one another via

committing suicide after one second time

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290
committing suicide after one second time
 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.680
committing suicide after one second time
so one second time is too short to make

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690
so one second time is too short to make
 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.170
so one second time is too short to make
a polymer chain in a precise way make a

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
a polymer chain in a precise way make a
 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.349
a polymer chain in a precise way make a
block of polymer or something else so

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359
block of polymer or something else so
 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.680
block of polymer or something else so
the approach which we taken in 20 years

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690
the approach which we taken in 20 years
 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.349
the approach which we taken in 20 years
ago is really based on putting these

a certain period of time let's say one

a certain period of time let's say one
minute and in that case we can have

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930
minute and in that case we can have
 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.960
