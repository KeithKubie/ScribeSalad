00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.764
We have two copies of
six different figures

00:00:02.764 --> 00:00:03.430
right over here.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.590
And I want to think about
which of these figures

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.450
are going to be unchanged if I
were to rotate it 180 degrees?

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.280
So let's do two
examples of that.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.780
So I have two copies
of this square.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.890
If I were to take
one of these copies

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.570
and rotate it 180 degrees.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.236
So let me show you
what that looks like.

00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:21.620
And we're going to rotate
around its center 180 degrees.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.970
So we're going to rotate
around the center.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.300
So this is it.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.410
So we're rotating it.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.730
That's rotated 90 degrees.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.120
And then we've
rotated 180 degrees.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.110
And notice the figure
looks exactly the same.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.380
This one, the
square is unchanged

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.704
by a 180-degree rotation.

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:41.620
Now what about this
trapezoid right over here?

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.078
Let's think about
what happens when

00:00:43.078 --> 00:00:45.250
it's rotated by 180 degrees.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.280
So that is 90 degrees
and 180 degrees.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.460
So this has now been changed.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.120
Now I have the short side.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.850
I have my base is short
and my top is long.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.640
Before my base was long
and my top was short.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.320
So when I rotate
it 180 degrees I

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.379
didn't get to the
exact same figure.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.322
I have essentially an
upside down version of it.

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:10.280
So what I want you to do
for the rest of these,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.530
is pause the video and think
about which of these will

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.250
be unchanged and
which of them will

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.730
be changed when you
rotate by 180 degrees.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.200
So let's look at
this star thing.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.130
And one way that my
brain visualizes it,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.160
is imagine the center.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.940
That's what we're
rotating around.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.150
And then if you
rotate 180 degrees.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.960
Imagine any point.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.200
Say this point,
relative to the center.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.670
If you were to
rotate it 90 degrees,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.680
you would get over here.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.846
And then if rotate it 180
degrees, you go over here.

00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:37.260
You go the opposite side of
the center from where it is.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.050
So from that point,
to the center,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.530
you keep going
that same distance.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.080
You'll end up right over there.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.910
So this one looks like
it won't be changed.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.440
But let's verify it.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.690
So we're going to
rotate 90 degrees.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.995
And then we have 180 degrees.

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:54.880
It is unchanged.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.100
Now let's look at this
parallelogram right over here.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.310
So its center, if we
think about its center

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.402
where my cursor is right
now-- Think about this point.

00:02:03.402 --> 00:02:05.360
The distance between that
point and the center,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.050
if we were to keep going
that same distance again,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.345
you would get to that point.

00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:11.720
Likewise, the distance between
this point and the center,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.680
if we were to go that
same distance again,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.160
you would to get to that point.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.450
So it seems like that
point would end up there.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.970
That point would end up there.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.950
And vice versa.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.810
So I think this one will
be unchanged by rotation.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.500
So let's verify it.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.930
So you go 90 degrees.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.559
And then you go 180 degrees.

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:29.600
Or I should say, it will
be unchanged by rotation

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.360
of 180 degrees
around its center.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.660
We got the same figure.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.302
Now let's think
about this triangle.

00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:39.260
So if you think about
the center of the figure.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.250
Let's say the center of the
figure is right around here.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.200
If you take this point, go
to the center of the figure,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.965
and then go that
distance again, you

00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:50.090
end up in a place where
there's no point right now.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.380
So that point is
going to end up there.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.240
This point is going
to end up there.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.750
This point is going
to end up here.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.300
So you're not going to have
the same figure anymore.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.140
And so we can
rotate it to verify.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.510
So that's rotated 90 degrees.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.712
And then that's
rotated 180 degrees.

00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:10.670
So we've kind of turned
this thing on its side.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.900
It is not the same thing.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.852
Now let's think about this
figure right over here.

00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:17.810
Well this figure, if you
rotate it 180 degrees,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.897
this point is now
going to be down here.

00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:21.480
And this point is
going to be up here.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.980
So you're going to
make, essentially

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.446
it's going to be an upside
down version of the same kite.

00:03:25.446 --> 00:03:26.320
And we can view that.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.461
We can visualize that now.

00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:28.710
So it's going to be different.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.910
But let's just show it.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.500
This is 90 degrees.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.160
And now this is 180 degrees.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:46.800
If it was actually symmetric
about the horizontal axis,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.607
then we would have a
different scenario.

00:03:48.607 --> 00:03:50.690
We would have a different
scenario with this thing

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.356
right over here.

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:54.240
If it was some type of a
parallelogram, or a rhombus,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.770
or something like
that, then this

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.530
could have been
more interesting.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.890
But in this situation, if it was
just a more symmetrical diamond

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.480
shape, then this rotation
would not have affected it.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.395
But this one clearly did.
