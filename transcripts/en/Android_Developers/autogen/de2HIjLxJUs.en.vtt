00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170
look at it but the question is how does
 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.270
look at it but the question is how does
that work and it's something that's

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280
that work and it's something that's
 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.540
that work and it's something that's
going to break in future releases so I

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550
going to break in future releases so I
 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.150

believe Alex you found a library that

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160
believe Alex you found a library that
 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.740
believe Alex you found a library that
actually lets you do that yeah so

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750
actually lets you do that yeah so
 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.750
actually lets you do that yeah so
there's a library available it's an open

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760
there's a library available it's an open
 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.340
there's a library available it's an open
source library called standout that

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350
source library called standout that
 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.380
source library called standout that
basically crits it's a third-party

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390
basically crits it's a third-party
 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.180
basically crits it's a third-party
library that lets you create little

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190

floating windows that can drag around on
 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.050
floating windows that can drag around on
your homescreen and it's even got this

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060
your homescreen and it's even got this
 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.090
your homescreen and it's even got this
like it's a pretty nifty looking always

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100
like it's a pretty nifty looking always
 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.430
like it's a pretty nifty looking always
on top functionality where you can even

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440
on top functionality where you can even
 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.260
on top functionality where you can even
open other apps and the standout window

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270
open other apps and the standout window
 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.890
open other apps and the standout window
will sort of float on top of it so this

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900
will sort of float on top of it so this
 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.050
will sort of float on top of it so this
actually works so dice players using

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060
actually works so dice players using
 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.910
actually works so dice players using
this library stand out and stand out

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920
this library stand out and stand out
 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.920
this library stand out and stand out
actually works by using a system alert

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930
actually works by using a system alert
 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.700
actually works by using a system alert
dialog in terms of Willis break in

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710

future releases this we can't say for

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790
future releases this we can't say for
 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.270
future releases this we can't say for
sure but the system alert dialog wasn't

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280
sure but the system alert dialog wasn't
 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.120
sure but the system alert dialog wasn't
designed with video in mind so it's it's

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130
designed with video in mind so it's it's
 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.460
designed with video in mind so it's it's
sort of an odd use of the system dialog

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470
sort of an odd use of the system dialog
 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.940
sort of an odd use of the system dialog
and I wouldn't expect that to work

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950
and I wouldn't expect that to work
 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.850
and I wouldn't expect that to work
without without some updates per version

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860
without without some updates per version
 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.420
without without some updates per version
like from developer of the library

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430
like from developer of the library
 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.030
like from developer of the library
especially difficult would be the the

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040
especially difficult would be the the
 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.470
especially difficult would be the the
context of actually using it to play

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480

expect that to I expect that the break
 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.640
expect that to I expect that the break
in all sorts of corner cases unless the

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650
in all sorts of corner cases unless the
 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.050
in all sorts of corner cases unless the
developer has been really careful about

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060
developer has been really careful about
 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.890
developer has been really careful about
that kind of thing

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900
that kind of thing
 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.190
that kind of thing
for instance playing simultaneously or

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200
for instance playing simultaneously or
 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.320

of a application that's playing other
 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.120

allocation considerations there yeah I

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940
allocation considerations there yeah I
 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.360
allocation considerations there yeah I
think that pretty much covers it from a

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370
think that pretty much covers it from a
 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.490
think that pretty much covers it from a
from a UI perspective is it's definitely

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500
from a UI perspective is it's definitely
 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.380
from a UI perspective is it's definitely
interesting effect but yeah it's not

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390
interesting effect but yeah it's not
 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.030
interesting effect but yeah it's not
it's not really the Android way of doing

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040
it's not really the Android way of doing
 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.659
it's not really the Android way of doing
things right it's having a window that

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669
things right it's having a window that
 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.510
things right it's having a window that
you can drag around sort of breaks the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520
you can drag around sort of breaks the
 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.970
you can drag around sort of breaks the
only in one application at a time UI

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980
only in one application at a time UI

only in one application at a time UI
paradigm that we go for with Android it

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290
paradigm that we go for with Android it
 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.200
paradigm that we go for with Android it
is a neat effect and it's impressive

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210
is a neat effect and it's impressive
 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.420
is a neat effect and it's impressive
that I mean the standout library is

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430
that I mean the standout library is
 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.590
that I mean the standout library is
impressive in terms of what they've

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600
impressive in terms of what they've
 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.780
impressive in terms of what they've
accomplished but I would say it should

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790
accomplished but I would say it should
 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.120
accomplished but I would say it should
be used with terror right let's move on

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130
be used with terror right let's move on
 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.060
be used with terror right let's move on
to our first question so another

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070
to our first question so another

question from the Jay Dixon in Australia
 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.230
question from the Jay Dixon in Australia
and so the question is with in-app

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240
and so the question is with in-app
 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.570
and so the question is with in-app
purchases on Google Play is there an

manage this so we don't really have a
 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.730
manage this so we don't really have a
way to go and actually we've really on

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740
way to go and actually we've really on
 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.620
way to go and actually we've really on
how much avoid offer discounts period I

going to give you a big caution here and

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360
going to give you a big caution here and
 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.140
going to give you a big caution here and
that is part of the reason why we have

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150
that is part of the reason why we have
 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.360
that is part of the reason why we have
the the concept of an in-app product and

why you have to upload all your prices
 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.750
why you have to upload all your prices
to the servers to make sure there's so

somebody discovers you're doing this
they could just go and modify the apk to

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:37.930
they could just go and modify the apk to
 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.970
they could just go and modify the apk to

logged into the phone and so from a
 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.000
logged into the phone and so from a
security perspective

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.010
security perspective
 

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.960

this is a bit sketchy ah so that's the

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:51.970
this is a bit sketchy ah so that's the
 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.250
this is a bit sketchy ah so that's the
one thing I really do want to warn you

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:53.260
one thing I really do want to warn you
 

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.640
one thing I really do want to warn you
about here if you decide to do this yeah

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:55.650
about here if you decide to do this yeah
 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.200
about here if you decide to do this yeah
well one alternative Mike I don't know

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.210
well one alternative Mike I don't know
 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.970
well one alternative Mike I don't know
if this would work but just uh like

00:07:59.970 --> 00:07:59.980
if this would work but just uh like
 

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.110
if this would work but just uh like
playing through the scenario in my head

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120
playing through the scenario in my head
 

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.060
playing through the scenario in my head
one thing that might work is to not

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.070
one thing that might work is to not
 

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.660
one thing that might work is to not
store the the item ID for the discounted

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:06.670
store the the item ID for the discounted
 

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.520
store the the item ID for the discounted
version of the item on the device just

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:08.530
version of the item on the device just
 

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.680
version of the item on the device just
have it on your server and have these or

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:10.690
have it on your server and have these or
 

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.270
have it on your server and have these or
authenticate to the server server sends

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.280

down the discount item item

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:13.810
down the discount item item
 

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.750
down the discount item item
I mean it's still there's still a risk

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:15.760
I mean it's still there's still a risk
 

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.250
I mean it's still there's still a risk
if somebody I find that Product ID

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:17.260
if somebody I find that Product ID
 

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.140
if somebody I find that Product ID
there's nothing stopping somebody from

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.150
there's nothing stopping somebody from
 

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.460
there's nothing stopping somebody from
going and plugging it in there but

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:20.470
going and plugging it in there but
 

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.830
going and plugging it in there but
actually discover it exists right you

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:22.840
actually discover it exists right you
 

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.090
actually discover it exists right you
have to discover it exists and you have

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:24.100
have to discover it exists and you have
 

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.460
have to discover it exists and you have
to maybe mimic the user packets know for

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:26.470
to maybe mimic the user packets know for
 

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.260
to maybe mimic the user packets know for
something to get the item IDs that apply

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:31.270
something to get the item IDs that apply
 

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.900
something to get the item IDs that apply
but it is a you know if it's just a

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:33.910
but it is a you know if it's just a
 

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.310
but it is a you know if it's just a
small discount you might not really care

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320
small discount you might not really care
 

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.710
small discount you might not really care
that much so and you know that being

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:37.720
that much so and you know that being
 

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.540
that much so and you know that being
said the user is still gonna have to pay

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:39.550
said the user is still gonna have to pay
 

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.180
said the user is still gonna have to pay
something so yeah yeah I don't think

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:42.190
something so yeah yeah I don't think
 

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:47.990
something so yeah yeah I don't think
it's gonna be a big difference right so

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000
it's gonna be a big difference right so
 

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.970
it's gonna be a big difference right so
let's see here is there any way to do

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:50.980
let's see here is there any way to do
 

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.370
let's see here is there any way to do
route between two points with the

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:53.380
route between two points with the
 

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.510
route between two points with the
Android map API

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:55.520
Android map API
 

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.980
Android map API
so and this is coming from Brazil so

00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:58.990
so and this is coming from Brazil so
 

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.420
so and this is coming from Brazil so
this is essentially driving directions I

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:01.430
this is essentially driving directions I
 

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.269
this is essentially driving directions I
believe in which case the answer is if

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:04.279
believe in which case the answer is if
 

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:08.110
believe in which case the answer is if
you're using map V you know but if you

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120
you're using map V you know but if you
 

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.889
you're using map V you know but if you
are using an intent to fire to load Maps

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:11.899
are using an intent to fire to load Maps
 

00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:13.449
are using an intent to fire to load Maps
I believe it's possible by just using a

00:09:13.449 --> 00:09:13.459
I believe it's possible by just using a
 

00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:16.120
I believe it's possible by just using a
map URL I think so yeah you could just

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.130
map URL I think so yeah you could just
 

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.490
map URL I think so yeah you could just
start it intent with the domination of

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:18.500
start it intent with the domination of
 

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.560
start it intent with the domination of
feature of Maps essentially but if you

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:20.570
feature of Maps essentially but if you
 

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.660
feature of Maps essentially but if you
have a you know a URL from driving

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:22.670
have a you know a URL from driving
 

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.460
have a you know a URL from driving
directions like you'd get from the

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:24.470
directions like you'd get from the
 

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.410
directions like you'd get from the
desktop version of maps there's a query

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:26.420
desktop version of maps there's a query
 

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.690
desktop version of maps there's a query
parameter for a source of address and a

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:28.700
parameter for a source of address and a
 

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.710
parameter for a source of address and a
query parameter for a destination

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720
query parameter for a destination
 

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.130
query parameter for a destination
address and if you fire off the intent

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:33.140
address and if you fire off the intent
 

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.110
address and if you fire off the intent
that looks just like the URL built on

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120
that looks just like the URL built on
 

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.300
that looks just like the URL built on
the desktop the Maps application will

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:37.310
the desktop the Maps application will
 

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.639
the desktop the Maps application will
offer to intercept that and we'll go and

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:39.649
offer to intercept that and we'll go and
 

00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:42.810
offer to intercept that and we'll go and
calculate driving directions locally so

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:42.820
calculate driving directions locally so
 

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.160
calculate driving directions locally so
yeah again not possible if not for you

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.170
yeah again not possible if not for you
 

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.920
yeah again not possible if not for you
but possible is an intent

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:48.930
 
 

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.040
 
so this question is coming from Andrew

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.050
so this question is coming from Andrew
 

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.970
so this question is coming from Andrew
in Romania

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:52.980
in Romania
 

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.790
in Romania
the question is with Android awesome

they're getting this error on Android
 

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.850
they're getting this error on Android
234 and it sounded like goes across

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860
234 and it sounded like goes across
 

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.499

several different devices looking at

00:10:12.499 --> 00:10:12.509
several different devices looking at
 

00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:15.530
several different devices looking at
their stack overflow question and the

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540
their stack overflow question and the
 

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.809
their stack overflow question and the
file also the interestingly enough it

00:10:17.809 --> 00:10:17.819
file also the interestingly enough it
 

00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:19.549
file also the interestingly enough it
works fine when they're playing off of

00:10:19.549 --> 00:10:19.559
works fine when they're playing off of
 

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:23.269
works fine when they're playing off of
the SD card so that's really interesting

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279
the SD card so that's really interesting
 

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.799
the SD card so that's really interesting
normally when you see these types of

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:24.809
normally when you see these types of
 

00:10:24.809 --> 00:10:26.359
normally when you see these types of
errors it's because you've encoded your

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:26.369
errors it's because you've encoded your
 

00:10:26.369 --> 00:10:29.329
errors it's because you've encoded your
video to use the wrong format and I

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339
video to use the wrong format and I
 

00:10:29.339 --> 00:10:30.829
video to use the wrong format and I
think in this case what's most likely

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839
think in this case what's most likely
 

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:34.220
think in this case what's most likely
happening if you look very carefully at

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:34.230
happening if you look very carefully at
 

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.389
happening if you look very carefully at
their source they're actually achieving

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399
their source they're actually achieving
 

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:38.179
their source they're actually achieving
that they file from an HTTP server okay

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:38.189
that they file from an HTTP server okay
 

00:10:38.189 --> 00:10:39.859
that they file from an HTTP server okay
I mean I can't say this for sure without

00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:39.869
I mean I can't say this for sure without
 

00:10:39.869 --> 00:10:41.540
I mean I can't say this for sure without
actually having the real URL which is

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:41.550
actually having the real URL which is
 

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.609
actually having the real URL which is
not present in your question so if you

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:43.619
not present in your question so if you
 

00:10:43.619 --> 00:10:44.989
not present in your question so if you
do have that feel free to ping us we can

00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:44.999
do have that feel free to ping us we can
 

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:47.299
do have that feel free to ping us we can
take a closer look at it but my guess is

00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:47.309
take a closer look at it but my guess is
 

00:10:47.309 --> 00:10:48.949
take a closer look at it but my guess is
it's probably an SSL error like the

00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959
it's probably an SSL error like the
 

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:51.019
it's probably an SSL error like the
certificates not trusted but why would

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:51.029
certificates not trusted but why would
 

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:54.499
certificates not trusted but why would
that happen on the SD card and not know

00:10:54.499 --> 00:10:54.509
that happen on the SD card and not know
 

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:56.059
that happen on the SD card and not know
if it's on the SD card there's no SSL oh

00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:56.069
if it's on the SD card there's no SSL oh
 

00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:58.639
if it's on the SD card there's no SSL oh
okay no other way around it happens it

00:10:58.639 --> 00:10:58.649
okay no other way around it happens it
 

00:10:58.649 --> 00:11:01.369
okay no other way around it happens it
works except on the SD card right no

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:01.379
works except on the SD card right no
 

00:11:01.379 --> 00:11:02.989
works except on the SD card right no
other way around it works an SD card it

00:11:02.989 --> 00:11:02.999
other way around it works an SD card it
 

00:11:02.999 --> 00:11:04.160
other way around it works an SD card it
does not work when they stream from

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:04.170
does not work when they stream from
 

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.980
does not work when they stream from
their server ok so then so it's an SLS

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:06.990
their server ok so then so it's an SLS
 

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.590
their server ok so then so it's an SLS
SLR and they bypass SSL because it's

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600
SLR and they bypass SSL because it's
 

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.949
SLR and they bypass SSL because it's
going to the SD card right ok well I

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959
going to the SD card right ok well I
 

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:16.280
going to the SD card right ok well I
mean yeah now that said there's nothing

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:16.290
mean yeah now that said there's nothing
 

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.749
mean yeah now that said there's nothing
in the logs actually indicates this is

00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:17.759
in the logs actually indicates this is
 

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:20.030
in the logs actually indicates this is
necessary this is just my best guess

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040
necessary this is just my best guess
 

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.030
necessary this is just my best guess
based on the limited logs we have

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040
based on the limited logs we have
 

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.619
based on the limited logs we have
available if you again if you can

00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:24.629
available if you again if you can
 

00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:26.239
available if you again if you can
actually give us the actual URL to the

00:11:26.239 --> 00:11:26.249
actually give us the actual URL to the
 

00:11:26.249 --> 00:11:27.230
actually give us the actual URL to the
file we can do a little bit more

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240
file we can do a little bit more
 

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.110
file we can do a little bit more
Diagnostics but just based on the

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120
Diagnostics but just based on the
 

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.299
Diagnostics but just based on the
limited information available that's our

00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:32.309
limited information available that's our
 

00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:33.850
limited information available that's our
best guess right

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:33.860
best guess right
 

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.490
best guess right
all right next question comes from Ryan

in Utah I'm developing a resource app

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.320
in Utah I'm developing a resource app
 

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.199
in Utah I'm developing a resource app
but I have partners that only want to

play a little confused by what they mean

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:51.649
play a little confused by what they mean
 

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:54.310
play a little confused by what they mean
by resource app yeah that was a little

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320
by resource app yeah that was a little
 

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.560
by resource app yeah that was a little
unclear to me too I guess is essentially

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:56.570
unclear to me too I guess is essentially
 

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:00.160
unclear to me too I guess is essentially
a apk that provides services to other

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:00.170
a apk that provides services to other
 

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.380
a apk that provides services to other
apks oh yes okay here's the example like

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:02.390
apks oh yes okay here's the example like
 

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.389
apks oh yes okay here's the example like
opentable right it has a intent that you

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399
opentable right it has a intent that you
 

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:08.380

can fire off to go and actually to go

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:08.390
can fire off to go and actually to go
 

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.449

quite possibly something like a theme

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:11.570
quite possibly something like a theme
 

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.300
quite possibly something like a theme
right it could be an apk that just

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:13.310
right it could be an apk that just
 

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.190
right it could be an apk that just
contains resources which actually would

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200
contains resources which actually would
 

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.840
contains resources which actually would
make sense and then they're going and

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:16.850
make sense and then they're going and
 

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.040
make sense and then they're going and
looking inside that deliver so to

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.050
looking inside that deliver so to
 

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:23.290
looking inside that deliver so to
receive their app okay interesting it's

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:23.300
receive their app okay interesting it's
 

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.210
receive their app okay interesting it's
okay so - the real question is there a

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:25.220
okay so - the real question is there a
 

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.800
okay so - the real question is there a
way to restrict what version is

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:26.810
way to restrict what version is
 

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.430
way to restrict what version is
downloadable for a given user on not

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.440
downloadable for a given user on not
 

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.829
downloadable for a given user on not
really I mean you can't say Baba

00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:32.839
really I mean you can't say Baba
 

00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:35.380
really I mean you can't say Baba
gmail.com only gets to see version 3 and

not version 4 or generally it's not even
 

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.790
not version 4 or generally it's not even
pop you can't restrict the version

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800
pop you can't restrict the version
 

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.939
pop you can't restrict the version
period when you download an app from

00:12:42.939 --> 00:12:42.949
period when you download an app from
 

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:44.199
period when you download an app from
Google Play you always get the latest

00:12:44.199 --> 00:12:44.209
Google Play you always get the latest
 

00:12:44.209 --> 00:12:46.540
Google Play you always get the latest
version sort of I mean you see you you

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:46.550
version sort of I mean you see you you
 

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.060
version sort of I mean you see you you
do have the option of using multiple apk

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.070
do have the option of using multiple apk
 

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.069
do have the option of using multiple apk
and what that would let you do is

00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:51.079
and what that would let you do is
 

00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:55.210
and what that would let you do is
restrict per user based on based on the

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:55.220
restrict per user based on based on the
 

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.189
restrict per user based on based on the
like let's say the platform version or

00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199
like let's say the platform version or
 

00:12:57.199 --> 00:12:59.590
like let's say the platform version or
the size of the screen so what you would

00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600
the size of the screen so what you would
 

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.360
the size of the screen so what you would
then do is break your apk up into like

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:01.370
then do is break your apk up into like
 

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.920
then do is break your apk up into like
three different versions let's for

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:02.930
three different versions let's for
 

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.300
three different versions let's for
instance let's call them like 9 10 and

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:04.310
instance let's call them like 9 10 and
 

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:09.340
instance let's call them like 9 10 and
11 and say version version 10 only works

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:09.350
11 and say version version 10 only works
 

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.550
11 and say version version 10 only works
with phone devices and version 11 is

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560
with phone devices and version 11 is
 

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.740
with phone devices and version 11 is
compatible with x-large devices which

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:14.750
compatible with x-large devices which
 

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.350
compatible with x-large devices which
would which would include tablets then

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360
would which would include tablets then
 

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.699
would which would include tablets then
when the user went to market they would

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:18.709
when the user went to market they would
 

00:13:18.709 --> 00:13:20.050
when the user went to market they would
see version 11 if they were on the

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:20.060
see version 11 if they were on the
 

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.490
see version 11 if they were on the
tablet and they would see where's intent

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:21.500
tablet and they would see where's intent
 

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.130
tablet and they would see where's intent
if they were on a phone multiply BK's

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:24.140
if they were on a phone multiply BK's
 

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.710
if they were on a phone multiply BK's
are not they don't work for every

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720
are not they don't work for every
 

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.060
are not they don't work for every
situation they will only let you

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.070
situation they will only let you
 

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.380
situation they will only let you
restrict based on the platform SDK on

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:31.390
restrict based on the platform SDK on
 

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.180
restrict based on the platform SDK on
let's see platform SDK screen size and

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:34.190
let's see platform SDK screen size and
 

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.319
let's see platform SDK screen size and
GL texture so it won't you can't do a

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:38.329
GL texture so it won't you can't do a
 

00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:40.210
GL texture so it won't you can't do a
thing like like I said before like say

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:40.220
thing like like I said before like say
 

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.150
thing like like I said before like say
Bob the gmail com gets to see version 11

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160
Bob the gmail com gets to see version 11
 

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.030
Bob the gmail com gets to see version 11
and everyone else gets to see version 10

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040
and everyone else gets to see version 10
 

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.410
and everyone else gets to see version 10
so it depends on what

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:47.420
so it depends on what
 

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.180
so it depends on what
what criteria you would want to restrict

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:49.190
what criteria you would want to restrict
 

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.750
what criteria you would want to restrict
on I'm guessing from the content of the

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:52.760
on I'm guessing from the content of the
 

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.280
on I'm guessing from the content of the
question that you would want to restrict

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:54.290
question that you would want to restrict
 

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.550
question that you would want to restrict

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560
on the version of the other applet so
 

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.070
on the version of the other applet so
you know the version of application a

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:00.080
you know the version of application a
 

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.660
you know the version of application a

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:01.670
that's installed on the user's system
 

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.340
that's installed on the user's system
would define what version of application

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:03.350
would define what version of application
 

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.470
would define what version of application

you can upgrade one of those about
 

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.780
you can upgrade one of those about

breaking the other one or you'd have to
 

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:32.200
breaking the other one or you'd have to

developers are going to want and I added

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:05.170
developers are going to want and I added
 

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.540
developers are going to want and I added
something specific to Android this is

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:08.550
something specific to Android this is
 

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.250
something specific to Android this is
pretty independent of the fact that it

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:11.260
pretty independent of the fact that it
 

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.590
pretty independent of the fact that it
would be running on Android generally

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600
would be running on Android generally
 

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.480
would be running on Android generally
what you would want to do is find a good

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:15.490
what you would want to do is find a good
 

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:19.350
what you would want to do is find a good
transcoding Java library they looked at

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360
transcoding Java library they looked at
 

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.790
transcoding Java library they looked at
ffmpeg which is actually a pretty good

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800
ffmpeg which is actually a pretty good
 

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.890
ffmpeg which is actually a pretty good
choice it is a good choice yeah it's

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:22.900
choice it is a good choice yeah it's
 

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.660
choice it is a good choice yeah it's
actually LGPL license too

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:24.670
actually LGPL license too
 

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.210
actually LGPL license too
so okay um actually we just do a

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:27.220
so okay um actually we just do a
 

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.940
so okay um actually we just do a
licensed LGPL and GPL there were some a

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:29.950
licensed LGPL and GPL there were some a
 

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.829
licensed LGPL and GPL there were some a
licensing concerns from the developer

00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839
licensing concerns from the developer
 

00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:33.090
licensing concerns from the developer
I'm afraid we can't actually speak to

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:33.100
I'm afraid we can't actually speak to
 

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.400
I'm afraid we can't actually speak to
those since we're not legal experts but

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:35.410
those since we're not legal experts but
 

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.780
those since we're not legal experts but
but you GL GPL is pretty permissive of

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:38.790
but you GL GPL is pretty permissive of
 

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.740
but you GL GPL is pretty permissive of

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:40.750
you know it's designed to be used as a
 

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.720
you know it's designed to be used as a
library so you can usually include it in

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:42.730
library so you can usually include it in
 

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.850
library so you can usually include it in
other code I think there were some cases

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:44.860
other code I think there were some cases
 

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.440
other code I think there were some cases
depending which codec you used it could

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:46.450
depending which codec you used it could
 

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.210
depending which codec you used it could
the licensing status change yeah I've

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:48.220
the licensing status change yeah I've
 

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.670
the licensing status change yeah I've
what I remember with LGPL the rule was

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:50.680
what I remember with LGPL the rule was
 

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.160
what I remember with LGPL the rule was
you could include it with your code well

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:53.170
you could include it with your code well
 

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.740
you could include it with your code well
it wouldn't force you to GPL your code

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:55.750
it wouldn't force you to GPL your code
 

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.320
it wouldn't force you to GPL your code
if you didn't make changes to the LGPL

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:58.330
if you didn't make changes to the LGPL
 

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.420
if you didn't make changes to the LGPL
library but I think that there are some

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:00.430
library but I think that there are some
 

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.250
library but I think that there are some
specific cases here where it's only GPL

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:02.260
specific cases here where it's only GPL
 

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.290
specific cases here where it's only GPL
licensed okay so yes if you do use

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:04.300
licensed okay so yes if you do use
 

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.449
licensed okay so yes if you do use
ffmpeg be a bit careful with the license

00:17:06.449 --> 00:17:06.459
ffmpeg be a bit careful with the license
 

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:08.819
ffmpeg be a bit careful with the license
there the ffmpeg developers do have a

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:08.829
there the ffmpeg developers do have a
 

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.069
there the ffmpeg developers do have a

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:13.760
page dedicated to discussing the license
so that they explain it in great detail

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:13.770
so that they explain it in great detail
 

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.380
so that they explain it in great detail
but you know outside of that another

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:16.390
but you know outside of that another
 

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.420
but you know outside of that another
option you could do would be to go in

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:18.430
option you could do would be to go in
 

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.069
option you could do would be to go in
set up a web service that's responsible

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079
set up a web service that's responsible
 

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.660
set up a web service that's responsible
for transcoding us that way you just

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:21.670
for transcoding us that way you just
 

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.840
for transcoding us that way you just
have a copy of FM

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:22.850
have a copy of FM
 

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:24.600
have a copy of FM

and then give back the resulting file
 

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:31.060
and then give back the resulting file
which you know it is actually an

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.070
which you know it is actually an
 

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.169
which you know it is actually an
interesting question there because

00:17:32.169 --> 00:17:32.179
interesting question there because

you're trading off you know on device

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:34.460
you're trading off you know on device
 

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.659
you're trading off you know on device
CPU to do it versus your network

00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:37.669
CPU to do it versus your network
 

00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:39.669
CPU to do it versus your network
bandwidth right but are you

00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679
bandwidth right but are you
 

00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:41.560
bandwidth right but are you
it doesn't make more sense to use the

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:41.570
it doesn't make more sense to use the
 

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:42.880
it doesn't make more sense to use the
devices limited CPU to do the

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:42.890
devices limited CPU to do the
 

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.340
devices limited CPU to do the
transcoding or to you upload never do

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:45.350
transcoding or to you upload never do
 

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.320
transcoding or to you upload never do
both now you're doing transcoding on the

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:47.330
both now you're doing transcoding on the
 

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.659
both now you're doing transcoding on the
device will waste battery but a lot of

00:17:49.659 --> 00:17:49.669
device will waste battery but a lot of
 

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:52.390
device will waste battery but a lot of
users also have limited but but also

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400
users also have limited but but also
 

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.919

depending on the size of the file you

00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:53.929
depending on the size of the file you
 

00:17:53.929 --> 00:17:55.810
depending on the size of the file you
could also burn through the battery I

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:55.820
could also burn through the battery I
 

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.230
could also burn through the battery I
mean you'd the issue with the with

00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240
mean you'd the issue with the with
 

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.640
mean you'd the issue with the with
uploading and then downloading is that

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:00.650
uploading and then downloading is that
 

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:01.779
uploading and then downloading is that
you would be paying the price in

00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:01.789
you would be paying the price in
 

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:03.610
you would be paying the price in
bandwidth twice yeah you'd only

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:03.620
bandwidth twice yeah you'd only
 

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.100
bandwidth twice yeah you'd only
transcode once but you deftly jump on

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:06.110
transcode once but you deftly jump on
 

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.690
transcode once but you deftly jump on
the device probably does make the most

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:07.700
the device probably does make the most
 

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.610
the device probably does make the most
sense here probably I think I would

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:09.620
sense here probably I think I would
 

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.380
sense here probably I think I would
probably with this kind of question I

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:11.390
probably with this kind of question I
 

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.880
probably with this kind of question I
would say just like run some tests and

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:12.890
would say just like run some tests and
 

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.370
would say just like run some tests and
well like what it part of it depends on

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:15.380
well like what it part of it depends on
 

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.980
well like what it part of it depends on
the common use case like are you

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:16.990
the common use case like are you
 

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.080
the common use case like are you
transcoding you know a three second

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:20.090
transcoding you know a three second
 

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.529
