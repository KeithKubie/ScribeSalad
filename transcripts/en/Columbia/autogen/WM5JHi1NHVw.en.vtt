action of some sort and and and we then

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440
action of some sort and and and we then
 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.970
action of some sort and and and we then
look back to the social structural

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980

ethnicity where they own land the
 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.060
ethnicity where they own land the
attributes that they have so we try to

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070
attributes that they have so we try to
 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.630
attributes that they have so we try to
capture something about them from the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640
capture something about them from the

and then we impute motive well if we

and then we impute motive well if we
 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.830
and then we impute motive well if we
observe characteristics of people and we

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840
observe characteristics of people and we
 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.270
observe characteristics of people and we
observe their action and we bridge that

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280
observe their action and we bridge that
 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.000
observe their action and we bridge that
gap to the imputation of motive who said

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.900
associated with a set of practices and
beliefs that that they can recognize

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910
beliefs that that they can recognize
 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.300
beliefs that that they can recognize
themselves as a member of a group or a

themselves as a member of a group or a

that that sense of identity is provides

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780
that that sense of identity is provides
 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.420
that that sense of identity is provides
the springs for action so my work

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430
the springs for action so my work
 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.710
the springs for action so my work
historically has been on trying to

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720
historically has been on trying to
 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.330
historically has been on trying to
understand how I could measure the

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340
understand how I could measure the
 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.629
understand how I could measure the
sources of relations around the person

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639
sources of relations around the person
 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.610
sources of relations around the person
and then think about how those relations

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620
and then think about how those relations
 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.920
and then think about how those relations
shape their identity their self

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930
shape their identity their self
 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.550
shape their identity their self
consciously he'll die down and then try

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560
consciously he'll die down and then try
 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.279
consciously he'll die down and then try
to explain action that I could observe

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289
to explain action that I could observe
 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.050
to explain action that I could observe
subsequently and that's another

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060
subsequently and that's another
 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.790
subsequently and that's another

that's more similar to oral history I

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080
that's more similar to oral history I
 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.960
that's more similar to oral history I
think it's more similar to try to

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970
think it's more similar to try to
 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:38.439
think it's more similar to try to
understand

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449
understand
 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.689
understand

it's the ethnographic project is to
 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.519
it's the ethnographic project is to
understand how people come to see the

that people's understandings of

that people's understandings of
 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.769
that people's understandings of
themselves I involve a involve a

theoretical enterprise that is their

theoretical enterprise that is their
 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.510
theoretical enterprise that is their
theory and how they got to where they

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520
theory and how they got to where they
 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.399
theory and how they got to where they
are now that theoretical understanding

are now that theoretical understanding

are now that theoretical understanding
of themselves that's reported and

of themselves that's reported and
 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.860
of themselves that's reported and
narrative is actually something that

sociologists can really study in oral

sociologists can really study in oral
 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:30.550
sociologists can really study in oral
and storage good stuff so when I think

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560
and storage good stuff so when I think
 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.379
and storage good stuff so when I think
of somebody telling a lie for history

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:32.389
of somebody telling a lie for history
 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:33.820
of somebody telling a lie for history
what I'm really understanding is that

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830
what I'm really understanding is that
 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.760
what I'm really understanding is that
you're doing what you know what we do

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770
you're doing what you know what we do
 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.439
you're doing what you know what we do
when we tell the life histories we stand

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:38.449
when we tell the life histories we stand
 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:41.409
when we tell the life histories we stand
at some point in the present and and

at some point in the present and and

under some theory inchoate or not under
 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.700
under some theory inchoate or not under
some theory we search into the infinite

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710
some theory we search into the infinite
 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.300
some theory we search into the infinite
past for events and experiences that

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310
past for events and experiences that
 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.079
past for events and experiences that
have made us get to the present and then

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:56.089
have made us get to the present and then
 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:57.820
have made us get to the present and then
we array those events and experiences

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830
we array those events and experiences
 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.949
we array those events and experiences
into a narrative that that is in plot it

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:02.959
into a narrative that that is in plot it
 

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:06.219
into a narrative that that is in plot it
in some way that that sounds believable

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229
in some way that that sounds believable
 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:08.920
in some way that that sounds believable
to awesome and if we're trying to

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930
to awesome and if we're trying to
 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.659
to awesome and if we're trying to
convince other people it sounds

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669
convince other people it sounds
 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:14.589
convince other people it sounds
believable to them but this the past is

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599
believable to them but this the past is
 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:18.070
believable to them but this the past is
a vast sea of experiences so how to

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080
a vast sea of experiences so how to
 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.350
a vast sea of experiences so how to
select the events in the past to array

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360
select the events in the past to array
 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.320
select the events in the past to array
to get you to the future requires a

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330
to get you to the future requires a
 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.420
to get you to the future requires a
theoretical orientation even if we don't

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430
theoretical orientation even if we don't
 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.850
theoretical orientation even if we don't
think about it as a theoretical even we

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:27.860
think about it as a theoretical even we
 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.489
think about it as a theoretical even we
don't think about people as theorists we

00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:29.499
don't think about people as theorists we
 

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:32.230
don't think about people as theorists we
recognize that they're doing what theory

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240
recognize that they're doing what theory
 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.670
recognize that they're doing what theory

look at so when you think when you're
 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.260
look at so when you think when you're
and you have a theory of something you

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.270
and you have a theory of something you
 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.180
and you have a theory of something you
know that i don't have to i can deny

the problem and by denying some data you
 

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.490
the problem and by denying some data you
are able to see what elements can't use

do people tell stories and that with the

do people tell stories and that with the
idea that we might actually learn

something about about these people that

something about about these people that
they made themselves not know which is

colorsource so this work is all about

how people become something and and take

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:02.910
how people become something and and take

how people become something and and take
seriously their own accounts about

make a circle right they don't lie down
 

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.620
make a circle right they don't lie down
in a circle they in fact they lie time

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:05.630
in a circle they in fact they lie time
 

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.360
in a circle they in fact they lie time
in inside the circle so you're not

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:07.370
in inside the circle so you're not
 

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:12.790
in inside the circle so you're not
clearing anything so how would that

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800
clearing anything so how would that
 

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:19.870
clearing anything so how would that
theory by bed yeah so I believe that I

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:19.880
theory by bed yeah so I believe that I
 

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:30.300
theory by bed yeah so I believe that I
don't know how to make this thing work

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:30.310
 

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:34.350
yeah try it try the left hand thing

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360
yeah try it try the left hand thing
 

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.430
yeah try it try the left hand thing
somebody knowledge oh yes oh okay and

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440
somebody knowledge oh yes oh okay and

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:45.410
back and forward case I said it doesn't
 

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.110
back and forward case I said it doesn't
matter now I think some of you already

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120
matter now I think some of you already
 

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.610
matter now I think some of you already
seen this to bill right I mean that's

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:48.620
seen this to bill right I mean that's
 

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.230

everything I've done bill is already
done so i can just do the super quickly

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:54.950
done so i can just do the super quickly

right two seconds so a few slides ago

00:16:59.940 --> 00:16:59.950
right two seconds so a few slides ago
 

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.829
right two seconds so a few slides ago
well the thing that I don't know how

00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839
well the thing that I don't know how

well the thing that I don't know how
bill teaches this work so that's always

00:17:04.929 --> 00:17:04.939
bill teaches this work so that's always
 

00:17:04.939 --> 00:17:08.140
bill teaches this work so that's always
a mystery to me why niches and how it

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:08.150
a mystery to me why niches and how it
 

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.540
a mystery to me why niches and how it
teaches it but the problem that this

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:10.550
teaches it but the problem that this
 

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.299
teaches it but the problem that this
work addresses it's becoming and can so

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:13.309
work addresses it's becoming and can so
 

00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:14.860
work addresses it's becoming and can so

these people they rose to help positions
 

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.730
these people they rose to help positions
of quite remarkable power so these are

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:41.740
of quite remarkable power so these are
 

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.670
of quite remarkable power so these are
very early stories of adherence of the

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:44.680
very early stories of adherence of the
 

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.050

the best story so what we did with these

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880
the best story so what we did with these
 

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.020
the best story so what we did with these
stories is we transform them into graphs

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.030
stories is we transform them into graphs
 

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.510
stories is we transform them into graphs
and the the logic of trying to transform

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:00.520
and the the logic of trying to transform
 

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.500
and the the logic of trying to transform
them into graphs was to was to try to

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:04.510
them into graphs was to was to try to
 

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.590
them into graphs was to was to try to
capture a structure of the narration of

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600
capture a structure of the narration of
 

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.200
capture a structure of the narration of
becoming so that we can identify

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:09.210
becoming so that we can identify
 

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.080
becoming so that we can identify
elements in the becoming process that

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:13.090
elements in the becoming process that
 

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:16.430
elements in the becoming process that
were central to their own cognition

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440
were central to their own cognition
 

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.140
were central to their own cognition
again this is their theory of how they

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:19.150
again this is their theory of how they
 

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.060
again this is their theory of how they
became a Nazi so it's there they're

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:21.070
became a Nazi so it's there they're
 

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.610
became a Nazi so it's there they're
quite purposely thinking that end point

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:23.620
quite purposely thinking that end point
 

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.140
quite purposely thinking that end point
of the story is how i became a nazi

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:25.150
of the story is how i became a nazi
 

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.670
of the story is how i became a nazi
they're telling that story they're

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:26.680
they're telling that story they're
 

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.680
they're telling that story they're
theorizing it and they're selecting from

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:28.690
theorizing it and they're selecting from
 

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:31.920
theorizing it and they're selecting from
their past events that that that they

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:31.930
their past events that that that they
 

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.520
their past events that that that they
wanted to array just in that order to

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:34.530
wanted to array just in that order to
 

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.040
wanted to array just in that order to
tell a compelling story and now this is

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.050
tell a compelling story and now this is
 

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.800
tell a compelling story and now this is
a little sub sub slot of the graph it so

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:40.810
a little sub sub slot of the graph it so
 

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:44.130
a little sub sub slot of the graph it so
it's a little a little sequence of

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:44.140
it's a little a little sequence of
 

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.810
it's a little a little sequence of
events I believe that our boy is

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820
events I believe that our boy is
 

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.720
events I believe that our boy is
describing a situation where his mom

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:51.730
describing a situation where his mom
 

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.080
describing a situation where his mom
buys him a pair of brown pants she

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:55.090
buys him a pair of brown pants she
 

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.400
buys him a pair of brown pants she
doesn't know the significance of the

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:56.410
doesn't know the significance of the
 

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.350
doesn't know the significance of the
brown pants he feel he will he

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360
brown pants he feel he will he
 

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.240
brown pants he feel he will he
recognizes the significance of ground

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.250
recognizes the significance of ground
 

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.520
recognizes the significance of ground
pants he wears them proudly to school as

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:02.530
pants he wears them proudly to school as
 

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.530
pants he wears them proudly to school as
he's going to school he has a cognition

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:04.540
he's going to school he has a cognition
 

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.340
he's going to school he has a cognition
I feel like half a Nazi he goes to

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:08.350
I feel like half a Nazi he goes to
 

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.530
I feel like half a Nazi he goes to
school he gets in a fight with two

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:10.540
school he gets in a fight with two
 

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.840
school he gets in a fight with two
Jewish kids he punches them in the nose

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:12.850
Jewish kids he punches them in the nose
 

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.810
Jewish kids he punches them in the nose
he gets expelled from school and he

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:15.820
he gets expelled from school and he
 

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.810
he gets expelled from school and he
returns home and so this little element

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:18.820
returns home and so this little element
 

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.690
returns home and so this little element
of the narration is built as a graph

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:21.700
of the narration is built as a graph
 

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:26.130
of the narration is built as a graph
where the narrative itself allows us to

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:26.140
where the narrative itself allows us to
 

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.170
where the narrative itself allows us to
draw an arc between of an events in the

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:28.180
draw an arc between of an events in the
 

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.390
draw an arc between of an events in the
past or the future to an event in the

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400
past or the future to an event in the
 

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.790
past or the future to an event in the
past or the future that is that the next

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:32.800
past or the future that is that the next
 

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.340
past or the future that is that the next
event couldn't have happened without the

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:35.350
event couldn't have happened without the
 

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.740
event couldn't have happened without the
prior one so it's it's the author's own

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:37.750
prior one so it's it's the author's own
 

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.100
prior one so it's it's the author's own
imputation of cause al causal logic and

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:41.110
imputation of cause al causal logic and
 

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.370
imputation of cause al causal logic and
the story and this is

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:42.380
the story and this is
 

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.830
the story and this is
this is done by hand without any

this is done by hand without any
 

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.930
this is done by hand without any
sophistication and there's no attempt to

sophistication and there's no attempt to
 

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.090
sophistication and there's no attempt to
be scientific which i always think is I

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.100
be scientific which i always think is I
 

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.370
be scientific which i always think is I
think it's a waste of time but if you

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:51.380
think it's a waste of time but if you
 

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.920
think it's a waste of time but if you
wanted to try to be scientific you could

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:53.930
wanted to try to be scientific you could
 

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.960
wanted to try to be scientific you could
use programs that are designed to do

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:55.970
use programs that are designed to do
 

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.410
use programs that are designed to do
this for you f know is one there are a

00:20:59.410 --> 00:20:59.420
this for you f know is one there are a
 

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.420
this for you f know is one there are a
bunch of programs that basically set up

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:01.430
bunch of programs that basically set up
 

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.310
bunch of programs that basically set up
a series of counterfactual so you could

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320
a series of counterfactual so you could
 

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.290
a series of counterfactual so you could
ask you know you can ask you can

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:05.300
ask you know you can ask you can
 

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.470
ask you know you can ask you can
undertake a counterfactual experiment in

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480
undertake a counterfactual experiment in
 

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.630
undertake a counterfactual experiment in
order to ascertain whether you would

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640
order to ascertain whether you would
 

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.170
order to ascertain whether you would
draw an arc from one node to another and

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:14.180
draw an arc from one node to another and
 

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.550
draw an arc from one node to another and
and and that's scientifically legitimate

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:18.560
and and that's scientifically legitimate
 

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.500
and and that's scientifically legitimate
it gives you a language a program and so

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:20.510
it gives you a language a program and so
 

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.500
it gives you a language a program and so

that 139 what happens it's just action

that 139 what happens it's just action
an action without narrative so there's

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:40.850
an action without narrative so there's
 

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.240
an action without narrative so there's
no continuity in the structures just one

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:43.250
no continuity in the structures just one

so our idea in this illustrative paper

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:48.830
so our idea in this illustrative paper
 

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.500
so our idea in this illustrative paper
was to say you could use narrative

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:50.510
was to say you could use narrative
 

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.340
was to say you could use narrative

slide then says well we can color we can

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:14.610
slide then says well we can color we can
 

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:18.590
slide then says well we can color we can
color advance by by themes and we can

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600
color advance by by themes and we can
 

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.840
color advance by by themes and we can
then ask the question like how central

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:20.850
then ask the question like how central
 

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.020
then ask the question like how central
is that theme to the narrative as a

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:24.030
is that theme to the narrative as a
 

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:27.110
is that theme to the narrative as a
whole and and then here we can identify

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120
whole and and then here we can identify
 

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.050
whole and and then here we can identify
some themes like chaos exposure to Nazis

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:30.060
some themes like chaos exposure to Nazis
 

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.290
some themes like chaos exposure to Nazis
anti-semitism then beam of order and so

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:33.300
anti-semitism then beam of order and so
 

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.040
anti-semitism then beam of order and so
on and we can try to we can try to

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:37.050
on and we can try to we can try to
 

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:40.070
on and we can try to we can try to
discover that that some kinds of themes

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080
discover that that some kinds of themes
 

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.520
discover that that some kinds of themes
turn out to be have greater centrality

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:43.530
turn out to be have greater centrality
 

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.410
turn out to be have greater centrality
and by centrality the network I'm

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:45.420
and by centrality the network I'm
 

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.630
and by centrality the network I'm
thinking about the note that if you took

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640
thinking about the note that if you took
 

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.980
thinking about the note that if you took
it out the rest of the thing would fall

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:48.990
it out the rest of the thing would fall
 

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.860
it out the rest of the thing would fall
apart so in this particular narrative

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:51.870
apart so in this particular narrative
 

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.420
apart so in this particular narrative
and actually in the narratives in

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:53.430
and actually in the narratives in
 

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.970
and actually in the narratives in
general this tension between chaos and

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980
general this tension between chaos and
 

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.750
general this tension between chaos and
order is the most central trope that's

00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760
order is the most central trope that's
 

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.660
order is the most central trope that's
used and so it's the thing that occupies

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:02.670
used and so it's the thing that occupies
 

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.870
used and so it's the thing that occupies
this the core of the narrative and it

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880
this the core of the narrative and it
 

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.910
this the core of the narrative and it
drives it for it so you take it out the

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:07.920
drives it for it so you take it out the
 

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.010
drives it for it so you take it out the
coloring process is lost and the

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:10.020
coloring process is lost and the
 

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.050
coloring process is lost and the
mechanism then is this exposure to

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:12.060
mechanism then is this exposure to
 

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.910
mechanism then is this exposure to
knotts you sir so the story is typically

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:13.920
knotts you sir so the story is typically
 

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.460
knotts you sir so the story is typically
our experience of chaos the recognition

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:16.470
our experience of chaos the recognition

of ordered that contact with a Nazi and

these are the elements that hold the

these are the elements that hold the

whole thing together and you know what's
 

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.170
whole thing together and you know what's
missing is anti-semitism and that could

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:24.180
missing is anti-semitism and that could
 

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.030
missing is anti-semitism and that could

that some of these events are shared
 

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.100
that some of these events are shared
they share the same event so we identify

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.110
they share the same event so we identify
 

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:04.870

producing this this intersection of
incredible dense objects and there's a

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.230
incredible dense objects and there's a
 

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:43.770
incredible dense objects and there's a
million other things going on and my

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:43.780
million other things going on and my
 

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.359
million other things going on and my
idea is I'm going to tell the story of

00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:45.369
idea is I'm going to tell the story of
 

00:34:45.369 --> 00:34:47.609
idea is I'm going to tell the story of
this village and these things happen but

00:34:47.609 --> 00:34:47.619
this village and these things happen but
 

00:34:47.619 --> 00:34:48.960
this village and these things happen but
there's a part of some other history

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:48.970
there's a part of some other history
 

00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:51.839
there's a part of some other history
they're not the story of Lulu so my idea

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:51.849
they're not the story of Lulu so my idea
 

00:34:51.849 --> 00:34:54.030
they're not the story of Lulu so my idea
is that I'm like a rash amount i'm going

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040
is that I'm like a rash amount i'm going
 

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.500
is that I'm like a rash amount i'm going
to get i'm going to get the story of

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:55.510
to get i'm going to get the story of
 

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:56.730
to get i'm going to get the story of
Lulu I'm going to get the story of the

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:56.740
Lulu I'm going to get the story of the
 

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.559
Lulu I'm going to get the story of the
rape from multiple points of view

00:34:58.559 --> 00:34:58.569

00:34:58.569 --> 00:35:00.630
rape from multiple points of view
simultaneous so I'm go to the next slide

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640
simultaneous so I'm go to the next slide
 

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:05.390
simultaneous so I'm go to the next slide
and and here there's a whole series of

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400
and and here there's a whole series of
 

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.440
and and here there's a whole series of
components and network language of

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:07.450
components and network language of
 

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:12.540
components and network language of
components is a larger unit that you can

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:12.550
components is a larger unit that you can
 

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.910
components is a larger unit that you can
get to from anywhere so if you're in it

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920
get to from anywhere so if you're in it
 

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.620
get to from anywhere so if you're in it
you can connect to all the other events

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:16.630
you can connect to all the other events
 

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.300
you can connect to all the other events
so these are all the different

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.310
so these are all the different
 

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:21.780
so these are all the different
components there's a big yellow cohesive

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:21.790
components there's a big yellow cohesive
 

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:24.599
components there's a big yellow cohesive
component here they're all of your this

00:35:24.599 --> 00:35:24.609
component here they're all of your this
 

00:35:24.609 --> 00:35:26.250
component here they're all of your this
event is tied to every other yellow

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:26.260
event is tied to every other yellow
 

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.319
event is tied to every other yellow
event but there's some other look here's

00:35:28.319 --> 00:35:28.329
event but there's some other look here's
 

00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:30.240
event but there's some other look here's
a little red component that connects all

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:30.250
a little red component that connects all
 

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.460
a little red component that connects all
these red events and so on so there are

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:32.470
these red events and so on so there are
 

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.579
these red events and so on so there are
different stories moving on terms of

00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:35.589
different stories moving on terms of
 

00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:38.700
different stories moving on terms of
graphical representation there's not

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:38.710
graphical representation there's not
 

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.270
graphical representation there's not
really time anymore time sort of gone

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280
really time anymore time sort of gone
 

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:46.950
really time anymore time sort of gone
but there is is dent is depth this is an

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960
but there is is dent is depth this is an
 

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.380
but there is is dent is depth this is an
event up here that that has only one

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:49.390
event up here that that has only one
 

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.170
event up here that that has only one
event that's behind it and this is an

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:52.180
event that's behind it and this is an
 

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.480
event that's behind it and this is an
event down here that has many events

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:54.490
event down here that has many events
 

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.550
event down here that has many events
that are behind it so in rough terms

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560
that are behind it so in rough terms
 

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.579
that are behind it so in rough terms
time moves down because time the more

00:35:59.579 --> 00:35:59.589
time moves down because time the more
 

00:35:59.589 --> 00:36:01.800
time moves down because time the more
things happen before you the lower

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:01.810
things happen before you the lower
 

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.870
things happen before you the lower
you're going to be but that's not

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880
you're going to be but that's not
 

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.940
you're going to be but that's not
necessarily true so this is now just an

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:05.950
necessarily true so this is now just an
 

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.520
necessarily true so this is now just an
image of the depth of this history you

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:08.530
image of the depth of this history you
 

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:12.000
image of the depth of this history you
go to the next slide and here I'm trying

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.010
go to the next slide and here I'm trying
 

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.250
go to the next slide and here I'm trying
to say that that actually everybody

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:14.260
to say that that actually everybody
 

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.530
to say that that actually everybody
contributes in their own special way to

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:16.540
contributes in their own special way to
 

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.170
contributes in their own special way to
making this story of Lee look so here

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:19.180
making this story of Lee look so here
 

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.359
making this story of Lee look so here
the green people this is the green guide

00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:21.369
the green people this is the green guide
 

00:36:21.369 --> 00:36:26.720
the green people this is the green guide
or woman those are her elements and then

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:26.730
or woman those are her elements and then
 

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.210
or woman those are her elements and then
the yellow person's elements come in

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:30.220
the yellow person's elements come in
 

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.359
the yellow person's elements come in
here this is the brown person it's not

00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:33.369
here this is the brown person it's not
 

00:36:33.369 --> 00:36:35.339
here this is the brown person it's not
so they're all telling their own stories

00:36:35.339 --> 00:36:35.349
so they're all telling their own stories
 

00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:38.130
so they're all telling their own stories
and they interrelate with each other to

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:38.140
and they interrelate with each other to
 

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.220
and they interrelate with each other to
produce this little history

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:41.230
produce this little history
 

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.230
produce this little history
so it's not that I could I could take

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240
so it's not that I could I could take
 

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.599
so it's not that I could I could take
out a single person when I would have a
