00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:01.890
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.560
Welcome.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.240
It's my great pleasure to
introduce Andy Biggs.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.410
Andy's actually going
to do a lot of the

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.250
introduction himself.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.490
He's going to talk a little
bit about his work

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.500
and how he got here.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.990
But there's a couple of
highlights that I do

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.740
want to point out.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.870
So Andy was the winner of the
2008 BBC Wildlife Photographer

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.400
of the Year in the category
of Wild Places--

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.185
is that right?

00:00:24.185 --> 00:00:24.560
ANDY BIGGS: Yeah.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.820
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, and
it's a killer image.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.690
So that's one of the accolades
that he's got.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.259
Andy is a Silicon
Valley veteran.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.920
I don't know if he left or if
the Valley spit him out, but

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.500
I'm sure he'll tell you
the story of that.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.510
But Andy is one of the premier,
one of the best

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.060
African wildlife photographers
that I've ever met.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.120
And it's really awesome to have
him here and speak to us.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.295
So take it away.

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:54.536
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:57.010
ANDY BIGGS: OK, everybody
hear me OK?

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.400
All right.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.070
So I'm Andy.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.380
And I'm an African wildlife
photographer.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.420
And this is now my
fourth career.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.100
I'm 43 years old.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.920
And yes, I'm a Silicon
Valley veteran.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.830
We left in 2002.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.080
But when I got out of college in
1991, I was an accountant.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.160
And I thought that I
was great at that.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.290
I might have been decent
at it, but I hated it.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.810
I hated it.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.100
So I moved into the consulting
world doing financial software

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.410
systems for a long time and
ended up in Silicon Valley,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.000
working for Rational Software.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.500
And in 2000, somebody said, hey,
you want to go out with

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.700
me to go take some
photographs?

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.920
We're going to head over
to the ocean over

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.740
by Pescadero Beach.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.790
And you have a camera?

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.730
And I thought, no, I don't.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.110
So I guess I should buy one.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.190
So I headed up to Keeble
&amp; Shuchat,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.850
and I bought a camera.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.460
And that's been a journey now
that's lasted really for the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.130
better part of what,
13 years now?

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.020
So eventually, after working my
tail off in Silicon Valley,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.370
I decided that it was time
to end my time here.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.570
Because mainly we wanted
to start a family.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.580
And it was a very difficult
environment to start a

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.140
business, a safari business, out
here with a high cost of

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.760
living and try to make it all
work and start a family.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.960
So we moved back to where we're
from, which is Houston.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.590
And we put everything
in storage.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.530
And we took off for Tanzania.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.910
And we went away for
a month and a half.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.890
We had no plan after a week of
planning once we got there.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.700
So we said, we're going to go
climb Kilimanjaro for a week.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.390
And somewhere on Kilimanjaro,
we'd figure out what we're

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.370
going to do the next week.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.360
And then at the end of that
week, we'd figure out what's

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.860
going to happen the next week,
which is very unlike my

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.570
behavior, my personality.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.700
Because I used to
be a planner.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.890
I was a project manager.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.860
And so I used to plan everything
to the nuts.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.780
And so somewhere on
Kilimanjaro, I

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.400
realized that this is--

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.720
I needed to put a business plan
together to actually turn

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.150
this into a business.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.460
And now 11 years later, I'm
doing it full time.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.160
I've been doing it full time
for many years now.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.910
But it's been a blast.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.330
So what I wanted to do today
is talk about transitioning

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.490
from Silicon Valley--

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.770
what I call Silicon Valley
to the Serengeti--

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.940
and then talk about photography,
maybe just look

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.740
at some photographic examples,
look at them, talk about them,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.040
the approach to photography,
how I think creative

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.080
photography should be the
driving force behind people's

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.420
photographs, not what does this
button do, and how do I

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.850
make it work?

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.500
The creative side should always
drive the craft, not

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.320
the craft driving
the creative.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.750
So I want to get into
that a little bit.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.920
Aravind mentioned this
a minute ago.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.430
This is the winning image
from 2008's BBC Wildlife

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.090
Photographer of the Year.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.750
It's a photograph of the
Namibian Skeleton Coast, which

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.480
is a country just above
South Africa on the

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.360
western coast of Africa.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.250
And we were taking a bush plane
flight one day all the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.110
way up the coast towards
the border of Angola.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.610
And normally, the coastal fog
sits over the water, and you

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.620
can't see it.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.750
And this day, there was
no fog on the water.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.220
It was all over the
sand dunes.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.140
And these sand dunes
are basically 1,200

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.480
to 1,500 feet tall.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.230
So they're really, really
large dunes.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.170
And to give it a little bit of
perspective, there's actually

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:38.400
a seal colony down here on the
bottom part of the screen.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.260
Give a little bit
of perspective.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.460
So when it comes to photography,
I think the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.240
starting point of photography
should be coming up with a

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.570
list of adjectives, as opposed
to, I've got a camera, and

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.900
this is what I think
I want to see.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.060
And I'm just going to capture
everything in front of me.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.420
I like to start with a list of
adjectives, like hopeful,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.160
remote, timeless, regal,
uplifting, happy--

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.720
as opposed to aggressive, sad.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.300
There's a lot of different
approaches to wildlife

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.410
photography, and we're going
to see those in a minute.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.480
And I don't like to take that
approach that most other

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.600
people take.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.730
I'm looking for more big,
wide open scenes,

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.060
things that tell a story.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.510
Because photographers--

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.430
we are visual storytellers.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.870
And visual storytelling
is difficult.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.440
Because we have the assumption
that there are no words with

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.330
any photograph.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.370
Sometimes there are.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.860
If you're lucky, it's in a
magazine with a wonderful gold

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.610
border around the front.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.910
But most of the time,
we don't.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.780
Most the time, photographers
are trying to illustrate a

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.300
story with one photograph,
not a series of

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.960
photographs with no words.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.320
So here we've got a photograph
of a giraffe underneath an

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.150
acacia tree in the Serengeti
National Park.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.360
Just trying to get a sense of
place, what's going on.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.420
We have all grown up knowing
what giraffes look like.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.220
We've seen them in books.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.240
We've seen them in
children's books.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.610
And we know that they've
got spots.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.050
We know they've got horns.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.550
But we don't have to fill the
frame with it because our

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.610
memory fills in those gaps.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.880
All we have to do
is show a shape.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.830
And we're going to talk about
shapes a little bit with black

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.890
and white photography
a little bit later.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.990
But I thought kind of start
off the discussion talking

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.600
about the whole adjective
approach--

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.510
find out what you're interested
in and how to

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.470
photograph that.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.360
Because you're going to be
editing your photographs

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.320
before you even click
the shutter.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.430
How you compose and how you tell
a story is all starting

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.670
with that, your requirements.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.430
And the requirements are, for
me, hopeful, timeless, remote.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.920
I don't like to have anything
that looks like it's been

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.440
man-made in my scenes.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.430
I don't want a road or a path.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.930
Because sometimes we
are on roads in the

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.570
middle of the Serengeti.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.190
So when I left Silicon Valley
in 2002, I had to transition

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.510
into this world of being a
full-time photographer.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.430
So that requires income.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.500
And income for me comes from
running photographic safaris,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.050
not so much being
a photographer,

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.500
licensing the images.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.960
That does happen.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.030
But it's really leading
photographic safaris, teaching

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.210
photography out in the bush, and
showing people how to have

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.730
an appreciation for what they're
seeing and then how to

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.660
capture them.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.140
And here we've got two young
lionesses on the ground that

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.340
we get this eye contact with.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.820
And I look for photographs
that have some sort of

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.780
connection to the viewer, that
somehow draws the viewer in.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.840
And a lot of times, the eyes are
the things that are doing

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.090
that for us.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.460
Here's another kind
of scenic image.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.350
Here is a bull elephant, a
male bull elephant in the

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.060
Okavango Delta in Botswana.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.470
Looking for some clouds, a
little bit of background, a

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.990
reflection, but something that
kind of places the animal in

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.890
its environment, that kind of
tells us the bigger picture,

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.560
as opposed to filling
the frame.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.910
Not to say that I
don't do that.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:58.910
I do that as well.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.610
But I try to vary the looks of
the photographs so that people

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.460
don't get what I would call
visual fatigue, the

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.840
same-looking photograph
every time.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.890
And the way that photographers
should and can do that is by

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:16.320
shooting vertical, horizontal,
zooming in, zooming out, going

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.360
in for detailed shots, going
in for big landscape shots.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.460
Here's one of my
safari groups.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.550
You can tell this was
a winter day.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.580
This is in July in Botswana.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.380
And we all have our
jackets on.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.950
And coming from Texas in
July, it's awesome.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.289
Because it's 105 degrees
where I am in July.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.280
And I can get on a plane,
and it's 45.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.530
It's fantastic.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:47.820
Again, back to this visual
storytelling idea--

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.270
when shooting in black and
white, which is very different

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.300
from color, one has to really
pay attention to shapes.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.510
Because when you remove the
color information from a

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.870
photograph, you're basically
left with nothing but shapes

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.490
and textures.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:06.890
And there's a language with
color that's all removed.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:12.380
So whenever we talk about
contrast in photographs, we

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.860
usually talk about--

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.790
we're thinking of black
to white, something

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.230
with a lot of contrast.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.800
But in the color world, we have
hue contrasts, so the

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.350
difference between reds
and blues, or

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.130
maybe blues and yellows.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.900
But we take that away, and we
have to have more to stand on.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.680
And so what I do is I'm always
looking for clean backgrounds,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.300
clean elements that are easy
for the human eye to figure

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.750
out what's going on.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.240
And here we sat here, watching
this lioness on a rock.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.620
She was asleep for
a few hours.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.160
And we just wanted her
to wake up and yawn.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.230
It's all we wanted
her to do, right?

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.320
So sometimes sitting around in
a Land Rover for hours is an

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.400
opportunity to read a
book, tell jokes,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.540
take a nap, do whatever.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.380
But patience pays off.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.610
Patience pays off.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.620
And in the safari world, driving
around in a vehicle

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.570
thinking that something's going
to happen right when you

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.945
pull up to it is
very misguided.

00:10:06.945 --> 00:10:09.190
It's very misguided, because
it never ever

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.220
happens that way.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.040
You don't drive around
and you're like, oh,

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.770
wow, look at that.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.600
There's a lion about
to kill something.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.375
No, you have to watch
things transpire.

00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:21.760
And you have to pay attention to
what's going on around you.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.740
Now, this is the opposite of
what I talked about a minute

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.550
ago, which is kind of the big
scene, the big overall

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.040
sweeping vista.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.140
This is a photograph of a mother
elephant walking across

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.040
the road in front of
us, protecting

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.610
the rest of her family.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.660
She just stops, looks, makes
her ears look larger.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.720
And certain mammals are easier
to photograph than others.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.150
Elephants, I think,
are the easiest.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.570
And the reason why they're the
easiest is that they give a

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.770
lot of non-verbal cues.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:54.130
Because how they socialize with
their other family units,

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.840
proximity, their tail movement,
how they move their

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.930
head gives you an idea of
what their mood is.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.720
And ultimately, that's what
I'm trying to convey.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.510
So we're back to the whole list
of adjectives, right?

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.210
If you come up with that list of
adjectives, you're going to

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.430
be looking for very specific
behavior in an animal to try

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.800
to photograph that moment.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.630
And sometimes, storytelling is
kind of bending the truth.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.420
Back to simple elements.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.110
This is a photograph in South
Africa a few years ago.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.380
We just waited for a lioness
to climb up into a tree,

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.300
because she saw a herd
of Cape buffalo.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.880
She wanted to get a better
vantage point, figure out how

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.820
to approach them.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.050
So she jumped up in the
tree, looked around.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.890
And I was hoping to get a shot
where her tail was actually

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.040
still in the frame.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.590
Because a lot of times,
photographers, we will get so

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.950
excited and zoom in and
go straight for

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.295
the eyes, the head.

00:11:45.295 --> 00:11:47.970
And we'll totally forget about
the tail and the legs and

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.150
everything else.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.860
So you have to have a lot of
breathing room in these

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.110
photographs.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.210
So we've mentioned
a few images.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.160
And we'll return to
those in a minute.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.950
But I wanted to talk about the
life of a safari photographer.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.950
When I started this business, I
was thinking, oh, I'm going

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.230
to take a bunch of
photographs.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.380
It's going to be great.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.040
I'm going to lead
some safaris.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.610
I'll take some photographs.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.730
And that's going to be it.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.440
Well, the reality is that
I'm a marketing guy.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.060
I've got to build a brand, who
I am, communicate that out to

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.680
the market.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.120
I've got to sell safaris.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.290
I've got to put them together.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.390
It helps to have a cost
accounting background.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.870
So I know how all the
international rates work with

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.870
the monetary and how to hedge.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.920
And I have to be able
to run a trip.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.930
I have to be a leader.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.890
I have to be a guide.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.750
I have to be able to say,
this is a giraffe.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.450
Here's what it's doing.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.440
Here's why it's doing it.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.530
Here's how to photograph it.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.785
I have to be a photographer.

00:12:47.785 --> 00:12:48.840
I have to be a teacher.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.640
I have to teach photography.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.700
Andy, what's an f-stop?

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.470
What's shutter speed, ISO?

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.550
What's all that going on?

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.490
I don't understand
how to do that.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.970
And I have to be an accountant
when I get back home, because

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.140
I still have to pay vendors.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.930
I still have to keep
the business going.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.700
And so I have to wear a
lot of different hats.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.810
But I'm an outsource
model kind of guy.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.180
So I outsource to these
different companies in Africa

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.650
for the camps.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.120
I outsource to these
guys as agents.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.880
And I have myself
in the office.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.820
I used to have an assistant,
who used to do a lot of fun

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.490
printing for me.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.710
But he moved up to New York.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.520
And I haven't seen
him in a while.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.750
But for the most part, I'm
an outsourced business.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.020
It's really great because I have
the freedom to not really

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.080
worry about a lot of things.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.370
And I just kind of remotely
manage other vendors.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.650
In 2008, I licensed a bunch of

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.690
photographs to Banana Republic.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.210
And as a wildlife photographer,
it's a very

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.460
unusual environment to be in.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.800
So essentially, Banana
Republic being in

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.980
the clothing world--

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.290
I would call them still in the
fashion world, even though

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.310
it's not high fashion--

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.710
a wildlife photographer existing
in a fashion world is

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.380
like oil and vinegar.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.440
We have two totally different
languages.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.510
And when their ad agency called
me and said, hey, we'd

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.720
love to use your photographs
as the cornerstone of our

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.910
urban safari campaign.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:09.900
What do you think?

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.730
I thought, yeah, it
sounds great.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.690
But I have no idea
what you want.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.980
So let's figure this
out together.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.760
So what they ultimately did
was they used a bunch of

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.900
images in their stores,
all their 750 stores.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.930
They put them in their marketing
brochures, on their

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.210
website, billboards--

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:27.910
you name it, in anything
they wanted to.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.260
And they licensed these images
for sole use for four months.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.900
Nobody else could use them
for any other purposes.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.620
And it was a lot of fun.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.630
It was a lot of fun because I
learned a lot about how that

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.640
world works.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.820
And being a former project
manager, showing up and doing

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.620
contract negotiation
was a lot of fun.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.940
Because now I was in the
driver's seat working with an

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.490
ad agency of creative people
negotiating contracts.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.620
So that was a lot of fun.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.360
So what they did is they
basically put them in all

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.900
stores, every little nook
and cranny where

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.680
they could find it.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.150
And I don't know if anybody
remembers in that year a lot

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.660
of women handbags, giraffe-print
purses?

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.130
That was the campaign that
we did together.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.260
I think the most fun part of
that negotiation is when they

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.690
came back and said, Andy, we
could really use a few more

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:23.740
images for our stores.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.700
We're kind of stretching
these images a lot.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.090
People are going to walk into
different sales areas within

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.370
the stores, and they're going
to see the same photographs.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.450
Could we do more?

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:33.620
I said, yeah, sure.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.740
Just you know what
this many took.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.450
Take that.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.390
You can figure out the
cost pretty quickly.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.470
And they said, well, we kind
of ran out of money.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:46.800
And I said, oh, well, being a
former budgeting guy, I can

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.910
figure this out.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.210
So if you ran out of money,
let's go find somebody else's

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.440
budget that has money.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.800
And they said, OK, well,
give us an idea.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.440
And I said, you know what?

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.790
Let's throw a party.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.240
Let's throw a party where
I can get some PR

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.760
value out of this.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.940
So they threw a big party.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.860
And what they did is they
basically announced to all

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.320
their Visa cardholders for
Banana Republic, if you've

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.460
made a purchase--

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.610
I think it was at least $600 in
the last 12 months, and you

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.110
live within 100 miles
of San Francisco--

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.920
we're going to send
you an invitation.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.540
And we're going to have
a private party.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.170
We're going to serve alcohol.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.290
We're going to have a DJ.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.170
We're going to put
it in our store.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.220
And we had something like 900
people come through the doors

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.570
in 120 minutes.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.140
And it was a lot of fun because
it just kind of

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.710
created a lot of PR for me.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.290
And I got some additional
value out of that.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:43.140
And then they said, OK, well,
can we use those images now?

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.270
I said, well, let's keep working
on this a little more.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.690
And I said, you know
what you should do?

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:55.900
You should design, print,
distribute, oh, maybe 100,000

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.660
About Andy cards and put them
behind the checkout counter of

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.950
every store.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.790
If you like these photographs,
maybe you could buy one, too.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.010
So we drove additional sales.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.750
We hit another different budget
within the organization

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.190
that allowed us to--

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.300
I could basically earn more
income indirectly from them

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.540
without them really having
to spend much money.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.260
So there are all these really
creative things that

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.780
photographers can do that are
not necessarily someone

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.310
cutting you a check.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.520
In this world right now, there's
so many people that

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.000
contact photographers that say,
oh, we'd love to use your

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.640
photographs.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.780
We have no budget.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.940
And I have a really nice
response to that.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.510
It's usually something to the
effect of, thank you for your

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.340
consideration.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.130
I appreciate that.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.000
Boil it down, that doesn't
pay the bills.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.990
I'd love to donate to
your organization.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:50.380
But I do that through a
different process, so sorry.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.550
And then in 2008, it was another
big part of the year,

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.310
I started a camera
bag company.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.820
Has anybody heard of
Gura Gear before?

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.730
So I started that in 2008.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.870
And I was really tired of
carrying around heavy, heavy,

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.780
heavy camera bags.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.880
You can imagine, as a wildlife
photographer, I was carrying

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.290
big lenses with me.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.610
The problem is that most
international airlines are

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.720
limited to 10, 12 kilos for
carryons, so like 22, 24,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.910
maybe 25 pounds at the most.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.480
And if you're carrying a 500 or
600 millimeter lens, that's

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.420
8 to 12 pounds.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.300
That's 50% of your weight
allocation right there.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.430
And most bags that can
carry that lens

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.960
weigh 7 to 12 pounds.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.970
So suddenly, you're on safari
with no camera,

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.485
a bag, and a lens.

00:18:36.485 --> 00:18:37.410
That doesn't work.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.490
So I removed all the weight.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.960
And here's a little product
promo shot I took in Kenya a

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.210
couple years ago.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:53.800
So how does a wildlife
photographer shoot?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.200
Here in the States, most
wildlife photography is done

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.100
handheld, on a tripod.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.770
You walk out into a field,
and you take photographs.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:05.300
Well, in Africa, much of it is
done with a Land Cruiser or a

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.570
Land Rover.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.060
And we basically drive
out on safari.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.560
We usually do two game
drives in a day.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.620
And we just go see
what we can see.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.550
But we always have some
sort of game plan.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.190
And the game plan is we're going
to track the second we

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.090
leave camp.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.630
We're going to track big paws.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:21.670
We're looking for leopards.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:22.920
We're looking for lions.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.630
What are they doing?

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.960
Where are they going?

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.580
And in the morning, that's
my morning paper.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.570
That's the first thing that
I read in the morning.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.750
We're trying to figure out
what's going on, what happened

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.810
in the night, where
did everything go.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:35.970
And we track.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.770
And in this photograph, we've
got a tracker sitting on the

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.510
hood of the vehicle who's
helping us figure out where

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:43.630
everything's going.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.700
And at some point, he may get
out of the vehicle, take a

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.440
rifle, and walk off for half
an hour or an hour.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.600
And we'll go pick him
up some other area.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.820
And he'll be self sufficient.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.060
He's just trying to track
what's going on.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.540
This is another vehicle
configuration without a

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.440
canopy, when it's
cooler outside.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.180
And you can see we've got bean
bags that we set up to support

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.920
our lenses.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.360
And it's really fairly easy.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.000
You don't have to
do much work.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.120
The guides and the trackers do
all the work for you-- yes?

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.570
He was asking, is there
are some sort of

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.960
clamp to the rail?

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.310
There is a clamp with a
stem and a bean bag

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.690
sitting right there.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:24.860
I bring those on safari with
me for all my customers.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.500
And anybody who likes to go
off-roading in the States has

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.520
no clue until you get into one
of these big bad boys.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.240
These are great because
they've got big, huge

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.870
inflatable tires.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.680
And this is in the Okavango
Delta, where the water is

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.320
often over the top
of the tires.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.450
So we're having to drive through
through the water to

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.160
get to another area.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.360
It's pretty common.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.460
I kind of giggle a little bit
when I see vehicles with the

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.110
snorkels on them here
in the States.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.770
I'm thinking, when was the last
time you forded a river?

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.620
Probably not yet.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.430
Yeah, and then sometimes,
we just use a bean bag.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.000
Sometimes we handhold
our lenses.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.450
The neat thing about most of the
safaris that I run is that

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.080
you don't have to have huge
lenses to get great

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.530
photographs.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.840
Remember, it's all about
visual storytelling.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.460
Visual storytelling doesn't mean
you have to zoom in on

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.590
everything.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.243
And at the end of the
presentation, I want to talk

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:24.020
to you about one idea of how to
visually tell a story in 10

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.340
photographs--

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.980
just some ideas on that.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.380
And here we've got a lioness
lying on a vehicle.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.320
We were all laughing, thinking,
oh, that guy can't

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.790
leave any time soon.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.670
And then right when we were
chuckling, we saw

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:37.920
his hand stick out.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.230
[LAUGHING]

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:44.020
ANDY BIGGS: OK, it's perfect
timing, isn't it?

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.900
Yeah, they were stuck there
for quite a while.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:52.090
You may see a lot of wildlife
images of something like this,

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.050
where you've got an animal
filling the frame.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.720
And you maybe don't understand
what's really going on.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.680
Because you're not--

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.080
the photographer's
only selecting a

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.010
small area of the scene.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.350
What's really going on is
something like this.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:11.040
So here's a vehicle behind on
the other side that we sat

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.890
there and waited for him
to walk towards us.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.760
Normally, we won't get that
close to the wildlife.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.890
We let them get closer to us.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.830
And we're just waiting
for him to walk off.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.530
Here's Laurie.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.705
So this is a typical
vehicle in Kenya.

00:22:26.705 --> 00:22:30.310
A little bit different, where
you can stand up, as well.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.310
I think I've got an image
of that in a minute.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.830
You can just put your bean
bag down there and take a

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.080
photograph.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.850
And if you make me angry, I'm
going to make you pull the

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.220
vehicle out of the mud.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.890
This is just a photo op.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.750
We were laughing and giggling.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.390
I told one of my travelers,
hey, get out there

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.640
and pull the chain.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.270
But not all photography is
done from a Land Rover.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.320
We're often flying around
in helicopters.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.090
And helicopters are very, very,
very efficient ways of

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:07.030
getting a unique angle
to wildlife.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.050
The challenge with that is you
don't want to fly too close.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.930
Because the closer you get with
a really loud turbine

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.090
engine, the more they get scared
or angry, and they'll

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.860
go away from you.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.230
You don't want that.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.570
And so what we do is we have
these helicopters in Botswana.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.390
And we will take
the doors off.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.950
And every now and then somebody
will ask me a

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:30.500
question like, Andy, what about
the air conditioning?

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.986
No problem on that
one, you've got--

00:23:32.986 --> 00:23:34.360
anyway.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.230
So we put two photographers on
the left and one on the right.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:41.190
And we basically fly figure
eights around our subject.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.690
And here you can see a
little bit closer in

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.760
with a fisheye lens.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.170
We put our gear on the floor.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.410
We put it on the side.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.480
And we're always in contact with
the pilot, saying, hey,

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.250
check that out over here.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.640
Let's go check that out.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.050
And what I'm always looking
for is something that is

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.440
clear, away from
the vegetation.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.970
Remember that most animals are
looking to either drink, eat,

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:09.430
sleep, fight, fornicate.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.080
And you have to think about
that, which means most of the

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.550
time, they're going to
be in the shade.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.000
They're going to be next to a
tree, not out in the middle of

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.680
a field, unless they're
a grazer.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.060
So here we've got some
giraffes walking off.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:28.660
Here we've got some elephants
in some shallow water.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.060
Again, it's not about zooming in
and filling the frame with

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.710
your subject.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.060
This is actually from a
helicopter shooting way out at

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.520
a low angle, just a gentle
sloping angle.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.520
And here's one from a couple
months ago in November, in the

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.130
Delta, the Okavango Delta, where
we've got a small family

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.290
herd of four elephants--

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.540
mother in the front, nice
separation between all the

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.630
individuals.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.610
And remember, we've been
talking about shape.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.090
And shape is really important
for the photographer.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.980
Whenever you've got shape,
it's separated from

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.030
foreground, background.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:05.230
That's good, because it helps us
home in on what the subject

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.310
is all about.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.820
If you've got a really, really
complicated background, it's

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.650
hard for the viewer to
understand what's going on.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:13.490
They have to work that
much harder.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.410
And whenever you've got a color
difference between your

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.080
subject and the background,
that's good.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.260
That's separation.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.770
Whenever you've got a
light difference--

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.420
black to white, a
hue difference--

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:28.650
those are tools that we use to
help create those shapes or

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.900
separate the shapes.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.025
Whenever someone says, hey,
Andy, what are the tents like

00:25:36.025 --> 00:25:39.760
in Tanzania or camping out in
the Serengeti, I just have to

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.580
show one photograph and say,
this is not a tent that you

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.440
had in Boy Scouts.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.530
This is a proper tent.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.190
You've got plumbing, even
though it's temporary.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.610
So we'll set these up.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.610
We call these Hemingway-style
camps.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.810
But it's not roughing it.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.780
So whenever I leave home and
go out to the Serengeti or

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.890
Botswana or wherever I go, we're
always well taken care

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.390
of so we can focus
on photography.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:06.930
And sometimes we stay
in really super

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.260
swanky places like this.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.740
Electricity--

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.180
either using solar for the camp,
and sometimes they use

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.640
backup diesel generators.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.370
And then we'll usually eat
outdoors at night.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.425
So I never have to worry about
accommodations, food,

00:26:22.425 --> 00:26:22.940
anything like that.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.950
Yes?

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:25.320
Yeah, so the question
is, how much editing

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.560
is done in the field?

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.430
For me, it's very different from
my travelers, my guests,

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.100
my customers.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.570
I'd say most of my customers
download once a day, look at

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.200
their photographs,
not edit them.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.100
Look at them.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.070
Learn from them.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.160
And then put what they've
learned in action the next

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.970
game drive or the next day.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.630
I have something over 200 gigs
of compact flash cards--

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:48.650
I don't know, something
like that.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:52.690
And I will probably download
every three to five days.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:53.810
Because I'm really busy.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.150
My day is back from a game
drive, everybody heads to

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.040
their tents, to their rooms.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.050
And I'm basically making sure
that lunch is going to be on

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:06.390
time, what's going on, getting
a presentation ready for the

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.650
night, the evening time--

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.830
what are we going to do in the
afternoon game drive--

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.830
maybe working with somebody one
on one with their laptop.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.700
So I don't get a chance to
download very often.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.890
So I just live off the
grid for a long time.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.850
And then hopefully I'll
back up at some point.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.330
Sometimes, we'll have these
really cool adventures like

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:32.030
going to Mahale Mountains, which
is on the western part

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.730
of Tanzania, which is on Lake
Tanganyika on the western side

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.070
is Democratic Republic
of Congo.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.960
And this is on the
Tanzania side.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.290
It's the second largest, by
volume, freshwater lake in the

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:46.310
world nobody has
ever heard of.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.300
But it's amazing.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.760
And to go there, it takes six
hours of bush plane flights,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.025
and having to go up and down
on a dhow, a boat.

00:27:55.025 --> 00:27:58.110
You can see the boat on the
bottom part of this frame--

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.250
into this mountain area looking
for wild chimpanzees.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:05.150
Chimpanzees are very, very
difficult to track.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.150
Because you have to have
a lot of trackers.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.070
And they move often.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.050
So the trackers leave at 6
o'clock in the morning.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.190
They go up into the forest.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.700
And they start radioing in where
they've seen them last,

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.260
where they bed down, where
are they heading,

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.520
where are they eating.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.370
And then hopefully when you
arrive two, three, four hours

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.050
later, and you've been
hiking, they haven't

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.050
gone away too far.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.310
But sometimes they do.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.330
So it might involve 6, 8, 10
hours of trekking in the day

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.030
just to find your subjects.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.990
And then the area they say, once
you get to them, you can

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.530
only photograph them
for 60 minutes.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.690
And then you must leave.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.530
So it's very restrictive.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:42.050
And these are very wild animals,
very difficult

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:42.760
photography.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.050
For those who are into
photography and all the techie

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:49.765
nerdy stuff, basically, this is
with a 70 to 200 lens on a

00:28:49.765 --> 00:28:53.970
D700 shooting at probably
ISO 3200, wide open.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:54.970
It's a dark canopy.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.920
It's a very, very, very
difficult place to photograph.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:04.170
But it's also one of
the most rewarding.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.310
This was in South Africa
few years ago.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:11.660
We were watching a lioness take
out an impala in the mud.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:17.480
And she obviously had
mud all over her.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.660
This is the extreme part, the
northern part of Namibia,

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.560
along the Angola border.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.300
It's the Himba tribe.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.300
And even though I photograph
wildlife primarily, I love to

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:30.340
photograph cultures all
throughout Africa.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:34.860
And these are fascinating
people, some of the last

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.560
semi-nomadic people in Africa.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:42.950
And what's great about them
photographically is they still

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.510
dress traditionally.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:48.490
And they cover themselves with
an ochre that's been mixed

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.610
with a butter fat.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:54.740
And they coat their bodies and
also burn and smoke some

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.800
Commiphora for basically
their smell.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.290
They smell really nice.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.280
And it's really fascinating
to shoot them.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.480
So on this day, we decided,
hey, let's go to the local

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.920
village, basically hut, and
let's see if they'll let us

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.490
take their photographs.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.100
And we went there.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.980
And they said, oh, yeah,
we'd love to do that.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.930
And we said, OK, would
you mind walking

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:18.510
out on the sand dunes?

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:19.650
And they started laughing.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.510
They're like, we
do that anyway.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.360
Why would you pay
us to do that?

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.770
And they said, wait, pay.

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:27.250
Oh, yeah, so can you bring us
back-- we'll do it tomorrow--

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.535
but can you bring
us some tobacco,

00:30:28.535 --> 00:30:30.460
some sugar, some maize.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.610
So we went off and bought some
of that and brought it back.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:36.550
And they just thought it was the
most hysterical thing to

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.710
walk out on the dunes, which
they do every day anyway.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.770
And it was a fun time.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.040
It was a fun time.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.160
Here's a Maasai in Tanzania
a few years ago.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.980
I find cultural photography a
little more difficult for me.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.340
I'm used to photographing
animals, where it's a little

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:59.220
less of an intimate
relationship, even though I

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.110
observe and watch.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.570
People photography is something
that I have to force

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.780
myself to do and try
harder and harder.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:10.640
And I find it hard because
it's the separation of

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.460
background and separation
of subject that

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.030
always intrigues me.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.310
So here we've got a greeting
dance that they're greeting us

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.890
when we came into the village.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.360
And they're all encircling us.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:32.960
We talked about action, where
we talked about this

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.100
adjective-driven approach
to photography.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.790
And it doesn't mean
that I always stay

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.910
within those bounds.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:43.300
Here we've got action
at a water hole.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.070
And I'll shoot it.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.790
I may not show it a lot.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:50.400
So there's a difference
between shooting,

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.440
editing, and showing.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.640
So I have to communicate on my
blog, on Google+, on all these

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.975
different places, what I'm
doing, who I am, what my

00:32:00.975 --> 00:32:02.410
photography looks like.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.170
Because I'm trying to
reach people to go

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.610
on safari with me.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.400
And I have to think about what
they want from their safari

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.900
versus just what I want.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.590
So I have to separate my
portfolios, the one that I

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:17.480
like to print and sell versus
what I want to communicate for

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.980
people to get them interested
in coming with me.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:24.420
And a lot of men, specifically,
are interested

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.800
like, I want to kill.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.440
I want to kill.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.760
I'm like, OK.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.940
So I have to communicate that
side of the business.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.190
And then usually once somebody
sees it, they're like, yeah,

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:35.890
let's not do that again.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:36.550
It's really funny.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:39.960
Once you see it and you realize,
it's maybe not what

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.720
you hoped for.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.520
But it usually involves a lot
of sitting, a lot waiting, a

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.900
lot of patience.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.370
And this actually happened on
the safari with Aravind a few

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.210
years ago, two years ago
in the Serengeti--

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.170
we just sat by a water hole.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.540
Again, action--

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.480
there's a little bit of implied
activity going on here

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.040
that's not maybe true.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.480
Here we've got a hippo in the
late afternoon, yawning.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.070
But it looks aggressive.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.460
It looks like he's being
very, very aggressive.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.660
This also isn't a really
large adult.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.110
It's more of a teenager
or a young adult.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.970
But you see all the water
splash going on.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:26.180
I'm showing the aggressive
side of photography or of

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.170
African wildlife.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:28.770
Here we've got an elephant.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:32.120
We pulled around a corner,
and she decides she

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:32.800
didn't want us there.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.160
And she just basically opened
up her eyes and took off.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.610
We startled her.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:39.970
It wasn't intentional.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.890
But it was a photographic
moment.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.670
I love to slow down
the shutter speed.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.790
Now, slowing down the shutter
speed gives this implied

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:53.050
movement, implied
action, power--

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.140
the adjective-driven
approach, right--

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.270
this power.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.000
And if you can slow your
shutter speed down to

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.510
something like a 60th, a 30th, a
10th, maybe even far down as

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:09.330
something like a fifth of a
second, it really shows a

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.480
different side of photography.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.429
It can be very creative.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.340
It's very difficult, very
frustrating to shoot this way.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.460
Because you may shoot 200
or 300 photographs

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.690
and get zero keepers.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:22.550
But pixels are cheap,
ie, free.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.179
And you can just delete them.

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:24.969
It's OK.

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:28.750
But it takes a lot of
patience to shoot

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:29.639
slower shutter speeds.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:31.280
Because you have to pan
through the shot.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.199
You have to have the same
autofocus point on the same

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:36.350
spot of the subject all
the way through.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.690
And you have to learn which
shutter speeds are appropriate

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:43.429
for which animals and
how fast they are.

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.820
Like something walking, you'd
really slow down their shutter

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.560
speed versus something
that's running.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.610
I also love this kind of
interaction between species.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:56.850
I'm not necessarily a
bird photographer.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:59.760
But I won't shy away from
being an opportunistic

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.470
photographer, taking shots
when I can get them.

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:04.620
So here, we've got a Cape
buffalo, which most people

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.650
think of as a very dangerous,
aggressive--

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:08.720
they can be--

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.835
animal, with a bird.

00:35:10.835 --> 00:35:15.930
It almost has this kind of yin
and yang approach to it.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:16.950
This is called an oxpecker.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.160
And it's a symbiotic
relationship, where the

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.080
oxpecker is basically cleaning
the animal of ticks.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.330
And the animal wants it there.

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:27.260
But not the only animal
that likes it there.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.020
Here's an oxpecker
on a white rhino.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.720
So I love these kind of
relationships between animals,

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.420
if you can get them.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.290
And it's often difficult.

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.340
Because there aren't that
many that interact.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:40.150
Usually, it's predatory--

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.150
animals trying to kill
something else.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.670
Or maybe paying attention to
those small little details

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:45.850
that make you laugh.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.730
Here we've got two brothers that
are just pulling on each

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.510
other's ear.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.270
I mean, mom was over
there eating.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:53.310
And the other mom was eating.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.990
And they just were playing
around and horsing around.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.390
And it was about just finding
those little small moments,

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:04.320
those little small details that
kind of make you laugh.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.790
Lighting and wildlife
photography and nature

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.230
photography is very important.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.250
There are so many different
types of lighting.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:16.580
We wanted to use the language
of angles of light.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.160
Where is the light in relation
to your subject?

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:24.590
We also have the language of
soft, harsh, warm, cold.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:29.150
And you have to think about
environments and situations

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:32.530
when they're going to a certain
light is going to

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.070
bring you something
that's different.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.750
So always play to
the positives.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:40.070
Here we've got a hot
air balloon--

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.860
I'm in a balloon myself--

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.430
a hot air balloon.

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:45.360
But we also have what looks
like fog on the ground.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.750
Well, whenever you put light
behind anything in the air

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:56.240
like rain, sleet, snow, water,
vapor, dust, fog, it

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:56.830
illuminates.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.340
It shows up.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.100
And so if you throw light behind
there, it transforms

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:01.970
the photograph.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:02.940
This is actually not fog.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.640
This is actually the dust from
the vehicles that were chasing

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.630
the hot air balloons to make
sure that when we landed,

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.690
there was somebody to
grab the ropes.

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:14.390
But it's still about visual
storytelling, right?

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:16.150
The angle of light is
really important.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:20.470
And if anybody has watched the
BBC's "Planet Earth," you'll

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:24.030
notice this in probably
75% of their shots.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:26.870
Basically, they're doing what
I call 3/4 lighting, which

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.680
means that the light is behind
the subject, but not direct

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.190
enough to cause a lens
flare on the lens.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.050
This helps define the shape.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.360
Because there's an adage in
photography that light

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.560
illuminates and shadows
define.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.340
And a shadow is necessary to
have a line or an edge.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.210
So where are you going to put
the shadow and the edge?

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:49.110
Well, I like it on the
edge of the animal.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.260
Makes sense, right?

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.560
So here we've got this nice
soft glow on the left-hand

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.200
side, or the edge,
like a rim light.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.810
But there's still enough light
to illuminate her face.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.250
And we have these great
processing tools now, when we

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.680
develop our photographs, where
we can pull out things from

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.030
the shadows, where in the
film world, this was

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.210
hard to pull off.

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.850
You could do it.

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:10.490
You just had to nail your
exposure within

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:12.930
a third of a stop.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.080
We talked about harsh
light a second ago.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.980
Play to the positives.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.810
If it's a harsh light, just
blow out the sky.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.070
There are a lot of photographers
out there that

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.790
are shooting portraits and
weddings that are doing this.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:25.760
And they're setting the trend.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.390
And wildlife photographers like
myself are just taking it

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:31.710
and running with it and
doing the same thing.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.970
So here, we've got a back-lit
leopard in a tree.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:36.160
And it's created a nice rim
light around her paws.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.510
You can see the bottom
of her body.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.720
And you don't really worry about
the sky because there's

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.160
nothing interesting
in the sky.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.600
Same kind of concept here.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.240
Actually, in the original file,
there's quite a bit of

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.490
lens flare.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.400
I'm OK with it.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.860
When I started this in 2002,
I used to be so picky about

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.990
everything that was
inside that frame.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.430
And I wanted everything
to be perfect.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.030
And now I'm just, pfft.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.230
11 years later, I just
will shoot it.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.540
And if it looks cool--

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.870
as long as it's conveying a
sense of space, that people

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.620
have some sort of emotional
reaction to the photograph,

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.500
then it's a successful image,
even if it has a lot of

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.910
technical faults.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:21.590
If you guys read magazines like
"National Geographic,"

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:23.600
you'll probably notice that
there are a lot of images with

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.320
significant technical faults.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.440
But it doesn't matter.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.160
Because it's about visual
storytelling and conveying

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.690
what needs to be said.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.250
And so what if something
is a little bit blurry?

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:37.000
It just doesn't matter as long
as the overall image works.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.720
Again, here's another
back-lit image.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:43.110
Here's a leopard in a tree.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.390
Here's a good example.

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:48.140
Here's kind of the standard sun
over my shoulder, looking

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.270
at the leopard.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:50.050
She looks up.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:51.660
That's great.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.890
There's really nothing
going on.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.300
It's direct.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.600
It's flat because there's
no shadow.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.700
So why not drive onto the
other side and get a

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.530
photograph on that side, which
looks a lot more dramatic?

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:06.440
I would prefer not to have
the tree growing

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.910
right through her head.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:12.160
But basically, sometimes
you have to take

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.290
what you can take.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.730
But it's a different look.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.640
You're able to get more of that
contrast, more of the

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.470
color, a lot more drama,
because you're

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.690
getting those shadows.

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:23.790
Speaking of shadows,
silhouettes, another approach

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.370
to photography, as long
as you've got the

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:27.750
shape worked out.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:31.730
Silhouettes are all
about shape.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:34.810
This is such a common scenario,
which drives most

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.450
photographers crazy--

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:38.920
complicated subject, complicated
background,

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.410
complicated light, complicated
everything.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:44.650
It's hard to figure out what's
going on other than it looks

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.860
like you've got a lying
leopard up in a tree.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.070
This is not processed.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.790
This is straight out
of the camera.

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:52.210
But it illustrates a typical
scenario, where you're like,

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:53.810
oh, that's cool.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.110
But it's really, really
hard to pull off.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:59.385
Here we've got a big branch
right in front of her body, a

00:40:59.385 --> 00:40:59.970
lot of lines.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:02.730
I mean, nature is inherently
messy.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.860
And it's our jobs as
photographers to clean it up.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:10.820
And I think of that cleaning
up as usually removal.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:15.530
We're using our lenses to
include or exclude things.

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:18.810
So I think photography is all
about excluding things as

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.080
opposed to including things.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.410
Like a painter includes
things--

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.670
blank canvas, add stuff.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:27.280
We take things out.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.450
But this is what I'd
rather have.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.170
I'd rather have that.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:34.640
So now we have an
easier-to-figure-out subject,

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.350
because we've got the
light on her.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:42.985
We've got an easier set of tree
branches that are not all

00:41:42.985 --> 00:41:44.830
in the way.

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:48.630
That's what we're looking for--
not this, but that.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.540
And it just takes patience and
spending time and waiting.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.670
Usually a leopard hangs out in a
tree until it wants to hunt,

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.150
which is usually at night, which
means you find them in

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:58.620
the afternoon, they're probably
going to be there

00:41:58.620 --> 00:41:59.560
later in the afternoon.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.130
So we drive around and do some
other things, return back to

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.090
the same tree.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.750
And maybe a photograph isn't
always about color.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:09.310
When do you use color
versus when do you

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:10.270
use black and white?

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:13.040
We talked about shape, right?

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.200
Well, color works, but maybe
shape works, too,

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.990
for black and white.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:19.550
I'm not sure which one's
better here.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:20.770
They're different.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.180
But I encourage you to take
photographs that maybe didn't

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.490
have good color, consider
it as a black and white.

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:29.970
I like to have very contrasty
photographs where there's a

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:33.560
deep black and a bright white in
every scene that helps get

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.700
an overall sense of--

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.880
drama, I think, gets
added from that.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:44.360
And then I love intimacy in
wildlife photography.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.390
And that's usually happening
between two of the same

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:49.310
species, like a mother
and a cub.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.020
Here we've got a mother
and a baby here.

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.610
Or maybe we've got a
mother and a cub.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:57.880
I really prefer that, because
that helps me support those

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.530
adjectives we've talked
about earlier--

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:03.660
hopeful, regal, uplifting.

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.460
That's what I'm really trying
to shoot for because

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.150
photography--

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:11.300
people who buy images are
rarely buying images of

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.140
aggressive subjects.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:17.530
I think when we think African
wildlife photography, what's

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:19.300
the first animal people
think about?

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.430
Usually a lion or an elephant.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:22.260
Well, a lion--

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:26.410
most the time people, I think,
want that yawn, that real big

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:28.030
aggressive roar.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:33.040
The reality is getting that into
an economic model doesn't

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.530
really translate very much.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.750
I don't know many companies or
people who want to buy a

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:39.680
print, put it on the wall
of a roaring lion.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.540
So this helps me sell images.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:45.330
Because I'm in the business of
staying in business, right?

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:46.920
So licensing photographs--

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.780
this is kind of what really
sells in the marketplace.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:55.370
OK, let's end this discussion
in a few secs, and I'll take

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:56.670
some questions.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:00.240
But let's end on some
storytelling ideas.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.810
Years ago, when I got into
this business, two

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:05.250
professional nature
photographers

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:07.960
told me over a margarita.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.070
They said, Andy, you need to
figure out whether your

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:14.330
storytelling style is one
photograph that sits on

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:18.100
somebody's wall or your wall,
above the fireplace

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.660
or above the couch.

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.420
Or are you looking for the
series of photographs?

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.630
Are you more of an editorial
photographer?

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:30.680
Are you looking to take 5,
10, 15, 20, 50, 100, 130

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.600
photographs--

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.820
130 is typically the number of
photographs used in a coffee

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.560
table book.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.650
How does it come out of you?

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:39.590
It's natural.

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.330
And I'm like, I'm a
single shot guy.

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:42.280
I mean, I know that.

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.480
And that helps me go down
one path and not

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.680
try the other one.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.290
But every now and then,
sometimes I run a safari where

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:52.510
someone hires me, like a CEO
who wants to bring other

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:56.900
executives, or maybe it's
a patriarch of a family.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.560
And they said, Andy, we've hired
you to run this safari,

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.870
teach us some photographs.

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:03.960
But would you also mind
documenting our safari for us?

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.780
We would love to have
photographs of the family.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.150
Now, I'm not a portrait
photographer.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:09.130
I don't pretend to be.

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:11.980
But I like a challenge.

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.710
So I'll do those things.

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:14.780
But storytelling--

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:18.600
I thought, let me throw some
images together to kind of

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.120
illustrate a day in the
life of a safari.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.410
Maybe it's seven photographs.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:24.110
Maybe it's nine.

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:25.180
Maybe it's 10.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.630
But usually when you start
telling stories like this on a

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:30.230
web page, and you're showing
them to family, they're bored

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:31.490
by the fourth photograph.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:33.330
Because they're seeing
the same image-- oh,

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.950
look, another elephant.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.140
Great, right?

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.420
Because they weren't there.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.630
They want to see people that
they know and love in the

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:40.630
photograph.

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:43.700
So here we've got leaving first
thing in the morning,

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.890
driving around, slow
shutter speed.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:50.080
Here we've got our tracker up
on the front of the vehicle.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.490
Here's our guide smiling at us
through the rear-view mirror.

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:55.650
Oh, look, a detail shot.

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:58.870
Here's a photograph of one
of us with a big lens.

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:01.040
We go on hikes sometimes.,
and we shoot from the

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.060
ground, just walking.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.130
OK, there's our subject.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:07.600
We're shooting giraffes
off in the distance.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.070
Oh, look, we stopped for
a tea and coffee break.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:11.680
So going in for those
detail shots.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.920
Everything about storytelling
is about glue.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.390
How does one photograph get
glued to the next one?

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:19.420
And how do they all
glue together?

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.110
Oh, look, smiling,
happy faces.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:24.070
That's a good thing from
a marketing standpoint.

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:27.690
Oh, look, we've got some
wildlife shots, great.

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:30.300
And then end of the day, we're
going to do some tracking.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.470
We've got some leopard tracks
going up and down a road.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.720
We had no idea which
way they're going.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.310
Let's go down one direction
first and

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.190
see what we can find.

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:40.530
Sunset shot, we're done.

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:44.140
So just a quick way of thinking
about storytelling is

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.100
really trying to glue images
together that all

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.040
somehow make sense.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.220
But if they were to stand on
their own, they're not the

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.810
photographs you're going to put
up on your wall as a big,

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.610
huge 40 by 60 print.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:56.340
I mean, maybe this
one would be OK.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:59.770
But maybe not that one.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:01.280
They're just different
purposes.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.750
I know a lot of people these
days who are building Blurb

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.330
books and things like that.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.200
Well, that's a totally different
style of editing and

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.420
including photographs than doing
something like these

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.890
images earlier, like that.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.770
This is that kind of I want
it to stand on its own.

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.340
But shooting in a series is
very, very, very different.

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.860
And then stopping the action--

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.700
love stopping the action.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.430
Sitting at a water hole, just
shooting, shooting, shooting.

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:32.880
Zebras, as they come down to the
water, is exciting because

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.580
eventually they get spooked.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.990
And about every 10, 15 minutes
it resets again, and they come

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:38.060
down to drink.

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:41.560
So four times an hour, you're
getting good photographic

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.650
opportunities.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:45.120
And for me, in the way I think
of things, four times in an

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.190
hour to shoot something
rich is awesome.

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:50.520
Because sometimes you might
drive around for two or three

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:57.080
hours not finding what fits
your adjective list.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.260
Well, thank you, guys.

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:00.090
Let's do some questions.

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:02.890
How much time do we have
for questions?

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.002
5, 10 minutes-- yeah, cool.

00:48:04.002 --> 00:48:08.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.400
AUDIENCE: I was wondering since
wildlife photography is

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.750
such a kind of an on-the-fly
kind of thing where you really

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:17.000
have to capture things in the
moment, are you consistently

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.980
using shutter priority
and autofocus?

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.410
Or how often do you go
just full manual?

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:25.490
ANDY BIGGS: That's a really
great question.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:27.870
I'm all over the board,
depending on the scenario.

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:31.430
So if I'm hypersensitive to
shutter speed, which is

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:34.100
usually when I want to slow the
shutter speed down, I'll

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.400
switch to shutter-speed
priority.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.550
I would say most of the time,
I'd be in aperture priority

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.530
mode because that's what's
most important for me.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:45.080
In recent years with
specifically Nikon cameras,

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.370
they do a really good
job with auto ISO.

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.660
So I'll shoot in manual mode,
I'll set my shutter speed, my

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:54.460
f-stop, and I'll let it
choose the ISO for me.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.770
Unfortunately, Canon hasn't
figured that out very well

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:59.310
yet, the exposure
compensation.

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:02.520
But I'm kind of all over the
board is the answer.

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.040
But I'd say 75% of the time,
I'm probably in aperture

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:05.800
priority mode.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.080
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.060
And autofocus?

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.200
ANDY BIGGS: Actually,
I'm always in

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.020
continuous autofocus mode.

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:18.440
And for anybody who has an
SLR with a rear autofocus

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:23.710
capability, usually on Canons,
it says AF On--

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.450
and actually Nikons
are the same--

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:28.120
AF On on the back, I prefer to
use the rear autofocus button,

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.100
not the shutter speed
autofocus button.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.570
Because I can leave it in
continuous or AI Servo mode

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:38.630
and take my thumb off to stop
focusing whenever I want to.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.020
So I don't have to
switch modes.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.070
And the reason why I use the
rear autofocus button is that

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:46.530
I look at it from a process
standpoint.

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:48.870
I'm a process guy.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:52.300
Back basically when Leica
invented the first 35

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.530
millimeter camera, we
had an aperture

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:55.630
selection on the lens.

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:57.700
We had a shutter speed
on the camera.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.470
And whatever the film speed
was, that's what it was.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:03.220
And then in the '50s,
they developed

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.180
meters in the cameras.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.790
And they said, well, where
are we going to put the

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:07.490
functionality for the meter?

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:08.870
Oh, let's put it on the
shutter button.

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:11.630
OK, so now we've got two
functions in one button.

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:14.870
In the late '80s, when autofocus
came out, hey, let's

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:15.640
have autofocus.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.090
Where are we going to put
the functionality?

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.350
Hey, let's put it on
the shutter button.

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:20.860
So now we've got three
functions, one button.

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:23.850
So autofocus, metering,
and take the shot.

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:27.570
And that just fries my brain
thinking about that.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:29.870
From a UI standpoint, it
just doesn't work.

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:33.020
So I prefer to shoot with
autofocus on the thumb,

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:36.400
because it's independent
of my forefinger.

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.240
Hope that helps.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.820
AUDIENCE: Can you say a few
words about the different

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:40.130
countries in which
you operate?

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:41.720
And the character
of each country?

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.010
ANDY BIGGS: Yeah, yeah.

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:46.210
So the differences between
the countries.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:46.950
So let me--

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:49.210
I'll make a broad statement
first and say that I go to

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.460
areas where there's
a lot of wildlife.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:54.930
And wildlife exists where there
are not a lot of humans.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:57.630
So typically more remote
locations--

00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:03.490
Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana,
South Africa, Namibia.

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:05.570
Rwanda's in there, even though
that's a very densely

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:07.030
populated country.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:09.870
And the Virunga Mountains are
basically an island amongst a

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:13.120
sea of people, where the
mountain gorillas are.

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.990
I only travel to areas
that are what I

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:16.130
consider to be safe.

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.360
Because I'm a father and
a husband as well.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.940
I want to come home.

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.310
So it's very important to me.

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:28.800
So usually, we get to places
that are remote.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.910
We fly into a major city and
we fly out the next day.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:33.370
And we get out in the
middle of nowhere.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.490
Most of my safaris are
split between--

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:43.990
I'd say Kenya, Tanzania, and
Botswana, which are very, very

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:47.450
easy places to get to,
politically stable.

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:50.140
I know Kenya had some issues
a couple years ago.

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.710
But really, on the whole, these
are very, very, very

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.530
stable places.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.210
In other words, I'm not running
trips to West Africa,

00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:58.995
Nigeria any time soon.

00:51:58.995 --> 00:52:01.400
So East Africa is
a broad brush.

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:06.040
East Africa is more wide open
savannah, where you have more

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:09.620
grazing herding animals,
wildebeest and zebras.

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:12.680
You get the wildebeest
migration, 2 million

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.380
wildebeests, 450,000 zebras--

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.470
really, really big.

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:19.690
Southern Africa tends
to be smaller

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:20.930
congregation of animals--

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:24.770
same species, just smaller
congregations and more

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:25.990
intimate experiences.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:30.180
Because East Africa typically
works off of a national park

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:33.170
method, where you pay fees to
be in the park, as well as

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:33.730
other people.

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:35.060
And you'll see them.

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.230
Southern Africa--

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.010
South Africa, Botswana--

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:42.430
tend to work off of a game
reserve, private game reserve,

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:45.670
concession kind of a model
where a given camp has

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:47.900
exclusive access to an area.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:53.290
And you'll see very few, if any,
vehicles within a day.

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:54.680
Fees are a lot higher
in Southern

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.410
Africa than East Africa.

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:59.480
I would say it's a fair
statement to say that most of

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.010
my safari travelers will
start off with a

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.590
Tanzania or Kenya safari.

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:07.030
They'll get interested and say,
this is a lot of fun.

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:11.190
And they'll end up doing a
Botswana safari later, because

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:13.580
it's a little bit more
of a commitment

00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:15.370
in time to get there.

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:18.235
Financially, as well,
it's more expensive.

00:53:18.235 --> 00:53:23.830
But the species are virtually
the same everywhere that I go.

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:26.210
So the question is, how did I
start the safari business and

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:29.460
put together the first safari?

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.960
I'm a networker.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:36.110
My personality is really driven
around talking to

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:38.240
people and engaging
with people.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.790
And I knew Michael Reichmann,
who owned Luminous Landscape

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:46.390
website, which is a nature
photography, a

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:48.200
very popular site.

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.140
I emailed him and said, hey,
let's put a safari together.

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:52.220
He said, that sounds great.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.920
So that helped me build up a
name in the industry with

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.600
somebody that was well known.

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.570
And then it kind of
went from there.

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:08.070
I was very fortunate in that I
was able to follow the same

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:10.970
trajectory that digital
photography took at the same

00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:13.980
time that baby boomers were
starting to retire or cutting

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.960
back on their work commitment.

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.920
So international travel
was made easier

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:19.940
10 or 15 years ago.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.070
It's just gotten easier
and easier and

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:22.380
easier every decade.

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:25.460
But really, I'd say the late
'90s started getting really

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.640
easy to a lot of these
places that I go.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.730
Digital photography
was on the rise.

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:33.160
I bought my first pair of
digital SLRs in 2002, the

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.700
original D30 Canon.

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.540
Paid three grand
each for them--

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:40.420
three autofocus points,
awesome.

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:43.880
And I was seeing my customers
doing the same thing.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.670
People were getting
reinvigorated by digital

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:47.290
photography.

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:49.440
Oh, I shot film but I stop
shooting in the '80s.

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.360
Something like that was
usually the story.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:56.860
Most of my travelers are either
empty nesters slash

00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:02.940
baby boomers, or high tech, one
kid or no kids, younger

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:07.580
30s, late 20s into the 30s,
early 40s, kind of that

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:11.360
demographic, and just a high
interest in digital

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.420
photography that didn't
exist before.

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.400
It's all about networking.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.310
So I really appreciate you
guys coming out today.

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:24.860
I wanted to be very mindful of
just one hour so that you can

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.730
get back to your normal
daily life here.

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:29.540
So thanks, guys, for
having me out here.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:33.340
[APPLAUSE]
