RACHEL ROSSIN:
Almost my entire life

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.800
is lived virtually on a screen.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.533
And what I'm
looking for is a way

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.834
to bring the digital experience
put into physical form.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.900
I grew up in a place where,
like, escapism was necessary.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.300
I was drawing, and painting,
and programming, and building

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.166
computers since I was eight.

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.567
It's a fascination
with, like, wanting

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:29.000
to create, like, weird
worlds in a virtual space.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.367
[ambient music]

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.266
Well, first, I'm
sketching, and painting,

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:45.000
and modeling in 3D software
and video game engines.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.100
What I'm doing is
I'm just giving

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.800
it logic so it has randomness.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.166
I'm just giving it
randomness that mimics life.

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:56.367
There's this obsession with
most artists with the idea

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:59.200
of exploding the
fourth dimension, where

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.567
the physical and
impermanent meet.

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:05.166
That space, like, the
in-between is what I'm trying

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.700
to do almost in every show.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.133
I'm trying to find the
link between the thing that

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.300
feels impossible and the
thing that's tangible.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.166
I can use parts of sculpture
to inform virtual reality

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.467
and, you know, vise versa.

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:26.834
The most beautiful and fragile
parts of my human experience

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.567
are stored in screens.

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:31.266
Being interested in
that and-- and being

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.734
in love with that as well,
it's a complicated feeling.

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:38.667
I mean, I certainly am feeling
like I'm losing my physicality,

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:42.066
the loss of translation between,
like, the body and mind,

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.900
the digital and the physical.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.400
And the response
to that, I think,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.300
was these pieces that were
really physical that really

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.633
is sort of like false bodies.

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:54.200
I was creating these small
sculptures in virtual reality,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.400
and then printed
onto plexiglass,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.734
and then formed with my
body with a blowtorch,

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:02.266
creating, like, an
artificial armor of a screen.

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:10.934
What we're looking
for in technology

00:02:10.934 --> 00:02:13.734
is to enhance being
a human being.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:17.000
As virtuality gets better,
our relationship with reality

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.433
also becomes richer.

00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:21.033
The hope is that virtuality
sort of stays bad,

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:23.800
because you don't want it to
become any sort of substitute

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.633
for reality.

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:27.400
But then as a-- like,
a counter to that,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.367
it can also become, like, such
an incredible tool for healing,

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:33.000
and for more truthful
experiences, and for change,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.033
you know?

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.166
Really, for-- like, for change.
