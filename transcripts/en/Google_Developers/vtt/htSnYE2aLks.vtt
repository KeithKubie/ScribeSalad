MARTIN OMANDER: Hello, my
name is Martin Omander,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.360
and I welcome you to Google
Root Access, the show featuring

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.430
actionable, startup advice.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.720
My guest today is Alex
Haro, cofounder of Life360.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.226
Tell us about your
startup, Alex.

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:18.600
ALEX HARO: Sure,
so first of all,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.516
thank you very much,
Martin, for having me on.

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:21.570
I'm super excited.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.950
Life360 is a mobile
app for families

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.450
that lets them stay close and
connected to the people that

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.950
matter most in their lives.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.480
Things like seeing where
everyone is on the map,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.659
being able to communicate
throughout the day,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.000
coordinate how they're going
to get together tonight

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.160
for dinner, and getting
automated alerts when they

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.277
arrive to home, or leave
school, or get to work.

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:43.610
Those are the things we're
focused on, and funny enough,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.610
we're actually one of the
first venture-backed Android

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.170
apps ever.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.630
Our first source of funding
was a grant from Google,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.890
when we won the Google Android
competition back in 2008.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.670
And since then,
by really focusing

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.630
in on the daily
utility of family life,

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.380
and how do we make it
a little bit easier,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.840
we've been able to acquire
a critical mass of 44

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.420
million families who are
using us every single day,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.903
and loving the
things that we do.

00:01:03.903 --> 00:01:04.819
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.770
So how-- sounds excellent.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.310
How are the numbers?

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.189
How is your traction?

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.730
ALEX HARO: Sure, I
mean we've already

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.110
passed 44 million families,
and we're adding 1 to 2 million

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.930
every single month.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.120
And it's growing very
well, and people really

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.214
are finding us organically.

00:01:19.214 --> 00:01:20.880
We're not paying for
any of those users,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.850
and they're loving us.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.240
MARTIN OMANDER:
Wow, that's amazing.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.115
ALEX HARO: Thank you.

00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:26.187
MARTIN OMANDER: So I
downloaded the app myself,

00:01:26.187 --> 00:01:27.020
from the Play Store.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.811
ALEX HARO: Awesome.

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:28.910
Count another user, right?

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.210
MARTIN OMANDER: One more, yes.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.300
So I didn't have
to pay anything.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.684
How do you guys make money?

00:01:33.684 --> 00:01:34.350
ALEX HARO: Sure.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.540
So first of all, the thing that
we're focused in on is scale.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.440
We want to capture the family
network, much like Facebook

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.140
has friends and
LinkedIn has work.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.470
No one has really captured
that family network.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.720
And we think it's the real
big, next network to go online.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.650
And so because we're
focused in on that,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.340
we have to build a
compelling product

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.600
that users want to
use every single day.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.420
And we do have to provide
something that really provides

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.580
utility without forcing
them to pay for it upfront.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.030
That being said,
we eventually do

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.720
have to become a legitimate
business that makes money,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.360
and so we've chosen the
freemium model to monetize.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.729
And what we've done is we
have specific features that

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.056
are behind a pay wall
that users have to pay,

00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:13.680
and those are only
features that they'd

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.110
want to use after they're
deeply engaged in Life360

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.710
and really finding
the value of it.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.470
So one of our most
popular services

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.920
is called LiveAdvisor, who's
a live representative-- you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.460
can think of it like an
OnStar rep in your car--

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.770
but for your phone instead.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.340
A live representative
that knows who

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.910
you are, where you are,
and can help you out

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.760
with things like
a minor emergency,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.000
like a broken down
car, or get you

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.174
dinner tickets tonight
for you and your wife.

00:02:36.174 --> 00:02:37.090
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.780
So I've had other guests on
this show who have told me--

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.400
they've all told
me how hard it is

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.654
to get consumers to
pay for something.

00:02:44.654 --> 00:02:46.820
And this seems like that's
what you're trying to do.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.410
How's that going?

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.980
ALEX HARO: Yeah, I mean,
I'm not going to lie to you.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.262
It definitely is hard.

00:02:50.262 --> 00:02:51.720
And there's a whole
bunch of things

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.980
that when you're first
thinking about business,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.320
you don't realize how hard it
is actually to get users to pay.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.670
And we launched back
in 2008, and so we

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.180
didn't have a lot of these
pay APIs that exist now,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.266
things like in-app
purchase and Paypal,

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:06.390
and all that kind of stuff.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.730
Really weren't mobile
focused at all, back in 2008.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.254
And so when we first launched
our premium offering,

00:03:11.254 --> 00:03:12.670
we actually collected
credit cards

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.210
straight from the
mobile app itself.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.940
The user had to go in and
provide the full credit card

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.104
info, if they were
interested in it.

00:03:19.104 --> 00:03:21.020
And surprisingly, that
actually worked for us.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.760
And we actually
had a large number

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.290
of users opting into premium,
and loving our premium

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.034
services, as well.

00:03:27.034 --> 00:03:28.450
But there's a whole
host of issues

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.120
that you don't think
about that suddenly pop up

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.340
day one, after the
first month of billing.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.190
When all of a sudden, some
percentage of your credit cards

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.140
just can't bill.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.450
And we thought we
did something wrong.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.600
It's like, holy
crap, what's wrong?

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.510
And it's all things
like lost credit cards,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.140
and people don't, unfortunately,
always have funds,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.640
and cards get stolen,
and cards get fraud,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.600
and they expire over time.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.820
And all these kind of
issues-- a lot of companies

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.620
have had to solve,
that have billed

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.280
hundreds of millions of
dollars through their systems.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.060
It's very hard for
a small startup

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.480
to realize what these
are, and try to solve them

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.320
without dedicating
a lot of their time

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.067
to billing and billing support.

00:04:09.067 --> 00:04:10.150
MARTIN OMANDER: Right, OK.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.940
Yeah that makes
sense, my primary card

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.690
has been replaced
twice in the last year.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.106
And I feel sorry
for everybody who

00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:17.446
was trying to get money
for my subscriptions.

00:04:17.446 --> 00:04:20.029
ALEX HARO: It happens a lot more
frequently than you'd expect,

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.410
for sure.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.320
MARTIN OMANDER: So
you go to people--

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.970
some people were actually then
entering the full credit card

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.190
number, some of them were even
succeeding, and in some cases

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.200
you were even able
to charge the card.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.940
But there were
problems, you said.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.110
How did you overcome
these problems?

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.950
ALEX HARO: Sure,
so first of all,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.110
I think the reason that
people were able to give us

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.750
credit cards, and
felt secure, is

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.220
because we are around
family and closed networks,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.460
and our users actually
really do trust us,

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.690
and we take that seriously.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.200
And we do a lot of things,
we're PCI compliant,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.420
and we follow all the
appropriate security protocols

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.740
and guidelines.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.680
But the way that we
were able to solve it,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.500
and what we've had
great success with,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.780
is actually with Google
In-app purchases.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.410
So about six months
ago, we switched

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.000
from doing our own credit card
based solution to Google In-app

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.170
purchase, and had great success.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.430
We tripled the
number of conversions

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.200
we had every single
day, overnight.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.770
So we released this, and we
went from 1x number of sign-ups

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.360
to premium, to 3x overnight.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.280
And it's been awesome.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.696
And the other great
thing about it

00:05:18.696 --> 00:05:21.310
is it's a very simple API
that you can build on top of.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.540
Google takes care of all
the really hard details

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.740
around how do you re-bill?

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.750
How do you send them
emails to make sure

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.520
that they enter their
credit card info?

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.142
How do you bug them to do it?

00:05:30.142 --> 00:05:31.100
How do you remind them?

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.930
And how do you deal with fraud
and all that kind of stuff?

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.750
Google takes care of all
those kind of details for you,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.370
so you have this very simple
API that you can just say,

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.809
hey Google, is this user
still premium or not?

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.350
And Google will return yes or
no, and you can deal with that,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.010
and not worry about
all the lower level

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.349
details and billing.

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.390
MARTIN OMANDER: So the
increased conversion rate,

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.540
where does that come
from, do you think?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.900
Is it because people
don't enter the full card?

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.750
Or why?

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.940
ALEX HARO: So I think
a lot of it is that.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.260
The credit card that you
have on Google Play services,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.620
that is used for Google In-app,
is for all of your apps.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.331
So say you love "Angry Birds,"
and you want to upgrade,

00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:10.080
for whatever the upgrade
for "Angry Birds"

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.880
is, and you enter
your credit card.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.857
Or say you really love
Life360, and you're

00:06:13.857 --> 00:06:15.690
willing to put your
credit card in for that.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.470
Once you enter your credit
card, then it's in the system,

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.390
and it's available to
all the other apps.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.530
So after you've gone
through that experience,

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.230
say you've done it for "Angry
Birds," now you love Life360,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.090
you're using every
single day, you say,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.640
hey, I want to upgrade for
some of these premium features.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.030
It's a one-click check out.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.390
So you just click and say,
yes, I want to buy this.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.080
And all of a sudden, that's it.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.580
So there's no more of this
having to enter your credit

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.992
card details every time,
and a lot of people

00:06:39.992 --> 00:06:41.700
haven't even memorized
their credit card,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.866
so they have to pull it out
and they may be driving,

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:45.160
or something crazy like that.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.770
Instead, it's just
one-click touch,

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.214
and you automatically upgrade.

00:06:48.214 --> 00:06:49.130
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.602
So Google takes
a cut, of course.

00:06:51.602 --> 00:06:53.060
That's on one side
of the equation.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.400
On the other side of the
question is greater conversion

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.070
rate you mentioned
that you've seen.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.880
How were you thinking
about that trade off?

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.910
Is it worth it?

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.614
Is it barely worth it to you?

00:07:01.614 --> 00:07:02.780
ALEX HARO: Sure, absolutely.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.970
I mean, obviously this is
very specific on everyone's

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.980
business, but what we've seen
is for our premium offering,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.810
some of it it's digital, some
of it's real, hard costs--

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.080
but the relative fixed cost per
premium user is relatively low.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.590
And so when we look at
the cost of developer time

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.910
to figure out all these
billing issues, when

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.330
we think about the cost of how
do we acquire these new premium

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.270
offerings, when we think about
just like going from 1x to 3x,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.080
that's almost worth it itself.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.190
All of those costs add up.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.660
They may not be
30%, but you end up

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.310
making more money--
we definitely

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.310
have-- through Google
In-app, then when you

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.564
try to do it yourself.

00:07:41.564 --> 00:07:42.480
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.420
So finally what is your
advice to other startups

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.824
who are trying to bill consumers
on a subscription model?

00:07:49.824 --> 00:07:50.490
ALEX HARO: Sure.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.270
So I think one of the things
that everyone needs to focus in

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.760
on is build something
that users really want.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.010
I think that's where we've
been hugely successful,

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.810
we've actually built something
that users really want.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.980
And then you'll figure
out how to build them

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.080
and how to pay them,
but unless you're really

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.509
building that product that
users really want to pay for,

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:09.800
anything else will be trickery.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.570
Like the users
have to want to pay

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.020
before you'll get them to pay.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.280
So first and foremost,
focus on making a product

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.320
that users really
do want to pay for.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.870
Then when it comes to
actually billing them,

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.600
don't try to solve
the problems yourself.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.240
You'll spend far too
much time figuring out,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.050
how does American Express trade
against Visa and MasterCard?

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.090
And how do I re-bill users?

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.539
And all sorts of things that
many other people have spent

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.150
many other people's
times figuring it out.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.710
And you should be focused
on building your product,

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.750
not figuring out
how to bill users.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.860
Whether it's In-app,
or some other service,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.716
you really should consider using
another service that really

00:08:45.716 --> 00:08:47.340
knows how to bill
users and how to deal

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.780
with all these
credit card issues.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.905
And you just worry on
building your awesome product

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.820
the users do want to pay for.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.700
MARTIN OMANDER: Great--
