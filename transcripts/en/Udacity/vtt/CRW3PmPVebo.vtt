00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.154
We want to go from a decimal to a percent, so I need to move the decimal 2

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:11.139
places to the right. I need to multiply by 100, and I get 33%. For 25,000th, I

00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:16.940
need to move the decimal 2 places to the right. That's multiplying by 100, and I

00:00:16.952 --> 00:00:22.604
get 2.5 percent. For 3.126 thousandths, I still need to move the decimal two

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:28.533
places to the right. That's the same thing as multiplying by 100, so I'll have

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:34.365
312 and 6/10 of a percent. A lot of people just read it 312.6%. And again, for

00:00:34.377 --> 00:00:40.324
the last one, I move the decimal two places by multiplying by 100. And I get

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:44.410
point 04%.. Nice work on that quiz.
