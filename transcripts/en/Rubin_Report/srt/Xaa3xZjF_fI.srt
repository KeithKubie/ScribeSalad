1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,120
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,300
So I think I, the first time we
sat down, I think I asked you this,

3
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:08,680
so this seems like the right segue for it.

4
00:00:08,681 --> 00:00:11,950
So for everything that we've talked about
here and the addiction to age and all

5
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:12,550
that,

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,650
there's gonna be a certain amount of
people that are watching this and going,

7
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:17,980
wait a minute, Glenn Beck was one of
the people that was peddling this stuff.

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,943
Huh?

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,850
I as well,
I think I know you pretty well right now.

10
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,930
And I feel like you are honest
in your beliefs and you've,

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,250
you've had some mayor Kulpa is about some
of the things you've said. Even just a,

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,310
you got into something on Twitter with
my friend Marge and new eyes and new

13
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:34,220
fully.
He,

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,840
he sent you a clip of something that
you did about him a couple of years back

15
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,990
and you fully, you apologized
immediately. You said,

16
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:43,120
I'd love to talk to you and learn
more and all of those things.

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,780
I just asked that to him today and what
he is he coming in? Yeah. And I know,

18
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,810
and I loop you guys in
an email, right? So, uh,

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,450
is there anything you can add to that
about just sort of how you've changed?

20
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:56,060
Like, do you remember a moment,
was there something about that?

21
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:58,610
Because maybe there are people that are
going down that road right now that's

22
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:01,790
still want more of the outrage and
stiller is still are, you know,

23
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,050
as they call it, shit posting on
Twitter and the rest of it. Um,

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,090
if you were trying to get
somebody to turn back,

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,350
no, cause they were really
personal experiences.

26
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:15,040
I went from the, you know, that,

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,220
that global poll that comes out
around Christmas time, you know, uh,

28
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,160
most admired man in the world.
Yeah.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,150
I was tied with the pope
just behind Nelson Mandela.

30
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,260
Okay. That's insane. That's insane.

31
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,610
12 months later, I'm no longer
on that list. I'm hated. Yeah.

32
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,110
I was saying the same things, CNN
that I was saying on Fox. Okay.

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,490
So that was confusing.
Um,

34
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,590
and it was,
you know,

35
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:52,030
you can't be hated by half of the country.
I mean,

36
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:56,020
unless you're just, um, you
know, maniacal, you know,

37
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,040
egomaniac that is just beyond
any kind of redemption.

38
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,990
You cannot be hated by half
of the country. You know,

39
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,640
a a false hero for the other
half of the country and not go,

40
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,490
okay,
I'm not that.

41
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,470
I don't think I'm that. Yeah. So who am I?

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,460
What part of it most people will go,
well,

43
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:24,730
they spent millions of dollars
to destroy my reputation,

44
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:26,770
to take things out of context.
And they did.

45
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,910
But I also did things because
my philosophy at the time
was if I can get enough

46
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,860
eyeballs, if I can get people to
watch, which puts me in leader Hosan,

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,230
you know, seeing engage Levis that
can get people to watch. Yeah.

48
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,930
Then I present them with facts and
my opinion of where it's going.

49
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,150
It forget about everything else.

50
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,530
They'll hang onto the facts and
someone in the press, we'll go,

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,100
I hate that.
So I'm going to prove him wrong.

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,520
They never did.
They never would look at the facts.

53
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,510
So this is always where they just want
to belittle you and shame just to silence

54
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:09,000
you

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,570
and I, and I helped them.
Okay. I added to that.

56
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:17,460
So I'm not saying it's somebody else.
I am taking my, my responsibility,

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,080
but the biggest thing is
now on the other side,

58
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,490
I can look and say, wait,
all of you in the press,

59
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,310
you said I was the worst.

60
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,180
Let me go get the transcripts.
See what I just said?

61
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,430
That's what you said to the 10th power
right here. It's, they won't work.

62
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,410
It's wrong and it won't work,
but nobody wants to do that.

63
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:50,280
Nobody wants to look. They, everyone
wants to point to the other person.

64
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,150
Nobody's willing to go.
I said me,

65
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,880
but you think that 70%
that you mentioned before,

66
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,060
maybe starting to do that a little
bit. I mean, again, I'm trying,

67
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:02,790
if I'm trying to find how to
get out of this thing. Okay.

68
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,190
And I think that 70% where I'm meeting,

69
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,170
I know it's a select group
because they're coming,

70
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,610
they're coming to see me and
Jordan and take 70% take 17

71
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,510
yeah, 10 committed, 10%
committed changes. The world.

72
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,860
17 is your tipping point,
so it doesn't take all of us.

73
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,730
Revolution was fought by
about 20% of America. Okay?

74
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,370
Those were the ones who said,
I believe in this.

75
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,010
We have to,
we have to understand,

76
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:36,870
and a lot of the book is
about postmodernism and
how that works and what its

77
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:41,340
goals are. What does
postmodern even mean? What is,

78
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,520
what's the modern world?
It's not about a machine.

79
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,610
It's about the scientific process.

80
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,850
It's about exploration and empirical
data and testing a and B and living with

81
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:59,580
the results. That's what the modern
world is. So when you realize,

82
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,880
so you would say postmodern really is
auntie modern in essence because it's

83
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,380
going against the ways that we've
been able to measure anything.

84
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:09,340
The way we've been able to look at

85
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,840
only you can,

86
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,790
when you don't understand postmodernism
and you read the headline, which I did,

87
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,760
math is racist.

88
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,430
You either go,

89
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:27,260
these people are out of their can
minds and I can't take it anymore.

90
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,380
Or you can say how?

91
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,750
How did they get there?
When you asked that question,

92
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,780
you start to go and peel the layers down
and you see the core of this idea good

93
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:47,321
or bad that what came out of the modern
era of the enlightenment was this and

94
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:51,240
they say

95
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,390
this is bad. They say this is bad.
That. That really is it. Yeah,

96
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,640
and anything that holds
this up must be destroyed.

97
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,030
If that's math, if that's
you. Doesn't matter.

98
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,320
Yeah.

99
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,210
If you understand that it's all about
deconstruction and deconstruction is all

100
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,290
about chaos.

101
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,730
You must not do anything
to hasten the chaos.

102
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,970
You have to restrain yourself. The best
way to fight this isn't about Gandhi. Oh,

103
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:20,680
I want to beat just like Jesus.
No,

104
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:25,681
I want to win and the best way to win is
to restrain yourself from adding any of

105
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:30,130
the chaos. Be Clear, be stuffed, spoken.

106
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,280
Be the person that everybody in the room,
when everybody is arguing,

107
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,310
they kind of look around the room and
there's maybe three people over there that

108
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:41,110
are just laughing and having fun and just
because you will be the one that will

109
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:45,440
control the room. In the end, everybody
else will kill themselves, but the the,

110
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,090
the majority of people
will go, oh, I hate this,

111
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,120
and they'll make their way over to you.
That's what we have to do.

112
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,280
We have to stop fighting
on the stupid stuff.

113
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,810
The stupid stuff.

114
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:00,920
Yeah.

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,010
Gay wedding cakes. Good God, man.

116
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,650
Homosexuals right now, today in parts
of the country. What do you say?

117
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:10,940
We start there?
What do you say?

118
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:15,320
We talk about something that
really makes a difference.

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,600
Really makes a difference. We get
to the gay wedding cakes. Yeah,

120
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,060
let's be good people first.
Yeah.

121
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,650
It's so interesting how people just don't
want to do the intellectual work and

122
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:32,150
now it's like we have these, we have these
phones, we have endless distractions.

123
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,460
To the point that perhaps 20 years ago
you might have a moment standing on a

124
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:40,490
corner waiting for a friend to go
to dinner where you'd have to think,

125
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,630
but we can distract ourselves to the point
where we actually never have to think

126
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,900
anymore. When was the last time
you just stood somewhere? I mean,

127
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,630
I know you're aware of all of this
stuff, but when it was, let's have you,

128
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:54,590
Glenn Beck just stood somewhere on the
corner waiting for your wife to meet you

129
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,190
and you weren't looking at your
phone or you were in, you know,

130
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,180
I him to do what you did,
but I can't do it for a month.

131
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,080
I have too many employees.
That's the problem. I only
have like five [inaudible].

132
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,620
I, I, I try to do it once a week.

133
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,070
Don't make it every time,
but just,

134
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,120
I'm not going to be online.
Do not pick up your device,

135
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,500
go out on a date with your
wife and do not carry a device.

136
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,240
You don't have it with you. Um,
that's important. And it's important,

137
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,530
Dave, because I learned
something with my alcoholism.

138
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,840
I was struggling with so many
things when I was younger,

139
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,690
um, that I didn't want to think about.
I didn't want to think about it.

140
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,610
I didn't want to think about the
things that I had done in my life.

141
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,810
The things that I was, oh, poor me about
it. Just didn't want to think about it.

142
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,190
And I would turn on the radio and I turn
it up loud and I'd be driving my car

143
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,000
and I never really
consciously connected the two.

144
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,780
It got to the point where it was so
bad that if I didn't have something to

145
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:09,370
distract, I would literally be
by myself and I go la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

146
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,880
Just to block out my thoughts.
Okay. That's a problem.

147
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,490
And I realized when I
was finally no longer,

148
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:23,570
I was sober and not, uh, uh,

149
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,960
and not just not drinking,
uh,

150
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,880
was the time that I was driving someplace
and I must've been driving for about

151
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,650
an hour and I hadn't turned anything on.

152
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,120
And I realized at one point I'm just
driving and I kind of come to kind of come

153
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:41,780
to thinking, you know, about what's in the
car, what's happening? And I'm like, oh,

154
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,180
I wonder what's on the rate.
Oh my gosh,

155
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,310
I've been alone with myself
and my thoughts for an hour.

156
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,410
That's a sign of mental
health. Yeah, we're sick.

157
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,903
We're sick.

158
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,260
So in the, uh, in the book
in the, in the forward,

159
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,000
you a very graciously,
and I'm humbled that you did it,

160
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:09,050
you included me in a list
of names of people that you,
uh, that you put in there.

161
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,570
Um,
and

162
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,710
Ben had this and I wrote,
I even wrote to, to Ben,

163
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:21,180
I wrote is an inscription on this page.
Yeah. Like two days later he calls me,

164
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,040
oh my gosh. We were with each other
for two days. And he was like, hey,

165
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,550
thanks very much. And then like at
midnight one night I get this text,

166
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,820
he's a busy guy and I know to those who
are willing to step out in front of the

167
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:36,720
crowd to question reason and
have dangerous conversations,

168
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,560
men with whom I may strongly disagree
with at times, but we'll all,

169
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:45,240
I will always consider
[inaudible] founders of reason
and contemporary heroes.

170
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,220
Ben Shapiro, Dave Ruben, Jordan
Peterson, Bret Weinstein, Sam Harris,

171
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:51,440
Jonathan Sacks,
pendula,

172
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,100
Joe Rogan. So I thought, I don't
want to make this about me.

173
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:56,110
So the one that I thought
was most interesting,

174
00:10:56,111 --> 00:11:01,000
they're actually with Sam Harris
because I suspect you guys probably,

175
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:05,260
if he disagrees with Jordan Peterson
on everything, pretty much everything,

176
00:11:05,261 --> 00:11:09,100
policy, existentialism meaning
a life, the whole damn thing.

177
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,000
You guys probably disagree
on everything plus one.

178
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:15,430
I don't know if we went through no,
and I thought,

179
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,880
well this is what it's all about.
This is what it's all about. So,

180
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:21,850
but would you have ever, I mean, 20
years ago, if you were writing a book,

181
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,743
you would,

182
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,940
that's when I,

183
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,940
I've often joked that my library is a
library of a serial killer because I was

184
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,950
too broke to actually go
get a formal education.

185
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,190
So I would go to Barnes and
noble or the library and I'd go,

186
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,360
who hates each other,
this opinion,

187
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,800
who hates this opinion,
that person.

188
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,270
And I would read them both and
I would look at him and say,

189
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,490
is there any, anything where they
intersect because I know is true.

190
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,540
If both these people are from
opposite ends of the spectrum.

191
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,480
And they both say this is true.

192
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,030
I know that one line in
both books is true. Okay.

193
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,470
So start small and build
the basis of truth.

194
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,850
And what motivated me was aligned
from Thomas Jefferson, uh,

195
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:17,710
that he wrote to his nephew Peter car.
Peter's parents had both died.

196
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,190
Um, when his dad was ill, he said,

197
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:24,130
can you please educate my
son when he comes of age?

198
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,180
So Thomas writes this unbelievable letter,
you know,

199
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,610
in mathematics you have to do this.
In literature, you have to do this.

200
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,110
The last thing is religion. And
I love it. It's changed my life.

201
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,840
MMM. When it comes to
religion, above all things,

202
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,560
fix reason firmly in her seat
and question with boldness,

203
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,670
even the very existence of God for if
there be a god he must surely rather

204
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,980
honest questioning over blindfolded fear.

205
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,120
We break down on the word honest,

206
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,990
honest questioning you and I liked each
other and get along because you haven't

207
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,770
asked me a setup question and I've
never asked you a set up question.

208
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,960
It's an honest question. Hang on
just a second. But that right.

209
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,620
But that, that is it and that's
good. But yeah, that keeps you young,

210
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:23,240
that keeps you alive. The minute used
to, I knew my father was going to die.

211
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,240
My father was the kind of guy who always
had a book in his back pocket. Okay.

212
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,960
Self educated man.
And uh,

213
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,580
he's always exploring and questioning
and he was so granola fruit loop,

214
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,950
be one with the universe kind of guy.

215
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,160
And I called him up.

216
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,120
We were best friends for a long time.
And um,

217
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,420
I'd call him sometimes two, three times
a day. And we just talk about books,

218
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:58,570
we're reading and things. Did you hear
this opinion? What do you think of this?

219
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,740
We talked about the future, the
past, all of it. And I said, Dad,

220
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,390
I just read this fantastic book.
You have to read this.

221
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:11,940
I'm going to send it to you.
And he said, hmm, that's okay.

222
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,890
And I said, alright. And he said,

223
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,950
I'm tired. I'm tired. I
think I've learned enough.

224
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,340
Huh? Three years later
he was, he was gone.

225
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,670
When you,
when you are not,

226
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,100
we are built to explore.

227
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,130
And when you're not exploring what's left,
well,

228
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:39,740
what would you be doing
if you weren't doing this?

229
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,710
I told my wife when she married me,

230
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:48,560
and this is one reason I've lucked
out so much. My wife hates fame.

231
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,230
She hates wealth.
She hates red carpet,

232
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,610
ate all of it cause she married
me and her family was like,

233
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:59,490
you're not gonna marry him. He is
a loser. He's not going to imagine,

234
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,510
he's not going to amount to anything.
Um,

235
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,570
when she married me because I'm the
first out of every generation that we can

236
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:13,280
find going back. I'm the first
male that has not become a baker.

237
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,420
And so I would probably probably be a
chef in some place or I'm not good at

238
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:20,670
baking.

239
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,770
I was just gonna say, would
you bake me a cake? That's

240
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,450
no, I'm not good at
baking. I am good advice.

241
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,760
My father said baking
sun is about formulas.

242
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,240
Cooking is winging it.
Yeah.

243
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,860
And I'm not good with
formulas to inpatient.

244
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,430
You're, you're a definitely
a, a wing in it Kinda guy.

245
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,670
So generally speaking,
do you feel it's funny,

246
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:46,660
the first half of what we've done here
was sort of fire and brimstone, sort of,

247
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:49,630
or laying out, you know, this is, this
thing could really go off the rails.

248
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,450
I think the last 20 minutes or so
it's been a little more hopeful.

249
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:58,210
I'm an optimistic catastrophist
you do not want me,

250
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,550
you do not want to be anywhere near
me on the titanic until we get to the

251
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:07,630
iceberg. As we're going into the
iceberg, I'm saying, are you kidding me?

252
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,240
Have you counted the lifeboats?
There's not enough lifeboats.

253
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,350
We're headed into cold area.
If there is, if these people,

254
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,410
they're going to be irresponsible, they're
not going to pay attention to the ice,

255
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:21,940
but they're arrogant. They're gonna
hit the iceberg and all going to die.

256
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,920
Okay. Soon as we hit that iceberg,
I'm there. We're gonna make it.

257
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,630
We're gonna make it because I
believe that when people are awake,

258
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:37,960
they will awaken to who they truly are.
And I think Americans are different.

259
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,670
We have this spirit us of exploration.

260
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:47,680
We're the people who cross the oceans
were the people that cross the Rockies.

261
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:49,670
I have to tell you if,

262
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:54,310
if I were alive during the
time when we were exploring,

263
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,000
I d I don't even think I would
have made it past the Missouri,

264
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,870
but definitely I would have gotten
to Denver and went, okay guys,

265
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,360
I am not going any. We're
not crossing. Okay. I always
think every time I'm on the,

266
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,910
uh, on, uh, what is it? The
five, uh, that goes by the,

267
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,280
the Getty Museum, which, which is,
that fell the four oh five zero five.

268
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,280
Every time I'm on the four
oh five we bumped to la.

269
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,300
So I see the Getty museum up there and I
think if I were a pioneer and I made it

270
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:26,194
this far,

271
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,350
I would have built my house in this valley
and people would have been on the top

272
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:33,010
of the hill going, you should see
what's on. And I'd be like, I am done.

273
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,950
But generally people are explorers,
they're good and they're,

274
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,250
they're hardy and they want to live.

275
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,410
I think they do want to live and they
want to live in peace and harmony.

276
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,380
I think that about the Palestinians
and the Israelis when if you could,

277
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:54,750
and I've done it,
I've done it.

278
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:00,470
When you don't have a camera in somebody's
face and nobody knows you're talking,

279
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:07,310
you sit down in a house of a Palestinian
and most likely average person,

280
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,960
they're like, I don't
really care. I mean I just,

281
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,930
I want to raise my family.
I just want to be left alone.

282
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:19,260
I want to be able to eat maybe
a little extra money, sole life,

283
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:22,620
and I can go off for a nice weekend.
That's people.

284
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,780
It's when everybody starts
telling them it's them, you know,

285
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:30,270
that's keeping you down.
That's what their struggle.

286
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,120
You find it weird in a way that,
um,

287
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,320
we're thought of as political beast
because in a certain way we really haven't

288
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:40,650
talked about politics here.
And I find now,

289
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,980
I'm probably less interested in politics
now today than I've ever been in my

290
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,190
adult life in a bizarre way. You
know what I mean? Like I still,

291
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,840
I still love it at some level,

292
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,040
but like what we're doing here and what
I think the real conversation happening

293
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,010
in the world right now is,
is not political.

294
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,130
There's a class of people that are trying
to make everything political and keep

295
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:04,510
you confused and controlled.
Flooding the Russians.

296
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:09,480
Do you see the latest the
Russians, believe it or not,
the Russians, one of their,

297
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,070
one of their,
yeah,

298
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,370
campaigns happened when,
uh,

299
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,320
I don't remember which was that the last,
the last star wars movie, I think. Oh,

300
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,980
I did see this. They said that, uh, the
last jet I, that is Russian bots, right?

301
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,600
Well,
that's what Ryan Johnson,

302
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:29,601
I guess was there is evidence that they
were s they were politicizing the movie

303
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,280
that they were, they were putting out, oh,

304
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,260
you're not gonna like that
robot because that robot,

305
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:41,070
it's all about social justice. I remember
seeing it. The movie did suck and we,

306
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:43,790
you know, yeah, he's
here. I'm with you. Yeah.

307
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,620
But what I'm saying is we have outside
influences that are trying to make

308
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,590
everything about politics.
Read the book,

309
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,620
defining Hitler is the best,

310
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,770
best explanation of what
happened in Germany. Ever

311
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,150
written by a guy at the time
as a warning to the west.

312
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,890
Go and you don't know what,
you don't know where we've been.

313
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:08,460
You don't know what's happening
here. Warning. And so he,

314
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:12,930
he really gives you a,
a look at what was happening prior to,

315
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,850
and you can see it.
You're like, oh my gosh,

316
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:19,260
that's the world trade center going down.
Oh my gosh, that's this. You can see it

317
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,940
repeating it. And he says, right,

318
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,140
right around 1933
nothing is not political.

319
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,600
There is not one topic

320
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,380
that is political. When did this happen
to us? It's incredible. I mean just,

321
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:32,801
you know,

322
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:36,490
I never watch cable news anymore and I
don't even watch sports channels anymore

323
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:38,740
because it's all political.
But when I'm doing cardio,

324
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:42,250
I'll just flip channels and everything.
You go to his political,

325
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:45,440
the view is now always political. If
you're watching women's, you know,

326
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:50,050
basically women's television in the,
the ESPN now is political all the time.

327
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:51,400
I mean every channel.

328
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,770
So you'd probably turn on the food channel
and there's some political situation

329
00:20:54,771 --> 00:20:54,950
happens.

330
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,780
Let me tell you something
that I've never said out loud.

331
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:03,850
Only person I think that even knows
it in my own company. Oh, Stu,

332
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,030
my executive producer,

333
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,760
I couldn't tell you any of the names of
the people that are running for House

334
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:14,240
and Senate. I'm on talk
radio. I don't care.

335
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,160
I don't care.
I pay somebody to look at that.

336
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,890
Tell me what's the balance of
the House for the audience?

337
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:27,550
It does not affect me one iota
except in the big picture.

338
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,000
Which movement is moving. I just, it,

339
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,340
it's a waste of our time.

340
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,520
Think of how many man hours America
has lost in the last 15 years.

341
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,430
Think of what we could have
done with all of this time.

342
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,960
Forget about the money.

343
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,480
Is that the best argument for basically
sort of classical liberalism or

344
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:56,870
libertarianism that if we
could just reign this thing in,

345
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,890
that not only could you live however
you want it to live? Basically,

346
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,290
if the government was just
pretended protecting your,

347
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,930
your life and your property,
your rights, your rights, right.

348
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,930
That not only would that be good
because you could do what you want,

349
00:22:08,931 --> 00:22:12,980
but it would actually, Evan would
save you money and see, Oh yeah,

350
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,480
you'd heal.
You'd still have it.

351
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,980
You'd have it still on the local side,

352
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,550
which would be great that that would
actually, you know what I mean?

353
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:26,400
Is You'd still have people who had tried
to take the local area and they'd be

354
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:30,090
the big boss of the area, so you'd
have those things you'd have at least,

355
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:34,170
you'd have a little more control over
that you could control it or you could

356
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:36,600
move to the next town.
You know what I mean?

357
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:41,100
San Francisco can be as
weird as it wants to be.

358
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,230
They could live in, you
know, six feet of human poop.

359
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,930
That's fine.
If that's what you want to do.

360
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,030
You know there's an app for the human
poop. Did you know that? I'm not kidding.

361
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:56,290
There's actually an APP that tells you
where human poop is on the streets in San

362
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,123
Francisco.

363
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,440
Literally going back.
It's insane.

364
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,630
It's insane. I, I remember saying,

365
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,580
I remember saying people,
there's gonna come a time where you,

366
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,760
we will not recognize your country.
What you thought was solid will be liquid.

367
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:17,190
What you thought was real will be false.

368
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,980
You're not going to recognize it.

369
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,160
We're not only so far past that
point now too, where you're like,

370
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,450
I don't even know who anyone is. I don't
know what is real, what's, I don't know,

371
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,090
up and down anymore.
We're so far past that,

372
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,420
but what's incredible
and this is a good thing,

373
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:40,421
or could it a good thing because of
technology by 2030 you're not going to

374
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,280
recognize it. Anything.
Nothing will be the same.

375
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,290
Nothing will be the same.

376
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:53,530
It will be the difference between looking
at our lives in 2030 looking back and

377
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:56,870
going, Dave, you remember
2018 when we sat,

378
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,620
it will be as different than as if
we were sitting in now and going,

379
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,730
man, can you imagine what 1920
was like? It's going to be

380
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,390
be that different. You know,
this reminds me of a align,

381
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:13,750
I interviewed Peter Teal a couple
of weeks ago and he said that um,

382
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,730
crypto is for libertarians
and AI is for authoritarians.

383
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,850
And I think that that sort of gets to
the heart of what you're saying because

384
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:25,420
maybe what's going to happen
here is that as our institutions,

385
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:28,210
our political institutions, academic
institutions, media institutions,

386
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,100
as they become so big,
they can't sustain themselves anymore.

387
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:37,030
So maybe we will sort of break
off into smaller communities,

388
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:39,820
whatever that means. And we'll
sort of is about, that's what the,

389
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,070
that's what the declaration
of independence and the
constitution encouraged,

390
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,480
encouraged,

391
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,650
break off, do your own thing. You
should be a little laboratory,

392
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,470
be a little laboratory.
You come up with some of the great,

393
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,970
I'm sure the other states and the other
cities will adopt it. If, if it works,

394
00:24:55,971 --> 00:25:00,110
we're all love it. Stop, stop.
It's, it's not one experiment.

395
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,420
Why are we so, Lillian, why
are we so afraid of that?

396
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:06,310
Because I pushed that idea constantly
and it's like, you know, just that the,

397
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,530
that the laboratory should exist so
that if you want low taxes, you go here.

398
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:12,860
But then if that screws over the schools
then go somewhere else or whatever it

399
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:15,440
is that, that play. But people
are really afraid of that.

400
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:20,441
That somehow we're not actually America
if we don't live under the same exact

401
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:23,730
laws everywhere at which, as
you said, is the antithesis of,

402
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,860
of the founding documents.

403
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,360
People just have been convinced
that people are not trustworthy.

404
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:35,290
Well, people aren't trustworthy if they
never get in trouble. If they never,

405
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,690
banks are not trustworthy.

406
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,340
If they never have to pay for their
own mistakes, they're not trustworthy.

407
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,460
Um,
when you have to pay for your own mistake,

408
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,510
you learn when people generally become
trustworthy. You brought up Peter Teal.

409
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,520
People ask me all the time, are
you concerned about deeply? Yes.

410
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:59,550
I'm concerned about d platforming big
time and especially Dave with what's

411
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:03,360
coming with,
with deep fakes and all the,

412
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:08,260
there is trouble on the horizon.
Peter,

413
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,510
every time somebody says something,
I always say,

414
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,890
you know the guy who can solve this Peter
Teal because we need a platform and I

415
00:26:18,551 --> 00:26:23,350
mean left and right. A platform
whose charter is the bill of rights.

416
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,860
That's it.
If you agree with the bill of rights,

417
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,850
you're not trying to shut anybody up.
You believe in these things,

418
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:34,960
these human principles, what make us
human. Come on, put your thing on here.

419
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,270
We're not going to kick anybody off.
We're not going to do anything. Is this a,

420
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:43,330
this a place where speech
will be protected because
thoughts are supposed to be

421
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:45,894
dangerous.

422
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,250
It's only the dangerous thoughts
that led us to the moon.

423
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:54,270
It's only the dangerous thoughts that
invented television or the Internet.

424
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:57,660
It's a dangerous thought that that said,

425
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,900
I wonder if I can make fire like the
sky does or that's a dangerous thought.

426
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,070
You're going to burn everything
down. Well, they didn't. Yeah.

427
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,010
Well, I can't say more
than if you saw my, uh,

428
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,910
chat with Eric Weinstein
a couple of weeks ago.

429
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:18,060
The billionaire class is talking now.
So there,

430
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:21,980
there is some upbeat to hear that. Yeah.
One other thing on that and then, uh,

431
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,930
I will let your staff do other, I assume
they have other work to do around here.

432
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:29,160
You people do another work around here
that you got things to do today to, um,

433
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:34,790
do you think that if we get
out of this thing and it,

434
00:27:35,961 --> 00:27:40,080
and it's basically okay out of this sort
of morass that we're in right now and

435
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:44,040
that is basically okay that we'll
look back on this and think, whoa,

436
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,150
there was something really good
that came out of it because

437
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:52,300
yeah. Barack Obama was my
biggest nemesis. You don't know.

438
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,960
You don't know what it's like to come
under attack until the president of the

439
00:27:59,351 --> 00:28:01,260
United States. I've had
two of them now. Yeah.

440
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Is coming after you directly and using
the force of his friends and allies to

441
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:10,780
come after. Who was the other
one that went after? It was not,

442
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:13,870
Trump's probably was drunk. Yeah. During,
but yeah, at the beginning. The beginning.

443
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,740
Yeah.
So

444
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,730
call you after you basically were
like, all right, I'll, no, no, nothing.

445
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,230
You didn't get anything?
Nothing. No, no, no. All right.

446
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,890
And I'm fine with that. Yeah. Um, uh,

447
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,130
what was what we were talking about
that will come out on their side,

448
00:28:28,131 --> 00:28:31,430
but we'll look back and this is getting
Obama and Donald Trump have been some of

449
00:28:31,431 --> 00:28:35,240
the best things that's ever happened
to me. And I don't mean financially or,

450
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,140
you know,
whatever.

451
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:41,140
I mean as a man because they've both
taken me by the lapels and shoved me up

452
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:43,520
against the wall and said,

453
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,290
what is it you really
believe we are so blessed.

454
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:53,030
Do you know that really,
even my father's generation,

455
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,180
he came at the end of, you know,
he was born in 26 so he, you know,

456
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:57,440
he saw World War II and stuff,

457
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,860
but anybody who really grew up
in lived from 1946 until now,

458
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,380
we really have been very blessed.
But we've also been cursed.

459
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:15,050
No one has had to have
everything about them challenged.

460
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,790
I'm a better man.

461
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,230
You're a better man because every time
somebody throws you up against the wall,

462
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:25,730
we will be a better country.
We'll be a stronger, more vibrant,

463
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,850
more free people if we behave ourselves
and learn from what's throwing us up

464
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:35,780
against the wall. That's how I ended
in interview back. Good word rhetoric.
