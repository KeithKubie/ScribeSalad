00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:11.150
If you’re thinking that a 3 pack of condoms
costs around $5 and Mountain Dew is only $1.99

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.990
for the 2-liter, so why not save yourself
$3 on your contraception, think again!

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.990
Pay the extra money!

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.560
Mountain Dew does not kill your sperm, lower
sperm count, make your penis smaller, or shrivel

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.910
up your testicles (unless it’s ice cold
and placed directly on your testicles, then

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.160
there might be some temporary shriveling).

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.140
I always love a good urban legend.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.670
I once got a co-worker to believe coffee shrank
his penis.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.780
All I needed to do was use a bunch of big
words in a meaningful way.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.320
(It also helps being a paramedic, as people
tend to take your medically protestations

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.320
more seriously and you have a bigger store
of medical terms on hand.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.070
It provides quite a bit of fun, I can tell
you.)

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.760
I made sure to use medical terms he didn’t
understand, and BAM!

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.600
He stopped drinking coffee for weeks.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.640
He figured it out a few weeks later and never
believed anything I said again.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.000
I can only assume this myth came about in
a similar way.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.310
That being said, I’m never one to just say
something without explaining why.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.360
Let’s look at Mountain Dew and see why exactly
it doesn’t kill sperm.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.280
Mountain dew has numerous ingredients.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:22.500
The two that get mentioned the most in this
myth are caffeine and Yellow dye #5, also

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.450
known as Tartrazine.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.560
Let’s start with caffeine.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.980
Mountain dew contains 54mg of caffeine in
a 12 oz can.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.670
That might seem like a lot since coke has
34mg per 12 ounces, Dr. Pepper has 41, and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.250
Pepsi has 38.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.080
If caffeine was truly the cause, drinking
coffee would also have to be out.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.170
The average cup of drip coffee has 217mg per
12 ounces, about 4 times more than the Mountain

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.170
Dew!

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.060
So for comparison’s sake, Mountain Dew doesn’t
contain very much caffeine, compared to other

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.230
things many commonly drink.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.160
The idea that caffeine affects the chances
of having a baby is true.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.670
There have been several studies that show
women who drink 3 or more cups of coffee a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.709
day have a decreased chance of becoming pregnant
compared to those who don’t drink coffee.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.570
Unfortunately, the exact nature of why caffeine
affects conception rates is unknown.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.260
Because those who drink more caffeine also
tend to have unhealthier lifestyles, many

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:32.790
of the studies site life style as the reason
and not necessarily the caffeine itself.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.880
The idea that caffeine intake affects sperm
in some way seems to be dose related.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.720
The Chemical Health Hazard Assessment Division
of the Canadian Bureau of Chemical Safety

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.470
(they really need to work on that name!) reviewed
all the current studies on the subject and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.490
found that they showed that if a man drank
one or two cups of coffee per day, he would

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.900
have an increase in his sperms motility (the
ability to move) and density.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.480
If you drank 4 or more cups and also smoked
more than 1 pack of cigarettes per day, your

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.300
sperms motility and density would decrease.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.209
The study concluded that only heavy smokers
need to worry about drinking too much coffee

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.680
and sperm problems.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.450
The authors went on to say that those sperm
problems would most likely not affect fertility.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.599
In the end, it appears you would have to drink
about eleven 12 ounce cans of Mountain Dew

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.670
(or a similar amount of other popular caffeinated
soft drinks) and smoke over 20 cigarettes

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.470
before your sperm would be affected.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.860
If you did, that affect wouldn’t cause any
fertility issues.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.940
At that point, I would worry more about your
cancer and diabetes risk, not to mention the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.700
effects on your heart and lungs, before I
would worry about your sperm.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.290
Now let’s look at the other proposed cause
of sperm problems and Mountain Dew- Tartrazine

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.390
(yellow dye #5).

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.840
Tartrazine has been used in food, ice creams,
drugs, and many other products since 1916.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.870
Most all of Tartazine you put in your body
will come out in your urine.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.129
Very little is actually metabolized by our
bodies.

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:10.020
The European Food Safety Authority re-evaluated
the effects of Tartrazine in 2009.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.920
What they found was that there are no adverse
effects on reproduction or development from

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.419
consuming Tartazine.

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:24.169
They even tested people at a rate of 1225
mg/kg and still found no adverse effects.

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:30.850
So for a 175 pound person that’s 97,443
miligrams!

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.550
It would be impossible to drink enough Mountain
Dew to exceed these levels.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.050
Sperm affects aside, the FDA does recommend
that we should only ingest 5 milligrams per

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.250
kilogram per day of Yellow dye #5.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.360
This has nothing to do with reproduction worries,
but more about allergic reactions.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.930
There is a small percentage of the population
that is allergic to Yellow dye number 5 (1/10,000

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.770
causes hives according to the FDA).

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.259
The Center for Science in the Public Interest
notes that Tartrazine is found in so many

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:06.150
products, from Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and
Doritos to shampoos and hand stamps, that

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.110
the average daily consumption is approximately
12.75mg per day.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.710
At these levels, there is still no worries
about sperm problems- just allergy ones.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.560
In the end, Mountain Dew will not affect you
sperm, testis, or penis size in any way.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:30.520
Should you want to ignore all scientific evidence
to the contrary, I suggest you also have your

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.550
mate stand on her head after copulation.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:06:47.139
There is no way she could get pregnant then!

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.080
According to the World Health Organization,
the average ejaculation contains approximately

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.270
100 million sperm cells.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.830
If you have less than 20 million per milliliter,
you are at risk of infertility issues.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.789
Even though Mountain Dew doesn’t affect
sperm, temperature does.

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.219
Optimal sperm production requires specific
temperatures.

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:10.479
It’s for this reason that when men get too
cold, as in the case of swimming in a cold

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:13.860
pool (“I just got out of the pool!”) your
testes retract back into your body.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.279
Conversely, when you get too warm, your body
allows them to hang lower via the cremaster

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:19.279
muscle.

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:20.279
This keeps them cooler.

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:23.439
Many studies point to a temperature of between
35-36 degrees Celsius as the optimum sperm

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.439
production temperature.

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:29.370
Your body is normally around 37 degrees C.
The warmer your testes, the greater chance

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.930
your sperm will have damage.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:08:00.360
So keep the lap-tops off your lap and your
heated car seats on low!
