a tough question is what do you do when
 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.830
a tough question is what do you do when
you're part of a group and you're not

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840
you're part of a group and you're not
 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.720
you're part of a group and you're not
the leader of the group and and the

leader and the others are moving in a
particular direction and you think that

particular direction and you think that
 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.690
particular direction and you think that
it has ethical problems if we take a

look at the Challenger story there were

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620
look at the Challenger story there were
 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.620
look at the Challenger story there were
two engineers who were fighting against

two engineers who were fighting against
 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.380
two engineers who were fighting against
the launch but it turns out that they

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390
the launch but it turns out that they
 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.060
the launch but it turns out that they
weren't particularly well organized in

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
weren't particularly well organized in
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.000
weren't particularly well organized in
their data presentation and the fact

that they weren't well prepared the fact
that that their arguments were primarily

launch of the of the Challenger there
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.959
launch of the of the Challenger there
was a meeting and some of the engineers

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
was a meeting and some of the engineers
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.760
was a meeting and some of the engineers
at Morton Thiokol who provided the

and NASA under political pressure

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649
and NASA under political pressure

dramatically wanted to launch the most

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
dramatically wanted to launch the most
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.319
dramatically wanted to launch the most
astounding was the engineers were

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
astounding was the engineers were
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.350
astounding was the engineers were
looking at the seven previous launches

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
looking at the seven previous launches
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.660
looking at the seven previous launches
out of 24 where there had been problems

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
out of 24 where there had been problems
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.370
out of 24 where there had been problems
and they couldn't discern an appropriate

and they couldn't discern an appropriate
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530
and they couldn't discern an appropriate
pattern what they failed to do was to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
pattern what they failed to do was to
 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.149
pattern what they failed to do was to
ask what any engineer should have known

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
ask what any engineer should have known
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.010
ask what any engineer should have known
and that is if you want to know whether

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
and that is if you want to know whether
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109
and that is if you want to know whether
temperature is related to 10 to oring

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
temperature is related to 10 to oring
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.670
temperature is related to 10 to oring
failure you need to look at the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680
failure you need to look at the
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.620
failure you need to look at the
successes and the failures throughout

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
successes and the failures throughout
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.170
successes and the failures throughout
this process there was virtually no

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
this process there was virtually no
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.420
this process there was virtually no
discussion about the fact that seven

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
discussion about the fact that seven
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.609
discussion about the fact that seven
astronauts had their lives at stake the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
astronauts had their lives at stake the
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.249
astronauts had their lives at stake the
discussion turned entirely technical it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
discussion turned entirely technical it
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.499
discussion turned entirely technical it
had very much of a managerial feel to it

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
had very much of a managerial feel to it
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.370
had very much of a managerial feel to it
and the ethical part of the decision

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
and the ethical part of the decision
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.490
and the ethical part of the decision
faded from awareness so the question is

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
faded from awareness so the question is
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.460
faded from awareness so the question is
what kind of an intervention might have

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
what kind of an intervention might have
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.410
what kind of an intervention might have
been effective and and the amazing part

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
been effective and and the amazing part
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.090
been effective and and the amazing part
of the Challenger story is that the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
of the Challenger story is that the
 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.450
of the Challenger story is that the
intervention was shockingly easy all

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
intervention was shockingly easy all
 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.340
intervention was shockingly easy all
that was really needed was for somebody

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
that was really needed was for somebody
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.010
that was really needed was for somebody
to say if we want to know is temperature

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
to say if we want to know is temperature
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.620
to say if we want to know is temperature
related to a ring failure what data do

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
related to a ring failure what data do
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.999
related to a ring failure what data do
we need and the answer is quite obvious

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
we need and the answer is quite obvious
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.639
we need and the answer is quite obvious
we need a look at the data for all 24

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
we need a look at the data for all 24
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.620
we need a look at the data for all 24
launches rather than just the 7 launches

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
launches rather than just the 7 launches
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.359

difference in temperature between
successful and unsuccessful launches had

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930
successful and unsuccessful launches had
 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.970
successful and unsuccessful launches had
somebody asked that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980
somebody asked that
 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.100
somebody asked that
it would have been very easy to get the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110
it would have been very easy to get the
 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.860
it would have been very easy to get the
other 17 data points and when you look

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
other 17 data points and when you look
 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.350
other 17 data points and when you look
at all all 24 data points together the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360
at all all 24 data points together the
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.080
at all all 24 data points together the
decision to not launch becomes extremely

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090
decision to not launch becomes extremely
 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.330
decision to not launch becomes extremely
obvious so one critical issue for group

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
obvious so one critical issue for group
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.430
obvious so one critical issue for group

convince others to move in a different
direction is to make sure that you've

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879
direction is to make sure that you've
 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.220
direction is to make sure that you've
put all your data together

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
put all your data together
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.229
put all your data together
you have a good recent argument so that

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239
you have a good recent argument so that
 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.449
you have a good recent argument so that
people can see the wisdom of a more

people can see the wisdom of a more
ethical direction
