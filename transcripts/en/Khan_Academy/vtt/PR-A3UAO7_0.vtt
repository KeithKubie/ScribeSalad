00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:02.344
- [Voiceover] What I'm hoping
to explore in this video

00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:06.216
is the notion of a sample space.

00:00:06.914 --> 00:00:08.748
And it's a pretty, hopefully you'll find,

00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:10.119
straightforward idea.

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.547
If you're doing a trial,

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:15.327
something that is probabilistic,

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:17.045
a trial or an experiment,

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:21.109
a sample space is just the
set of the possible outcomes.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.772
So a very simple trial
might be a coin flip.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.643
So if you're talking about a coin flip,

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.432
well then the sample space is going to be

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:33.870
the set of all the possible outcomes.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.472
So you could get a heads

00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:38.537
or you could get a tails.

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:41.161
That right over here is the sample space

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:43.336
for the coin flip.

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:45.542
And it's very useful because,

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:48.701
for example, if these are
equally likely outcomes

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:50.651
and you say well what's the probability

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:51.966
of the event of a heads, you say

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.821
okay that's one out of the
two equally likely outcomes.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.842
Or you could even construct, once you know

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:58.212
all of the possible outcomes even if

00:00:58.212 --> 00:00:59.442
they aren't equally likely, you could say

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:01.253
well let's create a
probability distribution.

00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:03.551
We at least know what the sample space is.

00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:05.270
We know what the possible outcomes are,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.501
now let's think about the probability

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:07.871
of each of those outcomes.

00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:10.680
But a lot of times when people
talk about sample spaces,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.117
they're often, they tend to
be most useful, I would say,

00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:16.206
when you have equally likely outcomes

00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:19.086
like in the case of a fair coin flip.

00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:20.966
Because then from the sample space,

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.868
it's fairly straight forward
to think about the probability

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:26.028
of various events.

00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:28.234
But this is a simple sample
space right over here,

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:30.811
but let's make things a
little bit more interesting.

00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:32.367
Let's imagine a world,

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:34.711
so let's just put this aside a little bit.

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:37.197
Let's imagine a world
where there's a bakery

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:41.028
and at that bakery there are three types,

00:01:41.028 --> 00:01:42.810
three flavors of cupcakes,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.875
but there's also three
different sizes of cupcakes.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:49.310
So now we're essentially
looking at two different ways

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.140
in which the thing that we're
going to be sampling can vary.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.533
So what we're doing,
let me write this down.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.058
So we have our flavors,

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:01.449
flavors of cupcakes at this bakery.

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:04.327
And let's say that you have chocolate,

00:02:05.372 --> 00:02:06.767
chocolate,

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.876
you have, let's say there's strawberry,

00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:12.827
strawberry,

00:02:12.827 --> 00:02:15.008
and let's say that there is vanilla,

00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:17.796
there is vanilla.

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:20.483
And they come in three different sizes.

00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:22.568
So sizes.

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.401
Sizes could be small,

00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:28.885
I'll just write it out, small,

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:30.021
medium,

00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:32.594
or large.

00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:35.684
So if you were, and let's
say each of these flavors

00:02:35.684 --> 00:02:36.984
come in each of these sizes.

00:02:36.984 --> 00:02:38.051
Or you could view it the other way around,

00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:40.606
each of these sizes come
in all three flavors.

00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:42.625
So now how do you
construct the sample space?

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:43.787
If you were to say, look I'm gonna go,

00:02:43.787 --> 00:02:45.296
you know, I'm gonna blindfold myself

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:48.541
and walk into this bakery and randomly

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.305
somehow pickup a cupcake and my fingers

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:54.602
can't tell the flavor or
the size of the cupcake,

00:02:54.602 --> 00:02:57.041
what are the possible,
what are the possible

00:02:57.041 --> 00:03:00.197
outcomes for the cupcake I'll pick?

00:03:00.197 --> 00:03:02.358
And the outcome would be both the flavor

00:03:02.358 --> 00:03:04.671
and the size of the cupcake.

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:07.924
Well there's a bunch of
ways to think about this.

00:03:07.924 --> 00:03:10.548
One way is you could draw a tree.

00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:12.661
You could say, okay well I'm gonna pick

00:03:12.661 --> 00:03:13.891
three different flavors.

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:15.418
I could either pick chocolate,

00:03:16.516 --> 00:03:17.811
chocolate,

00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:19.621
I'm gonna pick strawberry,

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.688
strawberry,

00:03:22.688 --> 00:03:24.590
or I'm going to pick vanilla,

00:03:25.892 --> 00:03:27.237
vanilla.

00:03:27.237 --> 00:03:28.562
And then for each of those flavors,

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:30.750
I'm only gonna pick a
small, medium, or large.

00:03:31.263 --> 00:03:33.376
So you could say small,

00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:35.650
medium, large.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.950
Small, so this is a small chocolate,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.364
this is a medium chocolate,
this is a large chocolate.

00:03:40.364 --> 00:03:44.056
This is a small strawberry,
medium strawberry,

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:45.728
large strawberry.

00:03:45.728 --> 00:03:49.327
This is a small vanilla, medium vanilla,

00:03:49.327 --> 00:03:50.976
large vanilla.

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:53.228
And so you see there's
nine possible outcomes.

00:03:53.228 --> 00:03:55.829
Once again, this is a medium chocolate.

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.638
You picked a chocolate
and it was a medium one.

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:00.611
This is a large vanilla.

00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:03.049
You picked a vanilla,
and it is a large one.

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.257
And you could have done
it the other way around.

00:04:04.257 --> 00:04:05.324
You could have said, well okay,

00:04:05.324 --> 00:04:07.902
I'm going to either pick a small,

00:04:07.902 --> 00:04:10.224
medium, or large

00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:11.548
and then for each of those I'm gonna pick

00:04:11.548 --> 00:04:13.451
either a chocolate,
strawberry, or vanilla.

00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:15.299
And I'll just use the first letters.

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.105
So I'm either gonna pick a chocolate,

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:19.520
a strawberry, or a vanilla.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.237
When I write the S over
here in this magenta color,

00:04:22.237 --> 00:04:23.769
I'm talking about the flavor

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:25.463
and if I write the S in green,

00:04:25.463 --> 00:04:27.228
I'm talking about small.

00:04:27.228 --> 00:04:30.689
So here you can have, if
you have a medium cupcake,

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.035
it could be chocolate,

00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:33.312
it could be strawberry,

00:04:33.312 --> 00:04:34.515
or it could be vanilla.

00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:35.489
If you have a large cupcake

00:04:35.489 --> 00:04:37.023
it could be chocolate,

00:04:37.023 --> 00:04:38.346
strawberry,

00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:40.529
or vanilla.

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:44.011
So for example, this was a
medium, chocolate cupcake.

00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:47.540
Over here a medium, chocolate
cupcake is this one.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.368
It's medium, chocolate.

00:04:50.065 --> 00:04:52.085
It would be that one over here.

00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:53.526
So you could use these

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.523
kind of a tree diagram like this

00:04:55.523 --> 00:04:57.961
to think about the sample space,

00:04:57.961 --> 00:05:00.468
to think about the nine
possible outcomes here.

00:05:00.468 --> 00:05:01.746
But you could also,

00:05:01.746 --> 00:05:03.626
you could also do a,

00:05:03.626 --> 00:05:04.787
I guess you could say grid,

00:05:04.787 --> 00:05:05.965
where you could write

00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:07.979
the flavors, so you could have chocolate,

00:05:09.513 --> 00:05:10.806
chocolate,

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:12.874
actually, let me just write the,

00:05:12.874 --> 00:05:14.337
well no, let me write them out.

00:05:14.337 --> 00:05:15.637
Actually, let me just,

00:05:15.637 --> 00:05:16.868
let me just write the letters since this

00:05:16.868 --> 00:05:18.424
is gonna take a long time to do.

00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:20.212
So you could have the flavors chocolate,

00:05:20.212 --> 00:05:21.813
strawberry, vanilla.

00:05:21.813 --> 00:05:24.205
So that's along that axis.

00:05:24.205 --> 00:05:25.785
And then you have your sizes.

00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:27.944
You can have a small,

00:05:27.944 --> 00:05:29.616
a medium,

00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:31.102
or large.

00:05:31.102 --> 00:05:33.023
And you can set up a grid here.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.687
So this is another way to do it.

00:05:36.687 --> 00:05:40.019
And notice this grid has nine boxes.

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:41.332
So let's look at it.

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.397
So set up the grid.

00:05:45.722 --> 00:05:47.279
Set up the grid.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.020
And so what is this one going to be?

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.365
This is a small chocolate.

00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:52.426
Small.

00:05:53.334 --> 00:05:55.842
Small chocolate.

00:05:55.842 --> 00:05:57.861
Small chocolate.

00:05:57.861 --> 00:05:58.977
What is this one?

00:05:58.977 --> 00:06:01.826
This is going to be a small,

00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:04.560
a small strawberry,

00:06:05.353 --> 00:06:08.557
A small strawberry.

00:06:08.557 --> 00:06:10.507
And you could just keep
constructing like this

00:06:10.507 --> 00:06:13.604
where everything in this row,
there are all about small.

00:06:13.604 --> 00:06:14.259
Oops.

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:15.857
Do it in the...

00:06:15.857 --> 00:06:17.780
This is small.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.753
I'm having trouble changing colors.

00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:21.262
Alright (laughing).

00:06:21.262 --> 00:06:25.558
There is a small and then this is a small,

00:06:25.558 --> 00:06:27.625
this is a small vanilla.

00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:29.690
This color changing is really,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.037
it's a difficult thing.

00:06:31.037 --> 00:06:32.454
Small vanilla.

00:06:32.454 --> 00:06:33.871
And all of these, these are all,

00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:35.751
this would be a medium chocolate.

00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:37.238
Medium strawberry.

00:06:37.238 --> 00:06:38.560
Medium vanilla.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.300
Large chocolate, large strawberry,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.206
large vanilla.

00:06:42.206 --> 00:06:43.785
And once again you have nine outcomes.

00:06:43.785 --> 00:06:45.086
This is another way to think about

00:06:45.086 --> 00:06:47.245
all of the possible outcomes when

00:06:47.245 --> 00:06:49.126
you're looking at these two ways

00:06:49.126 --> 00:06:51.609
in which my cupcakes could vary.

00:06:51.609 --> 00:06:53.235
Another way, a third way
that you could do it,

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:54.815
is you could literally
just construct a table.

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.625
Well you could say, okay

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.993
I could have a chocolate,

00:06:58.993 --> 00:07:00.340
actually I'm going to
use the letters again.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.776
So let's say we make,
this is the flavor column.

00:07:04.776 --> 00:07:07.671
And then this is the size column.

00:07:08.857 --> 00:07:10.087
Size column.

00:07:10.087 --> 00:07:11.412
And so you could say

00:07:11.412 --> 00:07:14.709
I could have a chocolate that is,

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:16.520
so let's see, there's
three types of chocolate

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.553
that I could have.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.272
And they could be

00:07:20.272 --> 00:07:24.172
they could be small, medium, or large.

00:07:24.172 --> 00:07:27.068
You could say there's three types of,

00:07:27.678 --> 00:07:29.531
three types of strawberry.

00:07:29.531 --> 00:07:31.782
It could be small, medium, or large.

00:07:31.782 --> 00:07:33.263
So let me write that in.

00:07:33.263 --> 00:07:36.119
Small, medium, large.

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:38.755
Or you could say oh, there's
three types of vanilla.

00:07:39.997 --> 00:07:42.472
There's three types of,

00:07:42.472 --> 00:07:44.237
I'm color changing again.

00:07:44.237 --> 00:07:46.188
Three types of vanilla.

00:07:46.188 --> 00:07:47.929
Once again, it could be

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:50.738
small, medium, or large.

00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:53.386
So you have these nine possibilities.

00:07:53.386 --> 00:07:55.753
Now, sample space,

00:07:55.753 --> 00:07:57.077
the sample space isn't telling you

00:07:57.077 --> 00:07:59.121
if they're equally likely or not.

00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:00.114
It's just telling you, hey, if

00:08:00.114 --> 00:08:01.321
you're gonna do an experiment,

00:08:01.321 --> 00:08:03.365
what are all the different possibilities,

00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:06.521
the possible outcomes for that experiment?

00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:08.844
Now in the case where
they are equally likely,

00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:11.770
it can be very, very
useful because you can say

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.323
you could do something like, if you said

00:08:14.323 --> 00:08:16.367
okay, it's equally likely to pick any one

00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:18.386
of these nine outcomes, you could say

00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:20.825
well what's the probability of,

00:08:20.825 --> 00:08:23.867
what's the probability of
getting something that is

00:08:23.867 --> 00:08:27.025
either small or chocolate?

00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:28.743
And so you could see well
how many of those events

00:08:28.743 --> 00:08:31.436
out of the total actually
meet that constraint?

00:08:31.436 --> 00:08:33.526
But we'll do more of
that in future videos.

00:08:33.526 --> 00:08:35.732
That's just a little bit of a clue

00:08:35.732 --> 00:08:38.170
of why we even care about things

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.283
like sample spaces.

00:08:40.283 --> 00:08:42.372
Especially sample spaces like this,

00:08:42.372 --> 00:08:44.230
where we're looking along two ways

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.947
or multiple ways that something can vary.

00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:49.292
And these types of sample
spaces in particular

00:08:49.292 --> 00:08:52.356
are called compound sample spaces.

00:08:52.356 --> 00:08:53.913
So these right over here,

00:08:53.913 --> 00:08:57.163
this is a compound sample space,

00:08:57.163 --> 00:08:58.975
because we're looking
at two different ways

00:08:58.975 --> 00:08:59.856
that it can vary.

00:08:59.856 --> 00:09:01.064
Not just a heads or tails,

00:09:01.064 --> 00:09:03.177
it can vary by size or by flavor.

00:09:03.177 --> 00:09:04.896
And you can even have compound

00:09:04.896 --> 00:09:07.587
sample spaces that vary
in more than two ways.
