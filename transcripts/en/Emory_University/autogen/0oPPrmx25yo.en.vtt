course you know that this crosstalk is

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790
course you know that this crosstalk is
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.970
course you know that this crosstalk is
very important for promoting and and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980
very important for promoting and and
 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.200
very important for promoting and and
governing also adaptive immunity so it's

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210
governing also adaptive immunity so it's
 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.230
governing also adaptive immunity so it's
a reason why we started to be interested

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240
a reason why we started to be interested
 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.360
a reason why we started to be interested
in our lab regarding the impact of HIV

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370
in our lab regarding the impact of HIV
 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.740
in our lab regarding the impact of HIV
infection on this crosstalk particularly

infection on this crosstalk particularly
 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.320
infection on this crosstalk particularly
since we know that in order to control

since we know that in order to control
 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.840
since we know that in order to control
HIV infection dissemination and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850
HIV infection dissemination and
 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.260
HIV infection dissemination and
pathogenesis we know that we have to act

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270
pathogenesis we know that we have to act
 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.000
pathogenesis we know that we have to act
very early as this slide from originally

very early as this slide from originally
 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.940
very early as this slide from originally
from Ashley Haase is telling us we know

from Ashley Haase is telling us we know
 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.960
from Ashley Haase is telling us we know
that indeed we have to act as soon as

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970
that indeed we have to act as soon as
 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.010
that indeed we have to act as soon as
the virus is crossing the barrier and to

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020
the virus is crossing the barrier and to
 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.860
the virus is crossing the barrier and to
avoid local expansion dissemination and

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
avoid local expansion dissemination and

also that there is an association
 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.490
also that there is an association
between TF 3d s1 and the low progression

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500
between TF 3d s1 and the low progression
 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.589

at the beginning of the cooperation with
 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.779
at the beginning of the cooperation with
Vietnam we had that idea to establish a

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789
Vietnam we had that idea to establish a
 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.749
Vietnam we had that idea to establish a
cohort of IV drug users to try to study

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759
cohort of IV drug users to try to study
 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.920
cohort of IV drug users to try to study
the IV drug users to try to develop

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930
the IV drug users to try to develop
 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.610
the IV drug users to try to develop
studies and on clinical trials and so on

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620
studies and on clinical trials and so on
 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.279
studies and on clinical trials and so on
however when we were trying to establish

however when we were trying to establish
 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.870
however when we were trying to establish
a cohort we find out whether a very nice

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880
a cohort we find out whether a very nice
 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.769
a cohort we find out whether a very nice
interim observation we found some

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:06.779
interim observation we found some
 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:10.219

started also to study whether the
 

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.210
started also to study whether the

activated NK cell at the particular NK
 

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.520
activated NK cell at the particular NK
