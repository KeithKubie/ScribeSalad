00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.500
*Menacing music*

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.500
*Boy screams*

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.100
*Monster screams*

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.900

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.000
Welcome to Now You See It.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.500
*screaming*

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.700

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.300
An effective moment in a scary movie requires extremely precise editing and camera direction

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.700
to actually be scary.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.300
I found a cool case study to outline this idea in a movie currently out in theaters called 'Lights Out'.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.500
The movie's based off of a short film with the same name, general concept, and director.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.800
What's interesting is that the movie and the short film have a moment that's basically the same,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.900
but I think one is much scarier than the other

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.700
But what do you think?

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.500
Let's look at both scary moments, and see which one is done better.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.700
Let's start with the movie:

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.200

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.200

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.200

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.200

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.500

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.500
Now the short film:

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.500

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.500

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.500

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.500

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.500

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.900
So, which one's scarier?

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.300
My guess is you picked the short film, but why?

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.500
Let's take a look at how the short film perfectly uses many horror techniques,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.700
while the movie, despite being so similar, doesn't.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.300
I think the most important difference is the length of the clip.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.700
The movie clip is actually from the trailer, because the movie's still in theaters.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.500
The trailer cut makes the movie clip about four seconds shorter.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.800
In those four seconds the short film has an extra flicker of the lights.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.700
With each added second is a lot more suspense added to the scary moment,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.700
so when the pattern suddenly changes, and the ghost moves, it's that much more startling.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.700
Let's say you want to scare the audience with a clown attack. How do you do it?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.900
Do you let the clown sit, motionless, for thirty long seconds,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.700
while we have no choice but to uncomfortably stare at it?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.700

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.800

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.300
And then all of a sudden, it's gone.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.100
Or do you show the clown for a few seconds at a time, and throw in a couple random jump scares

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.700
with no build-up or continuity?

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.700

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.700

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.700

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.700

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.500

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.300
It's making the choice between one really big scare or a bunch of little ok scares;

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.500
which moment builds up the payoff better?

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.900
Another difference in the two moments is that the short film has a very powerful shot right here.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.300
It's from the creature's point of view as it looks towards the woman, like a predator stalking it's prey.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.500
This shot makes the woman look small and powerless.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.900
This is a shot we're all familiar with in horror movies.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.100
It adds suspense by showing a character being watched by the monster.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.900
The problem with the movie clip is it just switches from her reaction to a shot of the monster,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.900
and it's not as menacing as the point-of-view shot.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.500
Finally, where are they in the movie? A warehouse?

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.200
It's never fully addressed in the movie, and it makes the moment less scary

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.200
because we're unfamiliar with the location.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.400
A big component of many horror films is that these monsters, or serial killers, or supernatural beings

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.700
invade places where we thought we were safe.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.900
That's what makes it scary.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.900
*policeman on phone*: "We've traced the call, it's coming from inside the house!"

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.500
*cont.*: "Our squad cars are heading over there right now, just get out of that house!"

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.800

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.800
Home invasion is a real life fear, and when we're in our pajamas, heading to bed,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.500
that's when we're at our most vulnerable.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.200
The short film really capitalizes on this idea, and it's genuinely scary.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.400
In the movie, we see an unfamiliar monster in a place we're already unfamiliar with,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400
so it's not as scary.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.400
Those are the three main differences, I think, but you could go even deeper.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.600
For one thing, in the short film, the lady is always bright in the shot,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.400
so it seems more menacing when we can see her clearly while also seeing the ghost.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.400
In the movie, when the ghost is visible, the lady can't really be seen,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.100
so she seems more removed from the monster and the threat.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.300
I also think the ambient hum in the background makes the short film scarier.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.000
Also the fact that in the short film the lady has to walk through the hallway where the ghost already is.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.200
That seems scarier than having the lady already at the light switch.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.800
But what do you think? Are there any other aspects that make the short film scarier?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.200
Am I overthinking something? Leave your comments below.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.500
Getting a laugh requires a funny performance, or a well timed cut.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.500
Getting people to cry maybe takes strong characters and a gorgeous film score.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.500
Getting an amazing shot requires compelling cinematography.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.700
But to get a scare? You need everything at once.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.100
The music, the timing, the script, the actors: everything has to work together or else it's not scary.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.700
So before you go to sleep tonight, ask yourself: what scares me the most?

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.700
Thanks for watching.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.700

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.700

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.100

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.100
*screaming*

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.100
"Kitty!"

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:20.100
