00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:04.670
LAURA LING (VOICEOVER):
I've traveled

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.266
the world working
as a journalist

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.390
and international reporter.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.550
LAURA LING: They're trying to
restore control, restore order.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.710
You can see the bullet
casings right here.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.960
LAURA LING (VOICEOVER): I
think that I have tried hard

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.100
to shine a light on issues that
need the world's attention.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.990
LAURA LING: In March of 2009 I
traveled to Northeastern China

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.020
to report on a story about
North Korean defectors.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.490
And it was while we were filming
along the frozen Tumen river

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.780
that we were chased down
by North Korean soldiers.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.290
Everything just
happened so quickly.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.430
I was eventually
knocked unconscious

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.570
and dragged into North Korea.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.190
It was the scariest
time of my life.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.760
I was isolated in
what is perhaps

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.130
the most isolated
country in the world.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:58.370
It was very easy for these
dark thoughts to invade my mind

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.600
and spiral me into a depression.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.990
I thought that I had failed
the North Korean refugees

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.740
that I had gone to cover.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.040
I felt that I had
failed my family.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.800
I did know about various vigils
that were taking place for us

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.150
across the country and in
other parts of the world.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.390
In very dark moments, I would
think about those lights.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.410
Seconds there seem
like an eternity.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.180
But there was
something that I began

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.050
to do that helped me
get through each day.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.660
And it was a very simple act.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.750
It was practicing
the act of gratitude.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.060
And I just started doing it one
day, where I was sitting down

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.450
and I thought to
myself, Laura think

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.490
about something that happened
today that you can actually

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.780
feel grateful for, despite
this horrible situation

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.240
that you're in.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.210
And so I would say to
myself, for example,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.240
I feel lucky I saw a
butterfly outside my window,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.479
even though I can't
breathe the fresh air.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.340
I feel grateful that I got to
go outside for a few moments

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.811
and see the sun and feel
the warmth on my skin.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.762
Getting letters
from my family, I

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:30.950
memorized each and every word.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.744
Doing this definitely was a
turning point for me mentally.

00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:38.050
I think that there
was a point where

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.420
I was only thinking about
the negative possibilities.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.450
That I wouldn't see
my family again.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.680
That I wouldn't
ever have children.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.170
That I would spend the rest
of my life in that country.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.556
But being able to focus on some
of those glimmers of light,

00:02:57.556 --> 00:03:00.930
it really did help
give me the strength

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.810
to look at each new day
as a new possibility.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.940
After I came home,
I actually continued

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.310
to practice this
act of gratitude.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.220
And it's a ritual
that I do to this day.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.380
And I do it as a reminder
of the things that

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.895
are important in my life.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.103
Things that I want to
cherish and treasure.

00:03:35.933 --> 00:03:39.090
Because this ritual had
such an impact on me

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.520
and who I am today,
I want explore

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.420
the rituals of other people.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.920
To understand and learn
about these practices that

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.070
have helped others get through
their struggles and obstacles,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.570
and have really helped
define who they are.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.900
And so I hope that
this series is

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.076
this inspirational look into
what drives the human spirit.

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:06.180

LAURA LING: much do you
have riding on this,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.915
for this to work?

00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:27.040
NICK FOUCH: This is kind
of everything that I have.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.430
I don't really have
a plan B. I don't

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.190
know how I would go back now.
