00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.089
Hi I’m Adriene Hill, and welcome to Crash
Course Statistics.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.630
In the last video we tried to make sense of
ginormous numbers.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.420
And teeny-tiny numbers.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.370
Today we’re going to talk about less showy
numbers.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.389
The numbers stuck in the middle.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.389
The averages.

00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:17.389
The medians.

00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:18.100
The modes.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.020
They may not seem as mind-blowing.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.070
Or all that flashy.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.530
But, turns out they are really, really important.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.670
Those middle numbers are often the ones that
get ALL the press attention.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.109
Get tossed back in forth in political debate.

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.390
And...they give us this little fun bit of
trivia…

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.729
What’s the average...or mean... number of
feet people have?

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:38.120
It’s not 2.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.469
Turns out the average number of feet people
has is a little less than 2.

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.170
Cause the average takes into account the small
number of people out there with fewer than

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.170
2 feet.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.700
So, if you have two feet, you have more than
the average number of feet.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.060
`And wIth that...let’s get what into “measures of central tendency” are, and why they’re useful.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:05.240
INTRO

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.200
If your boss asks you for a report on this
quarter’s sales numbers but is rushing to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.810
a meeting and only has time to listen to one
piece of information about the data, that

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.650
piece of information you give her should probably
be a measure of central tendency.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.700
The center of a bunch of data points is usually
a good example (or summary) of the type of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.619
data we can expect from the group as a whole.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.659
One common measure of the middle is the mean.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.770
You’ve likely heard it called the average--though
all of these measures are sometimes called

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.770
“averages”.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.549
Some people call it the “expectation”
of a set of data.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.850
The mean...or average...takes the sum of all
the numbers in a data set, and divides by

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.970
the number of data points.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.439
So, if 10 pregnant dogs give birth to 50 total
puppies--the average litter size is 5 puppies.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.340
Each data point, in this case each litter
of puppies, contributes equally to the calculation.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.780
Awwwww.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.960
Here’s another example.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.399
Say you you have ten dollars and your best
friend has 20 dollars, the mean amount of

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.229
cash you two have is 15 dollars.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.780
Ten-plus-twenty-divided by two.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.300
But saying that the mean is fifteen dollars--doesn’t
mean you each can buy that 12-dollar BFF necklace

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.340
you’ve been eyeing...the one with the half-a-heart
that fits together.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.180
You personally only have ten dollars in your
pocket.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.590
The average of a set of data points tells
us something about the data as a whole, but

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.360
it doesn’t tell us about individual data
points.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.520
The mean is good at measuring things that
are relatively “normally” distributed.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.060
“Normal” means a distribution of data
that has roughly the same amount of data on

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.120
either side of the middle, and has its most
common values around the middle of the data.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.670
Data that are distributed normally will have
a symmetrical bell shape that you’ve probably

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.400
seen before.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.060
A distribution shows us how often each value
occurs in our data set, which is also known

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.060
as their frequency.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.379
Imagine you are trying to impress your new
college dorm mates by guessing how many times

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.420
they’ve each seen Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s
Stone.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.560
Your mom is in the entertainment industry
and you overheard, at her last dinner party,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.049
that 18 year olds, on average, had seen the
movie five times each.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.349
That’s a lot of quidditch.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.349
So you should guess your new friends have
seen the movie five times each.

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.709
(Unless you can clearly see Slytherin tattoos.)

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.990
You won’t be right each time, but it’s
your best guess.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.890
It might not be the best way to impress them
though.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.329
It’s not a great party trick.

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.430
Sometimes the mean is misleading.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.260
For instance: life expectancy in the Middle
Ages.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.900
As we explored in Crash Course World History,
there was an incredibly high rate of infant

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.040
mortality in the days before modern medicine,
but the people who made it to adulthood lived

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.000
relatively long lives.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.800
Because of the high rate of infant and child
mortality, the average life expectancy was

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.730
about thirty years.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.959
But things weren’t nearly as dire as all
that.

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.450
Not if you actually made it to 30.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.379
In the 13th century a male who lived to 30--was
likely to make it into his fifties!

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:54.160
To give unusually large or small values, also
called outliers, less influence on our measure

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.110
of where the center of our data is, we can
use the median.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.560
Unlike the mean, the median doesn’t use
the value of every data point in it’s calculation.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.129
The median is the middle number if we lined
up our data from smallest to largest.

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.300
For example, if you have two cats, Julian
has one cat, and Erik has three cats, the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.900
median number of cats in your little cat-loving
group would be two.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.840
When we put the number of cats in order from
least to most cats, two is in the middle.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.380
But what if there’s no middle number?

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.450
You invite Will to join your cat group.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.680
He has an impressive ...or is it
excessive...total of fourteen cats.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.320
Now there are four cat owners.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.670
There is no one middle number; both two and
three are in the middle.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.910
In this case there are differing opinions
on how to calculate the median, but most often

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.950
we take the mean of the two middle numbers,
so our median would be 2.5 cats.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.950
Meow.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.950
Meow Me….

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.940
Let’s go to the thought bubble.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.650
Imagine ten artists have been working for
years, together, to come up with a new, fresh

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.480
way to tie macrame knots.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.820
The standard square knot...just wasn’t inspiring
them the way it used to.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.820
And finally.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.820
They do.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.820
Viola!

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.820
The abracadabra-doolittle knot!

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.350
So these 10 artists go out to celebrate.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.880
And they go to a relatively modestly priced
restaurant...cause macrame artists don’t

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.230
make all that much money.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.710
Each of them pulls in about $20,000 a year.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.830
So the average...or mean... income in around
the table is twenty-thousand dollars.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.500
And the median income is also twenty-thousand
dollars.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.290
Now, let’s imagine that Elon Musk gets wind
of this macrame milestone.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.330
Turns out...he’s a huge macrame fan himself.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.890
Beauty in design.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.110
He couldn’t miss up a chance to celebrate...So
he decides to show up at the restaurant.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.890
Musk’s total annual compensation...including
his salary and stock options...is reportedly

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.800
in the neighborhood of 100-million dollars.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.770
As soon as Musk walks in the door.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.380
The average income in the room...skyrockets...to
a little over 9 million dollars.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.130
But...nobody else in the room is ACTUALLY
richer...nobody feels any richer.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.480
The median income of the macrame artists and
Musk is still $20,000 because most of our

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.260
group is still making $20,000.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.540
And...this isn’t just the stuff of make-believe
macrame world...it happens in REAL life too...the

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.710
“average” is distorted by outliers.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.900
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.620
Alright, now say there’s a controversial
book on Amazon called Pineapple Belongs on

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.400
Pizza, with 400 reviews; 200 five-star reviews,
and 200 one-star reviews.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.100
The mean number of stars given was 3, but
no one in our sample actually gave the book

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.050
3 stars, just like no one could actually have
the median of 2.5 cats.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.500
In both of these situations, it can be useful
to look at the mode.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.800
The word mode comes from the Latin word modus,
which means “manner, fashion, or style”

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.740
and gives us the French expression a la mode,
meaning fashionable.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.140
Just like the most popular and fashionable
trends, the mode is the most popular value.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.340
But not popular like Despacito.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.490
When we refer to the “mode” of our data,
we mean the value that appears most in our

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.590
data set.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.390
For our Amazon book review of Pineapple Belongs
on Pizza the modes are both 5 and 1, which

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.090
give us a better understanding of how people
feel about the book.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.590
These reviews are called “bimodal” because
there are two values that are most common.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.420
Bimodal data is an example of “Multimodal”
data which has many values that are similarly

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.430
common.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.120
Usually multimodal data results from two or
more underlying groups all being measured

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120
together.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.740
In the case of our book, the two groups were
the “love it” five-star group, and the

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.310
“hate it” one-star group.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.770
Or for another example, if we made a graph
of the times customers went to IN-N-OUT, we’d

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.160
probably see two peaks because there’s two
groups of people: one around lunch time, and

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.890
one around dinnertime.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.590
The mode is useful here because it’s an
actual value that occurs in our data set,

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.500
unlike the median and mean which can give
us numbers that wouldn’t actually occur

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.610
and don’t describe our data very well.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.680
The mean time people come into In-N-Out may
very well be 3:30pm, but that doesn't suggest

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.710
you should expect an overflowing restaurant
in the middle of the afternoon.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.340
You should be able to get your animal style
burger ...without too much of a wait.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.890
The mode is most useful when you have a relatively
large sample so that you have a large number

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.960
of the popular values.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.430
One other benefit of the mode is that it can
be used with data that isn't numeric.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.040
Like, if I ask everyone their favorite color,
I could have a mode of “blue”.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.260
There’s no such thing as a “mean” or
average favorite color.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.370
The relationship between the mean, median,
and mode can tell us a lot about the distribution

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.370
of data.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.830
In normal distribution that we mentioned earlier
they’re all the same.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.710
We know that the middle value of the data
(the median) is also the most common (the

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.150
mode) and is the peak of the distribution.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.620
The fact that the median and mean are the
same tells us that the distribution is symmetric:

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.089
there’s equal amounts of data on either
side of the median, and equal amounts on either

00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:40.089
side of the mean.

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:44.660
Statisticians say the normal distribution
has zero skew, since the mean and median are

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.730
the same.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.750
When the median and mean are different, a
distribution is skewed, which is a way of

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.399
saying that there are some unusually extreme
values on one side of our distribution, either

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.589
large or small in our data set.

00:08:56.589 --> 00:09:00.610
With a skewed distribution, the mode will
still be the highest point on the distribution,

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:05.220
and the median will stay in the middle, but
the mean will be pulled towards the unusual

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.220
values.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.470
So, if the mean is a lot higher than the median
and mode, that tells you that there’s a

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.850
value (or values) that are relatively large
in your data set.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.100
And a mean that’s a lot lower than your
median and mode tells you that there’s a

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.300
value (or values) that are relatively small
in your dataset.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.820
Let’s go to the News Desk.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.660
The average income of a US family GREW 4 percent
between 2010 and 2013.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:36.240
Those average paychecks expanded from 84-thousand-dollars
to over 87-thousand dollars.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.959
But not everyone is cheering.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.189
The median income FELL five percent during
those same years.

00:09:43.189 --> 00:09:50.180
Median family income dropped from 49-thousand dollars to just over 46 and a half thousand dollars.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.480
This really happened, back in the years after
the financial crisis.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.140
The mean income rose at the same time the
median income fell.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:02.040
That’s because families at the tip-top of
the income distribution...we’re making more money.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.420
And pushing the mean up.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.920
While many other families were making less.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:11.370
And even though unscrupulous politicians could
accurately claim “average incomes are rising”--and

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.749
pat themselves on the back--it would be misleading.

00:10:13.749 --> 00:10:18.449
For most Americans during that stretch incomes
were flat or falling.

00:10:18.449 --> 00:10:21.870
This points to another really important point
about statistics, a point we’ll come back

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.380
to time and time again during this series.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.400
Statistics can be simultaneously true ...and
deceptive.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.450
And an important part of statistics is understanding
which questions you are trying to answer.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.140
And whether or not the information you have
is answering those questions.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.300
Statistics can help us make decisions.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.370
But we’ve all gotta use our common sense.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.810
And a little skepticism.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.810
Thanks for watching.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.200
I’ll see you next time.
