00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.490
An average healthy adult responds to nature’s
call anywhere between 4 and 10 times each

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.490
day.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.400
The need to take a leak begins when pressure
in the bladder rises, stretching the bladder

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.360
wall which is made up of bands of smooth muscle
(detrusor) that are filled with beta adrenergic

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.940
receptors that send and receive messages between
the muscle’s cells and the nervous system.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.650
While the bladder is initially stretching
as it fills via the ureters propelling urine

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.480
from the kidneys to your bladder, messages
are sent from the sympathetic nervous system

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.610
(the fight or flight part of the autonomic
nervous system) via the hypogastric nerve

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.970
to the detrusor muscles telling them to suppress
the urge to contract.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.440
At this point, you experience no urge to pee
and even if you wanted to, (unless you’re

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.900
experiencing some sort of renal system issue)
you typically wouldn’t be able to without

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.320
doing something to squeeze the bladder manually
(pushing on it directly, using your abdominal

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.620
muscles, etc.).

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.869
This is due to an internal urethral sphincter
keeping things closed tight along with the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.630
lack of squeezing by the detrusor, both controlled
by your autonomic nervous system.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.380
As the urine in the bladder reaches approximately
one quarter to half full, however, the stretch

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.750
receptors in the detrusor as well as other
receptors in and around the opening to the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.450
urethra (the tube that runs from the bladder
to the outside world) signal back to the Sacral

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.250
region of the spinal cord triggering the micturition
reflex, as well as letting your brain (and

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.700
you) know it’s time to pee.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.450
The parasympathetic system kicks in and signals
the detrusor muscle to now alternate between

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.850
contracting and relaxing, in a process known
as the micturition wave.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.119
If you choose to simply hold it, your brain
sends impulses down the spinal cord inhibiting

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.330
the micturition reflex, particularly making
sure your external urethral sphincter is ignoring

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.740
a secondary action of the micturition reflex
which is telling your voluntary external sphincter

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.570
it should go ahead and relax and let the urine
flow.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.150
These impulses from the brain, thus, make
sure this sphincter stays clamped shut until

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.690
you decide it’s time to pee.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.560
However, the longer you continue to hold it,
the less effective this is and the more intense

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.360
and frequent this micturition wave will be,
until it reaches a level where the detrusor

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.450
contracts for a long time.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.100
This is the point when you really, really
need to go.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.050
But if you’re on a road trip and your husband
just refuses to stop and you don’t have

00:02:43.050 --> 00:03:08.669
some form of travel urinal, you can

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:15.480
still generally (until things become critical)
tell your external urethral sphincter it’s

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.360
really not a good time and consciously make
sure it stays closed.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.420
(Though this system will continue to remind
you on occasion that your bladder can only

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.980
expand so much.)

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.700
As alluded to, all the time you’re searching
for a suitable spot, your brain is working

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.390
with other muscles helping to prevent an accident.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.010
An internal automatically controlled sphincter
surrounds the neck of the bladder (where it

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.030
meets the urethra), and the voluntarily controlled
muscles of your pelvic floor form the external

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.040
sphincter that supports the muscles of the
urethra itself.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.530
Working together, these help you hold it in
if you’re so inclined.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.100
Also, if your renal system is working properly,
a sort of 1-way valve at each of the two connection

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.890
points of the ureters and the bladder makes
sure urine isn’t squeezed back up the ureters

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.170
into your kidneys (via the detrusor and ureter
muscles creating a 1-2 cm compression point,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.370
squeezing that section of your ureters shut
at appropriate times).

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:20.370
When you are finally ready to relieve yourself,
if your detrusor isn’t already bearing down,

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:35.160
you’ll typically increase the pressure in
your bladder via your abdominal muscles.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.170
This triggers an unsuppressed micturition
reflex, at which point your automatically

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.420
controlled internal sphincter is relaxed,
as is the voluntary external urethral sphincter

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.560
(now that the higher centers of your brain
aren’t telling it to stay squeezed shut),

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.970
and your detrusor muscles give a good, long
squeeze.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.820
The result is the majority of the contents
of your bladder being squeezed out, with typically

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.420
around 50 or so milliliters remaining.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.100
Ah, sweet relief.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.690
You can monitor your health by observing the
color of your pee.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.480
If it’s pale or transparent yellow, you’re
good-to-go, and if it’s dark yellow, you

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.770
just need to take a little water.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.820
If it’s honey-colored you’re a bit dehydrated,
and if it’s the color of maple syrup you

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.180
probably have a problem, which could include
severe dehydration and even liver disease.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.450
Pink pee could indicate anything from kidney
disease to prostate problems or a urinary

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.130
tract infection, although if you’ve eaten
beets or blueberries, it could just be that.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.860
Orange is also troubling, but could be anything
from food dye to a bile duct condition.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.790
Blue or green urine typically comes from food
dye or medication, but there is a rare genetic

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.560
condition that can cause this color.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.130
If your urine is completely clear, you’re
probably drinking a lot of water and in the

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.500
extreme case should maybe cut back because
it’s possible (though rare) to kill yourself

00:05:48.500 --> 00:06:33.160
via drinking too much water (with a variety
of ways this could kill you).
