00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:07.806
&gt;&gt; A member of the Science and
Humanities Scholars Program,

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:13.646
today Sophie Rose Zucker is
earning a Bachelor's Degree

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:18.016
in Chemistry with university
honors and a Bachelor's Degree

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:20.906
in Creative Writing
with college honors.

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:25.526
Sophie has been an active of
the Carnegie Mellon community,

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:30.936
serving on the Executive Board
of Alpha Chi Omega sorority,

00:00:31.796 --> 00:00:35.786
President of MORF,
CMU"s feminist club,

00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:39.346
and Editor-in-Chief
of the Oakland Review,

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:41.316
CMU's literary magazine.

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:46.736
Following graduation, Sophie
will work for Epic Systems

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:49.276
of Madison, Wisconsin,
a software company

00:00:49.276 --> 00:00:50.886
for healthcare organizations.

00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:52.336
Sophie.

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:58.516
[ Applause ]

00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:00.416
[ Laughs ]

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:03.106
&gt;&gt; Thank you for that wonderful
introduction, Dr. Suresh.

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:04.866
Thank you, everyone.

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:05.426
How do I look?

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:08.826
[ Laughs ]

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:09.746
All right.

00:01:09.746 --> 00:01:10.746
Let's begin.

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:13.926
My heart is in the work.

00:01:14.956 --> 00:01:21.476
Uh. Those words have followed us
throughout our college careers,

00:01:21.476 --> 00:01:22.116
haven't they?

00:01:22.986 --> 00:01:25.886
They were pressed into our
minds during orientation,

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:29.606
spoken with passion and rigor
by university officials,

00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:32.966
upperclassmen, and staff
as they promised us

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:35.696
that we too would put
our hearts in the work.

00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:38.276
We would be Andrew Carnegie.

00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:43.016
When I was a high school
junior, those words inspired me.

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:45.766
My favorite subject
in school was Latin,

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:48.516
and I thought I would
never drink in college.

00:01:50.546 --> 00:01:51.806
Oh, sorry it's raining, guys.

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:55.546
[laughs] I walked through
Carnegie Mellon's campus

00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:58.996
and I saw myself here in a
world of people passionate

00:01:58.996 --> 00:02:01.706
about their studies and
passionate about the future.

00:02:01.706 --> 00:02:08.036
When I was a freshman, "my heart
is in the work" challenged me.

00:02:08.206 --> 00:02:11.156
I think it challenged
all of us, right?

00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:14.111
[ Laughs ]

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:16.836
Challenged us to sign up for
the most student organizations

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:18.406
at the Activities Fair.

00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:20.146
I don't know about you,
but I think I'm still

00:02:20.146 --> 00:02:21.246
on the Tartans D-List.

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:26.076
Challenged us to take on classes
we knew we probably shouldn't be

00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:28.956
taking as freshmen, despite
our advisor's recommendations,

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:33.286
and challenged us to step
out of our comfort zones.

00:02:34.116 --> 00:02:38.086
Sometimes "my heart is in the
work" translated to "work hard,

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:41.946
play hard," and each of us
interpreted that in our own way.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:45.066
Maybe it was going to
my first college party

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:47.776
and seeing a guy breathe
fire in front of me.

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:52.386
Maybe it was my friend who
called me at 6:30 in the morning

00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:54.746
from a walk home
down Morewood just

00:02:54.746 --> 00:02:55.986
to tell someone her secrets.

00:02:57.096 --> 00:02:59.446
Or maybe it was my
roommate, who started research

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:02.086
with faculty her freshman
year and saw the path

00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:05.696
to her future laid out in
front of her, bright and clear.

00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:10.546
As we progressed through
college, though, "my heart is

00:03:10.546 --> 00:03:12.506
in the work" took
on a nasty meaning.

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:16.036
It became a curse, a
pejorative, a joke.

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:19.336
It became something we muttered

00:03:19.336 --> 00:03:22.576
at three AM while struggling
throughout problem sets

00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:23.916
or during long weekends

00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:26.276
in practice rooms
and acting studios.

00:03:27.486 --> 00:03:28.996
Were our hearts really
in the work

00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:32.556
as we planned another event
we knew nobody would attend?

00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:36.366
And were our hearts in the
work at midnight on Sundays

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:39.256
in Hunt Library trying
to finish lab reports,

00:03:39.746 --> 00:03:41.796
gorging on snack
food and Red Bull?

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:46.126
In the middle of
my sophomore year,

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:49.816
I sat in my advisor's office,
asking him for guidance

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:51.116
about what to do that summer.

00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:53.516
I didn't know where to go.

00:03:53.806 --> 00:03:57.116
I felt like I should start
doing research because everyone

00:03:57.116 --> 00:03:59.026
in the chemistry
department does research,

00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:02.046
and sophomore summer was
too late to start research

00:04:02.046 --> 00:04:03.586
and I wanted to take
more writing classes

00:04:03.586 --> 00:04:06.196
and I wouldn't have time for
research during the year.

00:04:06.196 --> 00:04:07.516
I just couldn't do it all.

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:10.956
I grew frantic, panicked,
and I was about to cry

00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:15.406
when he just calmly looked
at me and he said, "Sophie,

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:17.986
over the past year,
it has seemed

00:04:17.986 --> 00:04:20.466
that chemistry has
excited you less and less

00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:23.096
and other things have
excited you more."

00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:27.916
And just like that, a whole
world opened up for me.

00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:32.406
The thing was I loved
putting my heart into work.

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:34.416
I think we all did, right?

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:37.836
I loved hearing my friends
tell me about their research

00:04:37.836 --> 00:04:39.956
and I loved the moment
I understood what they

00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:40.606
were saying.

00:04:41.206 --> 00:04:43.066
I got the science.

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:43.926
Yay, science.

00:04:44.846 --> 00:04:47.846
But it meant something
special to me

00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:51.706
and it didn't mean
anything special to me.

00:04:52.006 --> 00:04:55.666
I had spent time
and energy and heart

00:04:55.666 --> 00:05:00.296
on a field I thought I could
settle into and settle for,

00:05:01.336 --> 00:05:05.776
but when it came down to it, I
realized it was stupid to settle

00:05:06.316 --> 00:05:07.456
when other people weren't.

00:05:07.866 --> 00:05:12.596
I realized the things that have
brought me the most satisfaction

00:05:12.596 --> 00:05:15.016
during my time here were
outside the classroom

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:18.626
of my primary major, and
I don't think I'm online.

00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:21.286
It's not that my heart
wasn't in the work.

00:05:21.536 --> 00:05:23.516
It was just in other work.

00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:27.576
It was in other classes in
another academic department

00:05:27.576 --> 00:05:29.796
that wasn't on the path
I imagined for myself

00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:33.116
but that made me feel like
I was doing something new,

00:05:33.306 --> 00:05:37.586
something meaningful, but
two majors weren't enough.

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:40.486
Is enough ever enough
for CMU kids?

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:44.936
[laughs] I threw myself
into planning recruitment

00:05:44.936 --> 00:05:48.406
with my sorority, Alpha Chi
Omega, and I spent hours

00:05:48.406 --> 00:05:50.776
with the feminist club,
watching with glee

00:05:50.776 --> 00:05:54.156
as I saw an entire lecture hall
filled with students taking time

00:05:54.156 --> 00:05:55.566
to hear about women's bodies.

00:05:56.646 --> 00:05:58.276
It was more than
just other work.

00:05:58.476 --> 00:06:03.016
I found love in late-night
meetings with executive boards,

00:06:03.576 --> 00:06:06.176
performing weird skits with
the chemistry department,

00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:07.356
and building a booth.

00:06:08.506 --> 00:06:11.936
Extracurriculars became
another academic program,

00:06:12.126 --> 00:06:15.556
another degree, another
world outside problem sets --

00:06:15.726 --> 00:06:17.056
a world of group meet texts,

00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:19.226
Doodle polls, and
Google Calendar.

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:21.996
Who among us doesn't
know this world?

00:06:23.676 --> 00:06:27.976
Whether we were RAs, TAs,
research team members,

00:06:28.206 --> 00:06:30.326
team captains, or
chapter presidents,

00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:34.946
no one is leaving this campus
without having been a part

00:06:34.946 --> 00:06:39.396
of something outside the
work we set out to do.

00:06:39.626 --> 00:06:42.826
Why did these activities
seem to matter just as much,

00:06:43.176 --> 00:06:45.726
if not more, than
another assignment to turn

00:06:45.726 --> 00:06:47.316
in by the midnight deadline?

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:49.806
Somewhere along the line,

00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:52.996
the people around us
became friends we connected

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:57.566
with on a different level
than just getting things done.

00:06:57.776 --> 00:07:00.366
You've probably heard that
we're among the smartest,

00:07:00.726 --> 00:07:03.526
best educated, most
privileged people in the world.

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:05.316
Well, duh.

00:07:05.486 --> 00:07:11.066
Despite the trials
and difficulties each

00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:15.236
of us have faced both inside
and outside of this tiny,

00:07:15.306 --> 00:07:19.106
tiny campus, we are all
incredibly lucky to be,

00:07:19.496 --> 00:07:21.826
above all else, super smart.

00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:25.346
Come on, pat yourself
on the back, smartasses.

00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:29.806
You know what that
means, don't you?

00:07:30.956 --> 00:07:32.836
We can't waste our brains.

00:07:34.146 --> 00:07:39.276
We have an obligation to
do things that matter.

00:07:39.436 --> 00:07:43.326
Carnegie Mellon has not been
an amazing experience just

00:07:43.516 --> 00:07:44.696
because of our classes.

00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:49.316
As we head out to careers,
to graduate programs,

00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:52.456
to our parents' couches,
we must realize

00:07:52.956 --> 00:07:55.376
that sometimes what
made us happiest

00:07:55.376 --> 00:07:57.516
at CMU wasn't the work itself.

00:07:58.386 --> 00:08:01.026
It was the heart put
into things and the care.

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:05.156
It was the TAs who guided us
through concepts of mathematics

00:08:05.156 --> 00:08:08.276
and the friends who
helped us solve problems

00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:12.016
that would never end, the
advisors and professors

00:08:12.236 --> 00:08:14.976
who guided us towards paths
with meaning and purpose,

00:08:14.976 --> 00:08:21.416
and the times we became
mentors, leaders, and guides.

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:24.976
"My heart is in the
work" doesn't tell us

00:08:25.036 --> 00:08:27.226
to mindlessly dedicate
our hearts

00:08:27.226 --> 00:08:29.346
to working for the sake of work.

00:08:30.206 --> 00:08:33.946
It's a promise to
bring heart into work,

00:08:34.976 --> 00:08:37.346
to do the things
we do with heart,

00:08:37.806 --> 00:08:40.656
with passion, and with care.

00:08:41.246 --> 00:08:44.666
Now, I'm not saying each of
us should dedicate our lives

00:08:44.756 --> 00:08:48.586
to solving the world's biggest
problems, although, like,

00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:50.236
at least one of us should deal

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:51.786
with the sustainable
energy crisis.

00:08:52.446 --> 00:08:54.966
Chemical engineers, maybe
material science, one of you.

00:08:54.966 --> 00:08:59.506
[laughs] Can one of
you take care of that?

00:08:59.506 --> 00:08:59.896
[laughs] Thank you.

00:09:01.246 --> 00:09:06.286
But honestly, most of us are
going to spend the next five,

00:09:06.486 --> 00:09:08.676
maybe ten years doing stuff

00:09:08.776 --> 00:09:12.886
that isn't our dream
job, and that's okay.

00:09:13.536 --> 00:09:14.426
It's normal.

00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:18.116
The things I found myself
able to put the most passion

00:09:18.116 --> 00:09:21.246
into during my time here
were outside the classroom.

00:09:21.716 --> 00:09:23.336
Maybe work will be
like that too.

00:09:24.316 --> 00:09:27.626
Maybe some of us will struggle
to find meaning in the nine

00:09:27.626 --> 00:09:30.986
to five, in tax forms
and hour-long commutes,

00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:39.516
but what I ask of all of us
and what I hope for myself is

00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:42.006
that we put our hearts
into a work.

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.186
We know how to work hard.

00:09:44.756 --> 00:09:48.526
We've spent how many
years practicing it?

00:09:48.786 --> 00:09:52.286
Our more challenging work will
be to work with our hearts,

00:09:53.506 --> 00:09:58.936
to bring not only skill, talent,
and intelligence, but kindness,

00:09:59.526 --> 00:10:03.426
thought, and love into
what we do every day --

00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:07.656
into our workplaces,
communities, and families --

00:10:08.476 --> 00:10:12.496
to treat the people outside
the Carnegie Mellon bubble

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:15.606
with the same respect
and wide-eyed wonder

00:10:15.916 --> 00:10:19.406
as we treated each
other, to view the world

00:10:19.546 --> 00:10:24.686
as optimistically
as we did here.

00:10:24.896 --> 00:10:27.726
While Andrew Carnegie
is, was businessman,

00:10:28.176 --> 00:10:30.576
he's not remembered
for his businesses.

00:10:31.306 --> 00:10:33.006
He's remembered for
his philanthropy.

00:10:33.816 --> 00:10:38.096
Carnegie Hall, Carnegie
museums, the Carnegie libraries,

00:10:38.586 --> 00:10:40.126
Carnegie Mellon University --

00:10:40.126 --> 00:10:44.956
Andrew Carnegie spent his
entire life putting his heart

00:10:44.956 --> 00:10:49.786
into work, but his great sorrow
was to wait until the end

00:10:49.786 --> 00:10:54.926
of his career to put heart into
the arts, education, service,

00:10:55.586 --> 00:11:00.446
the good of the common man,
the things he cared about.

00:11:00.656 --> 00:11:04.616
Why shouldn't we, in the
spirit of innovation,

00:11:04.996 --> 00:11:06.916
improve upon his legacy?

00:11:07.826 --> 00:11:13.046
As we leave, class of 2016,
let's make "my heart is

00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:17.846
in the work" a promise to
bring our hearts into our work.

00:11:18.566 --> 00:11:19.596
Thank you.
