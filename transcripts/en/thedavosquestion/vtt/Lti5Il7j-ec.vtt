00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.299
&gt;&gt; Yes, I hope India can become a superpower.
Or I would add to it, I would say India is

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:13.200
going to to become a
superpower with mostly soft power.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.840
I think India's strength lies in the soft
power that we have.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.029
And whether that's [INAUDIBLE] I don't think
India, like the other

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.570
superpowers of the past, of the past will
have that kind of hard power

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.350
because the Indian culture talks about nonviolence.
What we need to do is get a infrastructure

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.020
in place, we need to get a
more skilled workforce in place and I feel

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.359
most important is build up
the partnerships today between the civil society,

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.659
between the corporate
sector, and the government and the bureaucracy.

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.820
If we are able to do that, then I think we
are very much on our way.
