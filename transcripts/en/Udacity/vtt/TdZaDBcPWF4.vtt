We have seen in our pipelining lesson that each control hazard will waste many

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.240
cycles in a pipeline processor. Branches and jumps are relatively common, so

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.990
performance will not be very good unless we do something about that.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.390
But what is it that we can do? That, you will discover in this lesson.
