00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.890
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Good morning and welcome
to this edition of Authors at Google.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.760
I'm Dan Russell, I'm from the search quality
group and it's my distinct pleasure to introduce

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.130
my friend, Chip Conley, today who's gonna
be talking about something I think we all

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.309
actually need to know a little bit more about.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.930
Now I could tell you a lot about Chip but
I won't because you're at Google and so you

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.330
can, presumably, can find things like he's
a rebel entrepreneur, he's done fantastic

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.739
work rehabbing and starting up hotels all
around the place, he's won fantastic awards,

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.280
he's a really interesting guy.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.999
But you can look that up.

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:43.100
What I wanna do it tell you a little bit about
the topic of today's talk.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.149
He's a practiced author having written multiple
books and you might recognize some of his

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.149
slacker co-authors.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.180
[pause]

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.389
So he's done this before and we started talking
a while ago about what would it mean to write

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.819
a book about equations about emotions.

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:04.190
And we talked about that for a while and when
he first said that I thought of an equation

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.369
like this: this is Schrödinger's Wave Equation
and I thought, "It's gonna describe the waves

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.930
of emotion.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.200
It's gonna be a quantum mechanical view of
the way people act and behave."

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.429
He said, "No, no, no, no, no [chuckles] That's
not the right approach."

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.970
So he said, "What about a beautiful equation;
we want simple, elegant simplicity."

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.070
And I thought of this equation which many
of you will recognize which is all those things

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.939
but it's not for people, that's really for
mathematicians.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:34.939
[laughter]

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:35.939
Right?

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:36.939
We have a distinct sub-species here.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.009
&gt;&gt;female #1: Former mathematicians.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.100
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible] mathematicians.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.159
&gt;&gt;Dan Russell: We're encompassing we take
all kinds of people here.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.409
And so I started thinking, "Well, maybe we
can describe emotions as systems of equations

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.409
like this."

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.630
"No, no, no, Dan."

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.149
And so the more, we talked the more I started
to realize that what Chip was about is trying

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.259
to describe these sort of neat, conceptual
nuggets of information that describe terms

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.560
about emotions a little bit like Ohm's law.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.929
The simplest, physical law described as an
equation which gets represented often as this

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.099
sort of triangular model that allows you to
very quickly see the relationship between

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.390
the different terms.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.260
When Chip and I were talking about emotional
equations, I realized that's what he means

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.930
by equation; it's a model of the relationship
between these conceptual categories.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.970
By this book, he's expressing this, I think,
very elegant and beautiful notion that we

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.810
can have this embedded in our belief system
and understand ourselves far better than you

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.290
would normally have without this.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:46.930
So Chip is my Burning Man buddy, he's a Maslowtopian,
he's an author, he's my friend.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.060
I'm very proud to introduce Chip Conley.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.260
[applause]

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:06.500
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: It is very strange to come
to Google and lecture you on math. [laughs]

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.790
[laughter]

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.939
But let me say thank you, Dan.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:15.130
I loved the pyramid, I left the Ohm's law
in the form of the pyramid because for those

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.250
of you who know a little bit about my last
book I am a Maslowtopian.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.950
I'm a big believer in Maslow's hierarchy of
needs and that led to me writing the book

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.120
Peak: How Great Companies Get their Mojo from
Maslow.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.730
So I'm gonna start today with a little video
and it's gonna, it's a little, maybe a little

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.319
hard to actually see but it's gonna give you
a frame of reference for my key theme of the

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.420
day and so let's see if we can make this work
and if it actually is visible up there.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.420
Here we go.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.420
[video]

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.420
&gt;&gt; ticket agent: Hello there, checking any
bags?

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.510
&gt;&gt;passenger: Yeah just two.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.510
&gt;&gt;ticket agent: Okay.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.660
The second bag will be $100.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.660
&gt;&gt;passenger: Uh –

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.660
[talking in background]

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.660
[pause]

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.660
okay, just one bag then.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.660
&gt;&gt;ticket agent: Here's your boarding pass
sir.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.660
Gate 83.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.660
Enjoy your flight.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.660
[music in background]

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.660
[sound of plane taking off]

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.660
[music in background]

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.660
[man singing]

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.660
I wanted love, I needed love
Most of all, most of all.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.660
Someone said true love was dead
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall for you.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.660
Oh what can I do?

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.660
Yeah

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.660
Take my badge but my heart remains
Loving you, baby child

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.660
Tighten up on your reigns
You're runnin' wild, runnin' wild

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.660
It's true

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.660
[music in background]
[telephone sounds in background]

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.660
Sick for days, so many ways
I'm achin' now, I'm achin' now

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.660
It's times like these, I need relief
Please show me how, oh show me how

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.660
To get right

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.660
[music in background]

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.660
[sound of horn honking]

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.660
[music in background]
[crickets chirp; owls hoot]

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660
Living just to keep going
Goin' just to be sane

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:38.220
All the while I know
It's such a shame

00:04:38.220 --> 00:05:11.510
I don't need to get steady
I know just how I feel

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:42.960
I'm telling you to be ready
My dear

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:54.750
[music in background]

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:10.470
[sound of door closing]

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:22.270
[music in background]

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:37.990
[sound of door closing]

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:45.850
[music fades]

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.780
[laughter]

00:06:49.780 --> 00:07:01.560
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: I wish the sound and the visuals
were a little bit better but I did bring a

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.680
friend here, who's the star of our show.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.680
[laughter]

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.680
So --

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.590
[laughter]

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.770
some of you don't know you have emotional
baggage.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.880
And most of you don't know that within your
emotional baggage --

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.770
[sound of suitcase being opened]

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.690
you have emotional baggage.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.800
[laughter]

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.860
There's in fact bags within the bags.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.710
What I'm gonna talk about today is --

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.870
[sound of suitcase being set down]

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:38.300
is the idea that math can be used in the form
of relationships, understanding the relationships

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.130
of your emotions.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.920
Now that may be a blast from this idea to
those of you who are the Ph.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.910
Ds in math in the room, and when I first brought
it up to Dan, Dan did scratch his head a little

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.510
bit and sort of was trying to understand what
I meant.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.910
And I'm gonna tell you my story today because
it's the story of, --it's a personal story--,

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:06.940
of how I needed a lighthouse when I was in
a very difficult place as a CEO of a company

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:12.310
and felt like I was supposed to have my life
together, but my life was falling apart.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:21.060
And somehow understanding the idea of an emotion
as an equation became a bit of a mantra for

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.370
me.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:28.170
The word Mantra, Meng could teach you this
because he's good at this stuff; mantra technically

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.720
means 'mind instrument'.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.459
And so what I needed was something to be the
mind instrument for me when I was going through

00:08:35.459 --> 00:08:37.709
a lot of difficult emotions.

00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:38.709
So --

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:40.509
[pause]

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:43.680
I've been a hotelier for 24 years, 25 years.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.540
24 years of it I was the CEO company Joie
de Vivre.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.250
Many of you have probably stayed at the Hotel
Avante, one of our hotels in Mountain View;

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.670
we're the second largest boutique hotelier
in the world now, Joie de Vivre is.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.050
We're based in San Francisco.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:05.699
People show up at our hotel front desks with
their baggage, some of it's not physical [laughs]

00:09:05.699 --> 00:09:10.480
some of it's the emotional baggage type [chuckles]
and what I'm hoping today is that in the course

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.370
of the time together that I'm gonna help you
understand what some of the baggage that you

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:20.370
may have goin' on in your own life and how
you make sense of the relationship of the

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.310
ingredients in essence that create anxiety
or happiness or despair.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.860
But first let me give you a little background.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.560
So as I mentioned before and as Dan mentioned,
I'm a big fan of Abe Maslow.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.279
I took one, a grand total of one psychology
class as Stanford.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:41.110
I went to Stanford undergrad, I went to Stanford
Business School, I took a class with Zimbardo,

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.860
Phil Zimbardo, Phillip Zimbardo.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.730
So he was my psychology professor and the
one thing I remember from psychology one,

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:52.360
in college was Abe Maslow because he was the
guy who talked about best practices in human

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.610
behavior as opposed to worst practices.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:59.819
He's also the one who came up a great quote,
"If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything

00:09:59.819 --> 00:10:01.589
starts to look like a nail."

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:04.589
And he said that to the psychology profession,
he said, "Why is it that we think that all

00:10:04.589 --> 00:10:05.589
people are broken?

00:10:05.589 --> 00:10:08.250
Why don't we study the flourishing people?

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.410
And by studying the people who are flourishing
or self actualizing in life maybe we can learn

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.699
something that we can apply to everybody else."

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:17.860
And that's why he created the hierarchy of
needs.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:24.310
And 10 years ago, in the wake of the dot com
buzz to 9/11 and you name it, everything that

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:25.569
could go wrong did go wrong.

00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:28.649
And here in the Bay Area for those of you
who were living here in the Bay Area 10 years

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:34.190
ago, we went through a bit of a minor depression,
economic depression based upon what happened

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.660
in the dot com bust.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.540
Well, at the point we were the largest hotelier
in the Bay Area, we had no hotels outside

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.839
the Bay Area so we were in a lot of trouble.

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:46.439
We applied Maslow's hierarchy of needs to
our company and we tried to create a self-actualized

00:10:46.439 --> 00:10:47.950
company and it worked.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:53.720
We tripled in size, we had no layoffs, we
got the award for the highest customer satisfaction

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.459
award in the hospitality industry and after
Google, we came in second place for the best

00:10:58.459 --> 00:10:59.459
place to work [chuckles]

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:00.459
[laughter]

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:03.040
in the San Francisco Bay Area, so thank you
Google.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.279
[laughter]

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:05.529
[pause]

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:10.339
But that was the last downturn and this is
a tale of two downturns, two Jewish shrinks,

00:11:10.339 --> 00:11:12.769
and two goys named Chip.

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:18.769
And the last downturn, I felt a bit like a
gladiator and my company Joie de Vivre lived

00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:24.410
up to its name, Joy of Life, and we used Maslow
to get ourselves through it.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.220
This downturn, I wasn't feeling so much that
way, I actually was feeling quite the opposite.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:34.829
I felt more like a prisoner than a gladiator.

00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:40.209
And so I started reading this book by Viktor
Frankl called Man's Search for Meaning.

00:11:40.209 --> 00:11:42.069
How many of you are familiar with the book?

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:44.480
So a handful of you folks.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.180
So Man's Search for Meaning was written by
Viktor Frankl in the 1940's.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:55.699
He was a Jewish psychologist in Vienna in
the 1930's and his basic premise as a psychologist

00:11:55.699 --> 00:12:03.759
was that the fuel of life is meaning; that's
what creates the sense of why we show up for

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:05.399
our lives each day.

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:11.769
And then, ironically, and sort of as if God
as a weird sense of humor, he was put in a

00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:18.170
concentration camp to see if his theory of
meaning being the fuel of life actually made

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.170
sense.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.190
He ended up writing about it and I started
reading this book in early 2008.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:29.160
Peak, my book came out in September of 2007
and I was goin' around the country and giving

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:35.540
about 80 speeches a year on self-actualization
in the context of work, including here at

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.910
Google.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.129
But in early 2008 I was very clear that my
life wasn't, I was like the guy going out

00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:43.410
and talking about self actualization but not
feeling it --

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.410
[laughter]

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.490
which was a really awkward, it's like the
preacher going out and giving his sermon and

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.220
then going out and doin' something that we
won't talk about here, you know what those

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.660
preachers do.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.660
[laughter]

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:58.380
And I ended up starting to read this book
because I felt like I was a bit of a prisoner

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.509
to my identity and to what was the upcoming
downturn that I could sort of see.

00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:06.649
'Cause the hotel industry basically can see
downturns.

00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:10.050
You see downturns faster than we do because
of the analytics associated with what goes

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.050
on with Google.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.209
We see it pretty quickly though, too, because
one of the first things people cut back on

00:13:14.209 --> 00:13:15.890
in terms of spending is travel.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:21.519
But there was a quote in Man's Search for
Meaning that really spoke to me on a deep

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:26.920
level and it was this one: "Between stimulus
and response there is a space.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:34.199
In that space is our power to choose our response
and in our response lies our growth and our

00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:35.199
freedom."

00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:40.990
So for me, I mean like who's the whining CEO,
Chip Conley, up there like being upset about

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.990
his life.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.620
Well, I wasn't whining about it.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.410
In fact, I had this growing divide between
my public image and my private reality and

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:52.139
when that happens that's actually quite often
when depression and a few other things can

00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:53.139
kick in.

00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:58.660
Well, I had other friends in my life who had
a growing divide between their public image

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.499
and their private reality too.

00:14:01.499 --> 00:14:09.339
Over the course of 2008 to 2010, I had five
friends commit suicide, take their lives,

00:14:09.339 --> 00:14:17.199
and one of them who my friend Greg Jones who's
here today knows well was my friend, Chip,

00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:18.199
and Greg's friend, Chip.

00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:24.160
This is not me, this is guy named Chip Hankins
and my talks and my book are really dedicated

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.160
to him.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.149
He was very close friend with both Greg and
me.

00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:31.350
And he was one of those guys who sort of,
you know people in your life who are sort

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:36.129
of the light of the party, they're the light
of your life and they're deep thinkers; Chip

00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:39.720
was all of those things, in some ways he was
a mirror for how I aspired to be in my own

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.720
life.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.200
And we shared the same name, we both actually
owned bars and we went for long periods of

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.200
time, we didn't drink.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.759
I mean there was a lot of similarities between
us.

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:55.280
On April 30, 2008, I got a call from his boss,
the president of his insurance company, because

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:01.149
for 12 years Chip was our insurance broker
for Joie de Vivre, and I got a call and found

00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:05.199
out that Chip had actually taken his life.

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:14.699
And so going to the funeral, the memorial
service at Greg's ranch actually and hearing

00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:20.689
about a friend and talking about your friend
who'd taken their life, it's hard, it's very

00:15:20.689 --> 00:15:24.130
hard and when they have the same name you
have, it's a little bit harder.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:29.309
And when you're sort of in the throes of your
own depression, the early stages for me, it

00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:33.170
made it a lot to handle.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.949
So I felt after that experience, I really
needed to make sense of this Man's Search

00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:39.949
for Meaning a little bit more.

00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:44.740
But then I had my own experience, I had two
and a half months after the memorial service

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:49.040
for Chip, I was in St. Louis again which is
where I was when I got the news about Chip.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.519
I was giving a speech about self actualization
and at the end of my speech I went flat line.

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:58.420
I was on stage giving a speech, fortunately
I sat down because I had a broken ankle at

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:05.399
the time, sat down and the second person I
was signing a book for the person said to

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:06.800
me, "You look awfully white."

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:15.649
And I just went unconscious and within about
five minutes the paramedics were there and

00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:19.110
they put heart monitors on me and that's when
I went flat line.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:23.360
So between that and a bunch of other things
happening in my life, a long term relationship

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.589
ending, my son going to San Quentin wrongfully,
he ended up getting out after being eight

00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:29.589
months in San Quentin.

00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:34.040
A federal judge let him out but [chuckles]
having your son go to San Quentin for eight

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.040
months is not a fun thing.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.800
And then we were running out of money, as
a company, and I was running out of money,

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800
personally.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:47.759
So I took Man's Search for Meaning and I said,
"You know, what I want this, I wanna understand

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:54.779
why I wanna continue to stand and be on this
earth and I don't wanna go the path that Chip

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:58.190
and others felt like they had to take."

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:05.079
So I turned this famous book on meaning into
an equation and I am not a math major, I am

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:11.209
so far from a math [chuckles] major, but what
I needed was something to help to explain

00:17:11.209 --> 00:17:16.390
the relationship between the components that
were creating some depression and despair

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.360
in my life.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.330
So this was the equation: Despair equals suffering
minus meaning.

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.710
It's a little bit like sacred algebra.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.080
[chuckles]

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.490
Suffering was the constant, if you're going
through a really rough time in your life suffering

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:36.840
is a constant; if you're a Buddhist its first
noble truth of Buddhism that suffering, Dukkha,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.740
is ever present.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.820
Having Meng in the front row is really hard,
it's very distracting right now.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.420
[laughs]

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.030
[laughter]

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.640
[pause]

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.270
Between Meng and between the Ph.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:55.080
D. math people in the room, it's like okay
I am really setting myself up for failure

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.080
today.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.080
[laughter]

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:03.400
No, but suffering is ever present when you're
going through a really rough time and the

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.510
funny thing about it, the sad thing about
it is we tend to actually focus on it and

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.620
when you're focusing on it you're not making
it any better.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.630
What this helped me to see is that suffering
is the constant and meaning's the variable

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.640
and if you put your attention on the meaning
and increase the meaning, the despair goes

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.120
down.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.560
And that was my own little mantra that I was
using in the summer of 2008 after my flat

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.320
line experience when I was goin' through a
bunch of other crap.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.830
And it was working for me because what it
helped me to get back to is, like, what's

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.940
the lesson, with all this stuff that's goin'
on, what's the lesson?

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:44.790
I also found a study, a really interesting
study, of women who grew up during the Civil

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.510
War, I'm sorry, during the Depression.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.150
Women who grew up in the 1930s.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.150
And what it showed was that women who actually
grew up in the 1930s in their formative years

00:18:55.150 --> 00:19:00.221
later in life when they became a widow because
quite often they outlive their husband, they

00:19:00.221 --> 00:19:07.520
actually had built, during the 1930s in their
teens and their 20s, resilience, independence,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.520
courage.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.450
They were better able to handle being a widow
than the women who didn't grow up during the

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.450
Depression.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:19.660
Major study by Elker and Lighter that was
done like 10, 20 years ago.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.590
So I said, "Okay maybe I'm actually in emotional
boot camp right now.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.370
And maybe during emotional boot camp, I'm
actually building some emotional muscles that

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.480
I have but I hadn't been working out in a
while."

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.450
And so that's what I started to think about.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:39.090
And then in November of 2008, when the world
was starting to fall apart in a faster pace,

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.560
it was two months after Lehman Brothers went
bankrupt.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.990
And in the hotel business, people in our company
could say, "My God, we're about to go into

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:51.510
our second once-in-a-lifetime downturn in
the same decade."

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.910
I was supposed to give a speech to the top
18, I'm sorry the top 80 executives in my

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:59.450
company at the Dream Inn in Santa Cruz which
is, if you haven't been there lately, it's

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.760
a hotel we renovated a couple years ago.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.590
It's sort of cool.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.300
And we were all sitting looking at the view
and everybody was looking for the cheerleading

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.020
speech from Chip the CEO.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.730
And instead of giving the cheerleading speech,
I threw it away because what I saw in the

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.580
room was 80 people who were full of suffering.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.860
And so I just said, on an easel, I just wrote
up my equation and I said, "I wanna just share

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.710
for the next hour my equation with you because
I actually think the worse thing I could do

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.760
right now is to be up here cheerleading.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.830
And I, instead, think we need to do what Abe
Maslow talked about is we need to have a good

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.930
exercise in psycho hygiene.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:36.930
[chuckles]

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:42.340
Psycho hygiene basically, means in Maslow
term, it means that when you're going through

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.370
a really difficult time, you learn how to
shower together.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:51.630
[chuckles] Because frankly what happens in
an organization during difficult times is

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:56.580
there's a lot of stress, it becomes a bit
of a sweat box, and actually people sort of

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.960
go at each other instead of actually sort
of figuring out how to actually make people

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.700
feel a little bit better.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:06.480
So I felt like what we needed to do is actually
be authentic and vulnerable and allow people

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.410
to talk about their fears about being a general
manager of a hotel that has just two years

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:15.320
ago got through the last downturn and now
we're going into another one.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:21.060
So an hour later after the talk and people
conversing and people telling their stories

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:26.040
someone came up to me and gave me a whisper
and said, "Do you have an equation for jealousy?"

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040
[laughs]

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.040
[laughter]

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.540
And someone else came up and said, "Do you
have one for anxiety?"

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.560
And then the smartest one in the room came
up and said, "Do you have one for happiness?"

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.370
So I said, "This is interesting."

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.530
I created this equation for myself and then
I shared it with my senior executives and

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:51.060
it seemed to actually resonate so I said,
"I wanna learn more about emotions."

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:56.160
This is Isaac Newton, really smart dude [laughs]
I mean come on now you know that he actually

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:02.450
helped to invent calculus, I don't know if
you can invent calculus, but he was able to

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:07.170
sort of help us understand calculus; gravity,
he didn't invent it but he helped us explain

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.270
it; the telescope.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:13.140
But you probably didn't know that Isaac Newton
also created the color wheel and helped us

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:19.150
to understand that if you combine red plus
blue you get purple.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.310
So I didn't know that Isaac Newton did that.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:26.370
Well as I started to look at the color wheel
I started to see well this idea of despair

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:30.510
equals suffering minus meaning is sort of,
it's like an emotion wheel.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.570
And I did my deep dive, I did sort of my Ph.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:38.820
D. in psychology and I spent the next year
and a half to two years learning and reading

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.270
about 150 books and 300 studies in psychology.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:46.760
And I learned about this guy Dr. Robert Plutchik
who had created in the 1980's something called

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.760
the emotion wheel.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.270
You can't really see it very well up here
but if you add joy plus anticipation it equals

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.270
optimism.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:57.710
And he created this emotion wheel and the
reason that it never got a lot of play within

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:03.820
the psychology academic community, is because
back in the 1980s, if you were doing backwater

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:09.010
academic studies in psychology you were focusing
on emotions because emotions was not a very

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:14.850
well respected piece of the psychology world;
today it is, but back then it wasn't.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.140
So it never really got very far.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:24.160
But I said to myself, "Wow, I guess there's
some history of the psychology academic world

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.910
looking at the idea of equations for emotions.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:32.100
In fact, I started to learn a little bit more
about the happiness equation that Martin Seligman,

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:37.290
Marty Seligman, famous positive psychologist
had created where he said, "Happiness is 50

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:44.850
percent your biological set point, 10 percent
your circumstances, and 40 percent your intention."

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:49.770
So I decided to do a little bit more research
and I decided to go out and study happiness.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.500
Now I could have gone to Disneyland [chuckles]

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.500
[laughter]

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.210
the happiest place on earth which is where
I grew up, I grew up like within five minutes

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.210
of Disneyland --

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.100
[pause]

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.560
instead I went to Bhutan.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.580
Why?

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.011
Anybody know why Bhutan and happiness?

00:24:03.011 --> 00:24:04.011
Yes.

00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:05.011
&gt;&gt;male #2: Gross national happiness index.

00:24:05.011 --> 00:24:07.480
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah, the gross national happiness
index.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:15.590
So 40 years ago, the 17 year old King of Bhutan
was in India and someone said to him, "What's

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:21.360
the GDP or actually the GNP because GDP hadn't
been created yet, what's the GNP for Bhutan?"

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:27.380
And the 17 year old king looked at the Indian
journalist and said, "Why do we care about

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.700
GNP, why don't we care about gross national
happiness?"

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:36.440
Now, at the time, it didn't take a lot of
note, people didn't take much note of it but

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.890
40 years later there are now 50 countries
in the world that are studying their gross

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.280
national happiness in some form with some
name.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:50.050
Bhutan was the first one and because it's
sort of a really cool place, that's Bhutan,

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:51.920
that's Tiger's Nest in Bhutan.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.250
I said, "I'm gonna go to Bhutan and I'm gonna
spend a week studying the gross national happiness

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:00.060
index there, get to know the Prime Minister,
get to know the people in the U.N. who are

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:05.680
there in Bhutan studying happiness and I'll
come back and then I'll go talk to a bunch

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.470
of other people on the happiness circuit."

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:08.470
[laughs]

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:09.470
[laughter]

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:15.330
So I did and I came back with this equation
and I was fortunate enough that a guy named

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:20.870
Chris Anderson, not Chris Anderson, the Wired
Chris Anderson, but Chris Anderson, the TED

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:26.411
Chris Anderson found out about my equation
and asked me to give a finale TED talk two

00:25:26.411 --> 00:25:31.520
years ago at the TED conference and introduced
my happiness equation.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:37.720
So this is a little bit of a mind tease, happiness
equals wanting what you have divided by having

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.720
what you want.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:44.230
It comes back to a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel
in 1954 said, "Happiness is not about having

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.970
what you want it's about wanting what you
have."

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:54.970
And it's learning to actually get to the practicing
of gratitude.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:26:00.070
The psychology profession and those who actually
study happiness basically they all say, "The

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:04.900
fastest way to create happiness in the moment
when you're not feeling happy is to figure

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.440
out how to get to gratitude as quickly as
possible.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.130
And it's not just the process of actually
getting to gratitude, it's also the practice

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.570
of expressing the gratitude.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:18.720
Because actually just experiencing the gratitude
without expressing it is like wrapping a Christmas

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.540
present and not giving it.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.540
[laughs]

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.540
[laughter]

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.980
So the idea of practicing gratitude is what
wanting what you have means.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.850
So when you want what you have, you have a
tendency to practice gratitude, to feel and

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.660
appreciate what you have.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:39.980
We, in the United States, get very wrapped
up in the denominator of this equation, the

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:46.150
pursuit of gratification; having what we want;
the act of going out and having what we want.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:50.770
Let me tell you, I am a Type A person, I was
a CEO for 24 years, I went to Stanford, I

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.530
went to Stanford Business School, I am a pursuer
by nature.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:58.790
So I'm not here to say that we should not
pursue happiness, it's actually in the Declaration

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.910
of Independence of our country.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:07.850
But if you look at the dictionary definition
of pursuit in some dictionaries, the definition

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:11.350
of pursuit is to chase with hostility.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:12.350
[laughs]

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.350
[laughter]

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.000
Do we chase happiness with hostility --

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
[laughter]

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
in the United States?

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.480
I think on occasion we do.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.480
[laughter]

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:27.480
So in some ways, happiness is about how do
you practice gratitude and how to you be careful

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.200
about the pursuing of gratification?

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.720
For me, it's not about actually being a couch
potato and just writing in my gratitude journal

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.530
every day, I wouldn't be able to do that very
well.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:43.990
But it is when I'm in that state of not feeling
very happy about something I can ask myself

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.670
this equation and the question, "How do I
get to gratitude right now?

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.240
How do I practice some gratitude?

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.440
And am I spending too much time in the denominator
in pursuing gratification?"

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.690
The book, this book Emotional Equations which
Books, Inc. is here so they've got, they've

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:05.020
got discount books, it's lovely that you,
Google, I think, subsidizes them right?

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.440
Well this book actually the first week it
was out it went on to the New York Times Best

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.640
Sellers List at number seven.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.500
Of course I was, my immediate reaction was
I want number four next week.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.590
[laughs] Because I was pursuing gratification
–

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.110
[pause]

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.530
and I saw it immediately and when I could
actually laugh at myself and say, "Damn, I

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:26.460
wrote a book about emotional equations and
actually did really well and my first reaction

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.150
when it did really well was, "I wanna be number
four."

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.150
[pause]

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:34.120
So that's how our mind works and it's been
working that way for a long time.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.610
We know who this guy is.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.740
What you didn't know about Socrates is he
was the first guy to ever go on a treadmill

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.350
and he was the first guy to buy Nikes.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:42.350
[chuckles]

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.350
[laughter]

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:51.570
But Socrates once said, "He who is not contented
with what he has would not be contented with

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.640
what he would like to have."

00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:00.160
So on a treadmill because most of you have
probably heard of the hedonic treadmill and

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:04.170
it's a treadmill that we all jump on and it's
the treadmill of gratification.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:08.120
How do we go out and pursue our gratification,
how do we go out and get what we want, how

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.510
do we go out and if we've gotten this how
do we go out and get that?

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.700
And generally speaking for those of us who
are leaders we want people working for us

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.000
who have that mentality.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.150
So I'm not saying we shouldn't actually have
the pursuit, what I am saying is when you're

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:25.580
not feeling happy, just know that this is
what's going on and it's been goin' on for

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.330
centuries, going back to Socrates' time.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:34.180
So after getting despair and happiness [chuckles]
I'd gotten the two equations at the extremes

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:40.900
I started asking myself, "What's the number
one emotion that seems to be pervading organizational

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.270
culture in the United States in this recession?"

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.120
This is 2009 at this point.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.120
[pause]

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:52.280
And this is it, it was anxiety, the number
one emotion in most organizations in the world,

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.680
especially in a recession.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:00.980
There are two ingredients that represent,
according to anxiety researchers, 95 to 96

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:06.310
percent of the anxiety that we tend to feel:
it's what you don't know and what you can't

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.720
control; those are the two variables.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.720
And so it's anxiety equals uncertainty times
powerlessness.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.650
And it's not a plus it's a times because they
have a combustible effect.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:23.400
And the truth is when you can take one of
them down closer to zero it actually does

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.390
help with the other and it helps to reduce
the anxiety.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:31.390
So I decided to create a balance sheet, okay,
another thing I don't know much about, accounting.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:35.000
I did go to Stanford Business School but I
hated accounting, didn't like math and I took

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.540
one psychology class, what the hell am I doin'
up here?

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.400
[chuckles] But you'll see this anxiety balance
sheet.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:46.470
If you are struggling with something in your
life, in something that's making you a little

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:50.410
anxious, try this exercise: create four columns.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.080
The first column is what do I know;

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.230
[pause]

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:58.910
second column is what don't I know about this
thing that's making me anxious;

00:30:58.910 --> 00:30:59.990
[pause]

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:03.060
the third column is what can I influence;

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.260
[pause]

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.950
and the fourth column is what can't I influence?

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.250
Okay let's see it altogether.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:14.800
So the anxiety balance sheet says there are
four columns: columns one and columns three

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:20.470
here are the "good" columns, what I do know
and what I can influence.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:25.401
Column two and four are the "bad" columns,
they're ones that actually create, they create

00:31:25.401 --> 00:31:28.370
the uncertainty and powerlessness.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:37.310
I've done this balance sheet with people and
leaders in companies from CBS to Nordstrom's

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:42.920
to Charles Schwab and what I've found is really
interesting, is when people do this exercise

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:50.130
75 to 80 percent of the people have more things,
more items in columns one and column three,

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:54.210
the "good" columns, the assets, than they
do in columns two and four.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:32:00.210
But when you're anxious you tend to obsess
about what's in column two and column four.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:04.280
So just actually getting it on paper helps
to take some of the anxiety away.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.640
Secondly, you can look at column two and say,
"What don't I know?" and you could ask yourself,

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.640
"How could I go learn that?

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.630
Maybe I'll go to Google and maybe I can learn
something on Google."

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.200
Yes, that's one way.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.480
Maybe you could ask your husband or your wife
if they're actually having an affair.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.660
That's a novel idea or maybe you could ask
your boss are there gonna be layoffs and am

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.440
I gonna lose my job?

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:32.210
Now most of us think that actually asking
someone the answer to what do I not know,

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:36.680
like trying to take something from column
two to put it in column one is a really stupid

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.160
idea because why do I wanna know the answer.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.710
Well, there's a study done, you probably heard
it before because it's sort of like one of

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:48.510
those sort of urban myth kinda studies, where
people had the choice of getting an electric

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:53.260
shock, there are only two choices you can
either get the electric shock now and it's

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:59.110
twice as painful as an electric shock you
can get in the next 24 hours.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:03.680
So you get either an electric shock now and
you just know you got it over with or you

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:09.360
can get an electric shock in the next 24 hours
randomly when you're not expecting it.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.980
So what did most people select?

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:17.180
What would you select, now or sometime in
the next 24 hours but half as painful?

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.060
Okay how many want now?

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.620
How many want sometime in the next 24 hours
randomly?

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.760
You're perfect two-thirds of you said that
you wanted it now and that's exactly what

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.840
the survey results showed is two-thirds of
the people want to get it over now why, because

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:38.380
mental stress is actually more painful than
physical stress, physical pain.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.470
So what does that mean for us as leaders here?

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.590
That means that if you have bad news to give
and you have a sense that the people who work

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:51.530
with you are starting to get an inkling about
the bad news, give the bad news, get it out

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:52.530
there.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:57.440
The anxiety shuts down the parts of your brain
that tend to be more creative and innovative,

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.820
you tend to spend your time in the amygdala
at the base of the brain, that caveman part

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:06.620
of your brain and not in the prefrontal cortex
where a lot of the reasoning and creativity

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.070
and innovation come from.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.589
Alright, curiosity.

00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:18.099
The founder of Sony once said, "Curiosity
is the fuel of creativity."

00:34:18.099 --> 00:34:19.550
I agree.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:25.399
Curiosity, Marty Seligman has also shown that
curiosity is what actually helps create resilience.

00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:30.079
When people are resilient, it has a lot to
do with coming up with new ways to look at

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:31.470
something.

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:35.950
So I started saying, "Well, curiosity seems
like an interesting and a very appropriate

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:40.460
emotion or state of being to talk about here
at Google, it's a very curious place."

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:47.460
What I started to realize when I did my research
on curiosity is that people who tend to be

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:51.530
curious, strangely enough, and for those of
you in the room you're gonna sort of not believe

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.710
this but it's actually a study, it was in
the Economist, it was in the Economist it

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.369
must be true.

00:34:56.369 --> 00:34:57.609
[laughs]

00:34:57.609 --> 00:34:58.849
[laughter]

00:34:58.849 --> 00:35:00.440
So I'm 51 years old.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:08.950
Dan came to my 50th birthday party at Burning
Man and so I was 50 years old, just turned

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:14.999
50 in December of 2010, and I see the cover
of the Economist Magazine in December of 2010,

00:35:14.999 --> 00:35:19.049
The Joy of Growing Old, I figure well this
is written for me, I better learn about it.

00:35:19.049 --> 00:35:23.609
And there was this interesting graph in there
called the U-bend of life and it was self

00:35:23.609 --> 00:35:25.310
reported well being in the United States.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:29.430
And what it shows basically is the following,
most importantly I'm gonna tell you about

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:33.549
the curiosity that relates to it, is that
people tend to be happiest as adults when

00:35:33.549 --> 00:35:38.950
they're in their college years 18 to 20 although
it sort of goes down each year, and then strangely

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:45.789
enough between about 25, 22, 24 and 34, 35
that's a 10 year period where people's happiness

00:35:45.789 --> 00:35:50.769
is relatively stable and then the shit hits
the fan at age 35.

00:35:50.769 --> 00:35:54.500
And between 35 and 50, how many of you are
35 to 50 here?

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.059
Okay I'm sorry.

00:35:56.059 --> 00:35:57.059
[laughs]

00:35:57.059 --> 00:35:58.059
[laughter]

00:35:58.059 --> 00:35:59.609
It just gets worse every year.

00:35:59.609 --> 00:36:00.869
[pause]

00:36:00.869 --> 00:36:04.119
Now there's a bunch of reasons for this: kids
have somethin' to do with it interestingly

00:36:04.119 --> 00:36:05.910
enough.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.710
[laughter]

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.819
Disappointment has something to do with it,
it's the number one emotion that gets worse

00:36:10.819 --> 00:36:15.109
each year between 35 and 50.

00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:18.630
And then the other thing that's related to
this that actually sort of is relevant to

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:25.460
what happens at age 50 and beyond, starting
age 50 and beyond is each decade the happiness

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:30.099
goes up, which is odd because I think generally
we have historically thought that people in

00:36:30.099 --> 00:36:34.720
their 70s and 80s are not very happy and what
newer evidence is showing is that actually

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.200
people get happier again.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.200
Why?

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.089
Well the number one [chuckles] reason that,
the number one parallel for people who are

00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:46.059
in their 18 to 20 year age and people who
are in their 70s and 80s is that they're curious.

00:36:46.059 --> 00:36:51.700
Now I don't think of my parents as all that
curious in their mid-70's but the fact is

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:55.279
there is a difference between having a sense
of wonder and having a sense of awe.

00:36:55.279 --> 00:37:00.660
People late in life, strangely enough, have
a sense of awe about life, more and more.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:06.549
There's a weird sense that they are just a
small speck in a bigger, magnificent picture

00:37:06.549 --> 00:37:10.130
and there's something beautiful about that
and something curious about it.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:14.529
And there's people like Peter Drucker, you
may have heard of Peter Drucker, famous management

00:37:14.529 --> 00:37:20.410
theorist, up 'til his dying day at age 95
every two years he would go out and study

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:24.820
something that had nothing to do with his
career, it could be Japanese Ikebana, it could

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:32.349
be American Civil War history, because what
he believed is that when you're curious in

00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:38.450
life, it fuels you, it fuels you and gives
you that sense of both the wonder and the

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:39.450
awe.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:44.569
So interestingly enough, I would say find
those places in your own life where you tend

00:37:44.569 --> 00:37:49.350
to be most curious, Google may be one of them,
Burning Man is one of them for me, TED has

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:53.499
been one of them for me, the Sundance Film
Festival is one of them for me.

00:37:53.499 --> 00:37:56.240
What helps take the blinders off?

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.880
Because what tends to happen in midlife, for
a lot of people, probably less so on this

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:06.540
campus, is that people put the blinders on
and that's when actually the curiosity starts

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:10.740
to go away and some of the happiness starts
to diminish.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:16.369
I was really lucky, how many of you have heard
of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi yeah, well a few

00:38:16.369 --> 00:38:22.830
of you, and I'm gonna call him Mike because
that's what he likes to be called, Mike Csikszentmihalyi.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:26.500
He wrote a book called Flow and when you hear
people talk about being in the flow or in

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:33.140
the zone, quite often they're sort of speaking
Mihaly Csikzentmihalyi's language, Mike Csikszentmihalyi

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.140
language.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:39.009
The idea was that there's certain times in
your life when you actually get in the flow

00:38:39.009 --> 00:38:43.660
where you just sort of feel like it's all
coming together and for 15 year olds it tends

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.730
to be when they're playing video games [laughs]

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:46.730
[laughter]

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:50.690
and interestingly enough if you look at the
components that create a sense of flow in

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:54.329
people's lives, very much so you'll see it
in a second.

00:38:54.329 --> 00:38:56.630
Well, Dan actually helped me with this equation
because we were talking about flow and it's

00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:02.289
a combination of skill and challenge, well
Mike Csikszentmihalyi mentored me, he invited

00:39:02.289 --> 00:39:07.069
me to come up to his ranch with his wife Isabella
in Montana for three days and to just talk

00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:09.980
about flow which was like the coolest thing
in the world.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:16.470
And I was just there to learn, I was curious,
I was very curious and he showed me some of

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:18.240
his diagrams.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.920
This I actually think is particularly appropriate
for people in the engineering world and people

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.579
who are dealing with the riddles of life.

00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:31.050
On one axis, there's challenge; on the other
axis, there's skill.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:35.490
If you have a lot of skill and very little
challenge you tend to be in the boredom place,

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:39.670
a lot of challenge very little skill you're
in the anxiety place.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:44.079
This is what it looks like if you look at
the whole graph and the different emotions

00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:45.079
you have.

00:39:45.079 --> 00:39:48.619
And ideally what we wanna do in life is we
wanna get into the flow zone and the flow

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:55.210
zone is basically flow equals 1.0; skill divided
by challenge there's sort of a 45 degree vector

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.770
that actually sort of helps you understand
that's where it's ideal.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:03.069
Actually a little bit off for those of you
more precise in the audience, it's less than

00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:07.829
1.0 because what Mike Csikszentmihalyi shown
is that you actually want a little more challenge

00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:12.780
than skill because what actually sort of ratchets
you up to that 45 degree angle as far to the

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:16.739
right as possible, is something that sort
of says you're challenge is a little bit higher

00:40:16.739 --> 00:40:21.470
than your skill and you're just sort of going
like this, like this, and like that.

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:27.339
So qualities that do that for people, it's
when you have clear goals that define success

00:40:27.339 --> 00:40:31.200
and as we look at the six that I'm gonna show
here just think about 15 year olds with their

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.660
video games.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:37.970
[laughs] Immediate feedback so that you can
incrementally adjust the constant balance

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:43.040
between your skill level and your challenge,
the ability to focus exclusively on the activity

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:48.480
through completion, a loss of sense of time
and self consciousness when you're in the

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.950
midst of the work, and the activity being
intrinsically rewarding so that there is an

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.089
effortlessness of action.

00:40:55.089 --> 00:40:58.259
So that's flow in the form of an equation.

00:40:58.259 --> 00:41:02.579
And the last one I'm gonna introduce before
I just sort of then sum up and we have questions

00:41:02.579 --> 00:41:07.359
and I'm gonna talk a little bit about why
it is relevant to leadership is thriving.

00:41:07.359 --> 00:41:12.039
Now as I started to do my research on the
idea of emotions in the form of equations,

00:41:12.039 --> 00:41:18.150
I did find not just that Marty Seligman happiness
equation, but I found a few other equations

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.150
as well.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:23.869
I found an equation by a woman named Barbara
Fredrickson, famous psychologist who'd written

00:41:23.869 --> 00:41:29.609
a book called Positivity; she has a website
called positivityratio.com and she'd shown

00:41:29.609 --> 00:41:35.109
that in the context of people's own personal
lives as well as in an organizational context

00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:41.650
if you wanna get into that sort of thriving
cycle, we're very familiar in our lives of

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:47.019
being in that downward spiral, the downward
spiral is when everything just sort of like

00:41:47.019 --> 00:41:48.739
domino theory, everything gets worse.

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:52.950
Well, there are upward spirals too, the New
York Giants seem to be in an upward spiral.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:58.650
The book Moneyball talked about the Oakland
A's winning 20 games in a row 10 years ago

00:41:58.650 --> 00:41:59.650
or so.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:04.599
So we sort of can get into upward spirals
in our lives and organizations can, too.

00:42:04.599 --> 00:42:12.130
In rowing there's a phenomena in rowing when
a crew is all rowing at the same time in unison

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:17.720
and it's just magical, the boat almost lifts
out of the water, it doesn't almost it actually

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.599
starts to lift out of the water.

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:26.519
They call that swing in rowing circles so
it's an amazing physical experience is that

00:42:26.519 --> 00:42:31.999
actually the unison of people being together
at the same time creates almost a thriving

00:42:31.999 --> 00:42:35.740
phenomena that the boat comes out of the water
and therefore there's less friction and the

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.140
boat goes even faster.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.970
Great organizations do that well.

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:44.391
And the reason why Barbara Fredrickson said
the ratio needs to be three to one, three

00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:50.700
to one positive to negative, is because Daniel
Kahneman who has a great new book out Thinking

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:56.250
Fast and Slow, he's shown with Amos Tversky
a few years ago that frankly we have this

00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:02.180
loss aversion thing, we have a tendency when
we have a bad experience in our life and then

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:07.849
we have a comparable good experience in our
life, the bad experience has twice of an emotional

00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:10.329
impact on us as the good experience.

00:43:10.329 --> 00:43:15.109
It's like our brains are sort of I don't know
Velcro for negativity --

00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:16.109
[laughter]

00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:18.170
and Teflon for positivity.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:22.710
So that's part of the reason why the ratio
needs to be three to one.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:26.119
And in organizational context that's what
they've been able to show.

00:43:26.119 --> 00:43:31.720
Now for me, I used this in my own company
when I really understood this.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:37.440
We had our top 15 executives, we would do
an executive committee meeting every week

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.500
and during a recession, those executive committee
meetings were terrible.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.741
I mean you know what I'm talking about, I
mean things are better now, but about two

00:43:44.741 --> 00:43:49.710
or three years ago at Google, yeah it wasn't
a whole lot of fun seeing some of the financials

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:53.390
and some of the results and there's a lot
more pressure.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:57.980
And so these meetings we would have, was 90
percent negative stuff, 90 percent all the

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.710
bad stuff and about 10 percent the positive.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:04.089
So I said, "Well I wanna actually leave this
meeting, this two hour meeting every week,

00:44:04.089 --> 00:44:05.440
on a positive note."

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.339
Not to just to fake it but I wanted to remind
people that there's some good things happening

00:44:09.339 --> 00:44:10.339
here.

00:44:10.339 --> 00:44:15.760
So what we did at the executive committee
meeting is I said, "Starting next week, I

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:20.579
want you to bring in an example of something
that happened in the last week out there in

00:44:20.579 --> 00:44:26.050
the field, one of our hotels, we have almost
40 hotels, come in and talk about something

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:30.440
that happened that was great and somebody
who deserves some extra recognition."

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.950
And so starting the next week we did this
and like only two people raised their hand

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.009
out of the 15, but each week we'd do it.

00:44:36.009 --> 00:44:41.990
And it could be the bellman of the Hotel Rex,
one of our hotels in Union Square of San Francisco,

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:46.369
and it could be the hotel has only one elevator
and it went down for two days.

00:44:46.369 --> 00:44:49.990
And if you have a seven story building [chuckles]
that has only one elevator and it's down for

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:54.150
two days you need a lot more bellmen because
you need people to schlep the bags up and

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:55.309
down the stairs.

00:44:55.309 --> 00:45:00.910
So there's a guy who had his family in town
from New York and instead of actually spending

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:05.839
time with his family, one of the bellman worked
16 hours a day two days in a row because we

00:45:05.839 --> 00:45:07.829
needed extra bellman service.

00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:12.069
Now he got paid overtime and he might have
gotten thanked by his supervisor, but did

00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:15.539
he think that somebody from the executive
offices like the head of marketing for the

00:45:15.539 --> 00:45:20.650
company was gonna come across the street or
go over to their hotel and say thank you to

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:21.839
him, Joe the bellman?

00:45:21.839 --> 00:45:26.430
Well, that's what we started doing and the
fact that we ended our meetings on a positive

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:30.140
note had three big positivity or thriving
things that came out of it.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:33.770
Number one is we reminded ourselves that there
were some good things happening and frankly

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:37.690
when things are going badly you really do
need to remind yourself that there's some

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.170
things that are going well as well.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:45.720
Secondly, Joe got the positivity, he got rewarded
and recognized by a senior executive in the

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:51.029
company and for the next 24 hours it was like
a stone in a pond the ripple effect of how

00:45:51.029 --> 00:45:55.140
Joe felt about his life and around everybody
around him not just the employees he worked

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.660
with and the customers but when he went home
that night was a positive.

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.559
And then thirdly, the fact that actually it
was from someone from a different department,

00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:04.799
that was our rule, if you're gonna go out
and say the thank you and you're gonna sort

00:46:04.799 --> 00:46:08.590
of do the positivity, it couldn't be someone
from operations to say thank you to Joe, Joe's

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:11.160
in the operations department, the hotel operations.

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.760
So we had someone from marketing or from IT
go and say thanks to Joe and that was important

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:21.119
because it created some cross fertilization
in a difficult time.

00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:25.060
So for those of you who feel like okay this
is a bunch of just nonsense, positive thinking

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.499
kind of stuff, well, look at a boat.

00:46:27.499 --> 00:46:32.790
This is a sailboat and if you look at what's
above the water versus what's below the water,

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:39.920
the average sailboat has about three times
as much above the water, the mast, than what's

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:45.380
below the water, the keel, the bottom of the
boat and then the keel which is what sort

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:50.470
of helps to steer the boat to some degree
and that and the rudder.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:57.450
So just from a physics perspective, the fact
that if you have an organization where all

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:02.650
you ever have is positivity and no one talks
about the negativity then you've got a sailboat

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:09.760
with ten times tall mast to one times tall
keel and that sailboat's gonna actually flip

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.430
over or capsize because it's a bunch of bullshit.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:17.799
Excuse me, but it's just people giving positivity
to each other and not actually talking about

00:47:17.799 --> 00:47:21.239
the negative; you gotta talk about the negative
that's the keel.

00:47:21.239 --> 00:47:26.339
But you could also have a boat or an organization
where the mast is only one-third and the keel

00:47:26.339 --> 00:47:32.450
is three times bigger than the mast and most
organizations are like that and then the senior

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:35.460
executives wonder why this damn sailboat won't
go very fast.

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.460
[chuckles]

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.460
[laughter]

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.569
So there's a physical side to this.

00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:42.359
But let me just sum up by saying the following:
I was a CEO for 24 years.

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:46.200
When I went to Stanford Business School I
was the youngest guy in my class and the second

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.140
youngest guy in my class was Seth Godin, you've
probably heard of Seth Godin.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:54.259
So Seth and I are good friends, have known
each other since business school, and Seth

00:47:54.259 --> 00:47:57.299
knew he wanted to be a writer when he grew
up and I said, "I'd sort of like to be a writer

00:47:57.299 --> 00:48:01.410
someday but first I wanna go out and be an
entrepreneur and maybe I'll be a CEO someday."

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:05.270
And one thing I said to Seth years ago is
he said, "Well what you gotta at business

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:07.930
school?" this is our second year of business
school, we wrote a book together in our second

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:10.229
year of business school, Seth and I did.

00:48:10.229 --> 00:48:11.960
And he says, "Well what'd you need to do?

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.369
What skill set do you have to have?"

00:48:13.369 --> 00:48:15.499
And I said, "I sort of feel like I have to
be a super human.

00:48:15.499 --> 00:48:20.470
In order to be a successful CEO someday I've
gotta be a super human."

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:26.970
And what I really believe now 24 years after
being a CEO, doing it for 24 years, and there

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:31.269
are very few people who have been a CEO for
the same company for 24 years, the company

00:48:31.269 --> 00:48:34.369
I founded, is it's not about being a super
human.

00:48:34.369 --> 00:48:43.400
It's about being a super human and just realizing
that as the CEO of the company, this sounds

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.589
like a cliché, but you're sort of like the
chief emotions officer.

00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:51.980
And let me explain that because some of you
are like, "Oh God, this is just agony."

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:55.249
[laughter]

00:48:55.249 --> 00:49:03.150
What I mean by that is that the fact is this
is a Petri dish, this organization Google

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:06.920
is a Petri dish, your department is a Petri
dish.

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:11.000
We learned from Daniel Goleman 16 years ago
when he wrote the book Emotional Intelligence

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.759
that two-thirds of the success of business
leaders tended to come from their emotional

00:49:15.759 --> 00:49:21.819
intelligence, their EQ, and about a third,
on average, from their IQ and from their level

00:49:21.819 --> 00:49:23.519
of experience in their work.

00:49:23.519 --> 00:49:27.369
So it was the first sort of, there was work
done before Daniel Goleman ever wrote about

00:49:27.369 --> 00:49:28.940
this, but this is where it got popularized.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.859
So 16 years later we know this.

00:49:31.859 --> 00:49:38.140
Smart guy here in a different state right
there.

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:45.260
Matt Lieberman's a neuroscientist at UCLA
and he's proven the following: when you're

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:51.920
feeling anxious or angry or frustrated, when
you make decisions from that place of anger

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:59.890
or anxiety and you try to make a decision
in that moment, you're losing 10 to 15 IQ

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:02.910
points in the act of making that decision.

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:07.079
Now if I'm giving a speech to a non-Google
crowd I would say the following: "Some of

00:50:07.079 --> 00:50:09.950
us in the crowd can't afford to lose 10 to
15 IQ points."

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:10.950
[laughs]

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:11.950
[laughter]

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:14.749
But at Google you can afford to lose 10 to
15 IQ points because you're all smart.

00:50:14.749 --> 00:50:21.650
But the bottom line is this: is that when
we are making decisions in that reactive place,

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:26.150
think back to that Viktor Frankl quote about
the choice in our lives and the freedom is

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:29.700
actually responding to things not reacting.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:35.349
When we come from a place of response as opposed
to reaction we are able, and what Lieberman

00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:39.940
showed is if you just even name the emotion,
and when I introduce the idea of these equations

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:43.390
he says, "Well that's just taking it one step
further that's even better," you're taking

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:47.150
yourself from the amygdala, that fight or
flight part of your brain, the caveman part

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:51.210
of your brain, the part of your brain that
frankly is not so smart, I mean it's good,

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:54.960
it has its role in your life for sure, and
you're taking yourself to a different part

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.769
of your brain where more reasoning happens.

00:50:56.769 --> 00:50:58.400
So it's a good thing.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:03.569
And finally if you have never read the book
Connected by Nicholas Christakis I highly

00:51:03.569 --> 00:51:06.089
recommend you read it, it came out two or
three years ago.

00:51:06.089 --> 00:51:10.440
What he was able to show is that our emotions
are contagious and we already knew this.

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.170
If I go up and smile at Meng, he'll smile
back.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:19.150
We have mirror neurons such that we sort of
end up aping each other, but also we have

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:22.900
socialization that means that whatever the
organizational environment we're in has an

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:25.859
influence on how we're feeling.

00:51:25.859 --> 00:51:33.089
Not a surprise, but the truth is that the
fear is just as contagious as the flu.

00:51:33.089 --> 00:51:36.769
And if you're a leader of an organization
and you don't understand that and you're fostering

00:51:36.769 --> 00:51:43.839
fear in an organization that needs to be creative
and innovative, duh you're actually not doin'

00:51:43.839 --> 00:51:47.930
a very smart thing about actually helping
to live up to their potential and use their

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:53.309
brain potential in a way that's actually gonna
be using their emotions to their maximum potential.

00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:58.330
So just to sum up some of us in the room are
saying, "Well, I'm not a leader."

00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:01.440
Well, you are a leader, you're a leader to
yourself, you're chief emotions officer [chuckles]

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:07.780
of yourself, you may have children and a spouse,
you may be the leader of your family, you

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:12.450
may be the leader of a department of three
people or five people.

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:17.279
Leaders are the emotional thermostats; where
we set out emotions have an enormous influence

00:52:17.279 --> 00:52:22.299
on what the group feels about their experience
in the group.

00:52:22.299 --> 00:52:26.549
According to some surveys 50 to 70 percent
of how a group feels about their experience

00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:31.130
in a group comes back to how they feel about
the leader and how they feel the leader feels

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:32.729
about the group.

00:52:32.729 --> 00:52:34.650
So I know this.

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:39.780
During the dot com bust, I set my emotional
thermostat high and our company did well.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:42.710
During this downturn I had a really hard time.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:47.089
Ultimately I sold the majority share of the
company to John Pritzker whose father started

00:52:47.089 --> 00:52:49.540
Hyatt, he's a billionaire, and it was great.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:54.529
It allowed me to go spend more time writing,
researching, etcetera.

00:52:54.529 --> 00:52:58.410
But I was not in a place where I was a very
good emotional thermostat for the organization

00:52:58.410 --> 00:52:59.410
and I could see it.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:04.559
So I've seen it on both sides where I've been
great at it and where I wasn't great at it.

00:53:04.559 --> 00:53:10.970
So the most neglected fact in business in
my opinion, is that we're all human.

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:14.900
And I learned how to actually play with a
computer and start workin' on a computer at

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:19.039
Stanford and then at Stanford Business School,
I learned how to drive a car in high school

00:53:19.039 --> 00:53:20.779
at driver's education.

00:53:20.779 --> 00:53:27.869
But I never learned emotions, [chuckles] I
never had a class on emotions and that's what

00:53:27.869 --> 00:53:33.849
my intent has been is to help us understand
the ingredients [sound of tapping on suitcase]

00:53:33.849 --> 00:53:38.230
in this piece of baggage that we're carrying
around with us for a lifetime.

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:45.729
And if you can understand the ingredients
of anxiety or the ingredients of joy or happiness

00:53:45.729 --> 00:53:51.829
or the ingredients of authenticity then you're
able to influence those ingredients a little

00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:52.829
bit more.

00:53:52.829 --> 00:54:00.819
So you may have your own emotional equation,
if you do, oh that's the book Emotional Equations,

00:54:00.819 --> 00:54:06.339
she's got them right here, Books Inc. has
them, and you may have your own emotional

00:54:06.339 --> 00:54:10.270
equation that you wanna come up with and you
can go to our Facebook site and actually post

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:11.930
your emotional equations there.

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:15.670
And with that thank you, I'm gonna say thank
you and them I'm gonna open up to see if there's

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:16.670
any questions.

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:23.700
But thank you very much for being here today.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.760
[applause]

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:32.380
So anybody have a question that's gonna scare
the hell outta me about the math side of this

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:34.490
thing?

00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:38.880
Let me just say one thing about the math and
Dan was very helpful with this: in the book,

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.789
I'm very clear that the math is not perfect
and frankly, if you take an equation like

00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:47.900
despair equals suffering minus meaning and
you invert it in a different way, it doesn't

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:48.900
work.

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:54.650
Some of the equations do work if you say,
it's like some don't work so I'm the first

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:58.569
to say don't try to actually get too precise
about this.

00:54:58.569 --> 00:55:04.270
But what it does do is it helps you understand
the relationship between these emotions and

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:08.430
that's the part where it is a bit of a mantra
and it can be a mind instrument for you.

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:09.430
Yes.

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:11.670
&gt;&gt;female #2: So I'll start with a thank you
--

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:12.670
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Thank you.

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:13.670
&gt;&gt;female #2: this is really incredible.

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:14.670
There were a lot of equations there though.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:19.319
Is there any that you would say is sort of
your number one that you pay attention most

00:55:19.319 --> 00:55:20.319
to?

00:55:20.319 --> 00:55:26.519
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Well let me just say this so
the one, it's like over the course of 25 years

00:55:26.519 --> 00:55:29.769
we've created like 55 boutique hotels so people
say, "Which is your favorite?"

00:55:29.769 --> 00:55:33.979
Well, my favorite's like the Phoenix, the
funky rock and roll motel in the Tenderloin

00:55:33.979 --> 00:55:37.130
that's our like lowest end hotel because it
was the first.

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:42.549
So the first one that means to me that despair
equals suffering minus meaning is one that's

00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:47.339
very meaningful to me on a daily basis and
has been very helpful for me when I'm talking

00:55:47.339 --> 00:55:51.329
with friends who are going through a difficult
time.

00:55:51.329 --> 00:55:56.349
The anxiety one is I think been the most effective
one in terms of in organizational context

00:55:56.349 --> 00:56:01.109
of helping people to sort of say, "I'm feeling
this anxiety, what do I do with it?"

00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:06.750
And the balance sheet, that anxiety balance
sheet is really valuable for people.

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:12.319
The one that recently has been helpful with
this book and sort of like saying, "Okay,

00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:16.809
Chip you have a tendency to get too much into
the pursuit of things and why don't you enjoy

00:56:16.809 --> 00:56:21.190
the little ride you're on right now," has
helped me to make sure that I'm not in the

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:24.490
denominator of the happiness equation too
often.

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:27.220
I mean those are some of the ones I've actually
presented to you, there's a bunch of other

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:33.839
ones, there's 18 that are presented in the
book in 17 different chapters and what I had

00:56:33.839 --> 00:56:38.410
to do, because this could be just a silly
little parlor game if I didn't go out and

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:43.839
make sure that if I'm doing an equation on
envy and jealousy, which is one chapter, that

00:56:43.839 --> 00:56:48.839
I spent time with experts in the field to
say, "Okay tell me about the nature of what

00:56:48.839 --> 00:56:51.009
are the ingredients of envy and jealousy."

00:56:51.009 --> 00:56:53.719
So that's what I needed to do and that's what
I did.

00:56:53.719 --> 00:56:54.920
So thank you.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.920
Yes.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.920
&gt;&gt;male #3: Thank you.

00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.970
This might be helpful for other Jewish people
in the room but I was wondering if you've

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:02.720
done any thinking about where guilt comes
from --

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.720
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Where what comes from?

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.720
[laughter]

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.720
&gt;&gt;male #3: Where guilt comes from.

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:06.720
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: [laughs]

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:13.220
It's interesting guilt is one that I want
to do in the next, there's probably, it looks

00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:19.230
because the book's doing well there may be
like a second version, that and trust are

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:23.160
like number one and number two, but I can't
tell you, I have not done my research yet

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.160
in terms of guilt.

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:31.269
Guilt is a fascinating emotion and so I promise
you it's gonna be in the next book because

00:57:31.269 --> 00:57:33.969
it's one that I think is quite pervasive,
too.

00:57:33.969 --> 00:57:37.280
Do you have any suggestions of what's your
equation for guilt?

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.720
&gt;&gt;male #3: [pause] Um --

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.249
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: It has something to do with
your mother?

00:57:41.249 --> 00:57:44.650
&gt;&gt;male #3: I think is has something to do
with how much responsibility --

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:45.650
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah.

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:46.650
&gt;&gt;male #3: you take for something.

00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:50.420
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah one of the equations in
the book is regret and regret equals disappointment

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:53.160
plus a sense of responsibility.

00:57:53.160 --> 00:58:00.050
And so actually I'm fascinated by regret and
remorse and guilt and shame.

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:03.510
Guilt and shame are interesting, the difference
between guilt and shame is guilt is I did

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:06.009
something wrong and shame is I am wrong.

00:58:06.009 --> 00:58:11.799
And so all of that's fascinating to me and
so I just haven't done my research on it yet

00:58:11.799 --> 00:58:12.799
so.

00:58:12.799 --> 00:58:13.799
&gt;&gt;male #3: So great.

00:58:13.799 --> 00:58:15.900
And also I was wondering quickly it seems
like Burning Man has been an big influence

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:16.900
on you.

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:17.900
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah.

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:19.259
&gt;&gt;male #3: I've never been I'm hoping to go
this year and I was wondering if you could

00:58:19.259 --> 00:58:25.089
briefly kind of share what about Burning Man
is so great or healthy or whatever.

00:58:25.089 --> 00:58:29.190
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah, let me say it's, everybody
is gonna have a different experience.

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:34.400
So and I'm on the board so I'm on the board
of Burning Man [chuckles] Burning Man has

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:38.970
a non-profit board and I'm on the board of
Burning Man and if you wanna read a funny

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:39.970
article --

00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:40.970
&gt;&gt;male #3: Also how do we get tickets --

00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:42.219
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: I get tickets yeah --

00:58:42.219 --> 00:58:43.219
[laughter]

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:47.299
that's a hard thing is there's now stupid
ass lottery that doesn't make a lot of sense,

00:58:47.299 --> 00:58:50.380
that we're still figuring out so there's gonna
be some new announcements on that soon.

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:54.630
I think the thing I like about Burning Man,
what Burning Man gets a lot of attention for

00:58:54.630 --> 00:59:01.009
is the drugs, the music, the nudity, but at
the core of what I think Burning Man really

00:59:01.009 --> 00:59:07.339
speaks to is the creative and artistic spirit
and how that unites us and there's a spirituality

00:59:07.339 --> 00:59:14.349
and a utopian sort of belief in the world
which I think is really, takes us back to

00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:19.460
childhood, for me it takes me to that sense
of like wonder about what the world could

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:24.910
be like if these Burning Man principles were
lived every day.

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:29.619
So I love it for that, I hate the dust storms,
there's all kinds of other things that you

00:59:29.619 --> 00:59:34.680
don't like about it, but more than anything
the creative spirit is what really drives

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:36.599
me to go almost every year.

00:59:36.599 --> 00:59:37.599
&gt;&gt;male #3: Great, thanks.

00:59:37.599 --> 00:59:38.859
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Thank you, yes.

00:59:38.859 --> 00:59:39.859
Question?

00:59:39.859 --> 00:59:40.859
&gt;&gt;male #4: Hi there.

00:59:40.859 --> 00:59:41.859
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Hi.

00:59:41.859 --> 00:59:42.859
&gt;&gt;male #4: Thanks so much for the talk --

00:59:42.859 --> 00:59:43.859
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah.

00:59:43.859 --> 00:59:46.319
&gt;&gt;male #4: that was great and it's so meaningful
for how we show up as people and as leaders.

00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:50.049
I was wondering though how you think impacts
customers and users?

00:59:50.049 --> 00:59:51.599
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah.

00:59:51.599 --> 00:59:56.170
Well one of my equations I had ever before
I wrote this book or even started the research

00:59:56.170 --> 01:00:00.180
was I had talked about it in my company is
disappointment equals expectations minus reality

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.339
and it's sort of one of the more basic equations
in the book.

01:00:03.339 --> 01:00:06.690
Disappointment equals expectations minus reality,
think of it.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:11.800
You are going on your honeymoon, expectations
here [chuckles] reality here, disappointment

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.880
or divorce.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:19.089
So that's, there's times when I think the
equations can be very helpful and that one's

01:00:19.089 --> 01:00:21.819
helpful for me when I'm talking to our marketing
department.

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:25.299
The marketing department wants to do everything
they can to paint a beautiful picture of what

01:00:25.299 --> 01:00:29.279
the hotel's gonna be like and the web's gonna
tell us, but if we don't do a very good job,

01:00:29.279 --> 01:00:34.190
an accurate job of telling the story, we are
going to create disappointed customers over

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:35.380
and over again.

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:41.650
So how do we improve the reality or make sure
that the expectations are in line with what

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:42.650
real really is?

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:48.440
So that's one of a handful of equations that
I think are relevant to the customer experience,

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.609
there's a few other ones, too.

01:00:49.609 --> 01:00:56.420
I'm actually speaking at South by Southwest
in March and my whole talk is on emotional

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.239
equations for the customer experience.

01:00:58.239 --> 01:01:02.529
So I'm in the process of actually writing
that speech so I'll figure that out and maybe

01:01:02.529 --> 01:01:03.529
it'll be on line.

01:01:03.529 --> 01:01:04.529
&gt;&gt;male #4: Yeah, please let us know.

01:01:04.529 --> 01:01:05.529
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Okay, thanks.

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:06.529
&gt;&gt;female #3: Hi Chip, thanks --

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:07.529
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah.

01:01:07.529 --> 01:01:08.529
&gt;&gt;female #3: so much for coming.

01:01:08.529 --> 01:01:11.569
Also I just stayed at my first Joie de Vivre
hotel, Hotel Irwin in Venice Beach --

01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:12.569
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Oh yeah --

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:13.569
&gt;&gt;female #3: it was really awesome.

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:14.569
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: I love the Irwin, it's funky.

01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:15.569
&gt;&gt;female #3: Yeah, really cool.

01:01:15.569 --> 01:01:16.569
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah.

01:01:16.569 --> 01:01:19.950
&gt;&gt;female #3: So I was wondering what opportunities
employees at Joie de Vivre have to learn about

01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:21.759
these concepts and if so how you teach --

01:01:21.759 --> 01:01:22.759
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah.

01:01:22.759 --> 01:01:23.759
&gt;&gt;female #3: them.

01:01:23.759 --> 01:01:25.989
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Well, we have a Joie de Vivre
University and I actually teach a class on

01:01:25.989 --> 01:01:29.690
emotional equations and started doing that
about two and half three years ago.

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:35.319
Senior leaders in the company have done half
day and full day retreats with me on our emotions.

01:01:35.319 --> 01:01:39.580
So in essence what we've gotten to a place
is we realized, "Damn; we didn't have any

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.580
courses."

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.960
We had courses, half our courses in Joie de
Vivre University are skill based and half

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:50.719
of them are sort of lifestyle oriented: yoga,
meditation, search inside yourself kind of

01:01:50.719 --> 01:01:51.719
things.

01:01:51.719 --> 01:01:55.160
But we didn't have anything, we had zero classes
on emotions other than understanding personality

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.890
types which was a course on the, I always
pronounce it wrong, the Enneagram, we had

01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:01.489
a course on that.

01:02:01.489 --> 01:02:05.670
But we didn't have anything about emotions
and so we started teaching emotions classes

01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:07.160
and they were the most popular classes.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.920
So now we're teaching more emotions classes
and that's part of how we are trying to help

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.089
improve the emotional fluency.

01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:18.630
See my belief is that emotional intelligence
is what Dan Goleman talked about and I love

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:22.959
it, but you could be intelligent about something
but not fluent.

01:02:22.959 --> 01:02:27.950
I could be intelligent about going to France
and knowing the dialects of French and the

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:31.619
history and the origins of the language, but
I can't walk down the street and go into the

01:02:31.619 --> 01:02:33.329
shop and actually speak it.

01:02:33.329 --> 01:02:40.040
Or I can be great at actually critiquing someone's
film or their dance moves but I can't dance.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.969
Being fluent means you can do it.

01:02:41.969 --> 01:02:46.319
And so to me, emotional intelligence is great
and emotional fluency is a step beyond it

01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:50.979
where you start becoming more intuitive about
how the emotions affect you and that's why

01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:56.369
for me the equations are a step towards fluency
as opposed to just the intelligence.

01:02:56.369 --> 01:02:57.369
So yeah, thanks.

01:02:57.369 --> 01:02:58.369
&gt;&gt;female #3: Okay.

01:02:58.369 --> 01:02:59.369
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: It's how you use them.

01:02:59.369 --> 01:03:00.369
&gt;&gt;female #4: One more.

01:03:00.369 --> 01:03:01.369
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: One more.

01:03:01.369 --> 01:03:02.369
Yeah.

01:03:02.369 --> 01:03:03.969
&gt;&gt;male #5: Hi, thank you very much for the
talk.

01:03:03.969 --> 01:03:09.500
If we take, if we take equations at the face
value it looks like that it's important to

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.209
minimize disappointment for example --

01:03:13.209 --> 01:03:14.599
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Minimize what?

01:03:14.599 --> 01:03:18.989
&gt;&gt;male #5: disappointment, the suffering,
meaning, and minimize disappointment right?

01:03:18.989 --> 01:03:23.619
So my question is what are your thoughts about
emotions and time because maybe there is a

01:03:23.619 --> 01:03:24.619
time --

01:03:24.619 --> 01:03:25.619
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah.

01:03:25.619 --> 01:03:28.140
&gt;&gt;male #5: for disappointment and then just
let it be and then not try to minimize it

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.140
at the moment.

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:31.519
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Well, there's a really interesting,
it's a very good question especially in the

01:03:31.519 --> 01:03:39.210
context of regret and actually, at one point,
Dan and I were trying to figure out one equation,

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:43.289
I remember which one it was that had a time
factor to it and it was a little challenging.

01:03:43.289 --> 01:03:48.579
But there's some emotions where the emotion
can get stronger over time, regret is one

01:03:48.579 --> 01:03:49.579
of them.

01:03:49.579 --> 01:03:53.959
It depends on what you regret but generally
speaking what has been shown is what we tend

01:03:53.959 --> 01:04:00.479
to do we have somethin' called loss aversion
and we don't wanna actually, if you ask someone

01:04:00.479 --> 01:04:06.200
whether you choose to, you have two choices,
no electric shocks on this one.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:14.700
You can either choose to earn $200, we're
gonna flip a coin, if you guess the right

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:20.140
side of the coin you get $200, if you get
it wrong you get zero; you can either actually

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:25.200
flip the coin and get zero or $200 or I can
give you $100 right now.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.150
Most people will choose the $100.

01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:28.150
Why?

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:32.959
I mean the math of it suggests that, why it's
because they don't want the regret.

01:04:32.959 --> 01:04:34.519
So that's one example.

01:04:34.519 --> 01:04:39.489
Now if all of a sudden you say, "Okay," I
mean, there's a component where you can actually

01:04:39.489 --> 01:04:42.079
add regret to it all of a sudden it goes back
to the math.

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:47.559
What they found over time is that people have
a tendency in the course of time to regret

01:04:47.559 --> 01:04:54.130
what they didn't do in life as opposed to
what they did do and where they made a mistake.

01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:59.380
So what's interesting about time is you have
to actually sort of factor it in for certain

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:06.819
emotions and know that with some emotions,
with most emotions, with time the emotion

01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:07.819
dissipates.

01:05:07.819 --> 01:05:12.400
And from a biological perspective, the biology
of an emotion in terms of physically what's

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:18.729
happening sensation wise in your body, it
lasts about 90 seconds.

01:05:18.729 --> 01:05:23.339
But how we bathe in that emotion for a lot
longer than 90 seconds is what's interesting

01:05:23.339 --> 01:05:27.049
and some emotions, like regret, actually can
get worse with time.

01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:31.480
So long story short is that's a piece that
where it's sort of like the advanced class

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.640
of emotional equations is how do you factor
time in.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:39.529
I didn't do it for the sake of this book because
it got a little too complicated and some emotions

01:05:39.529 --> 01:05:44.999
were not relevant; happiness definitely trails
off over time around a particular issue.

01:05:44.999 --> 01:05:50.579
So that's a long winded answer but it's a
good question because the truth is in the

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:56.589
moment we tend to actually feel, it's like
anything in life, when we're feeling that

01:05:56.589 --> 01:06:03.029
immense joy or happiness there's this tendency
to feel, at that moment, it's gonna last forever.

01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:08.039
And when you're feeling the intensity of the
despair in that moment, we think it's gonna

01:06:08.039 --> 01:06:09.930
last forever.

01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:15.269
And the truth is that our emotions are like
the weather, we're good external weather forecasters,

01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:18.299
you knew it was gonna probably rain today
because a forecaster told you or you could

01:06:18.299 --> 01:06:19.299
sense it.

01:06:19.299 --> 01:06:24.180
We're not so good at our own internal weather
forecasting and we have a tendency to think

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:28.279
that if there is a snow storm today there's
gonna be a snow storm the rest of our lives

01:06:28.279 --> 01:06:29.509
when we're feeling despair.

01:06:29.509 --> 01:06:34.779
And the fact is weather comes and goes and
the best thing you can do with these emotions,

01:06:34.779 --> 01:06:39.559
is to help them move through you and that's
the word emotion means; it means to move.

01:06:39.559 --> 01:06:40.579
So, Dan.

01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:44.920
&gt;&gt;Dan Russell: And with that, let's say thank
you to Chip.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.920
Thanks Chip.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.920
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: You're welcome.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:46.921
