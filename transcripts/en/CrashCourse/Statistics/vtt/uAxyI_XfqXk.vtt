00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.700
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and Welcome back to
Crash Course, Statistics.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.030
One thing that statistics are good for comparing.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.831
You can compare your GPA with the mean or
median GPA, and you can use the standard deviation

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:18.630
to figure out whether the amount of time that
people spend on social media everyday is pretty

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.380
similar, or whether people differ a lot.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.780
But both these examples are comparing apples
to apples.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.240
And sometimes we want to compare things that
aren’t exactly the same, or aren’t measured

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.560
in the same way.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.540
This is where standardization comes in.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.570
For example some prospective college students
took the SAT, some the ACT and others both.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.820
How can we compare things that aren’t the
same?

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.740
It’s like comparing apples to grapefruit.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:50.820
INTRO

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.900
Say there are two students who are applying
for admission to the same college-- one took

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.060
only the SAT, and the other only the ACT.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.780
Both tests are trying to measure the same
thing: college readiness.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.240
But they’re different tests, and more importantly,
are measured on different scales; The SAT

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.340
is currently out of 1600 points, while the
ACT is out of 36 points.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.290
This makes things tough to compare.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.369
While I can maybe assume that a perfect score
on the SAT and ACT mean similar things--namely

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.500
that I’ve found a superstar test taker--it’s
not immediately clear whether a 1200 on the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.430
SAT is better than a 25 on the ACT.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.900
Again, apples to grapefruit.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.340
They’re similar but not quite the same.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.250
The first thing we can do To make these scores
easier to compare is to center both of the

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.939
distributions around zero by subtracting the
mean of each respective test from each score.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.420
Now for both adjusted test scores, someone
who got around the mean of either test will

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.759
have a score of 0.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.659
So, if you scored a 1000 on the SAT or a 21
on the ACT , your new, adjusted score would

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.690
be 0, since those scores are 0 points away
from the means of each test.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.119
Now that both scores are centered around zero,
it’s a little easier to compare them.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.720
Things that are close to zero indicate a score
that was close to the mean, while those far

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.410
away from zero indicate scores that were either
a lot higher, or a lot lower than the mean

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.280
score for that test.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.320
But our test scores are still on different
scales.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.540
A 10 (above the mean) on the SAT obviously
isn’t the same as at 10 (above the mean)

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.599
on the ACT.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.540
The second, and final step that will allow
us to compare these two scores is to take

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.700
our already adjusted scores and measure the
distance away from the mean using units of

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.099
standard deviation.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.560
We do this by dividing the adjusted scores
by the standard deviation of the respective tests.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.860
This rescales both distributions of scores
so that the standard deviation for both is

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.440
now 1 unit.

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.349
A re-scaled score, which is called a z-score,
of 1 indicates a point that is 1 standard

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.409
deviation higher than the mean, and a z-score
of -1 indicates a point that is 1 standard

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.810
deviation lower than the mean.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.190
Now we can better compare two students: Tony
who got a 1200 on the SAT, and Maia who got

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.040
a 25 on the ACT.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.760
First we subtract the mean score from each,
and then divide by the standard deviation.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.810
Let’s say those standard deviations are
200 and 4.8 for the SAT and ACT respectively.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.880
So Tony’s score of 1200 minus 1000 divided
by 200 gives a new z-score of 1 (which means

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.240
means that it is 1 standard deviations above the mean).

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:40.080
And Maia’s 25 becomes 25 minus 21 divided
by 4.8 giving a new z-score of 0 .83 (which

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.390
means that her score is .83 standard deviations
above the mean).

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.760
These scores are much more comparable.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.530
It’s easy to see that Tony and Maia’s
z-scores are actually pretty similar, even

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.120
though it was hard to tell with their original
scores of 1200 and 25.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.400
Z-scores in general allow us to compare things
that are not on the same scale, as long as

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.099
they’re normally distributed.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.100
In fact there’s an entire z-distribution
that allows us to calculate things like percentiles.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.560
Percentiles tell you what percentage of the
population has a score or value that’s lower

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:12.560
than yours.

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.000
The median, is the 50th percentile; exactly
half the data is above and below it.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.449
By looking up Tony and Maia’s z-scores in
a standardized z-table, we can see that Both

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.810
scored above approximate 80% of their peers
give or take.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.720
You may have seen percentiles at the doctor’s
office when your physician told your parents

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.550
that you were at the 83rd percentile for height.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.050
That means that 83% of the population-- and
here we mean kids your age, not all people

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.009
ever--have heights that are less than or equal
to yours.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.889
If you look at the whole distribution of heights
and found yours, 83% of the distribution would

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.750
be to the left of your height.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.160
Now, technically you can find these percentiles
for any distribution, it involves calculating

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.080
the area underneath the curve and figuring
out how much of it is below a certain value.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.229
But that calculation can be tedious, so often
times we convert normal distributions into

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:09.500
standard normal--or z--distributions which
have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.040
Common percentiles have already been calculated
for the z-distribution, you may have seen

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.460
a table of them in a statistics textbook.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.550
Say you are competing for a spot at a local
video game convention.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.170
The rules state that you must be in the top
5 percent of scores for your favorite game,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.780
Call of Civic Duty--a jury duty based video
game.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.160
Scores of Call of Civic Duty are normally
distributed with a mean of 2,000 and a standard

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.540
deviation of 300.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.660
You get 100 points each day you don’t fall
asleep.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.340
So you set out to find out what score would
put you at the 95th percentile.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.620
Being in the 95th percentile means that you’re
in the top 5 percent of scores since 95% are

00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:48.740
below you.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.699
And these are just two different ways of talking
about the same situation.

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.520
Looking at our z-score table, we can see that
a z-score of about 1.65 would put you in the

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.310
top 5 percent of Call of Civic Duty players.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.960
In fact a z-score of 1.65 corresponds to the
95th percentile of any z-scored distribution.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.980
But we want to turn that back into a Call
of Civic Duty score so that you know just

00:06:10.981 --> 00:06:14.849
how high you have to score in order to qualify
for the gaming convention.

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.750
We know the process to turn a raw score into
a z-score, so to go the other direction, we

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.750
just reverse it.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.139
First, we multiply the z-score by the standard
deviation--300--to get 495.

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:32.860
Then we add the mean score 2,000 to get the
final score to beat: 2,495.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.130
We can also think of percentiles as the probability
that a random score drawn from a z-distribution

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.260
will be lower than a given score.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.370
Say, you are at the 90th percentile
for marathon runners.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.460
That means that if we randomly selected a
marathon runner, 90% of the time we’d select

00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:50.990
a runner with the same or slower run times than you.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.449
So you’re in the top 10 percent, but does
that mean you’re “extremely” good?

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.710
There’s really no clear answer of how good
you have to be or how high a score has to

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.710
be in order to be considered “extreme”,
it’s somewhat arbitrary.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.099
You may think the top 10% of marathon runners
are “extreme”, but someone might draw

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.960
the line at the top 1%.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.340
In fact, sometimes you can be so extreme that
people might start to think you’re not even

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.020
from a certain population z-distribution.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.460
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.830
You’re at the county fair, and stop at a
game booth.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.419
The woman running it says that she has two
piles: one of apples, and one of some type

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:26.620
of mystery object.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.640
She’ll randomly pick an item from one pile.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.040
If you can guess whether she picked an apple
or not, you’ll win a lifetime supply of

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.040
funnel cake.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.419
She does kindly tell you that the mean weight
of this type of apple is 200 grams with a

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:40.430
standard deviation of 20 grams.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.940
She grabs an object, weighs it, and yells
out the weight of 270 grams.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.740
You quickly calculate the z-score is 3.5.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.270
You take out your phone and pull up a z-score
table and figure out this object would be

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:58.379
in the top 99.99th percentile, meaning that
it is larger than 99.99 percent of apples.

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:01.409
It’s such a big apple, it’s basically
New York.

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:06.830
If it was an apple, it’s unlikely you’d
get one this big, only 0.001% of the time.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.909
So maybe it’s not an apple.

00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:12.419
Before you give your final answer you need
to ask yourself whether you think that’s

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:17.199
rare enough for you to conclude that it’s
probably not an apple, the limit is pretty

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:21.229
arbitrary, but it’s enough here for you
to guess not an apple.

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:25.460
And you swear you see a twinkle in the proprietor’s
eye when she tells you that you’re wrong

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.020
and pulls out a very large apple.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.180
As you walk away, you think about how nice
it would have been to know what the mystery

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.220
pile was.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.450
If it had been a pile of Bowling Balls, you
probably would have guessed “apple”, even

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.210
though it seemed a little heavy since it’s
more likely to have a 270 gram apple than

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.380
a 270 gram bowling ball.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.070
But if the other pile were grapefruit, you
might be more inclined to stick with your

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:51.370
original choice of “not an apple”, since
a 270 gram grapefruit is more likely than

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.710
a 270 gram apple.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.530
But since you didn’t know, you made the
best choice that you could and you can buy

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.640
your own funnel cake.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.200
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.580
Z-scores help us make comparisons.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.870
We can compare a thing to a certain population,
like a particular apple weight to all apple

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.870
weights.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.930
And we can compare stuff that’s not naturally
comparable like SAT and ACT scores.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.750
Though we might not calculate actual scores,
the ideas behind z-scores are what make us

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:19.630
feel that the likelihood of being on the same
flight as Chadwick Boseman is way smaller

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.771
than the likelihood of hitting 4 red lights
on our way home, even though those things

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.230
are very different.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.980
Or maybe we’re trying to compare athletes
from different sports to see who the GOAT is,

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.800
no not that kind of goat, Greatest Of All
Time.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.380
Let’s say our top contenders are Lebron
James and Tom Brady.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.920
But who’s the GOAT?

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.300
Lebron has a career average of about 27 points
per game, while Brady has an average of 1.92

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.380
touchdowns per game between 2000-2017.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.720
While both are impressive, we’re looking
for the greatest.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.250
When we’re picking out our GOAT, we could
compare the two athletes by thinking about

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.590
how much higher above the average score each
one has.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.690
But to know which athlete's score is more
impressive we’d need to compare their z-scores.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.650
I haven’t run the math, but off the top
of my head, I’m going with LeBron.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.650
Prove me wrong.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.710
Best analysis wins something that weighs less
than 270 grams.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.750
No other clues.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.860
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next time.
