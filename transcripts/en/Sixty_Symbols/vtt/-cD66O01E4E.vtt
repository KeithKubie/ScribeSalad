00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As the LHC has been

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.560
Working and running people are beginning to ask the question:

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.039
What comes next in the world of high-energy physics?

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:15.929
Should there be another Collider? And it's kind of become an issue for some people because,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.580
The Large Hadron Collider, although it's doing fantastic science,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.200
It's measuring quantities to amazingly high precision, if you think of it in terms of the discovery of new particles,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.620
It's discovered one, which was the Higgs back in 2012.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.640
BRADY: Which is what it was built for!

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.440
PROF: Exactly.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.760
PETER HIGGS: Really an incredible thing that it happened in my lifetime.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.100
PROF: But it's not found anything else.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.669
It's not found any evidence of dark matter, which throws through the world of supersymmetry.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.960
It's not found any evidence of more exotic things.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.440
Perhaps like extra dimensions or other new particles.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.340
It has demonstrated that we have effectively an interaction between the Higgs and the fermions,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.560
a force acting there that we need to understand better,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.560
because we can now probe that regime which we couldn't before.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.100
But the question is, Do we build an even bigger Collider?

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.460
And it was brought to a forefront by the recent publication suggesting that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.360
there might be what they call a future circular Collider based at CERN.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.860
That's where the current Large Hadron Collider is.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.100
The Large Hadron Collider is underground in a ring that's about 25 kilometers long.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.580
The Future Circular Collider would be a ring that's a hundred kilometers long,

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.920
four times the length.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.900
It would cost of order 10 to 20 billion pounds.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.860
Naturally a question that we need to ask ourselves, both as physicists but also society,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.600
Where do you want to invest these large amounts of money?

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.500
There was a particular article that, at least within the particle physics community,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.380
was read a lot, by Sabine Hossenfelder, in which she said,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.480
Although she accepted that probing fundamental physics through a particle accelerator

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.080
is the best microscope there is to do that, the fact that we've only made this one

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.580
Discovery and we don't have any great ideas as to what is coming next in terms of theory

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.669
Perhaps we should be deferring building

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.089
maybe not even building a future Collider until we have our theories firmly better established and

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.689
Then we can perhaps go ahead once we've said well

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.410
this is almost certainly to be be the way forward and that and therefore that will dictate the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.307
form of any large Collider.

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:44.730
BRADY: Rather than kind of fumbling in the dark

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.230
PROF: I think that's a probably she would agree without that that the way that we if we

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.299
Go ahead right now. We are will be basing it on physics that we already know but more speculative physics about what's coming next

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.159
And so and it's a really important question to address for me personally

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.029
I think it's it's a it's there's not a clear-cut answer

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.090
I

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.710
Remember back in the 1980s when the Large Hadron Collider was being put forward and maybe even slightly earlier

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.430
People did think they knew what the solution was. They did think that

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.800
Dark matter would be found in what was known as WIMPs, weakly interacting massive particles. There was we talked about a wimp miracle and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.119
There were natural candidates for this WIMPs, which were coming from supersymmetry

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.709
The Higgs mechanism had been suggested back in the 60s

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.929
and so there was a there was in some sense a well-defined path to go along and if I were in it

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.110
But the very first conference I ever went to in 1983

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.329
was at the Royal Society and Stephen Hawking gave a talk there in which he said we

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.209
Will know everything by the end of the century and it's all "N=8 super-gravity". He called it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.910
It was called and turned out not to be the case

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.739
there was an example where we did think we knew where we were going and we the decision on the

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.610
LHC was made and you do need to make these many years in advance, you know the LHC came into operation in 2008

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.089
Right, 20 odd years nearly thirty years after the initial proposal the proposal for the future circular

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.090
Collider would have it starting in

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.800
2050 because you've got to build these things you've got to develop the technology

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.040
Ed, are you saying that the large hadron collider didn't end up

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.220
Discovering the thing it was built to discover? No it did. You're quite right

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.089
You said at the very beginning its primary goal was to discover the Higgs, but it had secondary goals

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.820
and there was a real feeling that it would probably be able to if it found the Higgs it would probably find the

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.240
these WIMP particles because there was

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.880
supersymmetric models which suggested that WIMP particles would be in the same sort of mass range as the Higgs. That wasn't the case

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.540
And that wasn't the case they have just not they're just not showing up. In fact, no new particles of showing up. So the

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.019
Argument for building the big circular Collider isn't there as strongly as it was for the LHC?

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.820
In the sense of having a whole series of particles that you think you're going to find

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.850
Yeah, as far as I can tell there's not, and in fact

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.200
It would be a case that we'd be building it partly in order to actually

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:25.600
use the upgraded LHC and of course the LHC itself still has many years left of its lifetime to go and

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.070
Be using it

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.510
Not only as a discovery machine to actually find new things that might might be there but also to as a high precision

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.350
Machine to help us

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.730
understand the standard model and in particular the Higgs and the interaction the Higgs has with fermions with the

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:50.049
Things that you and I are made of the quarks and the leptons so to help us understand those interactions much much better

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.280
because another way of finding new physics is to say here's my standard model prediction for some very

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.040
exotic process then I go and measure that exotic process and I find a difference and

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.540
the difference may only be in like the tenth decimal place

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.840
but if you are

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:16.840
Sure about the calculations that have gone into it and sure about the measurements then there's your probing your finding evidence of new physics

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.089
This is the detector and that's one reason why you would go for it

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.970
You know a much more powerful machine that can probe into these new areas

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.670
Smaller length scales higher energy where things might pop up. We just don't know. It's one of the

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.450
Frustrating things about this. There's two things that can go on here

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.009
You can build a new Collider to find a new particle and have some paradigm change

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.580
Yeah

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:58.240
Or you can build one to just like fine tuning and get a higher resolution and better pictures and then two different arguments

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.769
It feels like yeah, but in fine-tuning you looking for differences, right?

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.020
It's not a case of I mean, yes, that's what you're always probing for you with a wave physics works

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.799
Right as we basically we don't try to confirm models. We try to rule them out

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:19.659
That's kind of in our heads we try to find deviations and that's what would this fine-tuning. It would be rather than having, you know

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:26.289
Something smash you in the face. And so here I am, this brand new particle. Look at me. I've revolutionised things straight away

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:34.029
It's a much more subtle way of doing it. You're finding deviations from what the standard model would say and and and

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.440
Nature is can be like this it can it can hide

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:44.140
These new ingredients that make it very difficult to find and if we don't build something, we're not going to find them this way

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.040
Ed, I know it takes a lot of time to build these things,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.140
but still, wouldn't it make more sense to wait for the next really paradigm

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.340
I think Sabine's got a very valid point here, but you know

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.080
But but the question also is at what stage?

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.610
In that process do you say AHA now it's time to build my new

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.630
You know

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.630
future circular collider

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.480
Because there is kind of two two aspects to it one. Is that the technology involved in the under theorist?

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:26.830
What do I know but I believe the technology involved in this is really complicated. Okay, you you they're always at the cutting edge

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.120
developing things

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.900
so what the LHC can do right today the back in the

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.230
1980s people no idea they'd be able to do it at the level that they can do it because

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.669
Technology is developed

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.749
one of the reasons they've been able to do it is that there was always a funding stream to help support the

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.619
superconducting magnets to help support the development of the

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.350
Accelerator technology the detector technology if you put that on hold right and said, okay

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.949
Let's just let the theories have a go now for a while until we come up with something

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.890
What are these people going to do? They're not going to hang around. They're not going to play say yeah, this is okay

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.100
Let's just there is take about five years. Let's go and do something else

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:09.109
They're going to leave and the subject and the runs the real risk. It is an expensive city

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.669
It's like Apollo they will leave and that's it. It'll be the end of it

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:19.400
And and okay, if you if you prepared to accept that so be it that that's the nature of it

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.500
there is one possible route through I

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.079
And I think Cerner are playing this

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.710
They're playing for two possible scenarios here

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:33.530
There's another one, which is that although they've come out with this future Collider circular Collider paper

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.749
And I personally think it's really exciting

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:42.500
they've also is sort of at the same time come up with it with another set of papers where they're looking at actually what it

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:49.580
Can we make use of what's around CERN at the moment to actually probe different types of physics, which would still be

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.280
looking at underlying fundamental physics of our universe but not

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.020
Requiring, you know?

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:03.499
Really high energy particle collisions? And this is motivated partly by the fact that we've not seen any evidence of dark matter

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.520
we've not seen these massive doubt matter particles and maybe

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.340
What what is actually going on in the universe?

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.259
these equivalent dark matter particles aren't very massive, they're maybe really light and

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:21.500
They don't interact very much with us in which cases having a big heavy Large

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.870
Hadron light Collider won't be the way to see them. We need more sophisticated

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.000
Ready-made

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.210
precisely-made detectors to pick up some of these lights particles like axions

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:41.509
specific axion detectors and so one possibility is to actually look at and for a set of

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.450
experiments

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.859
That could be based around CERN using the the accelerators

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:56.240
They've already gots and using some of the facilities they've already got so just bout better experiments under the existing ring

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.880
They use it. Yes, so they use up I'd bolts is a

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.820
thinking of it and

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.830
gently place

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.319
existing expect, you know, you use what you've got and then

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.730
lots of us

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:14.480
Go that was so exciting. And and of course you're building new things as well, but that's well. That's that's another possible and

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So why ever said that I could imagine?

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.550
the community saying

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.030
Okay

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.259
Let's have this period where we go that route for a little while

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.239
Let's keep the R&amp;D going for the for the big accelerators

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:36.949
But during that period we can be probing testing these these models of weak coupling regimes like dark matter particles

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.600
screening mechanisms, which could account for you know the fifth force that

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.720
Could be driving the accelerating universe

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.119
But meanwhile carry on with its R&amp;D invest in the R&amp;D for the future accelerators

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.900
And then hopefully some results will come out of these

00:11:54.150 --> 00:12:01.129
New set of proposals or some theoretical developments will emerge which say yeah. This is the way we should be going and

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.230
Then you can sort of decide

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.710
Ok

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:10.280
Now we'll start the process on but there is always this risk back in the 80s people were absolutely certain

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.720
I think a pretty certain about that not absolutely but fairly certain that

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.040
WIMPs were the way forward and that supersymmetry was the way forward

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:24.499
There was no question to build the Large Hadron Collider after the large electron positron Collider

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.850
It was it was just the thing to do and it turned out not to be right

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.420
It's er it who knows? That's the

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:38.280
Excitement's of many ways of working in these kind of fields. What would you do, Ed? Because obviously you're biased

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.100
yeah, but you do live in a world where you are also like, hospitals and

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.700
potholes to be built, and your children are going out to the world that need infrastructure

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.040
How do you think the money should be spent so it's a lot of money and

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.209
I would spend it and I

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.820
because for a number of reasons one is

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:04.729
You know, it's not just the UK contributing to CERN. CERN has got 22 members

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:11.180
It's got I don't know eight affiliated members, you know, there's 30 countries here will all contribute

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:19.339
They'll contribute over many many years. Okay, it's not as if this is an immediate out-lay, so there's a

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.120
dispersion of the actual finance.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:30.080
Of course hospitals need all the facilities they can but, you know particle physics live in hospitals

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.360
right

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:36.720
my you know my dear father who passed away when I went to the city hospital for him to have Radiology treatment.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:42.820
On the wall, is this amazing plaque, I've tried to find an image of it that talks about the cyclotron

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.660
accelerator that they were using and

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:53.149
The and that's that was the particle physics of the forties thirties forties fifties that is now in medicine the MRI scanner that was invented

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.400
here at, here at Nottingham

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.380
Uses technology from the physics environment where there was

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:06.680
purely for research that is now been bedded in in hospitals all around the world medicine needs

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.320
Funding in its own, right?

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.969
Of course it does but it's had so much input from fundamental

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.050
ideas fundamental physics ideas for a start and chemistry and

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:24.409
radioisotopes that everywhere in medicine that to simply

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.180
Simply say yeah

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.239
we should be putting all of this into medicine for example is

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:33.950
Not the way to make the major breakthroughs that will help people in the future in medicine either

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:40.940
What makes us special what makes us special is our inquisitive nature. We want to know about the universe. We want to know about beautiful

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.880
pictures and admire them we want to know about what makes the universe tick.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.660
And we should have the facilities to be able to invest in all of these
