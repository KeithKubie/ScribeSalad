rise and that basis it's a tie the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
rise and that basis it's a tie the
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.230
rise and that basis it's a tie the
oyster reef cost about the same amount

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
oyster reef cost about the same amount
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330

of money 1 million dollars per mile
again it's a tie but after that the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
again it's a tie but after that the
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.100
again it's a tie but after that the
oyster reef wins by a mile

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110

it will decline in value through wear

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
it will decline in value through wear
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.609
it will decline in value through wear
and tear the oyster reef if we take care

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
and tear the oyster reef if we take care
 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.770
and tear the oyster reef if we take care
of it will more than hold its value it

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
of it will more than hold its value it
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.039
of it will more than hold its value it
might even appreciate in value over time

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049
might even appreciate in value over time
 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.240
