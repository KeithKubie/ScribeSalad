00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:25.490
Myth: The Great Chicago 
Fire was started by 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:37.580
a cow.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:44.722
A 
popular story often told about how of the

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:50.070
Great Chicago Fire started is that a cow owned
by Kate O’Leary kicked a lit lantern over

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.400
and that started the flames.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.030
It may come as a disappoint to some to learn
that the cow story isn’t true—the man

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.730
who wrote the O’Leary story for the Chicago
Republican, Michael Ahern, later admitted

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.470
that he had made the cow angle up in order
to create a more interesting tale.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.140
But the fire certainly did start in the vicinity
of a barn owned by the O’Learys.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.900
However, the exact cause of the fire was never
determined, though Catherine O’Leary was

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.870
used as a scapegoat of sorts.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.790
O’Leary was an Irish Catholic immigrant—despised
by many people at the time—so she made an

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.030
easy target.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.870
In addition to Ahern’s retraction of his
cow story, the O’Learys claimed to have

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.690
been asleep by the time the fire started,
so there would have been no lantern in the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.190
barn for a cow to kick.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.800
There has been a lot of speculation about
the cause of the fire, but, as stated, little

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.140
is known for certain.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.870
One of the other popular theories that is
also likely false is that the fire was caused

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.890
by a meteor shower- specifically, the theory
goes that it was caused by fragments from

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.860
the broken up Beila’s Comet.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.990
(Incidentally, about a year later, on November
27, 1872, fragments from Beila’s Comet resulted

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.810
in a meteor shower that had an astounding
3,000 meteors per hour visible!)

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.490
Three other large fires started around Lake
Michigan on the same day, which some people

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.830
argue is too much of a coincidence not to
have a common cause.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.099
However, meteorites that actually make it
to the ground are usually cool when they hit

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.590
and thus generally don’t start fires.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.319
Further, given the prevalence of flames at
night and the extremely dry and windy conditions

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.930
at the time, it’s thought by most historians
that the other fires were merely coincidence

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.109
and not from a common source like a meteor
shower.

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.631
Despite not knowing the exact cause of the
Chicago fire, it is easy to see just how the

00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:31.769
fire spread once it started.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.439
Chicago in 1871 was not made up of skyscrapers-and-concrete.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.310
Around two-thirds of the buildings in Chicago
were made of wood at the time.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.139
Most of the buildings had tar or shingle roofs,
which would only serve to feed the flames.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.659
The roads and sidewalks were also made from
wood products.

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.319
The conditions were dry, with a drought plaguing
the city not long before the fire started—that

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.279
summer, they received only about a quarter
of their average rainfall.

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.829
And let’s not forget Chicago’s nickname:
it isn’t called “the Windy City” for

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:01.829
nothing.

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.010
At the time, it’s believed that a strong
south-westerly wind blew hot embers from the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.519
fire toward the heart of the city, landing
on the highly flammable roofs and starting

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.319
up additional fires.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.359
Another big issue was that the people did
not act quickly enough.

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.779
The fire department was alerted to the growing
problem around forty minutes after the fire

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:22.010
started, after an alarm was sounded in a pharmacy.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.580
The fire finally went out when the winds died
down and a light drizzle helped the fire fighters

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.900
with their efforts.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.420
Only three large buildings in the affected
area survived enough to be repaired: the Chicago

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.879
Water Tower, St. Michael’s Church, and the
Chicago Avenue Pumping Station.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.510
The latter two only had their exterior walls
to rebuild from, as their insides were eaten

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.370
away by the fire.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.650
In the aftermath, Chicago received donations
of money, food, clothing, and other supplies

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.819
from cities across the United States to help
them rebuild.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.629
Surprisingly, much of Chicago’s infrastructure—such
as mass transportation—remained intact.

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.480
The fire had destroyed nearly 73 miles of
road, but it hadn’t touched the harbors.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.709
Railroad tracks were also largely undamaged,
which allowed so many of the donated goods

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.129
to pour in.

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.739
After the fire, legislation was passed requiring
buildings to be constructed from brick, stone,

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.709
and other mostly fireproof materials.

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.329
It wasn’t fully effective because the poorer
residents couldn’t afford the materials

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.010
or the skilled labourers required to rebuild.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.530
In addition, some businesses simply ignored
the laws to save money.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.949
Ironically, it was Chicago’s fiery destruction
which led to it becoming one of the United

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.569
States’ most important economic cities,
as well as one of the most populous.

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.490
The rebuilding effort required an army of
people to be hired as labourers, which boosted

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.750
both the economy and population of the city.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.050
At the time of the fire in 1871, Chicago boasted
about 300,000 residents.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.650
By 1890, Chicago was home to over a million
people, making it second in population only

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.449
to New York City.

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.580
Bonus Facts:
• Funny enough, the winds changed in time

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.349
to save the O’Learys’ house.

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.900
Their barn went up in flames, but their house
wasn’t touched by the fire.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.220
• A new Chicago Fire Academy was built in
1956 on the site of the O’Learys’ burnt-down

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.220
barn.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.779
It is still in operation today.

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:13.979
• In contrast to the Chicago fire actually
helping Chicago become one of the major cities

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.500
in the United States, the 1906 San Francisco
earthquake that resulted in about 80% of the

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.850
city destroyed ended up ending San Francisco’s
reign as the dominate city in California,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.800
with a large percentage of the residents moving
to Los Angeles.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.090
• A large amount of timber used to rebuild
Chicago came from Singapore, Michigan, and

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.110
led to extreme deforestation.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.290
Without the trees to protect the town from
the elements, sand blew in from Lake Michigan’s

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.270
shoreline and eroded the town in just four
years.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.570
It is still one of Michigan’s ghost towns
and lies beneath the sand dunes on the shore

00:05:47.570 --> 00:06:00.860
of the lake.
