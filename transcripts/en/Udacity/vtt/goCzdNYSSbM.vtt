00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.485
So, for any given function when we're considering x to be the input and y to be

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.958
the output, there's never going to be more than one value of y for any value of

00:00:08.958 --> 00:00:12.514
x that we look at. Now, since I told you that these were some examples of

00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:15.930
functions, why don't we take a look at each of them and see how this concept

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.434
applies. So first, you have the line y equals negative 2x plus 5, which I've

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:24.330
drawn for you down here. And we can see that as we move across the horizontal

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.173
axis, we're never going to be able to move up to more than one y value or down

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:32.479
depending on your position. Now, for this parabola. Once again, even though this

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.575
isn't a straight line, if we move horizontally across the graph, we'll never

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:41.880
encounter more than one vertical coordinate for a given horizontal coordinate. Y

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.145
equals negative 5 is just a horizontal line. And we can see, once again, the

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:47.779
same concept applying.
