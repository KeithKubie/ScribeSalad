00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.750
So the idea behind the example
we've seen so far,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.950
has been that basically we're
interested in controlling illumination.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.280
We can control illumination
with a camera, and

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.240
that will allow us to extract various
types of information from a scene.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.960
So, given a control lights, we can
basically scan or re-light a scene.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.190
Scan to extract 3D information,
re-light to be able to then be able

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.470
to generate novel images with
different lighting conditions.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.800
So, one big question now comes up is,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.350
how can we actually do much more
elaborate computer control of light?

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.140
In the previous example, we basically
showed how we can use an iPhone display

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.160
itself to light a scene or how we can
use LEDs which are computer controlled.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.870
But now we want to actually be able to
do much finer control of the light.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.000
Well, that's where projectors come in,
because projectors can be thought of.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.710
And these days, with projectors
with micrometer devices and

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.890
stuff like that, and the high intensity
light that they actually can generate,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.560
can be used as really detailed types
of controllable light sources.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.650
Let's see how we can use them.
