[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.648
SPEAKER: Please join me in
welcoming Rob Ritchie and Krist

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:09.148
Novocelic.

00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:10.104
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:11.229
KRIST NOVOCELIC: Thank you.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.900
How did I get involved in
election reform coming out

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.890
of the music industry
and music scene?

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.770
And it was through music.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.290
I got politically involved
in Washington state.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.850
Bands like Pearl Jam, Nirvana,
Alice in Chains, Soundgarden

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.370
were just taking the world
by storm in 1992, 1991.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.640
And at the same time, the
Washington state legislature

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.130
had this censorship bill.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.550
It was really bad.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.540
And the city of Seattle had
this teen dance ordinance.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.140
So if you were an adult
between the ages of 18 and 20,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.160
you couldn't go see Mudhoney
play the Central Tavern because

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.740
of the rules.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.180
And so Seattle music was being
celebrated internationally.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.140
But here in our own backyard,
we were getting repressed.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.730
And so I got involved with other
people in the music community.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.690
And we were proactive about,
hey, this is a good thing,

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.510
and you should really
foster and encourage it.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.520
And we started to turn
things around where

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.730
music's now celebrated in
Seattle and Washington state.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.850
But it wasn't easy.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.270
One of the things,
personally, was, that's

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.546
how I got my civic education.

00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:32.670
Like, how does a bill work?

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.794
You know "I'm Just a Bill."

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:36.290
Remember the little
cartoon or whatever, which

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.470
has a cool bass line on it.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.510
And not just civics,
but the whole process--

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.660
like, all right, the
bill, and you're a law.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.500
But there's all these interests
that work legislation--

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.650
the music community,
beer distributors, fans,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.710
record stores, and
people coming together

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.600
and just engaging the system.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.020
And there was a
lot of enthusiasm.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.735
Like, hey, we're going
to have a concert.

00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:06.860
Are you going to come down?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.550
Absolutely.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.229
I want to be part
of the concert,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.980
because it's an event
for our political goals--

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.001
like a benefit concert.

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.250
And then, are you going to
come to the public hearing?

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.610
Yeah.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.610
We're going to be there.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.297
We're going to testify
for better laws.

00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:20.630
And then, are you going to vote?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.740
It's like, no, not really.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.510
Like, why not?

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.093
And it's just like,
well, I just don't

00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:26.150
feel like my vote matters.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.880
And part of that
education was really,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.440
like, it kind of doesn't
really matter, does it?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.110
Because we have this
representative here in Seattle.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.530
She's great.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.634
But if there's, like,
100% turnout for her,

00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:39.550
does it really matter?

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.140
Because she's going
to win anyway.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.612
And then this other person who's
against us, he's really bad,

00:02:45.612 --> 00:02:46.570
and he's out to get us.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.230
But he's in a safe seat, Krist.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.355
I don't think you can really
do anything about him.

00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:53.104
It's like, really?

00:02:53.104 --> 00:02:54.244
What do you mean safe seat?

00:02:54.244 --> 00:02:56.160
Well, this is how it
works, and this and that.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.285
Jesus, there's got to be
a better system than that.

00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:00.070
It's, yeah, well, you know.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.790
So at the time--

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.730
this was about 1995--

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.790
I'm on the internet.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.110
I think I had 110 version--

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.010
two 56Ks they put together--

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.020
ISDN line or something
like that it was called.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.040
Do you remember that?

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.690
Anyway, so I was faster than
all my neighbors and anything.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.210
And I was on a search
engine called AltaVista.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.820
And then I'd plug in keywords--

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.400
election reform, voting
reform, elections,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.294
voting in the United States.

00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:28.710
And this one group
would come up--

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.800
FairVote, FairVote,
FairVote, the Center

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.390
for Voting and Democracy.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.730
I'm like, well,
that's interesting.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.430
And who's their chairman?

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.415
John B. Anderson.

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:39.230
Oh, I remember him.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.950
He ran for president in
1980 as an independent.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.520
And he had this iconic campaign.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.190
He was running neck and
neck with the Democrat

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.360
and Republicans that summer
in 1980 in the campaign.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.200
It was really disruptive.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.090
He went-- what's the
word I'm looking for--

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.590
viral.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.550
He went viral.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.930
He caught all this imagination.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.540
ROB RITCHIE: "Doonesbury."

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.415
KRIST NOVOCELIC: What's that?

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:02.060
ROB RITCHIE:
"Doonesbury" liked him.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.770
KRIST NOVOCELIC:
"Doonesbury" liked him.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.060
So it's just like,
well, he's independent.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.000
Well, I come from the
independent music scene.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.200
So then FairVote has these,
what is ranked choice voting?

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.900
You know, in instant
runoff voting,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.590
you rank these candidates--

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.230
proportional representation
for the United States.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.445
We can do that in America?

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.380
They call it the
alternative vote,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.464
this ranked choice voting.

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:27.963
I'm like, oh, well, alternative
music is what I come out of.

00:04:27.963 --> 00:04:29.700
So it was all kind
of interesting.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.910
And so I looked into it
and I became fascinated.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.380
Because it just seemed
so cutting edge and so

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.100
transformative.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.100
And with Nirvana and the music
scene that we came out of,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.890
it seemed like most rock music
was really lame in the 1980s--

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.660
this kind of predictable
'70s rehash into the '80s.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.390
And so we came out of this
music scene that kind of

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.656
revolutionized the whole thing.

00:05:01.656 --> 00:05:03.530
And so there was this
whole new wave of music

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.420
that came in-- grunge rock,
alternative, or whatever.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.637
And so it seemed like
the same sensibility.

00:05:08.637 --> 00:05:10.970
Well, how do we do with our
elections and voting-- like,

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.530
maybe we can have this new kind
of wave of democracy take over?

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.350
And again, doing
those word searches--

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.290
it was just like, well, we have
proportional representation

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.161
in the United States?

00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:23.660
Wow.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.830
Isn't that like how
they vote in Europe?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.600
And it's like, no.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.806
It's kind of like it.

00:05:30.806 --> 00:05:32.180
Because it's not
winner-take-all.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.350
It's not where you have one
district where everybody votes

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.900
and whoever gets the
most votes represents

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.210
100% of the district.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.260
With proportional
representation,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.950
you have multi winners.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.240
And it's not a
winner-take-all system.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.320
So you can have, say, a
district with three people

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.650
who represent everybody.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.580
So it's like a slice of a pie.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.950
Everybody gets their share
of the vote-- like one third,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.840
one third, one third.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.150
But in Europe-- wow.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.010
In Europe, they
vote for parties.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.530
They don't even vote for people.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.830
Is that really a good idea?

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.390
Maybe.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.350
I don't know.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.110
In Europe, it
takes, like, 2%, 3%,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.130
4% of the vote to get elected.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.130
I don't know if that
would be very popular here

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.090
in the United States.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.370
So looking into the
FairVote website,

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.180
reading scholarly
papers, and it's

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.380
like, there's American versions
of proportional representation.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.990
So they're candidate-based.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.180
So you vote for the person.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.490
You don't vote for a party.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.105
The thresholds to get
elected are a lot higher.

00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:41.700
And there's versions that are
used to this day in the United

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.630
States.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.090
100 municipalities
in the United States

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.200
use some version of
proportional representation.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.690
And it could take 33% of
the vote to get elected,

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.150
or 25%, or 20%, or 15%.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.934
But it's a lot higher
than, say, in Israel.

00:07:02.934 --> 00:07:04.350
They just raised
it up to-- what--

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.650
3 and 1/2%, 4%,
something like that.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.290
So there's these
American versions

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.690
of proportional representation.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.230
And I thought that would
be very transformative.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:22.050
Like, wow, you feel like
your vote would matter.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.420
You could be you could be,
like, a Democrat in a rural area

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.360
and you could actually vote
for and elect somebody.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.580
I'm an Independent, by the way.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.030
But where I live, Democrats,
they pull in about 43%

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.240
of the vote on the coast
of Washington state.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.330
And they elect nobody.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.420
And then the Republican, she
wins every couple of years

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.140
automatically.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.070
And then the Democrats
don't put any money--

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.391
the Democratic leader
here in San Francisco,

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:57.390
she doesn't put any of
those millions of dollars

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.074
that they collect selling
access to the Congress--

00:08:01.074 --> 00:08:03.240
they don't put any money--
they just wrote that off.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.840
Those Democrats
are orphan voters.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:13.497
But then on the other hand,
you have Democrats in Seattle.

00:08:13.497 --> 00:08:14.580
And it was the same thing.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.030
It's just like,
if you have 100%--

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.500
they have, like, 70%
turnout for Democrats there.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.820
And there's all
these surplus votes.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.280
And it doesn't really add up.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.720
And then there's
Republicans in Seattle.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.840
They get nothing.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.540
But we're all taxpayers.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.020
We're all subject to the
rules and laws of the land.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.960
And so somehow, there's
this current system--

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.409
this winner-take-all system
with single-member districts.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.870
It decides who the
winners and losers are.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:49.070
We have an
independent commission

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.227
to draw districts
in Washington state.

00:08:51.227 --> 00:08:53.810
And it's just like they decide
who the winners and losers are.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.476
It's not even an
independent commission.

00:08:55.476 --> 00:08:57.890
It's a bipartisan commission,
where they the Democrats

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.832
and Republicans
collude, and they say,

00:08:59.832 --> 00:09:01.790
you're going to be the
winner, and you're going

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.560
to be the loser to the voters.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.130
In California, you
have a commission now.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.680
The first time you
used it was in 2011.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.260
And that was way better--

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.720
way better-- than
what you had before.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.225
But then wasn't a DOS
system better than--

00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:21.170
I don't know.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.440
What was before
that-- punch cards?

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.010
You know what I mean?

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.100
You following me?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.270
So there's this commission--

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.340
like, you've got an
independent commission.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.740
We took it out of the
hands of politicians,

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.830
and we gave the
choice for voters to--

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.070
the commission decides
who wins and who loses.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:45.650
So proportional representation
is, we decide who votes.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.710
So that's how I got--

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.110
I just felt it's just
a way better system.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.690
And so people aren't
really like plugged into--

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.240
I guess it's really
new to a lot of people.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.560
But I got involved
with FairVote.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.780
And so we work a lot with
the Voting Rights Act.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.470
And here in Santa
Clara, there's going

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:10.970
to be an initiative
on the ballot

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.010
to change to proportional
representation

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.830
as a remedy to the
Voting Rights Act.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:20.120
And a lot of people will
assume that the Voting Rights

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.750
Act doesn't say anything about
having these this district

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.130
elections as being the remedy.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.740
And actually, that's
where you find

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.980
proportional representation
in the case law in the United

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.210
States.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.880
It's coming out of
the Voting Rights Act.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.370
Because it gives
minorities a voice.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.720
So it facilitates
minority representation.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.830
It's just that simple.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.550
So if you're a
political minority--

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.120
say, a Republican in
this Democratic town--

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.000
you could possibly elect
somebody on your council.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.160
You're a racial minority.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.040
Absolutely you can
elect somebody,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.860
if the people of that race
are like-minded enough

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.510
to elect somebody.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.680
But it doesn't assume that.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.080
When you put districts together
with the district elections,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.180
that assumes that people
are going to be like,

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.430
well, you're Latino and
you're going to vote Democrat,

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.805
or you're black,
and you're going

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.870
to vote Democrat, which is fine.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.140
But the proportional
representation

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.600
doesn't necessarily
make that assumption.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.430
It lets the voters decide.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.210
And so that's basically
my stake in this,

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.150
and why I'm such a
forceful advocate for it.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.550
Because we're taxpayers.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.180
We're subject to the rules
and the laws of the land.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.440
And we should
decide who we elect.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.200
Instead, we have
political insiders--

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.590
the same people who sell
access to Sacramento or Olympia

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.500
or Salem or whatever
the statehouse,

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.625
or the US Congress--

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.920
today's boss-- those are the
people who are also making

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.160
decisions on the
most fundamental part

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.090
of our democracy--

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:19.010
the interface between the
citizen and government.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.830
And they're saying,
here is this system.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.580
It's the winner-take-all,
single-member system.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.330
And this is how it works.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.740
We draw these districts,
and then you vote.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.715
And then we make sure that this
district is safe for Democrats.

00:12:33.715 --> 00:12:35.090
We make sure that
this district's

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.550
safe for Republicans.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.610
And maybe there's a few
toss-up districts in between.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:43.130
And I think we can do a lot
better than that, especially

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.210
in the 21st century.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.210
Everybody's really concerned
about gerrymandering.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.340
And if you want a solution
for gerrymandering,

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:57.550
absolutely, let's have
independent commissions.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.400
But that's just
part of the deal.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.220
Voters need to have
a say, ultimately,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.950
on who represents us.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.500
And that's what proportional
representation is.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.810
There are American
versions of it.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.570
They're constitutionally
protected.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.000
They've been scrutinized
by the courts.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.570
And they're in use
in the United States.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.470
It's that simple.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.760
How am I on time here?

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.290
12:20.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.214
So I guess we can move on.

00:13:26.214 --> 00:13:26.880
ROB RITCHIE: OK.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.380
KRIST NOVOCELIC: And then we'll
do the Q&amp;A so you can really

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.902
kind of give it to me.

00:13:30.902 --> 00:13:31.860
ROB RITCHIE: All right.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.440
Hey, thanks, Krist.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.565
KRIST NOVOCELIC: Thank you.

00:13:33.565 --> 00:13:36.568
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.350
ROB RITCHIE: So,
great to be here.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.259
Thanks, Martin,
wherever you are.

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:44.050
Oh, there you are--

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.190
Marcus-- right next to me-- and
the Bright Spots collection,

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.250
which has been exciting for us.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.890
I have been doing
this for a long time.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.930
Every year, I think
progress has been

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.240
made in a way that felt
good in our year-end letter

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.050
to supporters.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.130
But certainly, in the
last few few years,

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.920
things took off in a
certain kind of way.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.720
We got a big statewide
win that I'll talk about

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.870
for ranked choice voting.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:12.684
We quintupled our members
in the last 18 months.

00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:15.100
And we've got people like from
the Bright Spots collective

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.460
and others--

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.154
Bain Capital-- a collection of
people and some lawyers saying,

00:14:18.154 --> 00:14:18.820
how can we help?

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.340
And people are trying
to do things, too.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.670
And it's a climate which I think
speaks to some kind of people's

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.160
concerns about the
specific outcome of 2016

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.020
and how it happened,
but, I think, also,

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.650
just this climate of feeling
that our democracy is really

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.110
in a state of crisis.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.224
Stepping back from
the point about how

00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:41.140
we can change our systems
from winner-take-all

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.050
to a proportional
system, we need to.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.610
We're in a sort
of state of crisis

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.930
that I think is in a cycle
that isn't going to get better

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:50.990
without intervention.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.459
And that's why I said
we want to walk through,

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.750
and then why we think ranked
choice voting specifically

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.910
is a wedge into that--

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.910
not the only one.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.370
There's a lot of
other great work

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.786
being done-- but
one that we think

00:15:01.786 --> 00:15:05.030
is fundamentally important.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.270
So getting back to
first principles,

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.680
the vote is this quietly
radical concept, right?

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.040
It hasn't been part
of human history.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.400
I mean, I'm sure people voted
in certain family groups

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:15.940
and so on.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.280
But deciding the
consent of the governed

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.660
and letting people
cast an equal vote

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.610
based on just being
a human being,

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.830
it's a pretty radical concept.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.020
And of course,
because of that has

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.630
been people who are
worried about it,

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.080
and those who are in power not
necessarily embracing the power

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.230
that, essentially, they're
turning over to people.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.470
And some of the rules that
have developed over time

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.020
have been quite intentionally
kind of crafted in ways

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.280
that I think minimize
or miniaturize

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.630
the power of our vote.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:53.380
Some are just that, when we
started voting, the technology

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.279
and the understanding of what
options we had was different.

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:57.820
And a country like
the United States,

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.370
which has been
around for a while,

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.870
wasn't aware of
some of the options.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.578
And Krist talked about
some of these uses

00:16:03.578 --> 00:16:06.030
of proportional systems
down at the local level.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.130
But higher up, we've
settled into kind

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.910
of institutional inertia
and a false belief

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.860
that it's always been that
way, or it has to be that way,

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.150
or that James Madison wrote in
stone that, thou shalt do it

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.230
this way, which is
actually not true at all.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.540
The US Constitution is a
blank slate about voting.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.300
And it's actually
something that we

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:33.520
are designed to really be doing
creative and innovative things

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.570
in states and having it go up.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:41.780
And yet, we get this sort
of stalled political class

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.650
that, in fact, has an interest
in keeping it the way it is.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.330
People don't know
much about options.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.520
They're sort of distracted
by other things.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.040
And we muddle along.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.756
And the US economy
works and things.

00:16:52.756 --> 00:16:54.130
But at a certain
point, actually,

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.640
the policymakers really matter,
and government really matters.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.480
And right now, it's in a
mode of deep challenges.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.980
And I think this work is
monumentally important.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.619
Two ways that the vote
is sort of transparently

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:11.920
restricted in ways that we're
going to get into today--

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.290
one is we get to
indicate one preference.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.099
Most of our elections, you get
to just vote for one person,

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.099
right?

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:21.359
That's it.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.790
And so if you have
two choices, and you

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.910
get to vote for one of
them, you have magnificently

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.160
indicated a preference
that sort of fully says,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.200
I like this person more
than the other person.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.658
And you add up the votes, and
one person gets more of them,

00:17:33.658 --> 00:17:35.520
and then you have a
winner, unless you're

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.590
using the electoral college.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.175
But if you have more
than two people,

00:17:41.175 --> 00:17:43.300
you're only voting for one,
and you've said nothing

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.450
about the other two.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.900
If you have five
people, you vote for one

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.820
and you're not saying
about the other four.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.530
You're starting to
actually not allow

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.120
people to indicate
preferences that,

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.250
in fact, might be quite
significant and important

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.540
to know.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.590
And we can.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.770
It's just a simple
matter of asking voters

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.130
to reveal opinions they have,
and then using that information

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.030
to actually get better outcomes.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.461
And that's really the idea
of ranked choice voting.

00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:09.960
And we'll get into
that in a moment.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.002
And then the second
major restriction

00:18:14.002 --> 00:18:15.460
is one that Krist
was getting into,

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:20.470
which is that we are accepting
this sort of geographic tyranny

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.270
that where you live determines
your representation,

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.410
and everyone who lives
in a particular place

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.630
should have one
representative, even if they

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:29.810
have very different views.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.050
And we don't really organize
ourselves necessarily

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.750
by geography in the way we
think and the way we certainly

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.000
think about politics
and the way we

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.280
might want to organize ourselves
and put forth a representative.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.440
But we have one person per area.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.430
And that's a major restriction
that, as Krist was saying,

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.900
51% represents 100%.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.160
And imagine an
economic environment

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.050
where the only way
you can make money

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.600
is if you're the actual biggest,
and if you have a new idea,

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.154
you don't get any reward
for it until you're actually

00:19:01.154 --> 00:19:02.320
the biggest in the industry.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.080
That would be sort of
stifling for what's possible.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.600
And that's the restriction
of the single-member district

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.100
system.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.064
Neither of these are
in the Constitution.

00:19:11.064 --> 00:19:12.230
All of these can be changed.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:13.688
And all of them
actually have a lot

00:19:13.688 --> 00:19:16.100
of history of being worked on.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.940
So for expanding
preferences, the model

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.490
that we've settled on--

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.670
and I think for good reason--
is ranked choice voting.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.337
When we talked at the
start, some people

00:19:26.337 --> 00:19:27.753
seemed to know
something about it.

00:19:27.753 --> 00:19:29.890
But who knows something
about instant runoff voting

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.960
and ranked choice voting--
just a show of hands.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.350
So in this system, rather
than just vote for one person,

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.750
if you've got this
multi-candidate situation,

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.616
you get to say, oh,
here's my first choice.

00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:45.240
But OK, there's these
other candidates.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.060
Here's my second choice.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.430
And here's my third choice.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.160
Santa Fe, New Mexico, just used
ranked choice voting for mayor

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.080
for the first time on Tuesday.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.300
They had five candidates run.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:01.280
And they had this very sort of
respectful, substantive, civil

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.390
campaign.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.280
Voters went in and,
overwhelmingly,

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.080
ranked a lot of the candidates--

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.154
first choice, second
choice, third choice.

00:20:08.154 --> 00:20:10.070
And the reason that they
had gotten interested

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.320
in this system is, they'd
had a whole string of mayors

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.349
who didn't win more
than half of the votes.

00:20:14.349 --> 00:20:15.890
So when you have
multiple candidates,

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:20.270
when you add up all the votes,
someone might have 39% or 32%

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.870
or whatever it might be.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.150
And there's a belief--

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.390
and rightly so-- that the
person who's winning just

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.790
happens to be at the top
of the heap, but, in fact,

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.362
could lose one-on-one to
someone else, and, in fact,

00:20:31.362 --> 00:20:33.320
isn't the one who really
would have won if only

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.330
those two people had run.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.550
So the idea of a
ranked choice system

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.910
is to use that added
information to determine

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.430
who is really the most
representative candidate.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.880
And we see this work a lot.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.400
Like the Oscars just
picks Best Picture

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.030
with ranked choice voting.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.215
The biggest conservative
party in Canada

00:20:55.215 --> 00:20:56.840
is using ranked choice
voting right now

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.140
to pick their leader in
the most populous province.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.260
And they did it last
year nationally.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.720
Same in the country of
New Zealand last week.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.070
We're seeing a lot of
uses of this system.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.082
It sort of works.

00:21:11.082 --> 00:21:12.290
And it works psychologically.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.670
Because, one, people
often have preferences.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.222
If you go into an ice cream
store and you want chocolate

00:21:17.222 --> 00:21:18.680
and they don't have
it, you usually

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.764
know what else to ask for.

00:21:19.764 --> 00:21:21.846
And then you get it and
you can feel someone happy

00:21:21.846 --> 00:21:23.600
even though you don't
get your chocolate.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:23.860
KRIST NOVOCELIC: Strawberry.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.620
ROB RITCHIE: Strawberry?

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.350
Vanilla bean.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:33.849
And the logic of the
system kind of makes sense.

00:21:33.849 --> 00:21:35.390
So you just drop
the last person out.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.770
So you add up all
those first choices.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.550
And if you've got someone who
has a majority in this system,

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:41.270
you're done.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.740
Because you're just trying
to get a majority winner,

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.060
which is more than half.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.265
If you don't, the candidate
in last place loses.

00:21:46.265 --> 00:21:48.484
You look at their ballots.

00:21:48.484 --> 00:21:50.150
Those people have
indicated preferences.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.540
You add them to each
voter's next choice.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.100
You see if you get
a majority winner.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.891
You keep going until you
get a majority winner.

00:21:57.891 --> 00:22:00.140
It makes sense in a lot of
the elections that we have.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.180
So the 2016 presidential race--

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.380
the general election had two
major candidates, but then

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.854
some interesting
other candidates.

00:22:07.854 --> 00:22:09.770
Like Gary Johnson was
the Libertarian nominee.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.080
Jill Stein was the
Green Party nominee.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.850
There were some
other people as well.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.920
And actually, most of
the big swing states

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.730
were not one with a majority,
like Michigan and Wisconsin

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:20.540
and so on.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.457
And so in those states,
if we'd had this system,

00:22:23.457 --> 00:22:25.040
we'd have said, OK,
it's not over yet,

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.124
because the people who
voted for Stein and Johnson

00:22:27.124 --> 00:22:29.498
and others could have indicated
a second or third choice.

00:22:29.498 --> 00:22:31.250
And you look at those
ballots and then you

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.212
add them to whoever
is next, and you

00:22:33.212 --> 00:22:34.420
would have an instant runoff.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.530
You would have had this
head-to-head comparison.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.100
And this whole
poisonous climate of,

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.890
oh, why are these third
parties running, goes away.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:49.230
And you actually might get
a more legitimate outcome

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.802
that people can
say is acceptable.

00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:51.510
It's interesting.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.640
There's been a lot of talk
about the Russian hacking that

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.140
happened.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.307
And yeah, we're hearing a
lot about that, obviously.

00:22:57.307 --> 00:22:58.723
It doesn't seem
like they actually

00:22:58.723 --> 00:22:59.830
hacked into any machines.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.040
But they hacked our
plurality system.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.592
We absolutely know
they did that,

00:23:03.592 --> 00:23:05.550
because they did all
these sort of Facebook ads

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:09.180
to promote third party
candidates and try to disrupt.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.420
Our system is vulnerable to
a certain kind of activity

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.040
because it's not a
very good system,

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.430
so that they could drive
certain people to vote

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.630
for a minor party candidate.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.734
They knew that that wouldn't
help the minor party

00:23:20.734 --> 00:23:22.650
candidate win, and it
might change the outcome

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.754
of a major party race.

00:23:23.754 --> 00:23:25.170
ranked choice
voting would kind of

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.060
deal with at least
that kind of hacking.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.460
But it does a lot
more to it as well.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.810
So back in Santa Fe, it's
sort of interesting history

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.825
of a city that has a
lot of local politics

00:23:37.825 --> 00:23:39.450
that get pretty
negative and poisonous.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.241
And it's got kind of
an interesting angle--

00:23:41.241 --> 00:23:45.940
a white divide and longer-term
Santa Feans and newcomers.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.750
And there's some
tensions and things.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.390
This was a fascinating campaign
for all the people you talk to.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.910
They had the most
debates they'd ever had,

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.340
and respectful, civil debates.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.340
So why might that be?

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:01.490
If you sort of think about the
system, if I'm trying to win,

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.990
and I'm pretty darn sure I'm
not going to get more than half

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.390
of first choices,
I know I'm going

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.640
to need to be some
people's second choices--

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.964
the backers of other people.

00:24:09.964 --> 00:24:10.880
That means two things.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.350
I need to learn about
what other candidates are

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:17.879
saying to kind of understand how
I can appeal to their voters.

00:24:17.879 --> 00:24:19.670
And I just am going to
talk to more people.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.378
I mean, the thing you
hear over and over,

00:24:21.378 --> 00:24:23.239
particularly at that
level, is, you're

00:24:23.239 --> 00:24:25.030
walking through a
neighborhood, and there's

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.620
a yard sign for someone else.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.640
And in the old system,
you walk by it and say,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.830
I'm not going to
waste my time there.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.090
With ranked choice voting, you
go in and you have a dialogue,

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.370
and you hope to be
their second choice.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:33.880
And who knows?

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.754
You might persuade them
to be a first choice.

00:24:35.754 --> 00:24:39.730
So there's sort of an
extension of the dialogue.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.530
And so when the
winner comes in, you

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.080
can't guarantee someone's
going to be a good mayor.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.910
But this person has
a lot of tools now.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:50.140
Because actually, the guy
who one went from 39% to 66%

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.959
during the count
at the final round,

00:24:52.959 --> 00:24:55.500
meaning that he really did learn
about a lot of other people.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.708
He really was good at getting
second or third choice.

00:24:57.708 --> 00:24:59.180
He has a lot more to work with.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.520
And let's see what he does.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.440
But a system can
actually really change

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.370
the rewards of how to be
a good representative.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.560
And, I think,
fundamentally, we're

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.650
at a point in our politics
where the politics of two

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:19.900
and the limitations of that
are increasingly disconnected

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.670
from how we think
about the world

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.160
and how, particularly, I
think younger people think

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.180
about choices.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.580
And you know, I grew up
where there were still

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.925
three networks and PBS and UHF.

00:25:30.925 --> 00:25:32.550
And that was it or
something like that.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.960
But now, my kids
don't think that way.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.990
And yet, in politics,
we're sort of

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.520
supposed to be
satisfied with that,

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.872
even though we know it's
not delivering, actually,

00:25:41.872 --> 00:25:43.330
particularly good
choices, and it's

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.000
creating incentives
to act in ways that,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.227
in fact, aren't very good.

00:25:47.227 --> 00:25:49.060
And it's just a matter
of a statutory change

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.320
that we can do.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.650
Any state can change how we vote
for president, US Senate, US

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.870
House on down on their own.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.140
In the state of Maine--
is there any Mainers here?

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.160
Probably not.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.520
But Maine is going to use
ranked choice voting in June

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.530
for all their big primaries.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.230
And they're also going to
vote on keeping ranked choice

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.120
voting, which we
think they will.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.030
And if they do, then they'll use
it for US Senate and US House

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.287
in November.

00:26:14.287 --> 00:26:16.370
They didn't actually try
to pass it for president.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.500
That's a future thing
that they can do.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.730
But they could've.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.640
But the way our system
works, actually, states

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.650
have a lot of leeway to kind
of lead in Democratic practice.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.400
And that's been our
sort of whole history.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.730
We started with incredible
limits on suffrage.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.690
And many states didn't vote
for president and so on.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.380
And then we keep
learning and expanding,

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.670
and states pushing the
edge of the envelope.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.378
Women's suffrage didn't
kind of magically

00:26:38.378 --> 00:26:40.030
start with a
constitutional amendment.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.560
It started with states using
it and cities using it.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.800
And that's what we're seeing
with ranked choice voting.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.250
And I think it's,
I believe, kind

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.350
of an inevitable
conversation for us to have.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:53.300
Because I think
that binary choice

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.670
is just not going to
work going forward.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.810
And the restlessness that
the voters are going to feel

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.966
is going to create more and
more tensions with the system.

00:27:02.966 --> 00:27:05.090
And it doesn't mean that
the major parties are bad.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.190
It just means that they
need to be accountable.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.470
And they can't just be
there because they're there.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.440
And they can't use
the rules and tools

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.690
that they have to keep
themselves entrenched,

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.520
which is essentially what
we've allowed to happen.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.260
We allow the major parties,
in their campaigns,

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.492
to run as political actors.

00:27:23.492 --> 00:27:24.950
And then they win,
and then they're

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.324
legislators making
policy determining

00:27:27.324 --> 00:27:29.240
the rules of the game
that, then, they run in.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.920
It's sort of an
intrinsic problem

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.240
to just kind of turn that over.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.324
And when we think of
politics being broken,

00:27:35.324 --> 00:27:36.740
it really, in a
sense, is actually

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.050
working just as you
might imagine it would

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:40.190
if you let that happen.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:44.550
And I think that we really
can't keep letting that happen.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.576
So I think Krist touched
well on the part of what

00:27:48.576 --> 00:27:50.450
it means to go from a
single-member districts

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:51.575
to a multi-member district.

00:27:51.575 --> 00:27:53.180
But I'll use a specific example.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.270
This other sort of fundamental
way that our vote I think

00:27:56.270 --> 00:28:01.880
is limited is, when we
vote for the US House,

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.374
we vote in single-member
districts by statute.

00:28:05.374 --> 00:28:07.040
Actually, that's a
congressional statute

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.679
from the 1960s, where
they required every state

00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:10.970
to use single-member districts.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.420
And we had states at
that time that didn't.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.670
And in a sense, we
were saying every state

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.430
that has more than one seat
needs to draw districts.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.040
And once you start
drawing districts,

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.690
it's usually sort of a
self-interested process.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.210
But even when it's not,
like in California, just

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:30.260
geographically, you have
partisan imbalances.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.210
We don't redraw state lines.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.780
Maybe we should, but we don't.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.582
And so we all know
which states are red

00:28:35.582 --> 00:28:37.790
and which states are blue
and which states are swing.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.440
And it's actually
very entrenched.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.900
And there's fewer swing
states than there used to be.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.630
And counties-- we don't
redraw county lines.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.800
The average county was
won by 15% in 1996.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:54.230
It was won by more than 40% in
the presidential race in 2016.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.900
The median county was won
by more than 70 to 30.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.700
So you put a bunch
of counties together,

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.590
and you do not have a
competitive district.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:01.860
I'm sorry.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.910
And so it's super
easy to know who's

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:09.060
going to win almost more than
90% of congressional races.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.300
And if you live in one
of those, binary choice,

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.830
stuck on one side,
your interest,

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:17.300
maybe, in the 2018
election is, how can I

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.200
channel money and volunteer
time in that Nevada

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.040
3, or some other
particular district--

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.645
probably not where you live?

00:29:26.645 --> 00:29:27.770
There's a bill in Congress.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:30.710
Ro Khanna is actually one of the
sponsors of it, the congressman

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.500
from around here.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.200
And it would be to,
by statute, actually

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.780
take the logic of the
1960s bill, which required

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.560
single-member districts,
and, instead, require

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.085
multi-member districts
with ranked choice voting.

00:29:44.085 --> 00:29:45.460
When you use ranked
choice voting

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.810
in a multi-member district,
you get those virtues

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.420
of the ranked choice system
as used in Maine and Santa

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:54.500
Fe and such places,
but you also can expand

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.930
who gets to help elect someone.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.900
Because each seat can be won
with a smaller share of votes.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.000
And then collectively,
almost everyone

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.470
gets to help elect someone.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:06.230
So you really expand that
kind of voter power that way,

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:11.390
which is why it's such a good
tool for the Voting Rights Act.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.530
So this isn't just
theoretical for us.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:19.080
And I think that it's
this time of opportunity.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.120
I've been doing
this for a while.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.742
But I think this
moment of disruption

00:30:25.742 --> 00:30:28.200
which we're experiencing in
our politics in multiple ways--

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.741
and it's not just
about Donald Trump.

00:30:29.741 --> 00:30:32.730
It's about, like, there's
a series of things

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.530
that, our politics
isn't working,

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.020
that really are sort of
deeply troubling to more

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.734
and more people.

00:30:38.734 --> 00:30:40.650
And again, I don't think
it's self-correcting.

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:42.820
There's a really good
paper that I wanted

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.070
to draw people's attention to.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.932
Michael Porter, this Harvard
Business School icon,

00:30:47.932 --> 00:30:49.140
wrote it with Katherine Gehl.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.390
It's called "Why Competition
in the Political Industry

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.290
is Failing America."

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:56.277
It really lays out where
we are, I think, very well.

00:30:56.277 --> 00:30:58.610
I don't agree with a lot of
the prescriptions they have.

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:01.390
But I do like that ranked
choice voting is among them.

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:06.290
But essentially, they lay
out the challenges we face

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:10.530
and the fact that we do have
the power to change things.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.980
And I think if we
don't, things are not

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.440
going to get better magically.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.370
I think some of
the deep divisions

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:22.490
we have that combine
with winner-take-all

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.660
are highly problematic.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.160
And we're in a cycle where this
kind of change has to happen.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.860
And I think all of the other
changes in our society too--

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.040
the Me Too movement
is partly about women

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.165
having a seat at the table.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.640
There's five women governors.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:45.860
80% of Congress-- four out
of five-- are men still.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.740
For Republicans, it's
more than nine out of 10.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:52.310
And at a certain point,
that's just not going to work.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.680
And how can we kind of
unloose this system?

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.690
And actually, one of
the outcomes of the Fair

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.180
Representation Act would
be a very likely rapid rise

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.370
in the number of
women who are winning,

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:05.440
a fluid way for our racial
and ethnic diversity.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.950
Is anyone from Santa Clara?

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:08.885
Just curious.

00:32:08.885 --> 00:32:11.600
So Santa Clara is
voting on ranked choice

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.660
voting the multi-member style,
and ranked choice voting

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.940
for mayor in June.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.250
But there's a whole bunch
of cities in California

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:23.030
that are addressing the
fact that they're not

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.160
very representative in
their local governments.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.070
Santa Clara has an
all white city council

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.680
in a city that's
majority minority.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.230
And you're seeing that
in a lot of places.

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.506
And the push is to have them
go to single-member districts--

00:32:36.506 --> 00:32:37.880
go from at-large
elections, where

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.430
they get to vote
city-wide, and then vote

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.410
in each single-member district.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:45.562
But we don't necessarily
live that way.

00:32:45.562 --> 00:32:47.520
We don't necessarily live
in our little pockets

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.659
of racial difference.

00:32:49.659 --> 00:32:52.200
And there's some things that,
maybe, a single-member district

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:52.470
does.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.960
But it doesn't necessarily
allow you to kind of fluidly

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.500
determine your own
representation every election.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.400
And that's a really
important conversation

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.310
we should be having.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.018
And California's
actually just doing this

00:33:02.018 --> 00:33:04.326
without the conversation
really happening much.

00:33:04.326 --> 00:33:05.700
But Santa Clara
is going to allow

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.908
us to have that conversation.

00:33:06.908 --> 00:33:11.250
So we're really excited
about that campaign.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:17.696
We're also seeing, I think,
a realization that it

00:33:17.696 --> 00:33:18.820
can work at a higher level.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.869
So this Maine situation
was interesting.

00:33:20.869 --> 00:33:23.160
I don't know how many of you
have heard of Paul LePage.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.312
He's the governor of Maine--
pretty controversial guy.

00:33:26.312 --> 00:33:30.090
He brags that he was Donald
Trump before Donald Trump was.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:32.940
But he's part of a whole
string of governors

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.890
who didn't win half the votes--

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.416
in fact, didn't win even 40%
of the votes when they won.

00:33:37.416 --> 00:33:38.790
The last three
governors of Maine

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.350
all won with less than 40.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.870
So it's a state that's ahead
of the curve, as far as

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:45.700
having independents and third
parties doing pretty well.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.565
And it creates this tension
of split votes and spoilers

00:33:48.565 --> 00:33:50.940
and people saying, you shouldn't
vote for the third party

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:51.440
candidate.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.085
But people are still
doing it and sort

00:33:53.085 --> 00:33:54.602
of controversial outcomes.

00:33:54.602 --> 00:33:57.060
And Maine responded to that by
passing ranked choice voting

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.720
in 2016 with the second highest
vote total that ever had been

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.880
passed in a ballot measure.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.000
And then speaking of the
challenges of changing things,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.400
we've had to deal with
legal issues or election

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.290
administration challenges.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:13.750
And I won't go into
the whole story,

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.139
but they basically repealed
it last fall, finally,

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:21.866
in this brinksmanship that one
of the parties was playing.

00:34:21.866 --> 00:34:23.449
But in Maine, you
can do a referendum.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:25.444
You can actually say, no,
let's not accept that law.

00:34:25.444 --> 00:34:26.739
KRIST NOVOCELIC: Before
it was even used.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:27.050
ROB RITCHIE: Yeah.

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.310
So they've collected
the signatures

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:29.989
to force a referendum
in June on it.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:32.281
So they're going to vote in
June on whether to keep it.

00:34:32.281 --> 00:34:33.822
And while they're
doing that, they're

00:34:33.822 --> 00:34:36.260
going to get to vote with it
in these races for governor,

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.326
where they've got 10
Democrats running and five

00:34:39.326 --> 00:34:40.159
Republicans running.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.325
And those people will run
with ranked choice voting.

00:34:42.325 --> 00:34:45.925
So that has the potential to
be a really big breakthrough.

00:34:45.925 --> 00:34:48.050
And we're seeing more states
where that can happen.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.800
Just yesterday, the radical
bastion of Utah just passed

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.400
ranked choice voting
as a city option,

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.200
with a really
explicit understanding

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.900
that they want to try
it out at a city level

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:05.450
to see if it's ready to work
in Utah at a higher level.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:09.010
And it's just fun
to see this moving

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.660
in different ways
in different places,

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:14.200
and more and more groups getting
involved, and more and more

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.160
state groups forming.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.790
And I think we're entering
this different phase.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:22.660
One thing I just wanted to
highlight as a possibility--

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:23.780
we'll see what happens--

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.610
but the 2020 presidential
race is looming.

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:29.890
And almost certainly,
we'll again

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:31.980
have some third party
and independent energy.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.370
We'll see.

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:34.540
Who knows on which side?

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.160
John Kasich is
saying that maybe he

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.469
won't run as a-- who
knows what he'll do?

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.760
But he sort of said it's time
for a multi-party system.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.330
Does he run on that
side of the spectrum?

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:47.350
Do we see kind of a Bernie
Sanders force run on the left?

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:48.100
We'll have to see.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.392
But our politics is
in this tense mode.

00:35:51.392 --> 00:35:53.350
And some states could
use ranked choice voting.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.302
So we're going to elevate
the goal of trying

00:35:55.302 --> 00:35:57.010
to do that at least
in a couple of states

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.792
to show that that's possible.

00:35:58.792 --> 00:36:00.250
And then the
presidential primaries

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:01.374
will be really interesting.

00:36:01.374 --> 00:36:03.730
The Republicans had a
lot of people running.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:07.330
And I think that part of what
Donald Trump was able to do

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:11.500
was dominate the media cycle and
kind of be the plurality guy.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.610
And actually, all of his
wins up until really late

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.970
in the process were by
plurality, not by majority.

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:21.640
And if he'd had
to win majorities

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.820
earlier, who knows how
that might have affected

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.500
how he campaigned and
maybe, ultimately,

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.860
how he governs today?

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.900
But Democrats face that
same dynamic in 2020.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.730
Is it just a race to 25%?

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.010
And what does that mean
for the way you behave

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:38.890
and the way you try to
bring people together?

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:40.290
And you can change those rules.

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:44.290
Like, Iowa caucuses could
change that simple party rule.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.070
It's very straightforward to
change ranked choice voting.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:52.020
So we're going to try to
look into that idea, too.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.470
And the Fair
Representation Act is not

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:58.110
going to pass this Congress.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.920
But it does have
several co-sponsors.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.465
And I think when you're having
dialogues about gerrymandering

00:37:03.465 --> 00:37:07.230
and about, wouldn't it be great
if we had a competitive race

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.020
where we live, or, wouldn't
it be great if we had more

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.890
diversity of representation,
or, I'm a Republican in the Bay

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:15.960
Area, or, I'm a
Democrat in Oklahoma,

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:20.040
or, I'm a pro-life Democrat,
or whatever it might be--

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.260
a pro-choice Republican--

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.900
there should be more
space for more of us.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.360
And we have a system
that really makes it hard

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.240
for these different
perspectives to be elected

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.610
and realize that that's an
answer just sitting there

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.760
that we can keep
building support for.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.770
And we have some ideas
about how that might happen.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.457
But Santa Clara's a place
where that can start.

00:37:40.457 --> 00:37:41.790
KRIST NOVOCELIC: Want to do Q&amp;A?

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:42.540
ROB RITCHIE: Yeah.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.360
So let me just finish, before
we do that, with two things

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.830
that I wanted to do.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:51.300
So one is to talk about the
ways that people can help.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:56.490
So one is that there are
these efforts going on.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:59.040
And there's lots
of growing numbers

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.470
of state groups for people
who are interested in donating

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:03.054
to things.

00:38:03.054 --> 00:38:04.720
There there's lots
of ways to help them,

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.500
including the
Santa Clara effort.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.170
But also, we have been
intrigued by the way

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:12.210
that people have
stepped forward to help.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.840
So Louis is part
of a group that has

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.715
taken on a frustrating
challenge that has really

00:38:19.715 --> 00:38:22.090
been a barrier to us over the
years, which is that ranked

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.290
choice voting has often
made sense to policymakers

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.040
in particular settings,
and then they turn

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.070
and they find out that their
voting equipment can't do it.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.140
The whole way we vote--

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.730
what we vote on--

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:34.980
I mean, it's funny, when
you're on a place like Google

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.560
where you're so far ahead of
the curve on doing things.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.280
And the way we vote is just
pathetically antiquated

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.410
and poorly administered,
including most

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:47.760
of the counties around here.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.480
San Francisco and Oakland use
these more than decade-old

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.310
systems that would
essentially be

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:55.361
like using the phones
we had 15 years ago

00:38:55.361 --> 00:38:56.610
and saying, like, that's cool.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:57.734
That's really cutting edge.

00:38:57.734 --> 00:39:00.327
And it really limits
what we can do.

00:39:00.327 --> 00:39:02.160
We actually have four
cities in the Bay Area

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.710
using ranked choice voting.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.960
But they do it in
this awkward way,

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.280
tied to the voting equipment.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:13.180
That's San Francisco, Oakland,
Berkeley, and San Francisco.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:21.930
And they stepped
forward and have

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.880
been working with
some folks that we

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:28.140
knew to create a
universal tabulator to be

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.390
able to work with
legacy voting equipment

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:33.000
and, essentially,
make it much easier

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.640
for some state like
Missouri or something, that

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.370
gets interested in
ranked choice voting,

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.710
to be able to work
with this widget--

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:42.450
it's more complicated
than that--

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:46.260
to be able to have a
federally approved,

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.700
tested, certified system to be
able, in a secure way, to use

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.890
ranked choice voting on
the older voting equipment,

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.260
aggregate data from
different systems,

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.420
and get past that puzzle.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.815
The next round of
new machines are

00:39:59.815 --> 00:40:01.440
going to get better
and better on this.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.620
And it's certainly
not rocket science.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.610
But it's been
incredibly helpful,

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:08.670
and will almost
certainly open the door

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.570
toward more things going on.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.260
We have a tool--

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.300
RankIt.Vote.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.510
I was going to show it to
you, but I'll just tell it.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.440
RankIt.Vote is a way to just
vote with ranked choice voting

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.690
and create a quick poll and
share it with your friends

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:22.710
and so on.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.930
But you know, I would imagine
Google Vote or something

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:26.430
right--

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:27.992
just sort of a great
interface where

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:30.450
you where you could go in,
maybe choose your voting system.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:31.770
There's other
voting systems, too.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:32.700
We could get into that.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.500
But there's other ways
to a vote-- but something

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.791
where people can make a quick
decision about something.

00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:40.140
Or an organization could do it.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.520
60 colleges and universities--

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.770
even more now-- use
ranked choice voting,

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:45.730
all figuring out how to do it.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:49.130
And if they had a nice
tool to securely run

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:53.290
ranked choice voting elections,
that would be terrific.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.220
The last thing I'll say is,
we have this tool, Monopoly

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.260
Politics, where we
project outcomes

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.930
in congressional
races, and then show

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.930
what would happen if the
two-party were, like,

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:07.380
53% to 47%.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.840
What might that do for outcomes?

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.580
And you can put that number in.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:16.550
And it's a pretty good Excel
tool that we're showing online,

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.340
that kind of shows
it, which, by the way,

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:22.170
shows-- if you put 53% in
right now, for the Democrats,

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.470
you don't get a Democratic
majority in the House.

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:30.210
And you can sort of see why, and
which districts don't change.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:33.420
But we'd love to make something
like that really inviting

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.270
to play with.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.220
So there's lots
of ways that we'd

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.800
love to kind of work
with people too.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.455
And let's turn it to questions.

00:41:38.455 --> 00:41:39.246
SPEAKER: All right.

00:41:39.246 --> 00:41:39.746
Yeah.

00:41:39.746 --> 00:41:40.662
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:40.662 --> 00:41:44.438
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:44.438 --> 00:41:45.390
All right.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:46.681
We're going to go to questions.

00:41:46.681 --> 00:41:48.862
There is a Dory.

00:41:48.862 --> 00:41:51.780
This comes from Darryl Gove.

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.720
Why not approval voting?

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.374
Ranked choice voting seems like
cognitive overhead for voters

00:41:56.374 --> 00:41:57.540
and complexity for counters.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.720
Approval seems easier and
should bias towards candidates

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.920
with broad appeal.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.360
KRIST NOVOCELIC: We're here
to talk about ranked choice

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:03.910
voting.

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:09.660
You can read all about approval
voting on the internet.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.170
I mean, we're here to talk
about ranked choice voting.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:17.130
Ranked choice voting
is in the law books.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:18.580
It's used internationally.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.346
It's used in the United States.

00:42:21.346 --> 00:42:22.470
Let's do the next question.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.550
ROB RITCHIE: Yeah, no,
I will just briefly

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.925
mention that, Krist, just
because it's interesting topic.

00:42:25.925 --> 00:42:28.500
We're in a room of people that
think about technology and not

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.041
being tied to what's been done.
ranked choice voting has been

00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:34.020
done much, much more than
some of the other alternative

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.090
systems that are kind of
interesting to look at,

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:40.559
like score voting and
star voting and approval

00:42:40.559 --> 00:42:41.600
voting, Condorcet voting.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.975
There's these sort of different
ideas that are out there.

00:42:43.975 --> 00:42:45.960
And I think they all
speak to certain virtues.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.597
One of the things
that's interesting,

00:42:47.597 --> 00:42:49.680
though-- sort of the
challenge-- is, a lot of them

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.100
are sort of mathematically,
technically sound,

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.777
but sort of psychologically not.

00:42:53.777 --> 00:42:56.110
And let me just give a quick
example of approval voting,

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.830
which is why I think
it is used so little

00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.880
in competitive elections.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.460
If you think about, say, that
Republican presidential field

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.892
in 2016, with approval,
you would say,

00:43:04.892 --> 00:43:05.850
oh, I like this person.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:06.690
I like this person.

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:07.520
I like this person.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:07.890
And that's it.

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:09.680
KRIST NOVOCELIC: Approval voting
is, you get all the candidates,

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.360
and you can vote for every
one of them if you want.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.500
Fill in the 0.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.640
Just boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.040
SPEAKER: It's like [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.320
ROB RITCHIE: Yeah.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.070
KRIST NOVOCELIC: Yeah.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:18.000
ROB RITCHIE: So yeah.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:18.600
KRIST NOVOCELIC: It's just
like, that's what it is.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:18.810
It's--

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:18.900
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:19.220
ROB RITCHIE: So
it's like if you're

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.100
doing a doodle something.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.090
But here's the thing.

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:28.030
When you're actually in
the heat of the fray,

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:30.660
it's really hard for candidates
to say, yeah, go ahead vote

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.760
for my opponent with an
equally cast vote that

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.510
might make me lose, and
for voters to actually get

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.710
in that frame, too.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:42.510
So it's psychologically
not as sound as the math.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:44.940
But we're also going to
say, hey, give it a try.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.920
It has very little
use in practice.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.840
And ranked choice
voting, we know, works.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.060
That's what I think
Krist was saying.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.120
We know it works.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.170
We know that voters actually
do it, and you want a system--

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.500
KRIST NOVOCELIC: It's been
scrutinized by the courts.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:55.830
ROB RITCHIE: --that
actually does it.

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.270
KRIST NOVOCELIC: And so if
you want to advocate a voting

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.250
system, you're going to come
across a lot of opponents

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.860
in the establishment.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.780
And the insiders
don't want change.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.720
And the first thing they do
is, they run to the lawbooks.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.070
And they're going to sue you.

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:09.450
And so with ranked
choice voting,

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:13.920
it's been scrutinized
by the courts.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.322
It's constitutionally protected.

00:44:16.322 --> 00:44:18.530
ROB RITCHIE: And we actually
hope more places try out

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:19.760
more systems.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.110
But I think we're
pretty confident that

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:24.440
ranked choice voting's ready
to go to the highest level

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.440
right now.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.110
SPEAKER: What are your thoughts
on Lawrence Lessig's as person,

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:29.679
one vote Equal Votes project.

00:44:29.679 --> 00:44:31.970
Will the lawsuits they're
bringing to the Supreme Court

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:33.487
help in your mission?

00:44:33.487 --> 00:44:35.320
ROB RITCHIE: Do people
know Lawrence Lessig?

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.440
Kind of interesting guy.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.680
He did a lot of stuff
on internet freedom

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.610
and was at Stanford.

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:41.270
Now, he's at Harvard.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:42.080
He's done some
interesting stuff.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.538
We're actually
going to be, likely,

00:44:43.538 --> 00:44:46.274
working with him on some
stuff on our particular goals.

00:44:46.274 --> 00:44:47.690
One of things he's
trying to do is

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.700
take on the electoral
college as it currently

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.562
is done in the winner-take-all
rule, which is another statute.

00:44:52.562 --> 00:44:54.270
It's not in the
Constitution or anything.

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.420
So when candidates
win a state, they

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.480
get all the electoral votes
in that by winner-take-all.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.820
So if you win by 20%, you
get all the electoral votes.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.280
If you win by one vote, you
get all the electoral votes.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:09.470
And his lawsuit is
against that principle.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:10.040
We'll see.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.420
I think it's going to be
a challenging legal theory

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:16.790
to go deep into the courts.

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:19.790
But I welcome the dialogue.

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.190
We actually are not fans of
the electoral college system

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:24.590
as it's currently
constituted, and think

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:27.707
that having a dialogue
about it is good.

00:45:27.707 --> 00:45:29.790
AUDIENCE: So I guess I
sort of have two questions.

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:33.580
The main one is, do we actually
have data on how many people

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.702
rank more than one
candidate when they do

00:45:35.702 --> 00:45:37.410
ranked choice voting,
or do a lot of them

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:39.090
just still put one person in?

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.200
And if they aren't putting
in a second person,

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.646
is it because of
lack of education

00:45:42.646 --> 00:45:43.770
about the other candidates?

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.228
Is there a way to
encourage people?

00:45:45.228 --> 00:45:47.519
Because that would be the
biggest thing I would think

00:45:47.519 --> 00:45:48.060
would happen.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.410
People would be like, I don't
know who these people are,

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:50.580
and they just
wouldn't even bother.

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.371
ROB RITCHIE: Right.

00:45:51.371 --> 00:45:53.910
Well, it's an
interesting question.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.830
So the more interested
they are in the race,

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:57.570
the more they'll rank everybody.

00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:59.221
So just as an
example, we did a poll

00:45:59.221 --> 00:46:00.720
in the Republican
presidential field

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.530
at the time of the Iowa caucuses
of real, likely Republican

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:05.030
voters.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:06.900
It was an online
poll with YouGov--

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.700
so a pretty nice
sort of way to be

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:10.590
able to show your preferences.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.590
Did not say rank everybody, but
it offered them the chance to.

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.167
And more than 90%
ranked them all.

00:46:15.167 --> 00:46:17.750
KRIST NOVOCELIC: How many people
ranked in Santa Fe last week?

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:19.050
ROB RITCHIE: And
Santa Fe-- exactly.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.758
We don't actually have
the full data yet.

00:46:20.758 --> 00:46:24.180
But Santa Fe, first
time use of it--

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.550
one is, they're getting
better ballot designs.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.920
Do some of you vote in
San Francisco or Oakland?

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.710
So they have ranked
choice voting.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:34.590
In the mayor's race,
a majority of people

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.780
use all the rankings
allowed, which is three.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:40.022
A majority of people
will do that for mayor.

00:46:40.022 --> 00:46:41.730
They're not allowed
to do more than three

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:44.880
in the current ballot design.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.700
And then if it's like a lower
level board of supervisors

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.490
race, a majority will
definitely rank more than one,

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:52.740
but not as many.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.849
And so the less you know
about the candidates,

00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:56.890
the more you won't do it.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.310
But in the Santa Fe
race-- so five candidates.

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:01.230
It went all the way
through down to two.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.690
When they got to the final
round, of all the people

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.850
that voted in the
first round, 96%

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:07.920
had made a preference
between the final two.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.430
It was kind of cool.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:12.090
And you know, it's a
pretty diverse city

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:13.629
with a lot of differences.

00:47:13.629 --> 00:47:15.420
But people had learned
about the candidates

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.390
and wanted to
indicate a preference.

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.357
The other part of it is that,
now, you have candidates who--

00:47:21.357 --> 00:47:23.940
you're saying like, oh, I don't
know who these candidates are.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:26.790
The candidates know
you might think that.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.250
They have a reason
to engage with you.

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.392
So what you're
starting to see is,

00:47:31.392 --> 00:47:33.600
people are starting to get
the playbook of how to win

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.260
with ranked choice voting.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.455
And the playbook is, talk
to more people, which

00:47:36.455 --> 00:47:37.830
is actually kind
of a good thing,

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:39.190
particularly at the local level.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.640
So Minneapolis and St. Paul
or places like that are using

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.514
ranked choice voting.

00:47:42.514 --> 00:47:46.405
And you're just seeing deeper
levels of conversations going.

00:47:46.405 --> 00:47:48.030
SPEAKER: What are
the biggest obstacles

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:50.238
to getting ranked choice
voting to be more prevalent?

00:47:50.238 --> 00:47:52.590
Do you see a lot of
opposition from the main two

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:54.969
political parties?

00:47:54.969 --> 00:47:56.010
KRIST NOVOCELIC: You can.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:03.770
There's opposition,
because you bring change.

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:06.890
And there's a survival
instinct of, say,

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:08.600
a politician or a
lawmaker to say, well,

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.100
how's this going to
affect my election?

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:16.214
And you saw it in, say, the
presidential debates in 2016.

00:48:16.214 --> 00:48:17.630
It's just like,
why didn't we have

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:19.970
more people up there
instead of the Republican

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:20.720
and the Democrat?

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.780
Because they didn't want
to have any competition.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.540
And so things are
so polarized now.

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:30.380
It's like people are just
afraid of the other side.

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:31.400
And they're so afraid.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.500
Or they demonize the other side.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:34.970
And they're so afraid.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:37.410
They don't have the
mental bandwidth,

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:39.500
the cognitive ability
to just say, well,

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:43.892
maybe I should go for this
independent or another voice.

00:48:43.892 --> 00:48:45.350
Because they're
afraid that they're

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.120
going to help the other side.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:50.760
And so the wagons are
circled on both sides.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.570
And so with ranked choice
voting, it's very powerful.

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:57.030
It's just like, you
have your first choice.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:58.940
It's your strongest choice.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.970
I really, really like her.

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.720
And I'm going to make
her my first choice.

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.940
But you know, she's all right.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.860
I'm comfortable with making
her my second choice.

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:14.270
But that second choice is not
hurting your first choice.

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:18.920
It's a sophisticated way
of ranking your candidates.

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:24.950
And people are so
polarized now in the tribal

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:27.101
with the Republicans
and the Democrats.

00:49:27.101 --> 00:49:28.850
And it just seems like
whatever the issues

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:30.740
are running in the news--

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:33.890
and then why don't you just
look at your own election

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:35.090
system in California?

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:37.340
They just changed the rules.

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.970
You're going to have your
primary election in March.

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:44.930
So all the candidates run
for whatever state office

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:50.120
in March, or Congress,
or for US Senate.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.310
And then the top two
candidates, no matter

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:54.970
if someone has a
majority or not,

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:58.500
they run again in November.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.340
That's, like, almost a
whole year of just getting

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.680
stuck with two candidates

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.850
I mean, why did the
legislature do that?

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:10.360
That's a big deal.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.815
In France, they have
runoff elections.

00:50:13.815 --> 00:50:16.400
In France, they have an
election for their assembly.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:19.700
If someone wins a majority in
that district, they're elected.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.400
If there's no majority, they
have a runoff two weeks later--

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.930
two weeks.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:27.260
And here, it's just months.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:31.580
And then behind the scenes,
you have all these insiders.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:33.320
I'm answering this question--

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.190
who's against it?

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:39.320
Not just the political parties,
which are soft money conduits.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.980
They sell access to the
legislature to Congress.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:44.900
Then they raise
millions of dollars.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:49.130
And then these bosses dole it
out to who could win or lose.

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:51.780
There's also these other groups
that work behind the scenes,

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.390
and voters have no
idea who they are.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:59.180
And they're chamber of commerce
or unions or identity politics

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.420
groups or some issue groups
on the left and right.

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.340
And they're doing
independent expenditures.

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.470
They're spending
millions of dollars.

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:10.880
And they don't want
to change that power

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.704
to give voters power.

00:51:12.704 --> 00:51:14.120
Why would they
want to give voters

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.200
power when they have the power?

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.984
When you're stuck with two
choices from March to November,

00:51:19.984 --> 00:51:20.900
that's what they want.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:23.191
Because if you had more
choices, you'd have more power.

00:51:23.191 --> 00:51:26.430
If you have more power,
then they have less power.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:28.720
So that's why
they're threatened.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.930
A lot of them are threatened.

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:33.110
There's rational, good
government folks in Sacramento

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:36.320
and on the local level
and in the Congress

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.090
that recognize
the value of this.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.820
But there's also a lot of
people who don't want it,

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:42.779
because they don't want
to give up their power.

00:51:42.779 --> 00:51:43.528
ROB RITCHIE: Yeah.

00:51:43.528 --> 00:51:45.364
And I'll say, just to
add as a tag to that,

00:51:45.364 --> 00:51:47.155
there's sort of an
insider versus outsider.

00:51:47.155 --> 00:51:48.530
It's not left versus right.

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:51.350
But it's often like a
younger versus older.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:52.850
Some of our most
passionate people--

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:54.620
the guy we were
working with in Utah--

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:55.790
conservative Republican.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:56.990
He's, like, 29.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:58.520
And he's just, like,
really into it.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.580
And the guy in Georgia who's
really into it is, like, 26.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.520
And they don't to be that
young to be really leading

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.160
that effort.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.550
But they tend to be
to be more ready.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:11.180
In 2008, when McCain and
Obama ran against each other,

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.201
they had both been prime
sponsors or prime advocates

00:52:14.201 --> 00:52:15.200
of ranked choice voting.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.540
They were sort of
a little bit of--

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.240
not outsiders, but
kind of change agents.

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.940
And so you will see people like
that who are more like that.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.940
And you know, the
current DNC chair likes

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.500
ranked choice voting.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:30.170
A guy from the second
Republican race

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:32.030
a few years ago is one
of our key advocates.

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:35.940
So there are interesting
changes happening.

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:37.870
And there is resistance.

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:40.009
But I think a lot of those
folks recognize it's not

00:52:40.009 --> 00:52:41.050
working that well either.

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:42.960
And they can see that this
is a way to let it breathe.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.340
I'll just say about
top two and the point

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:45.420
that Krist is making--

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.402
so you all live in the
top two environment,

00:52:48.402 --> 00:52:50.110
which has some
interesting aspects to it.

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:51.859
So I don't want to be
just critical of it.

00:52:51.859 --> 00:52:53.910
But a part of it
that's challenging

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:55.620
is, you only get
to vote for one.

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.540
And so in those primaries,
the first round,

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.980
you only get about for one.

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:02.250
So Republicans are worried they
might not get someone advancing

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:04.070
to the general election.

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:06.570
And that's because there's more
than one Republican running.

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:08.280
If only one Republican
ran for governor,

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.310
they're pretty much a done
deal that they get in.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:13.079
But it's a split vote.

00:53:13.079 --> 00:53:15.120
And Democrats are worried
they might not actually

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.669
get any in races
that they otherwise

00:53:16.669 --> 00:53:18.210
could win in the
congressional level,

00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:20.140
because they have too
many people running.

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.990
And that's a product
of a system that

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:27.250
just doesn't allow us to say
more than we were able to.

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:29.370
SPEAKER: Rob and
Krist, thank you.

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:33.020
[APPLAUSE]
