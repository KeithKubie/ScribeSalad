00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.500
A thermometer in a science lab
displays the temperature in

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.510
both Celsius and Fahrenheit.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.785
If the mercury in the
thermometer rises to 56

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:13.480
degrees Fahrenheit, what is
the corresponding Celsius

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.290
temperature?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.560
So right from the get go,
there's a formula that if you

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.400
get have the Celsius
temperature, it'll give you

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.210
the Fahrenheit, if you have the
Fahrenheit, it'll give you

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.160
the Celsius.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.040
Now I have a bad memory,
so I always have to

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.920
pseudo-derive it.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.830
And maybe in future videos,
we'll totally derive it.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.270
Once we get a little bit more
algebra, if you just know the

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.920
boiling and freezing points in
both scales, you should be

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.960
able to figure out the
relationship between the two.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.870
Now the way I always remember
it is that there's a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.570
relationship of 5/9 or
9/5 between the two.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.950
And then you have to
add or subtract 32.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.490
And the way I think about it is,
the Fahrenheit number is

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.960
always going to be larger.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.340
So if you start with-- or at
least while we are in our

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.620
normal, everyday living scales
when water is in its liquid

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.760
form and all that.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.020
So if you start with a Celsius,
I say, oh I have to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.740
make it bigger.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.860
So I have to say, OK, I'm going
to multiply that by 9/5.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.900
That will make it bigger.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.959
And then I'm going
to add 32 to it.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.450
And the reason why I know to add
32 is because when Celsius

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.940
is 0, 0 times 9/5 is still 0.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.950
And we know when Celsius is 0,
Fahrenheit is going to be 32.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.060
So I know I have to
add 32 to it.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.070
So, at least my gut is telling
me, that the formula is 9/5

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.070
times the Celsius degrees,
plus 32.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.100
And you can verify that this
works for the boiling point.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.360
This definitely works for
the freezing point.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.740
When Celsius is 0, this is going
to be 0, you add 32,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.930
that's going to be Fahrenheit.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.650
When Celsius is 100, 9/5 times
100 is 180, plus 32 is 212.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.900
So this works.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.450
They've given us the Fahrenheit
temperature, and we

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.580
need to get the Celsius
temperature.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.190
Now I could just put the 56 in
here, and solve for C, and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.660
that will completely work.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.110
Or I could solve for C using
this, so I have the equation

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.730
for Celsius in terms
of Fahrenheit.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.650
Either way.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.020
So let's do it the
second way, so we

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.240
have the second equation.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:11.510
So if we subtract 32 from both
sides of this equation, we get

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.370
Fahrenheit minus 32 is equal
to 9/5 times Celsius.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.870
Now to solve for Celsius, we
can multiply both sides of

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.120
this equation times 5/9.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.690
And so we will get 9 cancels
with 9, 5 cancels with 5.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.930
That was the whole point behind
multiplying by the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.180
reciprocal.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.710
Remember, this 5/9 is going to
be times this whole left side.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.780
We're left with Celsius.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.770
Celsius is equal to 5/9 times
Fahrenheit, minus 32.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.740
So we just rearranged this
equation up here to get this

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.280
equation down here.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.450
I didn't derive the equation in
this video, I just kind of

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.660
pseudo-remembered it, and made
sure I got the equation right.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.670
But you can derive it if
you just remember, it's

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.730
essentially, if you know
how to find the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.850
equation of a line.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.170
You say, well, when Celsius-- if
you use the x-coordinate as

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:21.550
Celsius-- when Celsius is
0, Fahrenheit is 32.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.490
And when Celsius is 100,
Fahrenheit is 212, and find

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.280
the equation of the line between
these two points.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.140
Don't worry about it if
you don't know that.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.580
All you need to know for this
problem is this right here.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.490
But if you know how to solve the
equation for the line, you

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.660
would come up with this answer
right here, and you wouldn't

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.950
have to memorize it.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.610
Now that we've actually gotten
this far, let's just put in 56

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.670
degrees for the Fahrenheit
temperature, and figure out

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.720
what the Celsius
temperature is.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.100
So if we put 56 in there, we're
going to have 5/9 times

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.680
56 minus 32 is equal to the
Celsius temperature.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.500
So 56 minus 32-- let me
continue it up here.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.810
56 minus 30 is 26,
minus 2 is 24.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.529
So this is going to be 24.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.990
So it's going to be
5/9 times 24.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.400
This right here is 24.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.280
5/9 times 24 is going
to be equal to C.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.720
And let's see if we can
simplify this at all.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.110
So this is the same thing
as 5 times 24 over 9.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.820
24 is divisible by 3.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.030
You divide it by 3, you get 8.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.600
9 divided by 3 is 3.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.890
So 5 times 8 is equal to 40/3
Celsius, degrees Celsius.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.870
Now if we wanted to write this
as a mixed number, 3 goes into

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.660
40 thirteen times.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.160
And you have a remainder of 1.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.535
So it's 13 and 1/3.

00:04:57.535 --> 00:04:58.860
Now we could even check that.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.510
3 times 13 is 39,
plus 1 is 40.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.560
And if this wasn't obvious to
you, you could actually just

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.350
take 3 into 40.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.640
3 goes into 4 one time.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.350
1 times 3 is 3.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.070
Subtract.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.200
You get 1.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.290
Bring down that 0.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.400
3 goes into 10 three times.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.060
3 times 3 is 9.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.720
You subtract.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.800
You get a remainder of 1.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.200
So it's 3 and 1/3.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.460
So this is 13 and 1/3
degrees Celsius.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.890
So if it's 56 degrees outside in
Fahrenheit, it's 13 and 1/3

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.240
degrees in Celsius.
