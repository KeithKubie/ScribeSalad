&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.900
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernsteain:
Peter Kramer is our guest.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.930
He is a columnist.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.080
He is a novelist.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.400
He is a psychiatrist on the
faculty at Brown Medical School.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.690
But as he says in his new book,
he's basically known as the

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.970
"Listening to Prozac" guy.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.100
All of you who are
here, I would say,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.420
I'm willing to bet
have read this book.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.030
And his new work is
called "Ordinarily Well".

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.330
It's a follow on to the best
seller, "Listening to Prozac".

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.510
And please join me in
welcoming Dr. Kramer.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:49.510
[ Applause ]

00:00:49.510 --> 00:01:05.350
[ Inaudible Discussion ]

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.560
Can you hear us now?

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.360
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:42.250
[ Inaudible Discussion ]

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.050
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter D. Kramer: Better?

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:54.290
[ Inaudible Discussion ]

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.380
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein:
Does my microphone--

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.220
Did my microphone pick
up Dr. Kramer's voice?

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.150
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.400
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter D. Kramer: Well, I--
oh, even I can tell, all right.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.780
So, you know, I've been to
some of the other sessions here

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.830
where the better--
yet better selling

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.010
and more honored authors
were speaking.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.420
And they all start by saying
how they were saved by reading,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.640
how the library card
really brought them

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.150
out of some small community
into the world.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.450
And it certainly is true for me.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.110
I am a child of immigrants.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.460
My mother was not satisfied with
the public library in our community

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.140
and would drive me across
town to another library

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.310
so we could take out,
you know, good enough

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.800
and well-curated enough
collection of books.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.080
So, I'm honored to be at
a celebration of reading.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.670
This really is, I know, important
in all your lives and a cause.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.570
You know, literacy
certainly is a cause.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.730
So, let me say that before
we talk about a book.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.030
Yes.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.330
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Terrific.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.630
Thank you.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.080
After reading your book, I
guess, the question I most want

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.510
to know is why this
book at this time?

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.810
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter D. Kramer: Yes.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.240
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Twenty three
years after your best seller.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.540
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter D. Kramer: Right.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.530
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Right at
time when one of eight people

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.650 position:56%
in America is using antidepressants.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.950
&gt;&gt; Peter Kramer: Right.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.470
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Why a defense
of Prozac and antidepressants?

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.430
&gt;&gt; Peter Kramer: Most of my books
come the way writers books do

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.850
out of some, you know, inspiring
thoughts, something that just needs

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.870
to be written that is
writerly, some observation

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.830 position:56%
that needs exploring and amplifying.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.930
This really is a cause book.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.200
This is a book I felt had
to be written for the sake

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.740
of the patients, which is not a
comfortable starting point for me,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.300
and maybe why it took me a little
longer than some of my other books.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.590
But I tell stories at the
beginning of the book about people

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.830
who really need antidepressants,
who either have not been prescribed

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.880
to them because their doctors
have doubts that have been aroused

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.530
by what I think is
spurious research that claim

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.050 position:56%
that these antidepressants and in a
minimal say a little what depression

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.750
or antidepressants are.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.010
But spurious research had said that
these medicines are a little more

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.310
than placebos with side effects.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.880
Or, who are doing well on
antidepressants in ways

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.260
that are important and
are cast into doubt,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.270
"Should I continue
taking the medicine?

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.740
Is it really a placebo?"

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.950 position:56%
And I'm not, by the way, saying
that everyone who is depressed needs

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.800
to be on antidepressant or
everyone who is doing well

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.970
on antidepressants
needs to stay on it.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.700
Just that that first question,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.370
do they work at all,
really can be discarded.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.940
And I think both researchers and
the press and the media had thrown

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.460
that into doubt in a way that
is dangerous to patients.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.400
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: But
as a psychiatrist, it's--

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.700
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter D. Kramer: Yes.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernsteain: -- it's
quite obvious, antidepressants work.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.300
&gt;&gt; Peter Kramer: Right.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.600
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernsteain:
Has there-- How has the--

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.420
How are those doubts been raised?

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.790
&gt;&gt; Peter Kramer: So, of course,
doctors see these medicines work.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.810
And the doubt that has been raised
isn't whether people get better

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.460
on antidepressants, but
whether they get better based

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.150
on the inherent efficacy
of the medicine.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.430
That is you could get better
just because of your faith

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.750
from the doctor and your faith
in pills or you could better

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.170 position:56%
because these medicines really work.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.620
That is the chemicals, they
are taken into your brain

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.010
and they do something that's useful
for people with mood disorders.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.980
So, I want to just say, because
I have talked a lot to the public

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.640
and I know that not everyone
knows this, what depression is?

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.130
When we say depression,
what we're talking about?

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.380
So, depression isn't
just ordinary sadness.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.680
It's a syndrome.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.350
It's a constellation of symptoms.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.840 position:56%
It's a disorder that's been
recognized, you know, since the time

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.330
of your properties, starting
under the name, melancholia.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.740
And we-- And you know
it when you see it.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.820
Lately, it's been defined
by symptoms, right?

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.620
So, people are sad.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.430
They can't experience pleasure.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.730
They're slowed down.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.030
They're apathetic.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.330
They may be suicidal.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.640
They may have problems with sleep
and appetite, low self-esteem.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.760
But it is those things
in a way that coheres

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.720
and makes it hard to
function in life.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.080
And, you know, at the
extreme, you know,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.280
you can think about Picasso
paintings or Durer etchings

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.880
where people are wringing their
hands and looking at the ground,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.100
and they're emaciated and almost
starving themselves to death,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.010 position:56%
and obsessed with negative thoughts.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.950
But there's a range of depressions.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.050
And some, which are, you know,
look or less recognizable

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.230
in that way are still
very destructive in life.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.860
And I think when you're in the
presence of a depressed patient,

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.300
you know pretty much what that
is, it's not ordinary sadness.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.610
And the antidepressants
are medicines

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.340
that human kind has had access
to only for the last 60 years.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.350
Since Hippocrates,
doctors have wanted

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.750
to have chemical approaches
to depression.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.900
The first antidepressants were
developed in the late 1950s.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.330
The concept that a
medicine would that we had

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.590
to hand did this was really
elaborated in the 1950s.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.700
And then the way 1980s in Europe
and here, we have this newer group

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.320
of antidepressants beginning with
Prozac and names that are familiar

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.360
to you or things like Zoloft
and Celexa, Effexor or Lexapro.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.010
That's the class of
medicines we're talking about.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.310
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Is it true

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.070
that we still don't
really know how they work?

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.370
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: It is true.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.950
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein:
How can that be?

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.390
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Well,
the brain is very complicated.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.320
In "Listening to Prozac," I
quote a scientist who says,

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.210 position:56%
"If the brain were simplest-- simple
enough for us to understand it,

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.940
we would not be complex enough
to have that understanding."

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.930
The-- We know a lot
of antidepressants.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:23.150
We know at the first level that
these medicines affect patterns

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.590
of transmission in the brain,

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.870
the way cells signal one
another with chemicals.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:33.810
And we know that these medicines
restore resilience in the brain

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.350
in some quite general way.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.180 position:56%
So, they make it possible for people
to make new cells in the brain.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.790
Something we've only known
for about 20-25 years is

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.200
that the adult human brain
continues to make new neurons

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.280
in certain parts, and
they allow the brain

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.480
to make new connections
between cells.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.250
And those things are
really muted in depression.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.590
Depression is a multisystem
illness that affects the brain,

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.990
the brain's capacity to learn,
but it also affects bone,

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.630
blood elements, hormonal glands.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.970
So, this is a body-wide disorder.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.800
But you know, at the core, we
have problems with the resilience

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.180
in the brain and the
medicines restore that.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.050
I start the book with an
anecdote about a friend of mine

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.540
who said we had a serious stroke,
and it turns out that this kind

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:26.000
of stroke, there's more
recovery from this kind of stroke

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.140
if you're given antidepressants
early.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.010
Not because they fight depression

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.930
but because they restore the
brain's ability apparently

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.120
to elaborate the connections
between cells in this way.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.060
And this friend of
mine, his patient,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.180
was not getting antidepressants
because of this sort

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.630
of created prejudice against them.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.100
And that really was the sort
of the trigger for my thinking

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.120
about writing a book like this.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.730
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: So, we
don't know exactly how they work?

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.030
&gt;&gt;Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.550
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein:
But you as a psychiatrist

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.570
and somewhat rare among
psychiatrists,

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.390
you do both talk therapy
and prescribing--

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.690
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:05.990
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein:
-- of antidepressants.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.360
So-- And you obviously see
that all of these works.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Yes.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.370
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein:
So, where on that scale

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.380
between all medicine
and all talk therapy--

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.680
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.100
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: --
do you lie and how do--

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.930
does the patient pick his
or her place on that--

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.250
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:30.320
So, it turns out that depression is
a relapsing and remitting disorder.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.060
It is chronic.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.000
People who've had a few
episodes are likely to have more.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.040
And that the later
episodes tend to be graver,

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.530
they have more serious
symptoms, they last longer,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.230
they have more trouble responding
to whatever intervention we make.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.130 position:56%
So, we like to interrupt depression.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.570
And to me, the measure of worth
of a treatment in depression is

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.110
that it works, so that the cases
made for exercise and meditation

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.490
and yoga and a religious
counseling and so on.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.390
And the question is,
are you getting better?

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.110
And if you're not getting better,

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.700
the best tested remedies are
psychotherapy and medication.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.300
And my-- I usually
start talking to people.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.000
I want to know what's going on.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.340
And that in itself seems to
have some mitigating effect.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.240
And my measure as a doctor,

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.600
and I think the doctor really is
the instrument here, is worry.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.110
If I start worrying that
this is really solid,

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.390
that I'm not budging it, that
things are getting worse,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.740
we're falling behind,
I do tend to turn

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.480 position:56%
to medication, and it tends to work.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.900
You know, there are-- You know,

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.680
I don't know how well you
think these medicines work,

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.140
there's a figure going around
that appears in the press lately.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.820
And part of this book is
quite critically depressed

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:50.000
in how they look at research.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.980
But the figure is 30%, that
antidepressants help 30% of people.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.310
With that number which is wrong
in three ways comes from a study,

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:01.620
very terrific study,
sponsored by the NIMH,

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.700
the Institute of Mental
Health that looked at people

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:11.390
who had been depressed, on average,
for 15 years, were in the seventh

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.430
or eight episode of depression.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.590
That episode had lasted two years.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.620
Most of the patients in
addition were alcoholic

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.400
or had a second mental illness.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.050
And in those patients, the
first antidepressant tried

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.840
at ordinary doses caused
a remission.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.110
That is the episode of
depression ended in 30%.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.080 position:56%
To me, that's actually
astonishingly good figure, you know,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.260
why hadn't those patients
gotten better already.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.420
Half of them lost half
their symptoms.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:50.860
If you look in an unselected
population, primary care doctors,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.480
patients coming in, you see
much higher levels of response.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.770
So, we're not really discussing,
do people get better on this.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.100
There was a Swedish study looking

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.790
at primary care populations,
nonsuicidal people.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.660
And by six months, 90% of them had
lost half their first symptoms.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.850
So, you know, people are very
responsive to these medicines.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.960
And the controversy that the
book is about is this question

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.180
about whether depression is also
very responsive to placebo pills.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.680
I think it's not but it's
kind of a complicated story.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.980
And I try to tell it complexly
through stories from my practice,

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.410
stories about the history
of psychiatry,

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:33.710
and also some introduction to sort
of basic statistical approaches

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.900
to research, how do
we measure depression,

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.570
how do we measure change,
how do we combine studies,

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.850
what makes this thing sort of--

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:44.630
a medicine is working and how do
doctors outside psychiatry treating

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:49.190
things like diabetes and asthma and
so on think about their treatments,

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.490
you know, how do we compare.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.790
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: So,
at the risk of asking you

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.350
to boil down your entire book--

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:54.650
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: -- why doesn't
the placebo hypothesis worked up?

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Well, placebo
is very complicated, you know,

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:05.130
you go into a study and all
sorts of things happen, right?

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.280
You get a lot of attention from
doctors, time passes, you know,

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.810
you return to employment
whatever it is.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:18.500
So, you need to say, what would
happen if we hadn't given the pill.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.780
So, some people are on the pill,
some people are not on the pill.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.940
Everybody gets a little bit
better, the people on the pill tend

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.810 position:56%
to get a lot better, and the pattern

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.900
of recovery is really
different on placebo.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.080
Often, a few symptoms get better
in a lot of people on medication.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.590 position:56%
Some really don't get better at all.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.730
They don't even enjoy that
little placebo effect,

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.010
they have side effects, they're
troubled by being on the medicine

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.740
and many of them get a lot better.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.150
And so, the question first of
all is what's going on in the

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.440
"placebo arm or the trial?"

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.340
Are people responding to
their beliefs about the pill

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.820
or is it all the support?

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.900
And then the second
question is what is the--

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.780
you know, what does
the medicine add.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.830
And it turns out the
medicine adds a lot.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.800
And I call the book "Ordinarily
Well" because the level

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.890
of what's added is at the level
of what's added by, you know,

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.700
most treatments that doctors give
for most common chronic ailments,

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.240
ailments like depression.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.540
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein:
I was going to ask you

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.140
in fact the very next question.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.730
In the first book, you coined
the phrase "better than well."

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.030
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.030
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: And I
assume "ordinarily well"--

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.330
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.630
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein:
-- came from there.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.930
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Yes.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.230
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Could
you tell us about that?

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.530
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.430
So, "Listening to Prozac" is really
about the biology of personality.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.510
And it turned out when these new
antidepressants became available,

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.010
they didn't just get people
better from depression.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.170
I had patients coming
in who'd say, you know,

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.060 position:56%
I'm pass that episode of depression.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:47.220
But in addition, I'm less socially
anxious, I'm more comfortable,

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.270
I seem to be better at my
job, better at parenting.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.300
And I call that phenomena or one of
my patients really called it better

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.870
than well, he said it
was better than baseline.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.320
And I asked the other doctors and
I was writing columns for doctors

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.450
at that time and, you
know, are you seeing this?

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.080
And then I wrote about
why the biology

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.570
of these medicines might
lead to that sort of result.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.670
And it was a worrying book that is

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.540
if we could reliably
influence personalities in ways

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.690
of the Culture Awards might
doctors overstep in certain ways.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.430 position:56%
And one reason I thought I in
particular ought to write this book,

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.350
that book was about
tweaking personality

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.960
with medication, it was worrying.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.460
It was to say, those
worries don't really extend

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.770
to the core uses of medication.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.920
Depression is a really destructive
ailment, it's very common,

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.190 position:56%
we have tools to treat it if they're
quote for we are to be using them.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.110
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: We haven't
talked about side effects--

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.390
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: --
which are a huge issue--

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.690
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Yes.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.990
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein:
-- in antidepressants.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.290
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.590
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: One
of the things I didn't know

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.820
when I read the book is
that when Prozac came out,

00:16:54.820 --> 00:17:00.680
you point out that it was adored
not so much for its efficacy

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.160
but for the fact that it had
so many fewer side effects.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.460
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.900
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Can you
tell us about antidepressants

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.460 position:56%
and side effects and how much better
are we doing these days in terms

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.130
of allowing people to
be on these medications

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.430
without these side effects.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.730
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:20.540 position:56%
So, the early medicines that I write
about, one called imipramine worked.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.470
They treated depression, but
they were dangerous in overdose,

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.630
you could commit suicide
on them easily.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:32.810
And they made people feel
drugged, they give you a dry mouth,

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.970
they affected the ability
of your eyes to accommodate,

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:40.620
moving between near and far
vision, they give constipation,

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.600
urinary problems in
men particularly,

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.510
people really felt
they were on a drug.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:51.010
And I think when medicines like
Celexa and Prozac came out,

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:54.350
even doctors didn't
understand how important it was

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.990
that they had a different
side effect profile.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.720
Now, these medicines have
lots of side effects.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.210
But they-- People on them sometimes
don't feel especially they're

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:05.510
on a drug.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.030
And if you're going to be
on a medicine for, say,

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:10.710
six or nine months taking it
everyday, it's very important

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.180
that you just feel well, not that
you just feel less depressed,

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.840
but then you can go back to your
business not being always aware

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.980
if you're on a medication.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.770
These medicines have side effects.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:25.070
One that is very much of
concern to us and is written

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.150
about a lot is the possibility that
people would get more suicidal,

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.830
and even that people
who are depressed

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.780
but have not been suicidal
will, for the first time,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.030
feel suicidal on medication.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.910
It turns out this was an
overlooked side effect

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.800
of the earlier antidepressants.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.960
Once this became clear
that this was a possibility

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.090
on the new antidepressants, it was
found in the older antidepressants,

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.140
it was found in a lot of the
drugs given for epilepsy,

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.430
it turns out to be true that a
number of classes of medication

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.120
that affect transmission
of the brain have that risk

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.440
because we're complexly wired.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.680
And the medicine-- You know,
it's people who were set

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.340
up to have these transmitters
do one thing in their brain,

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.130
and not everyone has
that same pattern.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.550
So, we're-- we watch
people very closely

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.420
when they first go
on these medicines.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.390
They can cause people to
have less sexual interest,

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:22.260 position:56%
the newer antidepressants, be slower
to have orgasms, very troubling,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.770
less common in young people,

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.240
very troubling especially
to young people.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.260
And then, lots of the ordinary
side effects that you see

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.790
with many medicines like
nausea, headache and so on,

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.950
well not especially
common are, you know,

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.200
possible side effects
to these medications.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.150
So, they're not without a price.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.670
And using for a long time, there
are late-appearing side effects,

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.210
people can actually get more
apathetic and it's sort of an art

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.470
for doctors to distinguish
between apathy as a side effect

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.670
which often can be
handled or reversed

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.580
and a return of the depression.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.430
So, these are medicines
that are best used expertly.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.590
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: And yet,
it appears and it's quite common

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.680
for people to be on antidepressants
for many, many years.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.980
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Yes.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.670
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: And it's OK?

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:10.970
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.270
Well, we don't know.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.170
I mean, we've been sort of lucky.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.460
There were lots of worries
about certain biochemical events

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.220
that might happen that make these--

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.460
would make these medicines
dangerous in long-term use.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.930
That doesn't seem to have emerged.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.230
But, we don't know.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.290
I mean, this is a sort
of very large experiment.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:33.210
These medicines were developed for
people beyond six or nine months.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.620
If people had two or three
episodes of depression,

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.200 position:56%
especially if they've been suicidal,
their doctors tend to keep them

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.350
on these medicines for a long time.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:47.210
We don't know enough about
what that does but we do know

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.880
that these medicines
work for a long time.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.940
There are experiments where you
have people on these medicines

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.680
and you then, after a while,
put some people secretly

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.020 position:56%
with their permission and, you know,

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.300
awareness of the overall
experiment on placebo.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.630
And it doesn't matter how far

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:08.120
out you measure this,
weeks, months, years.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.910
People on placebo are two,
three, four times as likely

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.890
to become depressed again as
people who stay on the medicine.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:20.660
I do take people off
antidepressants all the time.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.670 position:56%
And I take them off earlier probably

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.990
than the signs I think
literature says.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.640
I'd like to watch them closely.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.790
I have the luxury in a sort of
carriage trade private practice

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:35.030
of having people come to me often,
often enough that I can watch.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.810
An institute what's called Rescue
that if people starts sleeping,

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.110 position:56%
we reinstitute antidepressants fast.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:46.750
But the truth is that depression
also is harmful, and that being

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:52.150
on the antidepressants does
seem to prevent the progression

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.760
of depression as a chronic disease.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.250
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: You raised
this in the book, but let's say,

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.930
I came to you and I
said, Dr. Kramer,

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:03.010
the antidepressants you gave me
are making me feel so much better.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.320 position:56%
How much further can you take me
towards feeling really, really good?

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.000
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer:
Right, right, right.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.110
So, I think our goal is ending
an episode of depression.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.670
It really is not revving people up

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.590
or making them more
fluent in certain ways.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:25.000
But I mean, that is a tough topic,
you know, people who say, really,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.460
I'm just functioning better
as a parent, I want to stay

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.830
on this medicine or I
want to go back on it,

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.130
how do we deal with that.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:33.430
And in "Listening to Prozac,"

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.180
I write about what I call
diagnostic bracket creep

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.220
that once we have a tool of
the hand to treat something,

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.150 position:56%
do we tend to expand our definitions
of illness, just tell ourselves

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.410
as doctors that we're
treating illnesses.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:51.070
Let me say something because we've
been talking in theoretical terms,

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.920
this book and the use of
antidepressants and psychiatry

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.720
in general is about people.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:02.180
You know, these are ailments
that really blight lives.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:07.920 position:56%
And I try to make this book
usefully complex that is doing a lot

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:12.140
of storytelling as well as talking
about data and the kinds of results

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.270
that we're discussing here.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:19.340
But what drives it, I always try
to have a certain perspective

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.890
as an author to make a
book coherent is the moment

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.250
where a patient is
sitting with a doctor

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.380
and a decision has to be made.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.010
What do we want to
inform that decision?

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:33.960
We want awareness of data, we want
our doctors to be experienced,

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.640
we want doctors to
know about our lives,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.780
you know, not just about symptoms.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:44.330 position:56%
And I think that moment is really
what I'm trying to think about aloud

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:48.760
over the, you know, course of many
pages with footnotes and so on.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.280
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: The
patient interludes are terrific,

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.580
is there a person who really
stands out in your mind

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.290 position:56%
who you would like to tell us about?

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.960
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: I
want to mention a person

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.910
that I did not see although I
had the privilege of speaking

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.300
with him who's Ray
Osheroff, his real name.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.930
And when I write this book, I
talk about starting in psychiatry,

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.420
and I've been practicing
a long time.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.460
I started seeing patients, as a
medical student, in the 1970s.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.990
And in those days, on the
medical and surgical wards,

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.200
I'm not talking even
about psychiatric wards

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.780
which were more populated in
those days, you would see people

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.740
with a kind of terrible
depression I mentioned earlier

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.800
where people were barely moving

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.350
and were muttering terrible
thoughts and had no hope at all.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.790
And I think we see less of that.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:39.420 position:56%
And when I say that, when I say that
antidepressants had been available

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.540
for 20 years and weren't being used

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.340
for those patients,
people don't believe it.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.160
And I talk about this
case of Ray Osheroff,

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.460
he was a kidney doctor living
around here, he had a practice,

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.760
he owned clinics, I guess dialysis
clinics, he became depressed,

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.300 position:56%
he was put on antidepressants, given
psychotherapy, did a little better,

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.110
really didn't believe in the meds,
came off them, did much worse

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.630
and was hospitalized here at
the nearby Chestnut Lodge.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:11.570
And the model there was
psychoanalysis and he deteriorated.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.300
And despite the pleas of
his friends and family,

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.770
he was not put back on medication.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:21.510 position:56%
He became so agitated that he needed
medical attention to his feet.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:25.370
And I spoke to him later in
life and he sent me transcripts

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.430
of team meetings, kind of the
meetings where doctors and nurses

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.130
and so on plan defeating
their patients.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:36.260 position:56%
And they said, oh, his wish to go
back to work has to do with the fact

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.280
that his rewards at work are like
a giant breast and he's, you know,

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.060
looking for the kind of warmth
he never got from his father.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.730
And finally after months
of deterioration,

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.040
he was kind of rescued by a
friend and taken to Silver Hill

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.410 position:56%
in Connecticut and given medication.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.820
He was better in a few weeks.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.440 position:56%
He was back to medical practice in
a few months and practiced medicines

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.990 position:56%
for the rest of his life, but he'd
lost-- his primary medical practice,

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:10.310
lost a lot of money, his marriage
ended and he sued Chestnut Lodge.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.580
And that's why we know about this

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.620
because they were experts
on both sides.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.910
We interviewed him
and reported that.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:21.000
And the result of the
case is complicated,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.300
I go through it in the book.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.900
But effectively, he won
and in a settlement.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.910
And that caused a lot
of trouble in psychiatry

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.490
because it caused hospital
administrators to say, look,

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.030
you can't just treat these
patients with psychotherapy.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.120
You have to give medication.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.770
Therapists were insulted
that their way

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:43.830
of seeing things was
being shortcut and so on.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.380
And so, this turned out
to be an important case.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.960
But when I spoke to Ray
Osheroff late in life

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.480
and he'd never had an episode
of depression again like this

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.730
and had been on medication
all his life.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:59.040
He said the literature of torture
is most relevant, you know.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.380
That this was not really--
that depression, he said,

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.640
is wimp of a word, you don't
understand what it was he was

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.940
going through.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:11.070
But it really is the case that
these medicines were not used,

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.810
on a principle basis, were
not used until after that.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:18.720
And in a way, well, after that,
they weren't used regularly even

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.340
for very severe depression.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.390
So, it is that kind of story that
motivates the book that worries

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.430
over that sort of dismissal
of these medicines.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: I bet people
are ready to ask you some questions.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:37.170
Is there anybody who
would like to ask?

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.020
&gt;&gt; Dr. Kramer, I have
a question about people

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:52.180
who don't respond very well
to-- at-- to the initial--

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.480
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.650
&gt;&gt; -- medication that's
prescribed and maybe to try two

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:59.340
or three different ones and maybe
other certain group of people

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.950
who don't seem to respond
to any of them.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.200
I was just wondering, is
there something that you see

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.730
that these non-responders have
in common or someway to kind

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:16.470
of understand how to perceive with
people that have that presentation?

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.770
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.930
So, the question is
about non-responders.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:24.410
And, you know, sadly, there are
people who don't respond at all.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:29.450
And we have enormous need for-- to
anything that is the psychotherapy,

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.600
medicines, combinations
of medication.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.010
There're few but they're-- but
because the disorder is so common,

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:40.730
there're many of them if you
want on a percentage basis.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:46.410 position:56%
And, you know, sadly, for all sorts
of reasons, big pharma has retreated

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.390
from development of drugs
in mental health altogether.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:52.520
And in the book, I write about
lots of promising avenues.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.270
I mentioned really lots of
promising avenues for research.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:00.120
But it's sort of mom-and-pop
garage band, sort of a research

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.730
where small companies
try to get this attention

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:05.770
to these potential remedies.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:08.350
And, of course, lots of
them fall by the wayside.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:12.720
But there isn't really the--
aren't really the resources devoted

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.480
to this problem that
there should be.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.370
That said, I do also write
about some interesting studies

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.580
that I think the press
has undercovered.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.000
And one of them was done by a
consortium of universities, Rush,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.230
University of Pennsylvania,
Vanderbilt.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:31.070
And what they did was really
interesting, they took patients

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.300
and they allowed the patients
in the study I mentioned,

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.970
fairly chronic patients well
along in the course of depression,

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.630
and they said to pharmacologists,
do your worst, you know,

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:44.180 position:56%
this is not normally what's
studied, this was a pragmatic study,

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.990
you couldn't have placebos
on the other side,

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.770
there was nothing comparable.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.510
They just said, raise the dose
of the medicine, if you want,

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:54.070
change it, add a second
medicine, add a third medicine.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:58.640
And half of the patients also were
given very intensive psychotherapy.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.090
And although the press
report of the opposite,

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:05.530 position:56%
the truce was that you didn't see a
lot of effect from the psychotherapy

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.070
because the medicine did so well.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.580
It turns out that if you
let doctors, skilled doctors

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.110
and they were these kind of senior
advisors for the junior doctors

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:19.000
in the study really try to
treat depression assertively,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.130
you get most people to respond and
you get most of them to stay well

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.170
for the length of time that they
looked which was six months.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.660
But it took some people
18 months to get better.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:34.080
So, this wasn't, you know,
kind of an easy process.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.280
And, of course, it is also
possible since they were--

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.740
it wasn't comparison
group that in 18 months,

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.660
a lot of people get
better on their own.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.340
But this wasn't a very
chronic group that hadn't--

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.200
on the whole, the patients hadn't
gotten better on their own.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.930
So, I think one lesson from that
and as I say, it's upsetting to me

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:55.210
that I think the press really is
happier to cover debunking stories

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:58.560
that there have been, you know,
errors in assessing these medicines

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.880
so they don't really work.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.850
But the studies in which they
are showing to work tend not

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.700
to get the covers that they should.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.420
And it turns out most
people, if they--

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.410
almost everyone is stuck with
the program, and of course,

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.710
disappointed, people drop out.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:15.020
But almost everyone who sticks with
the program really does do better

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:19.030
and manage to stay outside
of depression for a while.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:24.030
And even those people who didn't
do well on the whole didn't return

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.330
to their baseline of depression,

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:29.350
it's just that they started
accumulating some symptoms again.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:34.800
So, I think things are more
hopeful maybe than we imagine.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.580
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Do
we have someone over here?

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:41.600
&gt;&gt; Yes. Couldn't you preface
through your comments with the fact

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.380
that doctors usually sit down
with the patient for an hour

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.970
and get the history before
any medication is prescribed?

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.270
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Oh yes.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:54.050
You know, should people be
well evaluated before medicines

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:55.350
are prescribed?

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.220
And, you know, my own
practice isn't just an hour.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.820
I may be with people
for an hour a week

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.900
after week before we
decide to give a medicine.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.560
We may know each other pretty well.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.930
But, you know, lots of
things cause depression.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.660
Early in this book, I read
about someone who has a disorder

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.250
of the hormonal gland,
thyroid disorder.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.720
And the question is whether
that's causing the depression.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.020
So, you need, you know, a good
evaluation that involves maybe

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:24.540
in addition to-- interviewed--
in the course of the interview,

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.630
you may decide you ought
to be giving blood tests

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.420
and taking blood tests,
evaluating people.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:33.800
People really-- You know, this,
when we take the perspective

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.140
that this is a medical disorder

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.300
which of course isn't the only
perspective on depression,

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.250
"Against Depression," the
earlier book of mine from 2005 is

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.420
about how we conceptualize
depression altogether.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.780
But if we take it as a medical
disorder, we really have

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.290
to evaluate it as a
medical disorder.

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:54.190
That said, I'm not
one of these people

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.450
who think primary care
doctors do so badly with this.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:01.440 position:56%
There has been an enormous effort
on the part of governmental agencies

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.860
and nonprofits to make general
doctors aware of depression.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.550
I think they're better
at assessing it,

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.500
they're better at recognizing it.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.260
And that although we worry about
the overuse of this medicine,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.990
on the whole, the fact that
depression is getting recognized

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:21.020
and treated is probably
for the good.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:25.310
And I certainly find people coming
to me who've only been treated say

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:29.340
by a gynecologist or whatever who
come in and they said, you know,

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.860
it's not just that I'm a
little better on this medicine,

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.720
it's that I see my
marriage differently.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.600
I see that it wasn't all my wife
that I had some contribution

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.660
that there's some loosening up
of perspective as takes place

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:45.070
in psychotherapy sometimes in
a good response to medication.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:52.440
So, I'm kind of on the optimistic
side about a broader group

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.980
of doctors using these medicines

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.870
because we simply don't
have that many specialists.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.170
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Sir?

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'd really be
interested in your thoughts on some

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.230
of the new rapid-acting
antidepressants like ketamine,

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:10.460
it seem to have activity
after a single administration.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.760
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.680
&gt;&gt; And even some reports that
they block suicidal ideation.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.980
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:20.080
So, there's a lot of interest in a
drug that was used as an anesthetic

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.050
and misused as a party drug
called ketamine which is given

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.860
through injections into the muscle

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:30.710
or intravenously dripped
into the veins.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:39.040 position:56%
And it was first used in people with
very severe hospitalized patients

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.340
with very severe depression.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:42.820 position:56%
And some of them got better rapidly.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.480
And drug companies are interested
in this drug and they're trying

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:50.050
to get medicines that can be
taken by mouth or can be used

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:53.760
as a nasal spray even that would
have some of these effects.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.830
And, you know, this seems
like a promising treatment.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.990
I'm a little concerned that it's
being used widely before it's

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:03.290
well tested.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:07.730
There are some early
worries that people who are--

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:11.590
who do respond to this after
a time stop responding to it

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.430
and stop responding in ways
that are fairly dramatic.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:17.880
So, 'we don't really yet
know enough about ketamine.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.910
But as I said, there a number
of things on the horizon

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:24.350
that seemed to be faster-acting.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:29.460 position:56%
And the National Institute of Mental
Health has a special pot of money

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:34.720
that it uses to encourage research
into faster-acting antidepressants

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.560
because there's a lot
of risk in the time

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:42.640 position:56%
between when a doctor sees a patient
first and when the medicines work,

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.680
a lot of risky things
like suicide and other,

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.530
you know, dramatic negative acts.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.250
So, we're very interested in that.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.520
That said, the antidepressants
we have

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.120
to had now do do things very early.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:01.550
I write about a doctor at Oxford
in England who has used a test

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:05.440 position:56%
of perception, how do you evaluate
kind of pictures and which you ought

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.690
to see helpful things but
depressed people might not.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.680
And he's giving people half
doses of antidepressants,

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:16.950
and within three hours,
their outlook changes

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.500
and their self-assessment.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.060
So, there are some early effects.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.810
And one of the theories about
how these medicines work is

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:28.060
that they loosen up the brain in
some way, but a lot of what goes

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.140
on in recovery from the
depression is in the world

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.140
that is you start calling your
friends again, you start putting

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.180
in more effort at work, people will
reward that so that there's sort

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:44.650
of a virtuous dialectic between
the chemical action and the social

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.880
and psychological action
of these medicines.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.530
But we do get some
effect very early.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.140
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: I
think we have someone here.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Could you
speak to the subject

00:36:54.780 --> 00:37:01.260
of how some people have
trouble taking generic forms

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:06.040
of antidepressants and when
doctors try to write a note

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.480
to pharmaceutical companies
to override that,

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.990
it's been my experience that more
and more often they're rejected.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:15.290
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.590
&gt;&gt; What is it about the generics?

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.890 position:56%
And I know the difference maybe on--

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:24.120
between the generic and the
one that was originally patent.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.340
But I'm just wondering, are
you aware of this as a problem

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.760
because I see it quite a bit?

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.060
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Yes.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.370
I mean, doctors worry
when a medicine goes

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:37.750
from a company primarily making it
to a generic manufacture making it

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:40.920
that the standards of the
Food and Drug Administration

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.910
for what constitutes equivalence
are either loose or even

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.900
when they're fairly
demanding that down the road,

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:54.140
not enough drugs are retested so
that people on the generic don't do

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.860
as well as they did when
they were on brand name drug.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.030
On the other hand, of
course, we're very worried

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.840
if doctors are being
influenced by advertising

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.690 position:56%
and prescribing brand name drugs and
making medical care more expensive

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:08.130
where generics are just as good.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.860
And the answer is it just really
is not enough science on this,

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.980
but every doctor sees it, you know,
of course where it's dramatic is

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:20.670
in neurology where drug
against epilepsy becomes generic

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.500
and doesn't work as well and
people start having seizures again.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.530
You know, you see that whereas
when people kind of fade

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:29.780 position:56%
into having more depressive
symptoms and become more depressive.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.270
It's not as dramatic and
as hard to know about.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:38.170
I think with Wellbutrin which is a
drug that works by different means,

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:42.250
Bupropion, when that became
generic, there were patients

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.110
who certainly said they
weren't doing as well on it.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:50.520
I have patients who are on
the brand name of Wellbutrin.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.110 position:56%
On the other hand, lots of people
do well on the generic when Concerta

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:59.860
which is a complicated form
of Ritalin that kids use

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.530
because it has a certain
curve of release.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:06.610
So, it kind of covers [inaudible]
very well became generic.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:10.600
I noticed in adult patients
that it wasn't working as well.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.380
And the pharmacists reassured
me and then the FDA did say

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.780
that the generic-- three

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.060
of the manufacturers weren't
doing a good enough job

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.590 position:56%
and they had to sort of rejigger it.

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:24.100
But the generic still doesn't
have the same engineering

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.400
that the brand name has.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.730 position:56%
So, you know, we do worry about that
and it's across all of medicine.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:31.730
And frankly, not enough
is known about it.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:36.480
It's hard to know what is patient's
anxiety and what is biochemistry.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.440
&gt;&gt; That supports what
I've read so far.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.310
So, that sounds occurring.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.640
Thank you.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.050
&gt;&gt; I see situations
where people say that--

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:52.040
or think that psychotherapy is
ineffective or doesn't exist

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.650
or seen inadequate in some way.

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:59.670
And I wonder if maybe the situation
is that it's very difficult

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.090
or it's often done
poorly or inadequately.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:07.640
And it's still important to
understand oneself and people

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.790
in at least a theoretical way.

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.090
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:13.560
So, I want to extend this question

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.630
about whether psychotherapy
is always done well

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:21.730
and whether people not doing well
in psychotherapy is effective,

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:25.040
the expertise say or the match
between doctor and patient rather

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.990
than inherently psychotherapy not
having a potential be effective

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.300
for that patient.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.560
And I want to take this on a
little slightly different direction

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.140
which is really antidepressants
have been well tested.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.400
And if these complicated critics
where they say well, you know,

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.460
maybe some studies haven't
been published and we can look

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.430
at the data and see a
pattern that says that

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:49.390
and if we imagine we had
all the studies, they,

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:51.640
which are themselves
to be less effective.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.010
And even under those conditions,
antidepressants look effective.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:41:00.600
But psychotherapy, when it's put to
the same test, really does poorly.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.440
It does seem to be the case that
when you study psychotherapy,

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.410
when people have good results,
they like to publish them,

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:08.600
when they have bad results,
they don't like to publish them.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.020
So, you get a very
distorted literature.

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:15.780
That said, it's really
hard to test psychotherapy.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:19.080
You don't know whether the doctors
are well trained and you don't have

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.580
that advantage of people saying,
I don't just like this therapist,

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.980
I'm going to a different one.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.670 position:56%
You know, in this study, you're kind
of stuck with the person you have.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.560
It's free, you're glad
to have it, you know,

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.370
but it's maybe not the
person you would have chosen.

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.170
And maybe it's not that taking
[inaudible] psychotherapy is going

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:35.470
to work best for you.

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:39.960
So, I think that research really
under measures the efficacy

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.010
of psychotherapy which I
find, you know, in my practice

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:47.620
to be extremely useful and
really, sustaining for people even

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.000
where they do labs back
into anxiety or depression

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.780
that the psychotherapy
seems to be helpful

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:58.250
in keeping them afloat while they
have a return of some symptoms.

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.910
So, I'm a big fan of psychotherapy.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:06.820
And I do think it is, you
know, very hard to measure.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.460
Lots of things in medicine
are hard to measure.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.220
I mean, I hope this book is
amusing as well as serious.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.490
And there are some
amusing things that happen,

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:18.810
you won't find this amusing,
but there was a study

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:21.060
of these surgical checklists,
you know,

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:26.350 position:56%
where you catechize the doctors and
make sure they got all these sponges

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.860
out of the patient before they
close them up that, you know,

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.830
there were these analyses that
combined lots of small studies

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:37.420
and showed that 60%
fewer patients died

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.390
when you're at surgical checklist.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:43.150
And then finally, when they
did a large study in Canada,

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.690
they required everyone in
Toronto to use the checklist,

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:48.760
and the researchers were able
to look at what happened before

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.540
and after the checklist
were introduced,

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.220
there was no difference at all.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.360
And probably, the story
was, you know, first of all,

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.780
maybe they were adopted more
willingly in other places

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.950
and maybe they're being forced to
adopt and it wasn't as helpful.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:06.600
But mainly, hospital systems
that introduced new methods

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.280
and had more people die
didn't publish the articles.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.280
So, you had, you know, an
enormous bias in the literature.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:19.240
And, you know, I think in
general, I hope in this book,

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.810
I'm educating people about how

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:24.930
to read not just technical
scientific articles but articles

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:27.340
in the Washington Post, the
New York Times and, you know,

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.160
online and all the things
that pass through your Twitter

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.750
and Facebook feeds, how to
read them skeptically and think

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.460
if this study had come
out differently,

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.290 position:56%
would it have been published at all.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:40.320
So, yes.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.120
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: I know
we have a time keeper here.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.660
Are we-- Do we have
time for couple more?

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:51.150
I'm going to go with yes.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.980
&gt;&gt; Doctor, you mentioned anxiety
just a moment ago and I wonder

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:59.730
if you could talk about
whether treating anxiety

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:04.720
as depression is an
effective way to treat it.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.360
And if you've got a very anxious
person who was too anxious

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.390
to take medication, have you had
experience with a patient like that

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:14.690
and how do you address that?

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:15.990
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:17.780
So, you know, I'm not
writing much about anxiety.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.650
But the genetics of
anxiety and the genetics

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:22.870
of depression looked very similar.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:27.350
The reasons why some
people get anxious

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.570
and some people get
depressed are debated.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:33.410
But they're-- they may well
be out in the world reasons

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:35.300
as well as genetic reasons.

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:40.420
And these medicines work
well for depression.

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.490
They are less addictive and
they have less of that sense

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:47.980
of you're anxiously coming
off them after four hours

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:52.770
than do the medicines uniquely
given for depression like Librium

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:55.930
and Valium and, you know,
in the old days, Miltown.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:59.990
And so, doctors like to get
people on antidepressants.

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:03.430
When people are very prone to
anxiety, it can be hard to get them

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:10.540
on antidepressants because they can
get more anxious in the short run,

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.150
and that's very hard to tolerate.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:14.480
And in addition, they may
be anxious about the thought

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.570
of taking maybe phobic say
or obsessive in some way

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:21.890
that prevents them from
wanting to take medication.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:23.540
So, that's sort of an art.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:27.970
Doctors use very small
doses, build up slowly.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:33.970
But in general, these can
be very good for anxiety.

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:36.550
And an area that I
also don't talk a lot

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:39.880
about in this book is treating
children and adolescents.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.160
And these medicines were less
good at treating depression

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.870
in children and adolescents.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:48.940
There may be more risk of suicide.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:53.170
The risk of suicide is very low,
but the multiplication of the risk

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:57.540 position:56%
of suicide by these medicines may be
greater in children and adolescents.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:03.080
And yet, they are used for a
good reason, but where they test

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:06.320
that very well is anxiety
in children and adolescents.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:10.320
And it's not that I'm recommending
medicating children and adolescents

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.280
for complicated story
developing brain

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.700
but when children really are
not reaching their developmental

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.130
milestones, they're not
interacting with other kids

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:22.130
or they're not learning in school,
they're not able to go to school,

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.960
you know, it turns out that
these medicines are very useful

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.620
in anxiety in younger group.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:28.920
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: Last two.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, hi there.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:35.540
Depression runs in my family and
we're pretty enthusiastic consumers

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.860
of SSRIs and atypical
antidepressants.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:41.370
But I have a nephew who
wasn't getting better

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:43.550
and they did a genetic
test on him and found

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:47.520
out that he has a genetic
defect through modification

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.140
that affects liver enzymes that
make the most the antidepressants

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.740
completely ineffective for him.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.040
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.650
&gt;&gt; And he's now being
treated with ketamine.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:56.950
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:58.710
&gt;&gt; I wonder if you can comment on
that and also in the possibility

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:01.770
that genetic testing could improve
the treatment of depression.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.070
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: Right.

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:08.500 position:56%
So, genetic testing, there are
already labs that do genetic testing

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.260
that say that they
can increase the odds

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.630
that you'll accurately select
an antidepressant for someone.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.160
Largely, the genetics we're talking

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.650
about are the genetics you're
talking about which is enzymes

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.690
and how the body breaks
down these chemicals.

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:25.610
So then if you break
them down very rapidly,

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:27.940
you may not be getting
much antidepressant,

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.480
you've been taking a lot of pills.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.810
And if you break them down slowly,
you may be at risk of getting a lot

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:35.720
of side effects even on a low dose.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:40.390
But really what we want, in
addition to that, is the genetics

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:44.760
of drug response so that if-- when
you are getting the proper dose

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:49.620
into your brain, are you likely
to respond based on your genetics.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:55.430
There is some of that testing, it--
it's at a level where, you know,

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:59.460
over just having your doctor choose
it randomly if that where how he

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:04.440 position:56%
or she would choose it, you know, if
you gave 12 people a genetic test,

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.220
you'd get one more response
than by eyeballing it.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:11.230
Doctors maybe can do better
than random also on their own

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:13.770
so maybe 1 in12 is not enough.

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:17.960
But I think it-- you
know, it is in the future.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:21.370
And I think doctors are sometimes
setting off blood samples

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.300
in really nonresponsive people.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.570
The Mayo Clinic, I
know, does some of this.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:31.910
So, it is available, you know,
in these refractory cases.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:35.620
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein: OK, that
seems like a good place to--

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.920
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer: All right.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.220
All right.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.520
&gt;&gt; Leonard Bernstein:
-- to finish off.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.330
Thank you very much for being
with us Dr. Peter Kramer.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.510
The book is "Ordinarily Well."

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:47.550
[ Applause ]

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.670
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Kramer:
Thank you, good.

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:55.240
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
