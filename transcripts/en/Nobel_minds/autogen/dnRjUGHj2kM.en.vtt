electronics and so people are thinking

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190
electronics and so people are thinking
 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.580
electronics and so people are thinking
about new type of technology to heal the

and this spintronics see one of the way

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000
and this spintronics see one of the way
 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.710
and this spintronics see one of the way
and in particular spinto agrees

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720
and in particular spinto agrees
 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.090
and in particular spinto agrees
