00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:08.641
[whistle shrills]

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:14.213
- I got it! I got it!
I got it!

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:15.948
- Whoa!

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:17.050
- Could be worse.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.085
She could have been at Baylor.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:21.187
That's Ashley,
and if we go to the replay,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.423
we will see
that she did not have it.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.124
This is what happens

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:27.560
when you're on the sideline
at the Auburn-LSU game

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:29.262
and you think
you can shag kickoffs

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.764
from a Lou Groza Award finalist.

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.633
College football gives people

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.901
who couldn't get
into a decent school

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.369
something to be proud of.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:38.237
Game days are a rich tradition

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.406
of tailgating
with other alcoholics

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.575
and screaming obscenities
at 19-year-olds.

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:44.077
The coaches make millions,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.611
the schools make billions,

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:48.714
and the players earn meaningless
communications degrees.

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:50.083
Some equate it to slavery,

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.752
which explains why the South
loves it so much.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:54.620
In those parts,
the only thing a father and son

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.289
enjoy throwing around
more than a football

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.924
is the N word.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:01.494
99% of all college players
won't make it to the NFL,

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:03.563
which means there's
a medical reason

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.332
why all the employees
at a certain rental car chain

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.101
are suicidal.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.735
But there's no denying
Ashley's a gal

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.504
who can take a hit to the face,

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.639
so you know the NFL
came a-callin'.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:14.807
That's why I put her

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.409
on the first turnip truck
out of Auburn,

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:17.910
accompanied her to the draft,

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:20.279
and happily took
my 60% commission

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:21.614

Web Redemption.

Ashley!

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:36.963
Hey!

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.297
Superagent Daniel Rosenhaus.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.832
How are you? Nice suit.

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:41.367
Does Ellen know
you borrowed it?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.269 align:end position:100%
- Everybody at the draft
wears this.

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:45.605 align:start position:0%

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.707 line:0%

00:01:58.317 --> 00:01:59.952
You're no Tagliabue!

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:01.487
Ashley.
- Hello.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.055
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:04.490
- You look great.
- Thank you.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:06.025
- Did you bust open your nose?

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:07.860
- I did not.
No injuries.

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:08.895
- Didn't even bleed?
- Nope.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:10.029 align:start position:0%
- You can take a hit.

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:12.031
<i> - [laughs] I can.</i>

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:12.965
- All right,
where are you from?

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:13.799
- I'm from Chicago originally,

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:15.201
right outside of Chicago.

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:16.169
- What would possess
a girl from Chicago

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.803
to go to school in Alabama?

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:19.238
- It's a family school,
so it goes way back

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:20.640
on my mom's side
of the family.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:21.374
- What do you do in Auburn?

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:25.011
- Go mudding.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.546
- You go mudding?
- Yeah.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.681
- Is that just in a truck?
- In a truck, yeah.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:30.716
- Put it in four-wheel drive
and just go through the mud?

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.018
- Yeah, that's about
all there is to do.

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:33.052
- That's fun, though?

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.221
- Yeah. It can be.

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:36.355
- Tell me about what happened
that day.

00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:37.723
- Well, I made a bet
with the managers

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:39.158
on the football team

00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:40.359 align:end position:100%
that I would be able
to catch the ball.

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:42.595 align:start position:0%
- Oh, this wasn't just, like,
a random--oh.

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:44.330
<i> - The kicker for Auburn</i>

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:45.498

<i> - Got you.</i>

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:47.867
<i> - So I sat there
 and waited for it.</i>

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.102
I got it! I got it!
- Whoa!

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:52.071
- When it hit your face,
what did you feel?

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:53.873
- Nothing.
It was a blur.

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:56.776
I fell back, and I was like,
"Oh, my gosh."

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:57.944
- I mean,
do you hate the fact

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:01.013
that if you Google
"girls balls to face"

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:03.216
that you're one
of the first results?

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.084
- I don't think I've ever
Googled it, so...

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:07.220
[cell phone rings]
- Mm!

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.254
Hello!

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:09.222
[whispering] Jets.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.389
[laughs]

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:12.024
Absolutely not!

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:13.392
My client's not going to a team

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.428
that drafted Mark Sanchez
fifth overall.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.796
Ugh!

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.097
Other than going to Auburn,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.932 align:start position:0%
what other bad decisions
have you made?

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:21.133
- Coming on this show.

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:22.401
- Ah!

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:24.203
Are you proud of the fact
that you were

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:26.572
the only highlight
from Auburn football in 2016?

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:28.140
- [laughs]

00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:29.308
- You ever dated
a football player?

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:30.610
- I actually am dating
a football player.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:31.811 align:start size:63% position:38%
He played at Auburn.

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:32.878
- What about the concussions?

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:33.946
Do you worry about that at all?

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:34.981
- I've thought about it,

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.049
but football is a hard sport.

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:39.318
I mean...
- I enjoy watching it so much.

00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:41.821
Never had a desire
to play a single down.

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.055
- Probably for the best.
- Right?

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:44.423
- Yeah.
- I'm pretty frail.

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:45.925
- Yeah.
- Oh, but agile.

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.226 align:start size:31% position:69%
- [laughs]

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.561
- You know, my mom,
to this day--

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:49.495
I don't know how old she is.

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:50.763
God, she's old.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.164 align:start position:0%
But she still thinks
she could be

00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:53.833
a running back in the NFL.

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.234
She's like, "Oh, no,
I just have an ability

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:57.236
"to juke and get out
of the way.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.138
I don't think people
could catch me."

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:01.240
And I always find that
fascinating,

00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:04.110
that this old woman still thinks
she could be in the NFL.

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:05.945
[cell phone rings]
Ooh.

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:06.946
Hello!

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.514
[laughing] Rex Ryan.

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:10.283
You're not even
in football anymore.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:13.352
Enjoy trying to sell
your town house in Buffalo.

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:15.521
Do you think there'll ever be
a female in the NFL?

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.990
- With the way that we're going
in society, probably.

00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:20.192
- Oh, think it's society that's
keeping women out of football?

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:22.461 align:start position:0%
You don't think
it's their skill set?

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:24.163
- Okay, I feel like there
would be a good kicker.

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.865
- I mean, they've tried,
and they always choke.

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:28.367
That girl up in Detroit?
Oh!

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.202
<i> Finally they got her
 the audition.</i>

00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:32.204
<i> She couldn't kick from 30.</i>

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:33.873
Ah, embarrassing.

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:35.441
[cell phone rings]
Ooh.

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:36.876
Been waiting for this one.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.778
[bleep] you, Belichick.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:41.480
Why don't you go write
another love letter to Trump?

00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:43.549
Did they do standard
concussion protocol on you?

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:45.351
- Yeah, they had one
of the team's doctors

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:46.352
come over and check me out.

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:47.620
- From Auburn?
- Yeah.

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:49.155
- Okay, so did they either
rub tobacco on you

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:50.189
or just pray over you?

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:52.525
- I would say both.
- I just assume

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.460
that's what's going on
down in Alabama.

00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:55.528
- Bible Belt.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.163
- Is prayer mandatory
in your school?

00:04:57.196 --> 00:05:00.066
- It is not, but I would say
95% of people probably do.

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.468 align:start position:0%
- Uh-huh. There's nothing
wrong with praying.

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.171
I mean, it doesn't work,
but, man, nothing like

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:07.239
making sure your food
gets a little colder.

00:05:07.272 --> 00:05:10.676
I'm not a fan of the families
that do the hand-holding prayer.

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:12.345
- My family does
hand-holding prayer.

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.347
- It's uncomfortable.
- Brings you closer, though.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.848
- I hear you,
but then I have to talk

00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:17.350
about how soft
my hands are.

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:18.751
- Yeah, see,
my hands get sweaty.

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:20.219 size:84% position:42%
- You got the sweaty palms?

00:05:20.252 --> 00:05:22.221 size:75% position:38%
I had a buddy in college
that had sweaty palms.

00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:23.989 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Yeah, it's embarrassing.

00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:24.990 align:start position:0%
- Really?

00:05:25.023 --> 00:05:26.992
You can take medication
for it.

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:29.495
- I've done everything.
I did electroshock water.

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:31.197
- Do guys comment
when they hold your hands

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.198
for the first time?

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:33.699
- No, what--
I mean, who would

00:05:33.732 --> 00:05:34.934
say something to you
about that?

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.435
- I would, because it'd be
a deal breaker

00:05:36.468 --> 00:05:37.737
if we didn't discuss it.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.004
- What?
- It's gross.

00:05:39.037 --> 00:05:40.406
- I can't help it.
- I know.

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:41.507
People can't help
a lot of things

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.608
that you're not
attracted to.

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:44.243
We'd have to talk about it.

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:45.444
- Okay, that's fair.
- We'd have to be comfortable.

00:05:45.477 --> 00:05:46.712
