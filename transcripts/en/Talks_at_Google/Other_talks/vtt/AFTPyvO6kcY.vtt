JESS: Hi, everyone.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.710
Hello.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.090
Welcome to Authors at Google.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.470
So, as you all know,
over the past decade,

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.132
Steve Jobs has changed
the way that we

00:00:22.132 --> 00:00:23.965
think about giving
presentations by modeling

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:28.441
a new form of interaction
types of presentations.

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.480
Today, we are going to
hear from the man that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.549
taught the world how
to be like Steve Jobs.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.525
He has watched hundreds of
hours of footage of TED talks,

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:39.047
and today, he's doing
it again-- teaching

00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:40.640
us all how to talk like TED.

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.070
Carmine Gallo.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.530
CARMINE GALLO:All right.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.071
Thanks, Jess.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.080
Good afternoon.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.490
Hello, everyone.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.150
I feel like I have a lot
of microphones on me today.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.380
There's multiple streams going
on, and that's why the mics.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.980
This is such an honor for
me to be speaking at Google.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.830
First of all, thank you
for changing the world.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.370
That's astonishing and must
be an amazing experience

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.261
to work here.

00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:10.260
That's what I want to
talk to you about today is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.450
world changing ideas.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.190
How many of you have good ideas?

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.790
How many of you think
you've got a good idea?

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.290
OK, most of you.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.230
Your ideas are
your currency now.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.430
Your ideas are the currency
of the 21st century.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.160
In the information age,
the knowledge economy,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.570
you're only as successful
as your ability

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.160
to communicate your
ideas persuasively.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.280
How do you do that?

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.690
I believe that there are
three fundamental laws

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.450
of communications-- laws that I
learned after studying hundreds

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.080
and hundreds of TED talks and
also analyzing and interviewing

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.070
some of the most famous
TED presenters of our time.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.740
Now, it's not just me who says
that communication skills are

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.520
so important.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.930
Ben Horowitz is a very
well-known local venture

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.340
capitalist.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.670
With Andreessen Horowitz, who's
behind Facebook and Twitter

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.018
and many other companies as
well, and obviously many of you

00:02:07.018 --> 00:02:09.699
know him as a
substantial investor.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.970
He was at South by Southwest
and he gave us this quote.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.800
"Storytelling is the
most underrated skill

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.360
when it comes to
entrepreneurship."

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.230
he was speaking specifically
to entrepreneurs.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.980
Storytelling-- the ability to
tell your story convincingly,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.340
persuasively, in a way
that really engages me--

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.970
that's going to be your value.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.090
That's going to help you
stand out in all of the noise

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.170
and to stand out and move your
brand forward and your careers

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.760
forward.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.210
Ben Horowitz believes that.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.040
I certainly believe that.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.010
And this gentleman
believes that.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.020
You may have seen him
before-- Warren Buffett,

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.610
the billionaire.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.870
Listen to this
audio clip where he

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.460
is telling a group of
business students--

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.720
I believe this was
Columbia University--

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.750
he's talking to a group
of business students.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.430
Listen to the value
that he places

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.934
on communication skills
and public speaking.

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:08.600
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.279
-Right now I would
pay $100,000 for 10%

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:14.820
of the future earnings
of any of you.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.861
So if anyone wants to see
me after this is over--

00:03:16.861 --> 00:03:19.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:24.092 --> 00:03:26.686
If that's true, if you're a
million-dollar asset right now,

00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:29.342
right, if 10% of you
is worth $100,000?

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:31.583
You could improve-- many
of you, and I certainly

00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:35.152
could have when I got
out, just in terms

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:36.812
of learning
communication skills.

00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:38.306
It's not something
that is taught.

00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:39.924
I actually went to a
Dale Carnegie course

00:03:39.924 --> 00:03:41.044
later on in terms
of public speaking.

00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:43.784
But if you improve your value
50% by having communication

00:03:43.784 --> 00:03:47.270
skills, that's another $500,000
in terms of capital value.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.756
See me after the class
and I'll pay you $150,000.

00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:53.420
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.400
CARMINE GALLO: Why
would he say that?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.050
Because Daniel Pink, a noted
author, has recently observed,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.700
"like it or not, we're
all in sales now."

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.180
That means that
you are constantly

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.640
selling yourself and selling
your ideas internally

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.700
and externally.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.130
It's the 21st century.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.980
We have new models of
communication, don't we?

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.950
We communicate in photos,
videos, 140-character tweets.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.950
Well, I believe that a 21st
century model of communication

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.370
requires 21st century
techniques, which

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.720
is why I turned my lens
from Steve Jobs, who

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.830
was one individual-- and
in my opinion, the greatest

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.050
corporate storyteller
we've ever had--

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.800
and I turned my focus
onto TED, the TED talks.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.530
TED, even though I'm
independent, I'm objective,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.520
I'm not affiliated
with that conference,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.570
I've worked with
many TED speakers.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.050
I've interviewed TED speakers.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.175
I've analyzed 150 hours
worth of TED content

00:04:55.175 --> 00:04:57.120
and I've categorized it.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.740
And I think I know why the
best TED talks go viral.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.450
But more importantly for
all of us in the room

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.850
is what can we learn
from the world's greatest

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.290
presenters and speakers
that we can apply

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.800
to make our message, our
pitch, more persuasive, more

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.590
convincing?

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.710
Especially if you
only have-- let's

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.120
say you don't have 18 minutes.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.300
You have five minutes
to convince your boss

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.690
to back your idea.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.160
How do you get it across?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.210
How do you persuade?

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.350
That's what we're going
to talk about today.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.540
I believe that there are
three fundamental components

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.260
that all inspirational
communication has.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.790
Any time there is a
conversation, a presentation,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.230
a pitch that we
consider persuasive,

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.140
these are the three
components that they have.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.470
They are emotional-- that
conversation is emotional.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.660
You have to touch my heart
before you reach my head.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.360
Those conversations are novel.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.610
They teach me something new.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.830
And finally, they're
also memorable.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.140
It doesn't matter.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.579
Your idea doesn't matter if I
can't remember what you said.

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:08.620
So we're going to talk
about each one one by one.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.960
Let's talk about emotional.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.360
How do we make ideas emotional?

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.370
First, passion.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.220
Passion is everything.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.290
You cannot inspire unless
you're inspired yourself.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.000
It's also important
for your career.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.740
Dr. Larry Smith gave a
very famous TEDx event.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.540
He is a University of
Waterloo economics professor.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.150
He's been studying passion and
entrepreneurship for decades.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.890
And he says passion is
the thing, the thing that

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.210
will help you create the highest
expression of your talent.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.020
I asked him after his TED
talk, I asked Dr. Smith,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.710
how do you identify passion?

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.146
This all sounds good,
and I agree with it.

00:06:49.146 --> 00:06:50.270
But how do you identify it?

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.450
What is it when we
say, that person

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.850
is passionate about something?

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.210
I want to follow my passion.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.880
That sounds so cliche.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.040
What exactly does that mean.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.110
He pointed me to an excerpt
from his now-famous TED talk,

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.060
and here's what he says
about what passion means.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.263
Probably the best
definition I've heard.

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:10.742
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:10.742 --> 00:07:12.714
-Passion is your greatest love.

00:07:12.714 --> 00:07:18.040
Passion is the thing that will
help you create the highest

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.123
expression of your talent.

00:07:19.123 --> 00:07:22.468
Passion, interest, it's
not the same thing.

00:07:22.468 --> 00:07:24.217
Are you really going
to go to your sweetie

00:07:24.217 --> 00:07:27.011
and say, marry me,
if you're interested?

00:07:31.448 --> 00:07:33.913
Won't happen.

00:07:33.913 --> 00:07:36.378
Won't happen, and
you will die alone.

00:07:36.378 --> 00:07:37.364
What you want.

00:07:37.364 --> 00:07:39.050
What you want.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.426
What you want is passion.

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:43.886
It is beyond interest.

00:07:43.886 --> 00:07:47.576
You need 20 interests, and
then one of them, one of them

00:07:47.576 --> 00:07:48.806
might grab you.

00:07:48.806 --> 00:07:51.226
One of them may engage you
more than anything else,

00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:53.726
and then you may have found
your greatest love in comparison

00:07:53.726 --> 00:07:58.154
to all the other things
that interest you.

00:07:58.154 --> 00:07:59.630
And that's what passion is.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.650
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.810
CARMINE GALLO: OK,
your greatest love.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.150
By the way, he's really
passionate, isn't he?

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.100
He's worked up.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.280
And I asked him, Dr. Smith,
you're going nuts on this.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.160
What's happening?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.740
He said, Carmine,
what you have seen

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.830
is 40 years of
pent-up frustration,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.640
of telling people that
they need to follow

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.270
their passion in order
to create the highest

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.670
expression of their talent.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.140
And he said, Carmine, wasted
talent is a waste I cannot

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.200
stand, which is why passion
is so important to him.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.590
But I love that definition--
your greatest love.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.130
How does that relate to us?

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.140
How does that relate to,
say, entrepreneurship?

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.530
I write for "Forbes," also
the books that I write.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:45.490
I have this amazing opportunity
to interview and spend time

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.820
with some of the great
leaders of our time.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.110
Let's talk about this idea
of your greatest love,

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.510
and what does that mean
to follow your passion?

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.690
Here's a photograph of
me and Richard Branson.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.590
Richard Branson always
seems to be smiling.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.710
I think when you've got five
billion reasons to smile,

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.920
you're always happy.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.650
He's always happy.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.350
But when I asked him,
what's your greatest love?

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.270
It's not-- it's not
getting people from point A

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.842
to point B on an airplane.

00:09:12.842 --> 00:09:14.050
That's not his greatest love.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.350
His greatest love is
disrupting the status quo.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.790
It's elevating the
customer experience.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.230
Some of you are familiar
with Zappos, I'm sure.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.340
Tony Hsieh, who's sort
of elevated the customer

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.020
experience, speaking of that.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.470
I've interviewed Tony Hsieh.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.090
His greatest love
is not the shoes,

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.030
which is very interesting.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.370
He sells shoes online,
but he wears old shoes

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.900
till they're worn out.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.090
When I asked him, what's
your greatest love?

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.730
He never mentioned shoes.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.820
He says it's
delivering happiness.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.680
How can I deliver happiness to
my customers and my employees?

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.930
Which is why he's created
that great culture at Zappos,

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.120
a culture like many of you have
experienced here at Google.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.940
The point is, he's
always thinking.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.170
The most inspiring
communicators and entrepreneurs

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.290
don't really pitch
their product as much

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.950
as they pitch what
the product means

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.580
for the lives of
their customers.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.590
Big difference.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.080
Howard Schultz, the founder
of Starbucks-- actually,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.130
they he's the founder.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.550
No, he's the CEO of
Starbucks, and he's

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.220
going to explain in a video
clip I'm going to show.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.780
But Howard Schultz,
when I interviewed him,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.970
completely changed the way I
look at communication skills.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.540
This was several years
ago for one of my books.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.310
He spent two hours
with me and not

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.850
once did he talk about coffee.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.170
I was the one who
brought up coffee.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.010
That's because that's
not what he's selling.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.900
He's selling a better
customer experience.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.720
He is selling a workplace
that treats people

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.060
with dignity and respect.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.320
He's selling community
and the romance of coffee,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.660
but it's not about the coffee.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.900
It's so much deeper than that.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.050
He gave me a quote
that I'll never forget.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.620
He said, Carmine, coffee is
the product that we make,

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.750
but it's not the
business we're in.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.010
So you need to think about that.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.340
That blew my mind.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.630
I can't tell you what--
I mean, it completely

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.179
changed the way I
look at communication.

00:11:16.179 --> 00:11:17.970
You've got to think
about not your product,

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.550
but what business you're in.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:26.050
This week, Oprah Winfrey
created her first big product

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.210
partnership with Starbucks.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.410
I think it's the Teavana brand.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.340
Some of you may have that tea.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.550
It was her first big
product partnership,

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.710
and she decided to go on a
partnership with Howard Schultz

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.660
because-- and I'm paraphrasing--
but she said because Starbucks

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.590
is so much more than a company.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.570
It's so much more
than the coffee.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.740
It means so much more.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.900
That comes from him.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.430
That comes from the
entrepreneur, the leader,

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.390
and the way he communicates
the vision behind his brand.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.310
Watch this very short video
clip taken a few months ago

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.290
of Oprah Winfrey first
interviewing Howard Schultz.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.392
Listen to the way he
talks about the brand.

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:06.384
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:06.384 --> 00:12:08.191
-People think I'm the
founder of Starbucks,

00:12:08.191 --> 00:12:09.690
but I'm was an
employee of Starbucks

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.848
when they had four stores.

00:12:10.848 --> 00:12:14.816
I was sent to Italy to
do a trip for Starbucks.

00:12:14.816 --> 00:12:17.296
I came back with this
feeling that the business

00:12:17.296 --> 00:12:19.881
that Starbucks was in
was the wrong business.

00:12:19.881 --> 00:12:22.256
-Because at the time that you
were employed by Starbucks,

00:12:22.256 --> 00:12:25.232
they just sold coffee
beans, and they actually

00:12:25.232 --> 00:12:27.216
did not sell a cup of coffee.

00:12:27.216 --> 00:12:28.208
-That's correct.

00:12:28.208 --> 00:12:30.192
And so what I
wanted to bring back

00:12:30.192 --> 00:12:33.168
was the daily ritual and
the sense of community,

00:12:33.168 --> 00:12:36.888
and the idea that we could build
this third place between home

00:12:36.888 --> 00:12:38.624
and work in America.

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:40.608
-Can you take me back
to that little coffee

00:12:40.608 --> 00:12:42.592
shop and the feeling
you had there?

00:12:42.592 --> 00:12:43.584
-In Italy?

00:12:43.584 --> 00:12:46.560
-Yes, absolutely,
when I was reading it,

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.536
it felt like an [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:51.520
-I was out of my mind.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.008
Every--

00:12:53.008 --> 00:12:54.992
-Had you gone in for coffee?

00:12:54.992 --> 00:12:56.480
-Yeah, like anyone else.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:02.330
But I walked in and saw
this symphony, the romance

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.218
and the theater of coffee.

00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:10.592
And also, coffee can be a
center of conversation socially.

00:13:10.592 --> 00:13:12.374
That is what spoke
to me, and that's

00:13:12.374 --> 00:13:13.647
what I wanted to achieve.

00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:14.480
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.220
CARMINE GALLO: Coffee at
the center of conversation.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.670
You see how it goes?

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.620
His communication
about his brand

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.280
goes so far beyond just
the physical product.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.870
Passion, by the
way, is contagious.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.900
I did a lot of research into
the science of persuasion

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.670
for my new TED book,
and I interviewed

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.930
neuroscientists and researchers.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:38.110
What they're finding is that
passion is indeed contagious.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.460
We already know
this intuitively,

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.050
but they are finding that if
you meet someone or listen

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.780
to someone who is genuinely
and authentically--

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:51.640
those are important words--
genuinely enthusiastic

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.840
about their product
and what it means

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.800
for the lives of
their customers,

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.040
that it will significantly
alter your perception

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.890
of that person and that product.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.840
So you've got to
think about passion.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.510
How do we transfer that passion?

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.430
How do we transfer what
we're excited about?

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.160
That's where we have to master
the art of storytelling.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.180
All of the greatest presenters
in corporate America

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.560
today, and certainly on the
TED stage, are fantastic

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.980
storytellers.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.080
Research is finding
some remarkable things.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.170
A remarkable thing happens
to your brain on stories.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.060
Princeton University
researchers have

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.310
found that if I
tell you a story,

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.020
the same areas of our
brains-- if they take an MRI

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:41.500
scan to look at brain blood
flow-- the same areas light up.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.350
That means we are
literally in sync.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.470
They call it
mind-to-mind coupling.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.360
I just call it being in sync.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.100
Stories are powerful.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.570
Sheryl Sandberg,
Facebook COO, is

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.570
learning all about
the power of stories.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.060
How many of you have
heard of the movement

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.600
that she started, Lean In?

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.810
Many of you, most of you now.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.270
Lean In is a very
powerful movement

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.180
for young women
in the workplace.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.710
I argue-- and if you'd like
to push back, please do.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.950
Save your questions
for the Q&amp;A. But I'm

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.160
arguing that you never
would have heard of Lean In,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.460
you would not be
leaning in right now,

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:29.250
if it had not been for a viral
18-minute TEDx presentation

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.330
that Sheryl Sandberg gave that
led to a bestselling book that

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.560
eventually sparked the movement.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.990
And here is why it went viral.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.360
Sheryl Sandberg recently
admitted-- just a few months

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.990
ago, she talked
about the TED talk

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.100
she gave several years
ago that launched Lean In.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.040
She was ready to give a
talk, in her words, that

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.540
was chock full of data
and no personal stories.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.900
A friend of hers right
before the conference

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.579
pulled her aside
and said, Sheryl,

00:15:59.579 --> 00:16:01.120
you look a little
out of sorts today.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.680
What's going on?

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.430
And she said, it's
kind of been a bad day.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.560
Right before I came
out to the conference,

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.600
my little girl was
tugging at my leg,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.550
and she was crying and
screaming, mommy don't go.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.980
But it's OK, I'll work it out.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.540
I'll get it together.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.710
And her friend said, why don't
you just tell that story?

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.000
Sheryl Sandberg was skeptical.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.920
She said, in front of people?

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.430
You want me to tell that
story in a presentation?

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.300
And then she realized
she had to be vulnerable.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.370
She realized that in order
to touch people emotionally--

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.640
isn't that what we're talking
about-- touching people

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.990
emotionally?

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.890
She had to break down that
wall and connect with them

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.530
on that personal
storytelling level.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:45.893
Here is how Ms. Sandberg
started her now-famous TED talk.

00:16:45.893 --> 00:16:46.800
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.055
-At the outset, I
want to be very clear

00:16:49.055 --> 00:16:51.438
that this speech comes
with no judgments.

00:16:51.438 --> 00:16:52.760
I don't have the right answer.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.130
I don't even have it for myself.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.224
I left San Francisco,
where I live, on Monday.

00:16:58.224 --> 00:17:00.182
I was getting on the
plane for this conference,

00:17:00.182 --> 00:17:02.730
and my daughter, who is
three, when I dropped her off

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.938
at preschool, did that whole
hugging the leg, crying,

00:17:04.938 --> 00:17:06.589
mommy-don't-get-on-the-plane
thing.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:08.581
This is hard.

00:17:08.581 --> 00:17:10.573
I feel guilty sometimes.

00:17:10.573 --> 00:17:12.814
I know no women,
whether they're at home

00:17:12.814 --> 00:17:14.806
or whether they're in
the workforce, that

00:17:14.806 --> 00:17:16.550
don't feel that sometimes.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.404
I'm not saying that
staying in the workforce

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:21.140
is the right thing for everyone.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.890
My talk today is about
what the messages are

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.692
if you want to stay
in the workforce.

00:17:26.692 --> 00:17:28.660
And I think there are three.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.324
One, sit at the table, two--

CARMINE GALLO: The story.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.570
It's the story that went viral.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.260
She applied the same technique
to her book, "Lean In."

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.390
Again, the first
chapter was all data.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.250
No personal stories.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.260
Her husband-- true story, she
just said this a few weeks ago.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.690
Her husband read the
first chapter and said,

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.000
this is like eating
your Wheaties.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.270
Because we know it's good for
you, but it's kind of boring.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.550
The book itself is
now full of stories

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.540
if you read the first chapter.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.270
18 minutes leads
to a best seller

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:11.290
leads to a movement for
millions of young women.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:16.770
An 18-minute presentation has
the power to start a movement.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.800
I studied 500 TED talks.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.290
Categorize the content,
and here's what happens.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.250
Pretty fascinating.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.380
Aristotle, for we
communication geeks,

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.560
is the father of persuasion.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.670
He said that
persuasion occurs when

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.090
you have three
components-- pathos, which

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.340
is what we're talking about
now-- emotion, storytelling.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.010
Logos is data, statistics.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.270
Ethos is establishing
credibility for who you are.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:51.140
65% of the majority of the best
TED talks-- 65% are stories.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.320
25% data, only 10% ethos.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.050
Sheryl Sandberg's
talk was 72% stories.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:03.310
Bryan Stevenson, for example,
tells a lot of stories.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.920
Bryan Stevenson is a
civil rights attorney.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.930
He knows how to talk to people.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:15.100
He successfully wins cases
before the US Supreme Court,

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:19.420
which, if you haven't guessed,
is a pretty tough audience.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.490
He knows how to persuade.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.470
When he gave a TED
talk last year,

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.670
he received the longest
standing ovation at TED.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.890
I talked to him afterwards.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.140
He told three stories
from his life.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.760
He supports the
stories with data,

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.400
but the data come
after the stories.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.770
So his template is stories data,
stories data, stories data.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:47.160
He includes the data, but
he supports his argument

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.560
with stories.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.510
His argument is, as a
civil rights attorney,

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.800
that young men and women in
underprivileged and underserved

00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:01.430
communities are incarcerated at
a much higher rate than others.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.190
That's his theme.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.740
I want to show you a
clip from this TED talk

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.660
because again, he received the
longest standing ovation at TED

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.560
because it was deeply emotional.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.030
Here, he tells a story
about his grandmother.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.140
I've got to set it
up for just a second.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.240
He said that his
grandmother pulled him aside

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.580
when he was 11 years
old and said Bryan,

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.260
I want you promise me never
to drink alcohol in your life.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.170
And Bryan said, well,
OK, I'm only 11.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:30.810
So, sure.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.090
Sure, I'll go along with it.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.970
Here is how he
picks up the story.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.660
His theme, by the way, was
there's power in identity.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:44.190
Watch and listen for how the
story reinforces the theme.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.154
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:45.154 --> 00:20:47.070
-I grew up in the country,
in the rural South,

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.410
and had a brother a year older
than me and a sister a year

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:50.910
younger.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:52.905
I was about 14 or 15
when one day my brother

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:54.845
came home and had
this six-pack of beer.

00:20:54.845 --> 00:20:56.075
I don't know where he got it.

00:20:56.075 --> 00:20:58.574
And he grabbed me and my sister
and we went out in the woods

00:20:58.574 --> 00:21:00.526
and we were kind of just
out there doing stuff

00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:02.966
we crazily did, and he
had a sip of his beer

00:21:02.966 --> 00:21:04.930
and he gave some to my
sister and she had some,

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:05.645
and they offered it to me.

00:21:05.645 --> 00:21:06.728
I said, no no no, it's OK.

00:21:06.728 --> 00:21:08.135
Y'all go ahead.

00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:09.426
I'm not going to have any beer.

00:21:09.426 --> 00:21:11.418
And my brother was like, come
on, we're doing this today.

00:21:11.418 --> 00:21:12.414
You always do what we do.

00:21:12.414 --> 00:21:14.406
I had some, your sister
had some, have some beer.

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:15.900
I said no, I don't
feel right about it.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.525
Y'all go ahead.

00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:17.394
Y'all go ahead.

00:21:17.394 --> 00:21:18.888
And then my brother
started staring at me.

00:21:18.888 --> 00:21:20.179
He said, what's wrong with you?

00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:21.662
Have some beer.

00:21:21.662 --> 00:21:23.370
And then looked at me
real hard and said,

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.828
oh, I hope you're
not still hung up

00:21:24.828 --> 00:21:28.350
on that conversation
Mama had with you.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.840
I said, what are
you talking about?

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.688
He says, oh, Mama tells all
grandkids that they're special.

00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:39.809
I was devastated.

00:21:39.809 --> 00:21:41.475
And I'm going to admit
something to you,

00:21:41.475 --> 00:21:45.090
I'm going to tell you something
that I probably shouldn't-- I

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.884
know this might be
broadcast broadly.

00:21:47.884 --> 00:21:50.595
But I'm 52 years
old, and I'm going

00:21:50.595 --> 00:21:54.293
to admit to you that I've
never had a drop of alcohol.

00:21:54.293 --> 00:21:58.730
I don't say that because
I think that's virtuous.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.688
I say that because there
is power in identity.

00:22:01.688 --> 00:22:03.200
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.700
CARMINE GALLO: You
see the template.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.915
Story ties back to
the central theme.

00:22:07.915 --> 00:22:10.090
There is power in identity.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:13.530
Now look, I don't
have all the answers.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.170
I'm constantly
learning something

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.190
about communication
and persuasion.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.640
That's why I talk to
people who, frankly,

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.590
are more persuasive than I am.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:25.510
If you win Supreme Court cases,
you're pretty persuasive.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.120
You know how to talk.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.660
So maybe Bryan Stevenson has
some pretty good answers.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.400
Maybe we should listen to him.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.860
Storytelling is powerful.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:42.250
How many of you enjoy consuming
organic fruits and vegetables?

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.940
Most of you.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.550
I see downstairs they had
a nice organic section

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:47.550
of the restaurant.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.190
You have this woman to thank.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.440
Her name is Myra Goodman.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.480
Myra Goodman, several decades
ago with her husband Drew,

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.680
started a two-acre
raspberry farm

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.990
and grew it into what is now
Earthbound Farm, the largest

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.770
grower of organic
produce in the world.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.880
If it wasn't for
her, you probably

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.070
would not be having the
abundance of organic

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.340
that you do because she
really pioneered the movement.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.460
She called me in
October and she was

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.230
getting ready for a TEDx talk.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.130
For those of you who don't
know, TEDx are the smaller,

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.880
independently
organized TED events.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.460
She called me in
October and she was

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:32.060
getting ready to talk to this--
it was a food-related event.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.400
She knew that I had just
finished a book on TED.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.077
I've known her
for several years.

00:23:36.077 --> 00:23:37.660
She said, what advice
can you give me?

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.680
I said, please
start with stories.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.230
You've got some great stories.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.820
You've got good data.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.910
You've got awesome
data, but we're

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.510
going to wrap that
data in stories.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.080
For example, I said,
Myra, I love that story

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.790
that I remember long
ago when you told me

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.905
that you started literally
selling raspberries at a farm

00:23:55.905 --> 00:23:59.660
stand in Carmel, California,
and now you go into every Costco

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.560
and they've got the
entire section of organic.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.710
Here's how she
started her TEDx talk.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.960
I think it was-- actually,
it was just a few weeks ago

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.859
in March.

00:24:09.859 --> 00:24:10.837
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:10.837 --> 00:24:13.771
-I have been a passionate
advocate of organic farming

00:24:13.771 --> 00:24:15.238
for 30 years.

00:24:15.238 --> 00:24:17.194
I can still remember
the exact moment

00:24:17.194 --> 00:24:21.106
when I knew I didn't want any
chemicals to grow our food.

00:24:21.106 --> 00:24:24.040
It was just two days
after my husband Drew

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.952
and I moved onto our original
two and 1/2 acre raspberry farm

00:24:27.952 --> 00:24:29.715
in Carmel Valley,
and I was standing

00:24:29.715 --> 00:24:34.022
between two rows of raspberries
near a little orchard of fig

00:24:34.022 --> 00:24:36.557
trees surrounded by the
gorgeous green mountains,

00:24:36.557 --> 00:24:38.992
and the miracle of what
was happening around me

00:24:38.992 --> 00:24:40.940
was stunning.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.796
I was 3,000 miles away from my
11th floor on East 36th Street

00:24:45.796 --> 00:24:50.686
here in Manhattan, but I felt
like I had finally come home.

00:24:50.686 --> 00:24:53.620
I just knew in my heart that
we shouldn't try and conquer

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:58.004
this beautiful earth
with chemicals.

00:24:58.004 --> 00:25:00.170
Drew felt the same way, so
right from the beginning,

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:04.960
we made the commitment to
learn to farm organically.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.780
Back when we started
Earthbound Farms,

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.270
Drew and I were two
faces of small organic.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.544
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:10.544 --> 00:25:11.960
CARMINE GALLO: I
just realized-- I

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.680
don't know why it's happening--
but I can see it in real time

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.745
here, and it looks like there's
a slight delay when you see it

00:25:16.745 --> 00:25:17.790
on the projector.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.400
What did you notice, by the way?

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.400
I know we're going to
have some Q&amp;A in a minute,

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.000
but what did you notice
about the slides?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.160
What did you notice about the
slides that she presented?

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.150
AUDIENCE: Personal.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:31.190
CARMINE GALLO: Personal.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.360
Personal, visual, pictures.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.810
When we tell stories,
we don't want

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.450
to clutter the slides with a
lot of words, charts, and text,

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.340
because it's about the story.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.110
The visuals
complement the story.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.680
Make sure that we--
we can talk about this

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.530
when we have the Q&amp;A
if you have questions.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.750
Save your questions.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:54.780
So emotional, touched my
heart, passion, storytelling.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:59.030
Also, ideas that spread,
which is the TED motto,

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.150
"Ideas That Spread,"
teach me something new.

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:05.720
Teach me something that
I've never heard before.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.690
Something new,
unexpected, or surprising.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.360
There's science behind this.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.800
Dr. A.K. Pradeep, who is a
neuroscientist in Berkeley,

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.990
said that our brains are
trained to look for something

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.940
brilliant and new,
something that stands out,

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.590
something that looks delicious.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:29.340
When the brain detects something
new, surprising, shocking,

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.260
unexpected, it
literally releases

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:37.220
dopamine, which acts as
a mental save button.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.800
I interviewed Robert Ballard.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.870
Robert Ballard
discovered a little ship

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.590
you may have heard
of, Titanic, in 1985.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:50.200
I actually asked him, I
asked the silliest question.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.290
What makes you more
nervous, actually public

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:56.320
speaking or exploring
the undersea world?

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.300
He said, Carmine, almost
dying 2 and 1/2 miles

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.500
beneath the surface of the
Atlantic is a lot scarier

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.880
any public speaking.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.130
He has no stage fright anymore.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.320
He said, your mission
in any presentation

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.412
is to inform,
educate, and inspire.

00:27:15.412 --> 00:27:16.120
Think about that.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.340
That's a powerful line.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.740
You can only inspire
when you give people

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.240
a new way of looking at the
world in which they live.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.650
Researchers call that new way
an emotionally charged event.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.690
It simply means that when
you perceive something

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:37.770
that is fresh, unexpected,
surprising, and new,

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.850
it actually creates
that dopamine

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.630
hit that I told you about.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.720
It's called, in the
academic research,

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.620
an emotionally charged event.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.350
OK, so what does that
mean in a presentation?

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:54.020
How many of you have seen or
remember the now-famous TED

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.940
talk by Mr. Bill Gates?

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.890
What do you remember
the most from

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.110
that particular presentation?

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.860
AUDIENCE: When he
released the mosquitoes.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.818
CARMINE GALLO: When he
released the mosquitoes.

00:28:05.818 --> 00:28:06.760
OK.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.410
Wait a minute, don't you
remember the third slide?

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:12.250
You don't remember the--OK.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.920
His slides were
professionally designed.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.350
They were really nice slides.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.680
You don't remember the slides.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.679
You remember the
emotionally charged event.

00:28:20.679 --> 00:28:22.470
So here, for some of
you who didn't see it,

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.070
Bill Gates is talking about
reducing childhood deaths

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:29.870
in third world countries,
deaths caused by malaria.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.533
Here's how he picked it up.

00:28:31.533 --> 00:28:32.520
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.380
-For example, there's more
money put into baldness drugs

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.260
than are put into malaria.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.986
Now, baldness is
a terrible thing.

00:28:44.986 --> 00:28:49.570
And rich men are
afflicted, and so that's

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:55.030
why that priority has been set.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.500
But malaria-- a million
deaths are caused by malaria

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.730
greatly understate its impact.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:04.380
Over 200 million people at any
one time are suffering from it.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.300
It means you can't get the
economies in these areas going

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:13.160
because it just holds
things back so much.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.410
Malaria's, of course,
transmitted by mosquitoes.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:21.300
I brought some here so
you could experience this.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.362
We'll let those go around
the auditorium a little bit.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.816
There's no reason
only poor people

00:29:29.816 --> 00:29:30.940
should have the experience.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:31.898
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.140
Those mosquitoes
are not infected.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.080
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.730
CARMINE GALLO: OK, thank you.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.470
Thanks for putting me at ease.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:49.540
I know as a fact that Bill
Gates is significantly

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.070
working at improving his
communication skills because he

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.910
has to transfer very
complex information

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.970
and he needs to make it
simple, engaging, memorable.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:01.380
This is one example.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.017
It's an extreme example.

00:30:03.017 --> 00:30:04.600
You're not going to
release mosquitoes

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.790
at your next Google meeting.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.000
I get that.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.300
But it's an example
of creating what's

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.510
called that emotionally
charged event.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.200
The reason why
you remember it is

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.310
because you did not expect
Bill Gates to release

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.220
a jar of mosquitoes
in a presentation.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.460
It's different.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.720
How many of you may
remember watching last year

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.650
Amanda Palmer-- a performance
artist, a musician--

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:26.690
give a TED talk?

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.400
Did some of you see?

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.500
OK, this one actually went
viral for a few weeks.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.520
It became very, very popular.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.740
Amanda Palmer is a musician.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.850
I'm not even sure where the
music would be categorized,

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.710
something like indie
punk cabaret rock.

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:46.040
Some of you might be familiar
with those categories.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.240
This particular presentation
that she gave last year

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.300
was viewed more than
5 million times.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.800
She practiced a lot.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.500
We can talk about practice
maybe in the Q&amp;A and rehearsal.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.240
She practiced more
than 100 times

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.930
on this particular presentation.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.860
But here's what people
remember the most--

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.707
the emotionally
charged event from

00:31:04.707 --> 00:31:05.915
this particular presentation.

00:31:17.162 --> 00:31:18.154
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:18.154 --> 00:31:23.114
-So I didn't always make
my living from music.

00:31:23.114 --> 00:31:26.586
For five years after graduating
from an upstanding liberal arts

00:31:26.586 --> 00:31:30.058
university, this was my day job.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.550
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:37.150
CARMINE GALLO: OK, so now she's
talking about being a living

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.560
statue, and she's going to
talk about her experience

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.030
and then bring it back into
what she learned about the music

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.020
business.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.160
That's what people
remember most.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:47.890
Why?

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.760
It's completely unexpected.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.470
She's using props.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.600
She's using visuals.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.170
She's telling stories.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.300
It is very unlike
the way you would

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.550
expect most
presentations to start.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:05.620
The reason why, if you watch
a presentation or a movie

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.410
or any kind of
visual event, you're

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.850
going to remember one part.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.850
That one jaw-dropping moment.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.220
That's what I mean by novelty.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.260
You need to teach
me something new,

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.200
but also shake out
the cobwebs, shake out

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.630
the way the brain is modeled
to perceive information

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.290
and give them
something entirely new.

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:29.790
Steve Jobs, the reason why I
first wrote about Steve Jobs,

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.760
he was brilliant at this.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.430
He didn't these extreme things.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.810
You never saw Steve Jobs stand
on a milk crate or release

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:37.450
mosquitoes.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:38.730
Those were extreme.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.885
But what did he do?

00:32:40.885 --> 00:32:42.639
Oh, but there is one more thing.

00:32:42.639 --> 00:32:44.930
When he first did that, that
was completely surprising,

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.070
completely unexpected.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.070
Steve Jobs was brilliant at
that and incorporating something

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:53.510
new and novel into every
one of his keynotes.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:57.330
Finally, the brain
has to remember it.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.330
It doesn't matter.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.970
Your idea, your
presentation, the beautiful

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:03.080
slides-- it's not
going to matter

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.320
if I don't remember the content.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.640
Let me give you some
very specific techniques

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.280
on making your pitch
more memorable.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.710
All TED talks, as
you probably know,

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:15.730
are limited to 18 minutes.

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.220
The 18 minute rule.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.710
It doesn't matter whether your
name is Bill Gates, Sheryl

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.260
Sandberg, or this week, Sting.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.210
Sting talked, last
year was Bono.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:26.790
Doesn't matter who you are.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.760
You're only limited
to 18 minutes.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.210
That's not a bad time limit.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.390
In fact, the TED
organizers found

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.800
that 18 minutes is long enough
to have a serious discussion

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.160
and short enough to
keep people's attention.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.030
There's science behind this
that you as communicators

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.050
need to know.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.550
It's called cognitive back log.

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.940
Researchers at Texas Christian
University are working on this.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.480
It simply means that
if I ask you retain

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.900
more information, the more
information I pile on,

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.350
like weights,
pretty soon, you're

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:59.910
going to drop the whole thing.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.120
Cognitive back log.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.920
In fact, they're
finding-- depending

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:09.210
on the research-- anywhere from
about 10 minutes to 18 minutes,

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.210
people start losing attention.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:13.980
They actually will physically
start looking at their watch,

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.550
look at their
phones, and thinking

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.199
about what they're
going to do next.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.860
From 10 to 18 minutes.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.960
So during that time, you
need to reengage them.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.376
I'm going to speak
for-- I'm going

00:34:23.376 --> 00:34:24.780
to break the 18 minute rule.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.692
I'm going to speak for
more than 18 minutes.

00:34:26.692 --> 00:34:27.900
We're going to break that up.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.489
We're going to have some Q&amp;A
so it's not just me speaking.

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:34.260
I'm trying to add video
clips so there's two voices.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.690
Those are different
ways of reengaging.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:40.110
But if I were to just stand
here with no visual display

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:44.130
of content, no information,
no second speaker

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.520
and I just talked
to you, by now,

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.310
you'd be ready to
tear your hair out,

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.840
no matter how engaging a
speaker you think you are.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:56.060
The brain naturally tunes out
after about 10 to 18 minutes.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.520
That's a very powerful concept.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.950
It's very important
to understand

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.390
when you're giving a
pitch or a presentation.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.650
A lot of great things
can happen in 18 minutes.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:06.850
John Kennedy inspired
a nation to look

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:09.800
to the stars in 15 minutes.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.870
Steve Jobs gave one of
the greatest commencement

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.550
addresses of our
time at Stanford.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.620
That was 15 minutes.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.500
Martin Luther King, he
took a little extra time

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.590
to outline his vision
for racial equality.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:23.530
That took about 17 minutes.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:27.180
Sheryl Sandberg started a
movement is about 16 minutes.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.030
Al Gore's "An
Inconvenient Truth"

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.880
was originally a TED talk.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.470
Launched the whole
global warming thing.

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:36.910
A lot of initiatives,
movements can

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:40.710
start in as little
as 18 minutes.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:45.590
Think about keeping
your content concise.

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:48.400
And then think about this other
technique that is so powerful.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.504
It works almost every time.

00:35:50.504 --> 00:35:52.170
I'm not going to
guarantee you anything,

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:55.730
but this is close--
the rule of three.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:36:00.370
The rule of three means that in
short term or working memory,

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:04.860
you're only capable of caring
about three big ideas, three

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.460
chunks of information.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.220
If I ask you to
remember a phone number,

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.340
you divide up into
chunks of three and four.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.530
Threes is a very
powerful number.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:17.090
It pervades every
aspect of our society.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:21.040
From slogans like "Just Do
It," or Obama's "Yes We Can."

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.790
Company names-- SAP, IBM, CNN.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:27.370
And certainly literature-- "The
Three Musketeers," "The Three

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:30.250
Little Pigs," "The Three Bears."

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:31.180
The rule of three.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.940
Authors know this
very, very well.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.820
Writers know this very well.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.190
Great presenters
know it very well.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.050
Bryan Stevenson
told three stories.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:45.260
He did not tell 12 or two.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.870
Told three.

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:48.800
It's an important number.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.940
The brain needs more than
one, but after you give it

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.250
about five, six,
or seven points,

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:56.730
it starts to forget everything.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.630
Three is a really good number.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.530
Tell your boss there's
three reasons why

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:03.980
you should back my idea.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.540
There's three reasons.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.640
There's three new
features of this product

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.910
that I think our consumers
are going to like.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:13.320
When I was analyzing all the
TED talks, take a look at this.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.900
These are just some examples
of the rule of three

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.430
from the best TED talks.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.860
Three reasons why
videos go viral.

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.850
These, by the way,
are not necessarily

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.910
the titles-- some of them are,
but most of them are not--

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:29.380
but it's the theme of
the actual presentation.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.910
Three reasons why
videos go viral.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:35.200
Three ways design
makes you happy.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.520
Three ways the brain
creates meaning.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.920
Three clues to
understanding your brain.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.712
A lot of brain stuff.

00:37:41.712 --> 00:37:43.004
AUDIENCE: That was four things.

00:37:43.004 --> 00:37:44.212
CARMINE GALLO: That was four.

00:37:44.212 --> 00:37:45.340
There was a bullet of four.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.790
But there's more.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:50.970
Three ways brands lose control.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:53.700
Three ways crooks steal
your digital data.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.730
Three myths about big organic.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:00.220
And of course, three things I
learned when my plane crashed.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.420
The rule of three.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.080
Very, very powerful.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.070
I do a lot of what's
called media training,

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.310
so I work with executives
before they go on

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:09.920
to import media interviews.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.690
Three always works.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.070
I hate to sound
too manipulative,

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:16.680
but this is how the brain works.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.300
If you give people three things
that they need to keep in mind,

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.390
they'll write them down.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.436
They want to know,
what's the third?

00:38:23.436 --> 00:38:24.310
Or what's the second?

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:25.610
Did I miss the second one?

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:27.720
People cannot ignore lists.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.370
Three is a good list.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.420
And finally, to make it
memorable-- especially

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.320
when we're delivering it doesn't
matter what software you use,

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.420
either Google software or
traditional PowerPoint,

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.580
or I use Apple Keynote or
Prezzie, think visually.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.900
Think visually.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.710
This is called
picture superiority.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.940
Picture superiority means
that if I deliver content

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:54.600
to you verbally, you'll remember
about 10% of the content.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:01.200
If I add a picture or an
image, retention soars to 65%.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.220
The average PowerPoint
has 40 words.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.520
Several years ago, when I
started analyzing Steve Jobs'

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.170
presentations--
and again, I think

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.240
we'll all acknowledge he was
the original great corporate

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:19.240
storyteller-- I never found one
slide, never, with 40 words.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:24.525
In fact, on average, it took
him 10 slides to reach 40 words.

00:39:24.525 --> 00:39:29.150
It was all pictures,
images that spoke so much

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:30.930
more than any text could.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:33.520
When you're talking about a new
computer like the MacBook Air

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.860
and you want to talk about how
thin it is, no number of words

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.560
could describe it
like that photograph.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.990
So thin it fits inside
an office envelope.

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:47.770
When you watch some of the great
TED presentations-- and Bono

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.130
did a beautiful one that
you can go onto TED.com

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:53.150
to watch-- that was
created in Prezzie.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:55.050
Beautifully done.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:58.430
Some data, mostly
images and pictures

00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:59.810
that supported the data.

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:05.260
Steve Jobs, his PowerPoints
are very unlike anything

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.090
that you used to see
from him and Microsoft.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:12.350
They're very visual, this whole
idea of picture superiority.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:15.330
Whenever you see
major executives now

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:18.920
give presentations-- maybe
not internally, but certainly

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:22.310
to external customers
and at external events--

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:25.660
they're are all
using this style.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.980
Whether it's Google-- I've seen
a number of executives using

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:31.960
this style-- Marissa Mayer
is now using it at Yahoo.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.140
She's building
beautiful presentations

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.100
if you saw her at CES.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.530
Actually, she was doing it here.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:40.610
She was still doing it here.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:43.720
Zuckerberg over at Facebook,
and Apple, certainly, they

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.320
continue to use this style.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.670
It's more of a visual style.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.070
You need to think visually.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.320
This is an actual slide from
Bill Gates' slide, where

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.130
he was talking about
global warming.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.920
His formula-- he said it's a
really simple formula-- as CO2

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.900
goes up, the
temperature increases,

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.800
which leads to some
really bad things.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.330
OK, he's trying to
simplify complexities.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.710
When you simplify complexities,
you need a simple slide.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:16.180
So that's an actual slide from
a Bill Gates presentation.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.190
You can do this--
I remember working

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.200
for LinkedIn before
they went IPO.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.450
They started using some
picture superiority

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:27.750
to explain what they did,
especially in the marketing

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:28.250
department.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:30.110
This is a before slide.

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.890
This is an after slide.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:33.440
So you see the difference.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.160
Here, it's a lot of numbers.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.880
The most important
numbers get lost.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.460
But if that's all
I want you to know

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.200
is how many members we have
and how many members we're

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.260
collecting every month, you
can tell this is an old slide.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.450
Only 70 million.

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:49.420
This was before
they event went IPO.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.990
But again, it's let's
think about how are we

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:56.010
going to display
information visually.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:59.930
Those are the three
components that all inspiring

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.070
presentations need to have.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.710
They all need to be emotional.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.940
Passion, storytelling.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.330
They all need to be novel.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:11.790
Teach me something new,
unexpected, fresh, surprising.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.122
And of course, memorable.

00:42:13.122 --> 00:42:14.830
There are a number of
techniques that you

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.610
can use to make sure
that people recall

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.640
the information that
you've given them.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.710
Above all, keep this in
mind-- that you do all

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:25.900
have the capacity
to move people.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.790
You all have the capacity
to educate, to electrify,

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:31.680
to inform, to inspire.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.470
You have ideas.

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:37.460
All of you have big,
bold, transcendent ideas

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.710
that need to be heard.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:43.970
Please communicate those ideas
as persuasively as possible

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.870
because we need to
hear those ideas

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:49.025
and we need to be able
to act on your ideas.

00:42:49.025 --> 00:42:51.150
Thank you very much for
inviting me this afternoon.

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.090
Thanks, guys.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:59.900
For those of you who
have a few minutes,

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.600
we are going to have the
"Talk Like TED" book.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.690
I'd love to sign them for you.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:08.810
But if you have any questions,
I'd love to take them.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:10.260
Yes, Jess.

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:13.683
AUDIENCE: We've heard a lot
about the way that [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:13.683 --> 00:43:15.150
structure of the presentation.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:18.573
I'm curious if you have any
thoughts on how [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:23.770
CARMINE GALLO: So
how TED as a concept

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.890
has affected
presentations and society.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:31.460
I wrote a column for "Forbes,"
and I said, like it or not,

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.090
your next presentation is being
compared to TED because you

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.510
can't argue with the
empirical evidence.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:42.190
The empirical evidence shows
that we have two million TED

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.160
videos stream every single day.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.800
They are being seen
in 150 countries.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.890
They're being translated
into 90 languages.

00:43:52.890 --> 00:44:00.330
This style-- fresh,
engaging, visual, emotional

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:01.840
is catching on.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.320
I've traveled to Europe
and I've traveled to Asia.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.890
I'll never forget
being in Japan.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:08.710
I've had several people in
Japan come up to me and say,

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:12.880
we love the whole American
style of presenting.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.380
And I said, what's
the American style?

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.280
One person said,
you know, like TED.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.990
People see TED.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.610
True story.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:22.200
I had a rabbi come up to me.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.820
This didn't happen too long ago.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.240
A rabbi came up to me,
and he said, Carmine,

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.050
I need to improve my sermons.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:28.800
I said, well, why?

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.340
He said, people in
my congregations

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.590
have told me I've got
to step up my game.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:37.700
One person said,
we see TED talks.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.550
Whether you're a spiritual
leader, whether you're

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:42.980
a business
professional, there is

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:47.100
this new and fresh dynamic way
of presenting that people don't

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.835
know what they're looking
for, but they know it

00:44:49.835 --> 00:44:51.510
when they see it.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:55.032
I think that's what TED means.

00:44:55.032 --> 00:44:55.740
Yes, Toni, right?

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:56.170
Toni.

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:57.370
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering
if you can just

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.530
talk about the application
of these principles

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.430
to communication.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.930
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:04.479 --> 00:45:05.520
CARMINE GALLO: Perfectly.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.500
So how do you apply this
to written communications?

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:09.780
The rule of three.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.440
Rule of three works beautifully.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.670
You have to have a headline.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:16.310
That's the theme of
your presentation.

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:18.930
All TED talks, they
all have themes

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.880
that fall into 140
characters or less.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.150
You can actually
tweet out the headline

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:25.900
from every theme
of every TED talk.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.980
You could tweet them out.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.850
They're that short.

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:32.240
And then, so give me a headline.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.810
What's the one thing you want
me to know in this email,

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:36.890
and then break it up.

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:41.810
Give me some white space, just
like a nicely designed slide

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:44.740
should have some content
and some white space.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:49.010
If you fill it up with content,
then it's very hard for the eye

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:50.570
to analyze.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:54.020
What's the one thing you want me
to know in this email, the one

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.360
action you want me to take,
and three supporting points.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.070
That's actually not a bad
way of structuring an email.

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:03.450
Whether it's a TED
presentation or it's an email,

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:04.910
you can use of the
same techniques.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:06.576
AUDIENCE: I was
thinking more about what

00:46:06.576 --> 00:46:09.130
you do in your
articles, for example.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:10.540
CARMINE GALLO: In my article.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:14.270
Articles are structured very
much like a presentation.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:17.950
We put most of our
thoughts into the headline.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:20.120
What is the one thing
I want you to know?

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:23.340
The headline would be the title
of your talk, for example.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.946
That would be number one.

00:46:24.946 --> 00:46:26.820
Then I'm going to think
about what story am I

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.360
going to start
with, what data am

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.260
I going to use to
support my argument,

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.099
and the examples
I'm going to use.

00:46:33.099 --> 00:46:35.015
Very much structured
like a good presentation.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:39.500
I'm a former journalist.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:43.670
I worked for CNN and CBS and a
number of other media outlets.

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:45.180
We're storytellers.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.645
We think in stories.

00:46:46.645 --> 00:46:48.770
I think that's what a great
presentation does, too,

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:52.910
especially from the
examples you saw today.

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.054
Yes, sir?

00:46:54.054 --> 00:46:56.018
AUDIENCE: When I
was at IBM, we used

00:46:56.018 --> 00:46:57.434
to joke about
making presentations

00:46:57.434 --> 00:46:59.563
to senior executives only
three points because they

00:46:59.563 --> 00:47:02.830
couldn't absorb anything else.

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:07.230
[INAUDIBLE] here got
thrown out of the room.

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:10.040
What can I do for
people who actually

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:11.081
don't care about emotion?

00:47:11.081 --> 00:47:13.013
They want the real numbers.

00:47:13.013 --> 00:47:15.911
They are going to
push back really hard.

00:47:15.911 --> 00:47:17.870
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:19.780
CARMINE GALLO: Yeah, push back.

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:24.380
Because I am so confident,
I am absolutely,

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.910
110% confident in
these techniques.

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:28.660
I'll tell you why.

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.530
I have worked with
nuclear scientists

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:32.830
at Lawrence Livermore Lab.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:36.100
I live out in
Livermore, Pleasanton.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:40.490
I worked with nuclear
scientists at Sandia in Mexico.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:44.220
Nothing-- I know what you
do is complex-- nothing

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:48.280
is more complicated than nuclear
weapons and nuclear science.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.230
They're using these techniques
pretty effectively now.

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:55.730
When we say three, it
doesn't necessarily

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:58.030
mean I'm only going to
deliver three points.

00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:59.209
That's a great question.

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:01.500
It doesn't mean I'm just
going to deliver three points.

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:05.120
But I'm going to try
to break up the content

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.940
so it's not just a flood of
information coming at you.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.780
I'm going to break
it up into chunks.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.370
Maybe there's a component
within my presentation

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:18.550
that focuses on
the three features,

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:21.000
and then within those
I have subpoints.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.495
I gave you a lot more
than three techniques,

00:48:23.495 --> 00:48:26.050
a lot more than
three techniques.

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:28.640
But I tried to make it simple
in terms of the categories.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.780
There's three categories that
the techniques fall into.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.160
It's pretty powerful.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.740
But you also bring up
another good point.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.900
Do not walk into your boss and
give a TED-like presentation.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.900
You can take elements
from this, but it's

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:51.090
somewhat of a contrived
scenario, right, this whole 18

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:52.010
minute thing?

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:55.650
You don't want to
distract people

00:48:55.650 --> 00:49:00.010
by doing something so
different and unexpected

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.440
that it actually
becomes a distraction.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.900
But I would urge you to start
using some of these principles

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.080
to make for a more engaging
conversation and more

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.920
engaging presentations.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.931
Look, I'm not going
to mention the name,

00:49:13.931 --> 00:49:15.680
and I won't mention
the company because he

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.420
might recognize himself.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:20.050
An executive middle
level manager

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:22.360
called me from a global
technology company

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.700
that all of you would know.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.890
Called me last year.

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:29.220
He said, Carmine, over
the last two years,

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:32.660
I have improved my
presentation skills.

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:37.980
He showed me a deck very unlike
the decks that are typical

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.510
and standard at this
particular tech company.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.170
It's very old school PowerPoint.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:45.070
His are more like this.

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:48.650
He said now, he's been
considered an evangelist

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:53.460
and he is being blown all over
the world to give presentations

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:59.080
to prospects and to new clients
because even area managers know

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.860
they can't give a presentation
as good as this guy can.

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.010
So he's actually been
labeled evangelist.

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.230
I said, what does that
mean to your career?

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:11.320
He said, well, in a
company of 80,000,

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.010
it gets me a lot closer to
being a country manager.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:16.340
And a country
manager in my company

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:19.890
is the equivalent of a million
dollars with salary and bonus.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:24.280
So presentation skills in two
years went from old school

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:28.110
to radically different, has
actually elevated his stature

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:29.780
within this company.

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:33.460
Again, it does come back down to
public speaking, communication,

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.436
persuasion.

00:50:35.436 --> 00:50:36.846
Yes, sir.

00:50:36.846 --> 00:50:40.372
AUDIENCE: Whenever anybody
has to stand and up

00:50:40.372 --> 00:50:43.759
talk about standing up and
[INAUDIBLE] but I really

00:50:43.759 --> 00:50:44.800
enjoyed the presentation.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.680
CARMINE GALLO: You
enjoyed it, good.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.610
Thank.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:51.290
AUDIENCE: I notice it's about
the craft in your presentation.

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:53.020
Obviously, you
tried to illustrate

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.482
the points you're talking about.

00:50:54.482 --> 00:50:57.065
CARMINE GALLO: You're suggesting
I didn't give you everything.

00:50:57.065 --> 00:50:59.530
AUDIENCE: Well, I was going
to ask a simple thing.

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:07.590
Content aside, what are the
three most important things

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:08.695
about presentation.

00:51:08.695 --> 00:51:10.070
CARMINE GALLO:
I'll give you one.

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:11.200
I'll give you one.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.390
Practice.

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:13.950
That's what I didn't talk about.

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:14.940
Practice.

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:17.800
You only hear this
when you talk to people

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.350
who are great presenters.

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:22.600
You wouldn't get it just
from watching a TED talk.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.766
Some of the best TED
talks, the ones that

00:51:24.766 --> 00:51:28.270
have been seen 20
million times were

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:31.750
practice and
rehearsed 200 times.

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:34.180
That Amanda Palmer
one was practiced,

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.040
she practiced it 100 times.

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.230
Remember I showed you
that Myra Goodman?

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:42.980
She practiced every day
for about three months.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.550
Every day for three months.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:49.300
Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, which
she is a Harvard researcher,

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.940
she has the second
most viewed TED

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:56.120
talk-- about 15 million views--
she practiced 200 times.

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.030
Steve Jobs practiced,
and I know this

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:03.030
as a fact, practiced
relentlessly.

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:06.740
He knew every font,
every slide, every demo.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:10.740
Drove his engineers crazy, but
he made sure that he practiced.

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.670
That's why he made
it look effortless.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:16.790
When you see a presentation
that looks effortless,

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:20.720
it's because a lot of
work went behind it.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.760
Let's do this, folks.

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.602
I will be around
for a few minutes.

00:52:23.602 --> 00:52:25.310
I'm going to be around
for a few minutes.

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:26.509
Is there one more question?

00:52:26.509 --> 00:52:29.092
AUDIENCE: Just wanted to know
if you had any insight as to how

00:52:29.092 --> 00:52:31.045
one gets elected
to give a TED talk.

00:52:31.045 --> 00:52:33.670
CARMINE GALLO: How does someone
get elected to give a TED talk?

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:37.560
It's very difficult to be
on the national TED stage.

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.116
This year, it was
held in Vancouver.

00:52:39.116 --> 00:52:40.240
It's only held once a year.

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.060
That's the big TED stage.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:46.810
That's where you see Sting
and Bill Gates and the others.

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:49.410
Apparently, Sting gave
a sensational TED talk

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:50.140
in Vancouver.

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:54.030
It hasn't been uploaded yet,
so I can't wait to see it.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:58.750
Unless you're curing malaria
or your name is Bill Gates,

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:00.400
probably aren't
going to be invited.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.110
It's very, very difficult.

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:06.580
But there are the lower,
the smaller TEDx talks,

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.410
which are regional,
community based.

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:11.030
Some are much
better than others.

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:13.160
Some are more
prestigious than others.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.170
You can go directly to
the websites of those TEDx

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:19.820
organizers, and they're always
looking for great speakers

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:20.520
locally.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.710
And guess what?

00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:23.560
The video still goes
to the TED page.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.939
It's still in the same network.

00:53:26.939 --> 00:53:27.980
I'm going to hang around.

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:29.380
I'm going to sign books.

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.440
I'd love to talk to you,
I'd love to meet as many

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.480
of you as possible and continue
to answer your questions.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:35.782
Jess, thanks for inviting me.

00:53:35.782 --> 00:53:36.490
Thanks, everyone.

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:38.940
