00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.280
Are you ready to code
mostly fluid layout?

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.100
You've already seen this layout before,
but

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.930
you haven't had a chance
to modify it's CSS yet.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.550
This quiz you'll be adding some
CSS break points to some HTML, so

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.590
that the page layouts
match what you see here.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.960
Here let me show you
what you'll be doing.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.820
In the head of the document
you'll find two style tags.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.120
The first style tag just
has default styles.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.050
And you don't need to change these.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.660
Here let me close them.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.930
The second style tag includes
the responsive styles.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.350
And this is where you're
going to put your breakpoints.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.830
My advice is to write the initial
breakpoints in the source file,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.610
with classes that you might
want to modify at that breakpoint.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.798
Then open the page in the browser, and
toy with the styles using dev tools.

00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:46.810
If you got the styles set that you
think look right, go ahead and

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.230
change the source files.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.270
Also, try playing around with the order
while you are messing around with

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.180
the break points.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.440
It's actually pretty fun.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.210
Check this box once your layout
matches the sites that you see here.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.710
Good luck!
