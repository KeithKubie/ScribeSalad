Every week on our show
during the election process,

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:06.173
we like to talk to a different
segment of the American populous

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.876
to get their take
on this year's election.

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.044
Here to represent the small
but formidable voting block

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:13.247
of former presidents
of the United States of America

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.549
is former president of
the United States of America,

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.751
George W. Bush.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.687
-(applause and cheering)
-(presidential fanfare plays)

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.592
(applause and cheering swell)

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:26.894
Nice to see you, Chris.

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:28.495
Nice to see you, too.
Thank you for coming.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.330
How are you?

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:33.867
Glad to be here.
Nice to meet you.

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.403
Nice to meet you.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:39.139
You're a very distinguished
panel. Yeah.

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:42.609
Yeah. How are you?
How are you?

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:46.246
How are you?
How are you?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.052
Had a...

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:55.155
-(applause and cheering)
-Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:58.025
Thank you. Thank you for coming,
Mr. President.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.593
Very nice to have you here.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.462
Hello, Chris.

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:04.631
Hello, my fellow Americans.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:08.569
And hello, people of online,
especially...

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:11.071
especially @weedboner69.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:12.539
(laughter)

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:15.209
He's a funny guy, Chris.

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.244
-You should have him on.
-All right, well,

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:19.580
we'll definitely consider that,
but I have to say,

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:21.415
it is a real honor
to have you on this program.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.083
This legitimizes what we do
here. Thank you for coming.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.452
Well, thank you. Thank you.
First of all, Chris,

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.020
I'd just like
to just say something

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:30.557
-about my cousin Billy Bush.
Uh... -(laughter)

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.293
He's been in the news a lot
lately, uh,

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:39.132
him and that disgraced pumpkin,
Donald Trump, uh,

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.834
talking on that bus.

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:44.371
And I... I just... I just want
to say one thing.

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:47.774
-We Bushes don't act like that,
okay? -(laughter)

00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:50.244
We, uh... we have standards.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.779
And we're, uh, we're raised
a certain way.

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:54.548
And we would never,

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.050
under any circumstances,

00:01:57.084 --> 00:01:59.019
ride a bus.

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:07.995
You know, when
you're-when you're a Bush,

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:10.764
you ride in a limousine
or a Jumpjet.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.734
Or maybe a monster truck
called Sasquatch Express.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:16.270
But, uh, you know,

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.839
never a bus.
It-it boggles the mind.

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:20.707
Yeah, well, listen, there's
a very important distinction,

00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:22.609
and I... you know,
it's too bad we didn't

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:24.711
find out about that earlier,
but a lot of Republicans

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:26.847
have come out
against Donald Trump, so...

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.949
People are confused
about where you stand.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.150
Where do you stand?

00:02:30.184 --> 00:02:31.852
Well, I'll tell you what,
Chris, uh,

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:35.722
this-this dunderhead is making
me look great, you know?

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:37.124
Yeah.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.259
I mean, did-did you see
where I.. where I hugged

00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:41.728
Michelle Obama a few weeks ago?

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:44.031
-You see that?
-Well, I...

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:47.201
I see where she's almost
kind of making a snarky face

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:49.469
and trying to hug you, but
you're not really giving back.

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:50.737
I mean, I'm-I'm kind
of affectionately

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:52.606
-leaning into her, like, "Aw..."
-Yeah, I guess maybe

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.907
a little bit, yeah, you're...

00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:55.776
giving her a little lean,
but she's sort of...

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.644
I think we're both
feeling like, "This is nice."

00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:00.113
I don't know if that...
I mean, the look on her face

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:02.382
is sort of like, "Can you
(bleep) believe this over here?"

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:04.251
I mean, it's, like, a little...
It seems... I...

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:06.520
You know what, though,
I don't want to take it away.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:08.856
I guess it is a sweet moment,
it's a sweet moment.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.057
Well... well, it was.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.325
And, uh, I don't know why

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.793
you're-you're trying
to debunk it.

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:14.895
-It was a sweet moment.
-No, I'm not. I apo...

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:16.964
-Sorry, I apologize.
-And let's face it--

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:20.100
the Internet ate it up like a...
like a two-for-one deal

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.703
at the Cheesecake Factory.

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:24.505
Which, by the way,
is a good restaurant

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.541
with terrific snacks
and appetizers.

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:31.912
And I recommend
their cheesecake, Chris.

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.248
Oh, well.
Good recommendation.

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:37.050
Uh...

00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:39.353
I mean, ev-everyone...
you go to Cheesecake Factory,

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.522
-why-why dick around, you know?
-Yeah, it's good. Don't...

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.290
-Just go right...
-Just go right to it,

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.726
-Just go right to it.
-Yeah, yeah. I mean...

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.127
-There's no reason...
-No, you're right,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.929
you're absolutely right.
It's not...

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:50.430
It's not Chicken Factory

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:51.798
-or Steak Factory.
-Exactly.

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:54.468
-You're the only one
who gets it, man. -Yeah.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:56.603
-I'm upset now.
-I mean, I...

00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:58.906
That picture was so cute,
even I almost forgot

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.776
about how I invaded Iraq
over WMDs that weren't there.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:06.213
I destabilized
an entire region, Chris,

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.116
but... but no one
seems to care anymore.

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.584
And, uh...

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:14.021
thanks to the-the bozo
Trump here,

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:15.889
uh, yeah,

00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:18.392
folks have forgotten about
how I tanked the economy

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.694
or how I-I didn't
get bin Laden.

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:24.431
Heck, you know, Kanye West even
said I hated hurricanes.

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.869
But... all forgotten now.

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:30.804
-You know? -All gone.
Yeah, it's all good, so...

00:04:30.838 --> 00:04:32.506
Okay, so, this is an
interesting thesis statement.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.474
You're saying Trump
is improving your image.

00:04:34.508 --> 00:04:37.511
So, does that... does that mean
that you're supporting him?

00:04:37.544 --> 00:04:40.314
He-he's a-he's
a dangerous man, Chris.

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:43.650
And, uh, back in Texas,
where I'm from,

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:45.619
bo-born and raised...

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.825
you don't talk about women
the way he does.

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:55.095
We-we got a... got a funny
kind of justice down there.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:58.398
Uh, some might even say
it's illegal.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.335
But, uh, but if he ever

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:04.171
tried jammin' his
Tic Tac-covered cow tongue

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:06.273
down a lady's throat in Texas,

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:10.244
we'd give him what we call
the Amarillo steak and eggs.

00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:12.779
That's where, uh,
that's where you cook him up

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.581
a nice T-bone steak,
medium rare,

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:17.017
with scrambled eggs
and a side of grits,

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.119
and then you drag him
with your truck.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:22.055
-HARDWICK: Oh, okay. All right.
-Yeah.

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.491
Good to know.
That's just what...

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:27.194
That's how...
that's how they do it.

00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:29.463
And now he's saying
the election's rigged.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.797
The only thing that's rigged

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.734
is-is that stuffed chupacabra
on top of his head.

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:39.306
I don't know how
he keeps it on there,

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.042
but I-I sure hope
Hillary knocks it off.

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:44.011
-(cheering, applause) -Yeah.
-HARDWICK: Oh. Oh, well, that...

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:48.415
Okay, that's...
that's really interesting.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:51.218
So that-so that means
you're endorsing Hillary, then?

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:53.387
Well, I... well, eh... I...

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.957
Look... I'm not
the decider, Chris.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.459
Yeah, I know, but I just...
I feel like so many Bushes

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:00.861
have already
indicated their support,

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:02.029
including your daughter
Barbara Bush,

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:03.330
your wife Laura Bush,

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.699
your father and former president
George H.W. Bush,

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.734
Gavin Rossdale,
the lead singer of Bush,

00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:09.670
the dog from
the Bush's Baked Beans ad,

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.139
almost every roller coaster
operator at Busch Gardens,

00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:15.142
this Bush near the I-80
outside Akron.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.013
So... what about
this last square here?

00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:23.383
What about George W. Bush? Are
you endorsing Hillary?

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:24.985
What are you doing?

00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:26.954
-Look at my wife's hat.
-Well...

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.025
That wa... I-I was
asking if you're...

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:35.696
-She looks almost Britishy,
you know? -Yeah, yeah, she...

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.465
She-she looks very Britishy,
but I-but I was asking

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:40.033
-who you're supporting, and...
-I'm sorry, Chris,

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:42.336
-I wasn't paying attention.
I was just... -Okay.

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:43.971
...meresmerized by my...

00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:46.039
She... It look like
she'd be part of the cast

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:49.510
-of <i>Downton Abbey.</i> -Yeah, she
does. Yeah, she definitely...

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:51.812
looks like the cast
of <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:54.081
I-Is it a hat that you would
think maybe a president

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:55.415
that you might want to see

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:56.950
in the White House
would wear, or...

00:06:56.984 --> 00:06:58.652
I still don't know
what you're driving towards.

00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:00.921
-Uh...
-Okay, all right.

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:03.123
I'll take world history for 400.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:05.425
All right.

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:07.794
Fair.

00:07:07.828 --> 00:07:10.097
Very fair. Okay.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.398
World history it is.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.401
In the 2016
presidential election,

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:17.838
George W. Bush
endorsed this candidate.

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:20.741
Look, Chris...

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.643
if Trump takes this thing,

00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:24.311
Laura and I have
a very comfortable

00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:27.814
underground bunker
we can move to, okay?

00:07:27.848 --> 00:07:30.117
It's got a mini fridge
for snacks and sodas

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.985
and a much larger
walk-in freezer

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.888
with thousands
of Hungry-Man dinners.

00:07:34.922 --> 00:07:36.790
Uh, we have every season

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:39.426
of <i>Just Shoot M</i> on DVD,

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.262
so I'm gonna be down there
with, uh, Princess Kate

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:45.933
and Nolan Ryan
while society gets overrun

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.535
by wild dogs and racists.

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:52.005
My advice is
don't let that happen, America.

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.441
Don't let that
sack of rotten sweet potatoes

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.076
anywhere near the White House,
you know?

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:58.045
-HARDWICK: All right, so...
-(cheering, applause)

00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:03.951
I mean, those are
very strong words.

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.420
So, that's a yes for Hillary?

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:08.589
Truth be told, I have...

00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:11.325
I have a-a strict
no-endorsement policy

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:14.561
since I got burned on a deal
before I was governor of Texas.

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:16.797
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.898
Yeah, I remember that.

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:19.800
I mean, I loved...
I loved them dang pants.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.736
-Yeah. -It's hard not to, and
you now you have a lot of 'em.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:25.038
President George W. Bush, thank
you so much for being here.

00:08:25.072 --> 00:08:27.941
Uh, do you have time to stick
around and play a game with us

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:30.077
-after the break?
-Of course I've got time.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.846
-What-what do you think
I'm doing here, Chris? -Okay.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.415
-(cheering, applause)
-All... all I have...

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:37.384
Yeah.

00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:43.123
I mean, literally,

00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:45.492
all I have is time.

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.828
I mean, you're gonna be lucky
if I even leave today.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.563
Okay, well, I...

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:51.865
I'm glad you're sticking around.
We're happy to have you here.

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:53.934
We'll be right back with
former president George W. Bush

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:54.034
and more <i>@midnight. </i>
Stick around.
