00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.320
Okay. Hello Andy. Hi, Mr Rogan. Thanks for having me. My pleasure.

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.790
How are you doing, man? You're all healed up.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.330
The bruising and swelling has gone down.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.690
As you can see about the most serious injury was to the brain.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.050
You have a serious injury to your brain. Yeah. Brain hemorrhage.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.880
What happened from what? The mall beating? So they were getting hit in the head.

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.720
You got a brain hemorrhage multiple times. Really? Intuitions. Yes,

8
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:31.710
they were bashing me on the back of my head and to my eyes.

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.160
<v 1>But what,</v>

10
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.510
so how do you know you had brain hemorrhaging and how are you able to just walk

11
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:37.344
around?

12
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.990
<v 0>Well, I was taken to, I started losing my balance after the beating.</v>

13
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.090
There was no police. I made it to the Court House, sat down on the ground.

14
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.040
Ambulance was called.

15
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.910
I had to walk back to the ambulance because the streets were a walk back to the

16
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:54.890
police precinct in the direction of the mall.

17
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.180
The medics that were associated with the Portland police let me know that they,

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.000
um, that I needed to walk in that direction.

19
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.440
It was quite shocking because it was, um,

20
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.040
I had just been a victim of the small beating and then now they're telling me to

21
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:09.620
walk back in direction of, uh,

22
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.870
the central precinct where the beating had happened.

23
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.420
<v 1>Did they not know that you had been beaten up? Well, let's, let's let, let's,</v>

24
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:19.080
let's set this up for people who are new to this and don't understand what

25
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:20.520
happened. Um,

26
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.580
I'd been aware of you because of you had written for Colette,

27
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.420
right. And, uh,

28
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:31.140
you had become one of these for whatever reason,

29
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.620
controversial online journalists and uh,

30
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.940
you covered antifa quite a bit and you covered a lot of, uh,

31
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:43.230
the radical left. You were in Portland. And uh,

32
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.270
what was the exact rally that was going on? What was it called?

33
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.683
Does it have a name?

34
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.160
<v 0>Uh, it was something like protect Portland.</v>

35
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.320
So it was organized by roasted.

36
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.170
He on to fight and its allies and by its allies I meet,

37
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.550
I am referring to the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America that

38
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:06.450
came out to some book done in numbers.

39
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.550
And what are they protecting Portland from?

40
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.130
They allege a fascist fascist, but just in general,

41
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:16.620
I mean is there like a particular thing they're worried about?

42
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.200
There were two right wing events happening that day that they were counter

43
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:27.060
demonstrating against. There was a on one side and pod one pod are downtown.

44
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.160
The proud boys for holding a flag waving event that was completely a peaceful.

45
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.080
There was no actually flag waving American flag waving. Correct. Okay. Um,

46
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.290
and a lot of Portlanders found that provocative and a manifestation of a fish's

47
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.080
stick violence and, and another part of downtown,

48
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:50.520
there was a men's rights activists who was holding, um, a rally.

49
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.770
Uh, it was titled for, for victims of domestic terrorism.

50
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:59.310
It was an anti antifa event. So,

51
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.200
uh,

52
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.510
<v 1>a men's rights activist yes.</v>

53
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.580
That was doing an anti fascist or anti antifa.

54
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.280
Correct. Well, what boy,

55
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.030
it seems like a whole lot of do about nothing. Flag-Waving and anti anti.

56
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.050
Okay.

57
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.870
<v 0>Yeah. Can I set the context for please? For the city of Portland? It's a mess.</v>

58
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.830
You have listeners and viewers all over the world. So Portland,

59
00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:30.831
Oregon is a extremely progressive city in the Pacific northwest of the u s and,

60
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.640
um, I call it a political monoculture because really it's, um, uh,

61
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.233
not just,

62
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.010
you're more likely to find Socialists Open Socialists there then you would find

63
00:03:44.011 --> 00:03:45.420
like a regular, uh,

64
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.450
republican or Conservative and within the sort of echo chamber of just left us

65
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:53.190
politics, there's,

66
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.700
it's become also a hotbed for far left militancy Soro city Antifa is,

67
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.290
you could call it like the local chapter movement of Antifa is one of the oldest

68
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:08.220
in the country. It's very large in Portland. And they hold,

69
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.270
um, what you could call protests, but they're there.

70
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.350
Their protest would always devolve into riots where they essentially take over

71
00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:19.440
parts of downtown and attack people,

72
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:23.940
attack their ideological opponents and do it frequently with impunity.

73
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.310
I mean, I wasn't the only one to talk that day.

74
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:30.540
There were two other people who were bashed on the head very and have very

75
00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:35.070
severe lacerations to the face on hat. And you may recall the footage, uh,

76
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.750
from October of last year when there was an elderly driver who was attacked on

77
00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:40.560
the streets.

78
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.850
<v 1>Yeah, they were directing traffic. Exactly. And somehow or another,</v>

79
00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:48.060
the mayor thought it was a good idea to let this take place. Is that the case?

80
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:50.190
And they told the police to stand down. Is that true?

81
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.870
<v 0>So, um,</v>

82
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.180
I mean the next part of this journey for me will be the legal aspect of it.

83
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.910
And it seems like something things in Portland,

84
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.870
the issue is really not with the rank and file officers.

85
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.070
They're following orders to not intervene. So I,

86
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:10.950
I had been, uh,

87
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.150
assaulted and criminally harassed early before the mob, beating people,

88
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.720
throwing milkshakes at my face and head within eyesight of police who were

89
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:24.100
watching in downtown. And both of these were reported. And the,

90
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:27.220
the answer that I heard that day as I've heard many times before when I've been

91
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:31.240
assaulted by Antifa is that we will not question,

92
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.680
approach or detain the suspect because this couldn't, it's like the crowd.

93
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.350
<v 1>Okay. So this is why this has exacerbated,</v>

94
00:05:39.351 --> 00:05:42.600
or this is why this has become such a big deal in Portland because of this

95
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:42.991
attitude.

96
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:47.100
Because Portland seems to be the hot bed right now for this kind of stuff.

97
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.260
Is that, is that fair to say? I think it is.

98
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.250
So is this the mayor hook mean who is,

99
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.530
who's the one who's giving the orders to the police to tell them to allow stuff

100
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.364
to take place?

101
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.450
<v 0>Well, on,</v>

102
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.480
on crowd funding for the legal fund right now and we are willing,

103
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.400
we are going to hold accountable.

104
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.470
Whoever is responsible for dereliction of duty where the evidence leads us.

105
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:17.471
So Portland has the odd Duvernay's system in that the mayor who is up for

106
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:24.140
reelection by the way, is also the police commissioner,

107
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.270
so, oh wow. Yeah. How does that work?

108
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.970
It, it was an old system that I had inherited and it just,

109
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.350
it never changed from the wild west. Like that sounds ridiculous.

110
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.080
It is ridiculous. You can see all the political con,

111
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.450
the conflicts and then conflicts of interest that that would arise. Right? Yeah.

112
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.220
Yeah. Shitload. Um, how did you get involved in this? Like what, why,

113
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.510
first of all, why were they angry you, I uh,

114
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.190
I work as a journalist. Uh,

115
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.590
I'll name like places that I've been published before.

116
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.830
I write and I do video and I do podcasts.

117
00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:03.140
So my written work has been published in the Wall Street Journal,

118
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.330
the National Reviews Spectator,

119
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.210
New York Post and my on the editorial team of Collette magazine. Um,

120
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.050
and one of my beats among south row is about far less militancy,

121
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:16.160
particularly in Portland.

122
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.760
And to me what I was noticing was that the national and local media coverage had

123
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.920
a particular blind spot when it came to the coverage on Antifa.

124
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.430
There was all this sensitivity to the colonoscopy far-right and uh,

125
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:38.900
white nationalism or white identity extremism,

126
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.680
but they could not or would not recognize the militancy that was on the left.

127
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.110
And Portland's seem to be one of the places for Ground Zero,

128
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.380
particularly after 2016,

129
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:55.230
we had very violent rioting and downtown that, um,

130
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.930
a segment of the population could not accept the election results in November.

131
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.090
And so, uh, they did $1 million in damage setting fires and,

132
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.750
uh, destroying properties and businesses. And I thought time,

133
00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:13.751
I was a graduate student working at the student paper and I did a story on that

134
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:19.040
and I came out to witness and it, it, you know, this was a major American city,

135
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:24.041
but it felt like I was in Afghanistan or Iraq just with all of these fires and

136
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:28.490
explosions and people running around with bouts while I messed up.

137
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.880
And that was the first time I really became familiar with Antifa and I took an

138
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:36.881
interest in it and I saw over and over that the media coverage was basically

139
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.140
really sorta whitewashing them,

140
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.760
kind of like referring to them as antifascist,

141
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.910
giving them that propaganda victory and anti Pfizer movement,

142
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.450
the monsters of doublespeak and disinformation.

143
00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:57.760
So it starts with name. Antifa is short for antifascists,

144
00:08:57.761 --> 00:09:00.250
but I never refer to them as [inaudible] because, um,

145
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.100
that's seeding the ground to, uh, to them.

146
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.990
Uh, they, when they say that they are, uh,

147
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.580
defending a community self-defense,

148
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:16.500
it actually is referring to meet premeditated violence and offensive violence.

149
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.990
So I started going into covering this more and more. You know,

150
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:26.180
after I left the student paper, I started writing for, um,

151
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.710
some national and international publications.

152
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.520
And there internationally there was, uh, you know,

153
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.650
a set of readers who interested in what the hell is going on in Portland,

154
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:41.880
why are there these continuous scenes of street brawls and anarchy over and

155
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.970
over? What are the variables that are causing this?

156
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.230
And I thought that I could try to shine a light on it.

157
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.390
And by doing so,

158
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:56.391
Antifa became enraged with my work and particularly things they've hated me

159
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:03.360
since last year. But they started really escalating,

160
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.570
um, on, on the 1st of May, May Day. Um,

161
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.640
so this year was when I was physically assaulted by them for the first time.

162
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.540
They were very upset that I wrote a story for the New York Post where there was

163
00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:22.830
a series of,

164
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.330
and this is one of the other beats that I work on is a hate crime hoaxes.

165
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.150
Um, Portland earlier this year,

166
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:34.890
I had this huge panic over serious allegations of,

167
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.420
uh, LGBT people claiming that they were marauding right-wing gangs,

168
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:43.680
driving around, trying to kill people with bats, with hammers,

169
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.690
trying to, uh, kidnapped them.

170
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.130
And these were all rumors that were reported on social media calls to huge

171
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:54.360
frenzy. Even the mayor, uh, had to come out and, you know,

172
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.710
issue statement about how he was concerned there was an emergency town hole with

173
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.570
the local career center. And, um,

174
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.690
so I started looking into all these allegations,

175
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.730
so it was 15 of them and I found that of the 15 only one was reported to police

176
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:15.090
and what was reported to police and documented in the report was entirely

177
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.290
different from the go fund me,

178
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.830
where over $10,000 was raised for this trans activists. Um,

179
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:25.910
she had alleged that one night walking home transphobic people had beat her with

180
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:28.050
a bat and knocked him unconscious.

181
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:32.940
Police report said that she was extremely intoxicated and likely fell and there

182
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:35.880
was no evidence that anybody had assaulted her.

183
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.980
So when this story came out because anti-fog was really antifa and the

184
00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:44.760
democratic socialists of America and Portland were really involved in paddling

185
00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:49.560
this hate crime fear in Portland. And I just Kinda, you know,

186
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.920
threw water on this, uh, uh, panic that they have been,

187
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.390
um, flaming. And so on the 1st of May,

188
00:11:59.830 --> 00:11:59.860
um,

189
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.850
there was a riot that I was covering and one of the mast and seafood people went

190
00:12:03.851 --> 00:12:06.880
up and sprayed me with, I think it was Bam Mace,

191
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:11.470
some type of chemical that blinds you and burns. You saw that video? Yeah.

192
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.850
So there was no police that ha that was there that,

193
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.650
I mean that Antifa event was publicly advertised on Facebook and all that.

194
00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:22.150
So over and over,

195
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.830
like Antifa is very transparent about their calls for people to come to the

196
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:31.210
stuff and to engage in this physical confrontation that they call self defense.

197
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.840
And the police either stay away or on purpose or are told to stay away.

198
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:38.853
So

199
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.150
<v 1>it's very confusing because when you watch the videos there,</v>

200
00:12:42.151 --> 00:12:44.940
there's amazing people. They're amazing people who disagree with them,

201
00:12:44.941 --> 00:12:46.050
like they're yelling at each other.

202
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.150
And then someone will come along and makes people,

203
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:53.300
and for the police to not step in and do something, it's, I don't,

204
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.060
I don't think there's another city in the country that would allow something

205
00:12:57.061 --> 00:12:57.960
like that. It just doesn't,

206
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.140
it doesn't seem like it makes any sense at all because you're,

207
00:13:00.141 --> 00:13:02.910
you're not talking about people that are being physically attacked and that are

208
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.450
macing someone to protect themselves or even a threat of being physically

209
00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:07.170
attacked.

210
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.470
They're just disagreeing with each other and yelling at each other and then

211
00:13:10.471 --> 00:13:12.420
someone will come along and start macing people.

212
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.580
And I've seen it many times and I think there's also a real problem with people

213
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:21.690
wearing masks. You know, what, whether their ideology makes sense or not.

214
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.350
When you put people in masks and then you have a bunch of people yelling and

215
00:13:25.351 --> 00:13:30.210
escalating and then there's teams, there's team antifa versus team, you know,

216
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.240
anybody opposing them they feel is a white supremacist or a Nazi.

217
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.850
And this is just how they've chosen to frame it, to dehumanize people.

218
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.230
And then you see them attack people.

219
00:13:40.231 --> 00:13:43.290
I'm sure you're aware of the girl who got maced in the face because she had a

220
00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:45.450
hat on that said make bitcoin great again,

221
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:49.710
but it was the same color hat as the make America great again hat and she got

222
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:52.440
maced in the face and she got hit with something too. Right.

223
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.440
Then she had hit in the face with something. Anyway,

224
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.500
this kind of shit is really weird.

225
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.670
It's really weird and disturbing to see these young people with these ideals,

226
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.430
idealistic versions of what they're doing.

227
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.130
I think a lot of the people that are involved in that really think they are

228
00:14:08.131 --> 00:14:10.260
fighting fascism. They really do.

229
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.190
They really think that Donald Trump and the proud boys and white supremacists

230
00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:16.650
from Charlottesville carrying Tiki torches,

231
00:14:16.651 --> 00:14:20.520
that these people represent something horrible that sweeping across the country

232
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.570
in the young people today need to stand up and fight against this and they're

233
00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:27.900
putting on masks and they're carrying backpacks and whacking people in the head

234
00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:32.901
with crowbars is really fucking weird to see and it's really weird that the city

235
00:14:33.991 --> 00:14:38.820
of Portland or all cities in fact haven't made some sort of a law where you

236
00:14:38.821 --> 00:14:43.350
can't walk around in public with a fucking mask on because that is one of the

237
00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:44.490
things that helps these people.

238
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.630
It's the same thing that you see on social media when people are anonymous and

239
00:14:48.631 --> 00:14:50.400
they say the most horrible, hateful shit,

240
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.550
they're saying that because they're not in front of you,

241
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.960
you can't recognize them.

242
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.910
They don't have to take responsibility for what they're saying.

243
00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.470
This is a lot of the same characteristics that a person has when they're wearing

244
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.363
a costume.

245
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.240
You're dressed in all black with gloves on and a face mask and you're hitting

246
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:08.150
people with a bike lock. Like what? What is that about? Well,

247
00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:12.050
what that's about is you're getting away with being anonymous and you're getting

248
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:14.090
support from all these other people around you.

249
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.690
There's this mob mentality that takes place.

250
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.170
It's well documented with humans where when you get a group of people together

251
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.980
and there's another group and it's like, it's a tribal warfare type situation,

252
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.910
and that's what you're seeing within TIF.

253
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.200
And the fact that the Portland police have,

254
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:31.610
I don't know what's going on with them,

255
00:15:31.611 --> 00:15:33.560
whether they've been told to not handle that,

256
00:15:33.561 --> 00:15:36.690
but the fact they haven't done anything to mitigate this is fucking, uh, it's,

257
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.600
it's embarrassing. It's a shame. It's, it's terrible. It really is.

258
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.610
It's a term, it's a travesty.

259
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.580
<v 0>You asked about the mayor earlier and, and if he issued any stand down orders,</v>

260
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:53.610
there's a statement that was put out after I was attacked by the puddle Turner,

261
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.500
who's the president of the police union and he said very clearly,

262
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.440
he called from the male to remove the handcuffs,

263
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.190
handcuffs of law enforcement so they can enforce the law.

264
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.510
And he accused them out of politicizing the police department.

265
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.890
Is this mayor popular? No, he's not.

266
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.910
He's hated.

267
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:18.300
Well by moderates because of the things that he allows top in the city.

268
00:16:18.491 --> 00:16:22.000
But the far left hate him as well. They view him as not radical enough.

269
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:29.530
<v 1>Why, why are they mad at you? Is it just the articles that you've written?</v>

270
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.070
Cause somebody told me that you had been accused of doxing people. Is that true?

271
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:38.600
<v 0>Absolutely not true. So this is such an outrageous defamatory claims.</v>

272
00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:42.240
So what happened was, uh, on May Day at that riot,

273
00:16:42.241 --> 00:16:45.350
there was one of the Antifa women, uh,

274
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.740
had charged in to participate in the fight during the rope brawl and one of the

275
00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.240
right wing person, he was wearing a mouse. I didn't know who he was,

276
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.860
allegedly had uh, hit her on her head.

277
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.200
Nia had on her neck somewhere like that. She was knocked out.

278
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.160
I recognized this woman from her activism that day as the person who,

279
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.440
um, sabotage the sound equipment.

280
00:17:10.441 --> 00:17:14.790
When James DiMauro came to Portland state in February of last year,

281
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:17.430
that was an event that I was involved in organizing, uh,

282
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:18.750
putting Portland State University.

283
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.720
<v 1>And we should just explain to people, James DeMaurice,</v>

284
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.900
the author of the Google memo that was talking about women in tech that was

285
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:30.380
wildly misrepresented what he had said and the people had claimed that he was

286
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.500
this awful sexist,

287
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:36.510
even the CEO of Youtube said that he enforced harmful gender stereotypes where

288
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.850
while he was citing, um,

289
00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:43.910
evolutionary psychology and the citing all these different studies on why women

290
00:17:44.461 --> 00:17:49.440
gravitate towards particular fields and even a page and a half encouraging a

291
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:53.150
strategy, do you track strategies to encourage more women to get into tech?

292
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.160
But it was basically in response to things that Google had written about dealing

293
00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:02.190
with the lack of women in tech. What, what is the problem here?

294
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.760
They were looking for a PR for pro very particular answer, which was sexism.

295
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.691
And he was saying, well,

296
00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:10.980
it actually has more to do with the choices that women sort of naturally tend to

297
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:11.910
gravitate towards.

298
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:17.330
And he was saying that there was a way to prob possibly encourage women to get

299
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:20.490
into technology and he divides these strategies to do so,

300
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:25.050
but was wildly misrepresented. And He, if you meet the guy,

301
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:28.980
and I've had him on the podcast, he is a soft spoken sweetheart of a guy.

302
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:32.550
He's not, I'm not a massage dentist, not a mean spirited person.

303
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:37.740
He was merely looking at the results of studies and he was looking at real raw

304
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:42.741
data and this real tendency that certain people have to gravitate towards

305
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:45.060
certain positions in life.

306
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.500
<v 0>Yeah. So there was so many misconceptions about James somewhere, which is why,</v>

307
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.560
uh, the student group I was involved in was invited him to come,

308
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.070
but Antifa and the allies just could not take that.

309
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.390
They tried to shut down the event. They tried to get it console.

310
00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.170
And at that event, this one woman, she, uh,

311
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.820
damage to sound equipment as she was trying to shut it down,

312
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.080
she pulled all these quotes out and pushed the soundboard on the ground at

313
00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:12.000
broke. So I recognized her from that day. She was named in the media. Um,

314
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.570
and then on May Day recognize her. So I named her, I said,

315
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.160
this is the name of the woman who was knocked out. I recognize her from, uh,

316
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.020
the James demoine event. Uh,

317
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.620
protest where she had done ministry equipment and Antifa had spun that around as

318
00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:32.130
me doxing her. Um, that's not doxing.

319
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:37.530
Doxing is where you release people's personal details such as where they work,

320
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.170
where they live, their phone numbers with the,

321
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.400
so that people who identified her, I named her, yes,

322
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:49.110
but she had been identified in the media before. She was a big local activists.

323
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.680
<v 1>So that's basically it. Other than you writing these stories,</v>

324
00:19:53.681 --> 00:19:55.360
criticizing their behavior,

325
00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:01.410
what's disturbing to me beyond disturbing was legitimate journalists that were

326
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:08.250
making excuses for why you got beat up and people saying things like play stupid

327
00:20:10.661 --> 00:20:15.430
games when stupid prizes. I saw stuff like that that pick a better hobby.

328
00:20:15.431 --> 00:20:19.540
I saw a guy write that, you know, antifascists will rule.

329
00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.430
No Portland's not your place.

330
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.930
I saw all this crazy shit from people that blue check marks that were saying

331
00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.740
that this is what happens when you support fascism.

332
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.450
And I was so baffled by this. Like I read some of your stuff.

333
00:20:34.451 --> 00:20:37.720
I haven't read all of it admittedly, but I've read some of you stuff.

334
00:20:37.721 --> 00:20:40.090
None of it came off as you supporting fascism.

335
00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.710
It came off as you maybe at the worst case scenario,

336
00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:49.711
being a contrarian and not wanting to go with this sort of left wing ideology

337
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:55.690
that is so widespread throughout the Pacific northwest. But I didn't,

338
00:20:55.691 --> 00:20:58.870
I didn't see any, I mean, first of all,

339
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.990
you're not a white guy. We should be explained to people.

340
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.450
You are Vietnamese and you know,

341
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:07.480
you're what they would consider a member of a protected class.

342
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:10.750
You're not just a minority, you're openly gay.

343
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:15.100
You mean your, your what? What do you consider yourself politically?

344
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.160
<v 0>I've been avoiding labels for a while. I think,</v>

345
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.110
and it's interesting that a lot of the coverage on what happened to me always

346
00:21:25.111 --> 00:21:27.450
call the fide my Jay, um,

347
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.420
who I am as like conservative journalist.

348
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.300
<v 1>Well, the worst thing is the way they're labeled Colette, they were said,</v>

349
00:21:33.301 --> 00:21:36.930
you work for far right? A Newspaper Magazine, Colette,

350
00:21:36.931 --> 00:21:41.370
which is not the case at all. That's not true.

351
00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.130
<v 0>I think the subtle, I mean the dog was sorts of,</v>

352
00:21:46.131 --> 00:21:49.490
they're trying to say in there that this person deserved it.

353
00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.460
And of course these are the same people who always talk about believes the

354
00:21:52.461 --> 00:21:56.540
victim. They were the ones who jumped on to believe justice.

355
00:21:56.541 --> 00:22:00.380
Marlette um, but uh, I guess I was the wrong type of victim.

356
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:05.160
<v 1>Well exactly because even though you are, you're,</v>

357
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.260
you seem like a very nice person. You aren't doing anything violent. You,

358
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.490
you supporting the wrong thing or not supporting them, not supporting,

359
00:22:14.491 --> 00:22:19.491
not just blindly supporting what Antifa is involved with,

360
00:22:19.741 --> 00:22:22.380
which is what I mean. That is what fascism is.

361
00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:27.650
I mean you can't even question some of the more heinous things that make clearly

362
00:22:28.381 --> 00:22:31.110
heinous things they're doing. Just fucking macing people in the audience,

363
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:36.270
Mason people in the crowd just pointing it at people yelling and screaming,

364
00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:38.940
hitting each other with things. When you're wearing masks,

365
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:42.630
getting involved in these brawls, it's so fucking stupid.

366
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.580
It's so stupid to watch.

367
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:49.970
It's like this is base human behavior and its worst example and the fact that

368
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.230
this dumb ass fucking mayor thinks that this is a good idea to let this play

369
00:22:55.231 --> 00:22:57.840
itself out. This is how people get shot.

370
00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:02.340
This is how people die when you allow a certain amount of violence and when you

371
00:23:02.341 --> 00:23:02.611
can,

372
00:23:02.611 --> 00:23:06.750
don't or don't do anything with violence that you can't defend like violence

373
00:23:06.751 --> 00:23:07.890
against a person like yourself.

374
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.990
I saw those guys hitting you in the back of the head,

375
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.840
throwing milkshakes at you where your truck just trying to walk away.

376
00:23:12.841 --> 00:23:13.950
You weren't doing anything.

377
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.540
<v 0>Yeah. You, you asked me after getting, how did I get the, the brain hemorrhage.</v>

378
00:23:18.541 --> 00:23:21.540
So the video that's gone viral out there,

379
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.220
there's actually the second half of the beating.

380
00:23:23.221 --> 00:23:26.280
I don't know if there's video of the first half, hopefully, um,

381
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.920
there is through CCTV or something, but the first,

382
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.740
there are more hits to my face in my head.

383
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.010
And so when I went to the hospital, uh,

384
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:39.270
because of the nature of the contusions on my head, they did a CT scan in the,

385
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:43.200
um, in the Er and that confirmed the sub arachnoid hemorrhage.

386
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.040
<v 1>So what started it?</v>

387
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.930
<v 0>What, what was the, why did you get hit? Okay. 29th of June.</v>

388
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.980
Okay. Uh, that would be 10, 11 days ago from now.

389
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.220
And so there was that demonstration happening.

390
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:03.170
Antifa was rallying to oppose the fall. Right. They claim of pose fascists.

391
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:09.170
I came, I was excited to use my new GoPro. I was a bit nervous. Um, speaking,

392
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.840
I'm going to like van, I was nervous cause I had been targeted just um,

393
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.170
two months earlier. Right.

394
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.420
I left my house with the helmet and got in my car and saw briefly my,

395
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:24.350
you wear a helmet. I had to help let, I did have one.

396
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.290
I saw a reflection on myself, took it off,

397
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.430
decided I don't want anybody there to get the impression that I can't,

398
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.330
cause they already accused me of being a Nazi in fall rights and white

399
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.320
supremacists.

400
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.300
I didn't want any of them to then perceive me by the fact that I came to the

401
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:44.000
helmet as possibly a combatant. So I left that at home.

402
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.830
That means white supremacists is up possible in their always. Yes. Hilarious.

403
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.840
And, I mean this goes to the,

404
00:24:51.841 --> 00:24:55.940
the bigger issue that I've taken issue with how flipping people use these

405
00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:59.600
accusations of not just racist or being Nazi or far right,

406
00:24:59.601 --> 00:25:04.601
but it's like what part of what makes anti-fossil dangerous is that they feel

407
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:10.070
that they are morally justified in the brutality. Yes.

408
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:15.310
And they get actually a lot of morale from progressive and left wing media.

409
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.200
So, um, after talking about what the attacker would like to talk about,

410
00:25:21.201 --> 00:25:26.150
how the actual militant anti photos people is very small,

411
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.400
those who are going out and doing the violence,

412
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.760
the lodge or group and those that I find more concerning actually or the

413
00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:38.921
nonviolent ENT feel antifa find those more concerning because they work to

414
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:44.090
mainstream anti phys tactics and ideas.

415
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.970
Like now doxing by Antifa is not even,

416
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.480
is kind of seen as well, these people deserve it.

417
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:52.370
I'm like,

418
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.080
do people not realize like when your docs and your peoples, you know,

419
00:25:57.081 --> 00:25:59.150
releasing your addresses happened to me,

420
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.120
your family's address out it.

421
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:07.100
It puts this constant state of fear in you even when you're in your own home.

422
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.700
Like, I don't know if they realize that. Um,

423
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.860
so there's the doxing and then of course you know,

424
00:26:12.861 --> 00:26:16.790
the punch or not see meme was meant to be cute and funny. Um,

425
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.770
but when they labeled such large segment of the population that's Nazi, it's,

426
00:26:20.771 --> 00:26:24.760
it's, it's going after a lot of people who um,

427
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.230
are innocent and law abiding such as myself,

428
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.560
but they're also calling Jewish people Nazis is actually insane.

429
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.340
And then now more recently the, the milkshake and leucine us as cute,

430
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.650
nonviolent for my political dissent.

431
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.330
As you saw in the video after I was getting beaten,

432
00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:45.340
I was trying to get away then they were pelting all liquids at my head and in my

433
00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:49.350
face and that blinded me. I couldn't even see really which way to leave.

434
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.830
So to backtrack a little bit, sorry,

435
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.160
I'm jumping all over the march. It was right in the heart of downtown

436
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.430
justify as attack. They were chanting no hate, no fear. This is irony of it.

437
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:03.660
I remember that very clearly.

438
00:27:03.661 --> 00:27:06.270
The crowd was chanting that I was walking towards the front of the

439
00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:09.080
demonstration, thought I would to get a wide angle shot on my golf,

440
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.160
a GoPro before I could get there.

441
00:27:11.161 --> 00:27:15.690
Somebody bashes me really hard in the back of the head and I've never been in a

442
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:17.840
fight. Um, Mr Rogan.

443
00:27:17.841 --> 00:27:20.820
So I didn't even realize what had happened to me.

444
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:23.940
I was knocked forward as soon as I caught my footing,

445
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.130
the punches kept coming from every direction and all I could see was like,

446
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.680
um, people just in block with mass.

447
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:35.490
And most of them that were hitting me hard on these gloves that have the

448
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:37.050
hardened, um, knuckles,

449
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:42.080
I think it's like slap gloves or tactical clothes and it was just endless.

450
00:27:42.151 --> 00:27:44.490
And I could see in the background like, um,

451
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.940
this was in front of the Justice Center. This is the other side irony.

452
00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.810
So in broad daylight,

453
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.070
in the of downtown steps away from the central police precinct,

454
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.580
from the sheriff's office, this beating happened,

455
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.860
no police intervene at any point. I don't really see it. I don't know. I,

456
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.860
nobody came to my aid at any point before, during or after.

457
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:11.220
<v 1>So this happens out of nowhere. You get side of the back of the head,</v>

458
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:13.710
a bunch of people punch you. I mean, how many times do you think you got hit?

459
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.010
<v 0>Maybe six or more.</v>

460
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:18.580
<v 1>The,</v>

461
00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.820
the fact that people dismissed this as not being a big deal is really horrific

462
00:28:22.821 --> 00:28:26.960
to me. The fact that the people that are in Antifa that are nonviolent folks,

463
00:28:26.961 --> 00:28:27.720
which I think I'm,

464
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.630
I'm glad you brought that up cause I was going to bring that up,

465
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:33.140
that it's the extreme of the extremists, right?

466
00:28:33.141 --> 00:28:37.370
It's the people that think that there's a call for violence and that there's a

467
00:28:37.371 --> 00:28:41.000
reason to do it. And even someone like yourself that is a nonviolent person.

468
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:46.150
I was just there as a journalist that there is a justification for just just for

469
00:28:46.311 --> 00:28:49.220
whatever reason you want, just go up to that person and start hitting them.

470
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.570
Even though they're not a threat,

471
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.490
even though they're not doing anything to harm anybody,

472
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.020
even though they're not putting anybody in danger there,

473
00:28:55.021 --> 00:28:57.740
they're just being a journalist and you feel like you could justify hitting

474
00:28:57.741 --> 00:29:00.410
them. It's really disgusting. And it's this guy,

475
00:29:00.411 --> 00:29:04.520
I mean there was this thing with vox where Carlos Mesa was

476
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.990
minimizing um, the,

477
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:13.370
the impact of Antifa and kind of joking around about it and making it seem like

478
00:29:13.371 --> 00:29:14.540
it's just no big deal.

479
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.320
And he got really upset cause Steven Crowder was making fun of the fact that

480
00:29:18.321 --> 00:29:19.154
he's gay.

481
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.940
And the fact that he talks with the list and that crowd or mentioned that along

482
00:29:22.941 --> 00:29:27.530
with mocking his stance on Antifa and then it became this gigantic thing that

483
00:29:27.531 --> 00:29:29.120
Steven Crowder's a gay basher.

484
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:34.070
But what didn't become a big deal is that this guy is minimizing violent

485
00:29:34.071 --> 00:29:37.370
fascists. And that's what I mean. That's how I feel about this.

486
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:41.090
When you're trying to enforce your own ideology on other,

487
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.320
and you have no tolerance for anybody with a different opinion,

488
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.140
particularly journalists, that is fascism.

489
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:52.650
It's so ironic to call yourself an antifascist when you're literally in forcing

490
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.940
your own particular ideology to the point of violence and you're wearing masks

491
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:01.600
and you're running around hitting people and pretending that you're being

492
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:06.070
inundated with Nazis and white supremacists and that this is all necessary.

493
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:10.360
Like that old man that was just driving and they're directing traffic and

494
00:30:10.361 --> 00:30:13.970
forcing him to obey them, and then when he doesn't watch it,

495
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.800
they chase after him and assault him. It's fucking bananas.

496
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:22.450
And the fact that this city has not stepped in and recognize that they have a

497
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:26.950
real problem because this has got momentum behind it and the people that are

498
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:31.420
involved that are nonviolent, you got to speak up. They've got to speak up.

499
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:35.470
If you're a person that really believes that there shouldn't be homophobia and

500
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:38.140
there shouldn't be violence and there shouldn't be white supremacy,

501
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:42.610
good for you. You probably got involved in this for all the right reasons.

502
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:47.790
But if you don't recognize that someone like you yourself who is a person of a

503
00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:51.370
different ethnicity, you're not a white person. You're Vietnamese,

504
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.580
you're a gay man and you got assaulted for no reason.

505
00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.260
You didn't do anything that mean.

506
00:30:56.261 --> 00:31:01.261
It's almost like a test of where do your values truly lie and if you think it's

507
00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:05.080
okay for a person like you to just get assaulted for no reason,

508
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.590
you are the problem. You're the problem.

509
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.750
Your mindset is the problem.

510
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:12.970
It's not whether or not there should be white supremacy.

511
00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:13.930
Of course there shouldn't be.

512
00:31:13.931 --> 00:31:18.310
It's not whether or not there shouldn't be people be able to freely express

513
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:19.720
themselves. Of course there should be.

514
00:31:19.721 --> 00:31:24.490
That is not what the issue is with the issue is his group mob mentality.

515
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.390
When you get people together and you let them wear masks and you tell them that

516
00:31:28.391 --> 00:31:32.380
they're fighting against some evil and then they feel justified and hitting a

517
00:31:32.381 --> 00:31:33.220
person like you,

518
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.810
it is really sickening and there's this diffusion of responsibility thing that

519
00:31:37.811 --> 00:31:41.320
happens when one person hits you and everybody feels like it's okay to hit you.

520
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:46.090
It's a mob mentality thing and it's, it is extremely common with human beings.

521
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.220
I've been in mob situations. It's terrifying because you feel it in the air.

522
00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.670
You feel the chaos in the air when you're in some sort of a,

523
00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:58.630
a large scale brawl type situation, like anything can happen.

524
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.060
People just run up on people and start punching them.

525
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.210
It's not like two people alone in a, in a,

526
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.350
in a like an open area where they can talk and work things out. No,

527
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:11.770
it's chaos and there's some weird animal activity.

528
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.510
There's some weird weird animal instinct aspect to it that is very unique to

529
00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:21.100
humans and when you see something like this and see a guy like you just getting

530
00:32:21.101 --> 00:32:25.150
peppered with milkshakes and punched in the head and it's fucking disturbing.

531
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:30.280
And for these people to dismiss that and not stand out, not stand up and say,

532
00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:32.740
hey, this is not what we're supposed to be about.

533
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.830
This is not what I signed up for. They become a part of the problem.

534
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.500
I'm sure there's people listening to this that are upset at this because maybe

535
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:43.040
you, you, you've support Antifa you support their ideology.

536
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.080
Think about what you actually support.

537
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.630
Think about what this is really all about.

538
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.680
What you shouldn't be supporting is people wearing masks running around fucking

539
00:32:51.681 --> 00:32:54.110
hitting people. You ain't changing shit with that.

540
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.680
All you're going to do is call for more people with masks from the other side.

541
00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.950
If people feel like right-wing peep or being attacked.

542
00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:04.730
And I don't think you're even right wing. Are you? I mean, what are,

543
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.710
what will you just, what would,

544
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:10.580
if you had a gun to your head or a mace to your face, what would you just say?

545
00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:12.020
You're a centrist. What would you say?

546
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:15.560
I think it's fair to describe me on a center right. Center. Right. Okay.

547
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.650
Which is fine. It should be okay. I mean, there should be,

548
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:23.651
we should be allowed to have disagreements of ideologies and of political

549
00:33:24.771 --> 00:33:28.100
persuasions, political, um, leanings.

550
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.850
But this is th it's twisted and it's twisted.

551
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:33.920
The way it's being depicted in the media.

552
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:37.670
It's very strange how it's being dismissed. It's very strange.

553
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:42.440
And that there's really people in 2019 debating whether or not it's okay to

554
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:45.740
assault journalists. It's fucking madness.

555
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.440
<v 0>Well, we didn't seem to build up to this for years.</v>

556
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.280
Pupil political violence coming from the left is seen as moral and unfortunately

557
00:33:56.631 --> 00:33:59.450
even those working in mainstream media,

558
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:03.680
how that tynes excused or found that type of violence.

559
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:04.970
Good.

560
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:09.970
I'm thinking of Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon at CNN and I wonder if that played a

561
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:14.690
role in why they were the only center left, um, broadcast,

562
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.640
um, new station news network to invite me on to speak.

563
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:25.510
Um, no other leftist center media has invited me on, um, to anyway.

564
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:28.630
<v 1>When they had you on the speak, what was their attitude about all this?</v>

565
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:34.870
<v 0>I think the host was very respectful and fair. Who else?</v>

566
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.140
Who wasn't? Um, John Brennan? I think.

567
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.030
<v 1>So. You think they were respectful and fair? Um,</v>

568
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:47.570
did it bother you that people at Chris Cuomo and Don Limmud had openly supported

569
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.823
Antifa

570
00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:53.170
<v 0>it did it, I mean, this is,</v>

571
00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.400
was kind of encouraged me to continue to doing my work, um, months ago,

572
00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.680
even last year when I was getting threatened because it seemed like,

573
00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:07.610
I don't think Chris or dawn actually understood,

574
00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.120
I think the ignorant about Antifa. I think you're right. You know,

575
00:35:10.121 --> 00:35:12.850
they fall and they believe the, the propaganda about them.

576
00:35:12.851 --> 00:35:14.470
That's just an antifascist movement. Yeah.

577
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.630
<v 1>Well the name of [inaudible] itself,</v>

578
00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:22.580
<v 0>I'm hoping that, like even with my injuries and some you can see some,</v>

579
00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:25.540
you, you can't. Um, I'm continuing to speak,

580
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:30.541
force myself to do all of these media engagements because I want the needle on

581
00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.350
the conversations about Antifa to, to, to move to change.

582
00:35:35.351 --> 00:35:40.351
Like this is not just a movement of people masking up and starting random

583
00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:48.510
violence on the streets. Like the violence isn't just, it has not arbitrary.

584
00:35:48.511 --> 00:35:52.530
It's working towards their goal. It's a movement of violent,

585
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.560
radical anarchists and communists and they're agitating for political revolution

586
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.350
in violence as part of the modus operandi. It's not a bug,

587
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:02.970
it's a feature of what they do.

588
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.350
So I don't know if people recognize how dangerous this is,

589
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:12.210
this movement and the DHS since 2016 has described some of antic fuzz activities

590
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.220
as domestic terrorist violence. So the fact that they're able to openly,

591
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.190
um, organize and recruit on social media is, it's a baffling to me.

592
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:28.220
I'm wondering like there's such this huge blind spot for far left melodies and

593
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:32.250
see, not shits in mainstream media but also in big tech.

594
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.120
<v 1>Do you think this is because Trump is president and because so many people</v>

595
00:36:35.121 --> 00:36:39.050
oppose Trump as president did? The idea of far left militancy is in a,

596
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.060
in opposition to what they oppose so they feel like the the enemy of my enemy is

597
00:36:44.061 --> 00:36:45.770
my friend. That's exactly what it is.

598
00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:50.771
I think it what Eric Weinstein had a great point about this and he said the one

599
00:36:52.431 --> 00:36:57.431
of the real issues is the cowards of the left and the cowards of the right that

600
00:36:57.531 --> 00:37:00.230
are allowing the extremists to do the work for them.

601
00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:05.440
So when people see someone like the proud boys running around attacking people,

602
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.780
even the proud boys, you have to realize that they started off as a joke.

603
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.500
Like when Gavin McInnes first came up with the idea of the proud boys, it was,

604
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:17.560
it was literally a joke and it became an actual organization at for fun.

605
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.680
And then people joined it that didn't think it was a joke.

606
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.920
And then people joined it and starting taking in a deeper and deeper direction.

607
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:29.130
Then he eventually disavowed himself in in a abandoned the group. You see the,

608
00:37:29.131 --> 00:37:33.920
I bet. I bet you see the same thing with Antifa. I bet the idea initially was,

609
00:37:33.921 --> 00:37:37.940
hey, we see these Tiki torch carrying assholes in Charlottesville.

610
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.860
We see that guy with the car ran over,

611
00:37:39.861 --> 00:37:43.090
the girl who was a protester and killed her like this fucking shit has got it

612
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.820
stopped. So we have to organize, we have to do something and then what happens?

613
00:37:46.821 --> 00:37:50.540
You get people in masks and you get people justified and then you get people

614
00:37:50.541 --> 00:37:51.670
that support those people.

615
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.490
Then you get the extremists and the extremists who are not disavowed, who are,

616
00:37:55.491 --> 00:38:00.200
who are not the, there's no one speaking out against them from the left.

617
00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:01.101
There's no one saying, hey,

618
00:38:01.101 --> 00:38:05.270
this shit has got to stop because they want them to do their dirty work for

619
00:38:05.271 --> 00:38:10.130
them. They want them to push the envelope and push the agenda and get their

620
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.560
[inaudible], their ideology moving in the right direction.

621
00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:16.130
Even if it's done through methods that they don't agree with and that's where it

622
00:38:16.131 --> 00:38:16.964
gets horrible.

623
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:21.950
Because I see these people that are involved in this and I know for a fact just

624
00:38:21.951 --> 00:38:24.110
by watching them move and interact with each other,

625
00:38:24.111 --> 00:38:27.470
they don't understand violence. They don't, they're not good at it.

626
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.170
They don't understand it. This is like role play.

627
00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.650
It's like caused play and you're going to call for real.

628
00:38:33.651 --> 00:38:37.870
You're going to get real violence return and from people who actually know how

629
00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:41.260
to do it. And if you look at violence from the left and violence for the right,

630
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.390
violence from the right scares me a whole lot more.

631
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.520
There are a lot more armed [inaudible].

632
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.770
There are more dangerous human beings in general. And I think that if this,

633
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:53.410
this keeps happening and people from the right feel threatened and their

634
00:38:53.411 --> 00:38:56.230
lifestyle feels threatened and their ideologies feel threatened,

635
00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.350
you're going to get people meeting at these things and it's going to be more

636
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:02.290
than just people throwing mace and milkshakes at each other.

637
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.470
It's going to be people showing up ready for actual combat.

638
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.590
That's fucking terrifying. It's fucking terrifying.

639
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.520
And this idea that you could just run around hitting people and not have any

640
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:15.580
consequences. It's just like the way a child looks at violence.

641
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.210
This is what bothers me so much. If you are,

642
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.660
if you looked at their core tenants of what they want to do and if they wanted

643
00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:26.230
to accomplish that through political negotiation and through conversation and

644
00:39:26.231 --> 00:39:29.950
rallies and speeches, fine, that's fine,

645
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:34.150
but when you have people wearing masks, hitting and macing people, you've,

646
00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:34.870
you've pat,

647
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:39.870
you've crossed the line into the land of no return and you've called out to

648
00:39:39.941 --> 00:39:41.110
people who oppose you.

649
00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:46.210
You challenged them to come and do the same and this is how violence begets

650
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.050
greater violence. It's fucking dangerous. It's really dangerous.

651
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.330
Violence does not exist in a vacuum.

652
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.750
You can't just have a little bit of violence and then there's no repercussions.

653
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.340
People react to that.

654
00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.420
There's people that watch those videos and watch you get punched and there is no

655
00:40:01.421 --> 00:40:05.890
justification for that. When you see someone like yourself who's a small person,

656
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:09.380
slight in stature, not violent in any way, and you're,

657
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.080
you're not even swinging back,

658
00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.510
you're just taking it and try to protect yourself.

659
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.370
People get infuriated by that. And there's people right now,

660
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.320
I guarantee you who saw that video,

661
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:24.190
who are thinking what I would do if I was there, I'd fucking shoot all of them.

662
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:27.610
Or I'd beat them all to death with baseball bats or I'd run him over with my car

663
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:32.560
or I do things. And the unhinged amongst the right who feel like this is, uh,

664
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.360
in opposition of their ideology,

665
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.120
they're going to show up some debt and when that happens,

666
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:40.450
people are going to die. This is a fucking terrible,

667
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.920
and this is where the mayor and the police and they have not done their job.

668
00:40:44.921 --> 00:40:46.060
And I believe the police,

669
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.850
when they say that they've been handcuffed and maybe the mayor just didn't have

670
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:51.100
an idea of where this was all go, but now you do.

671
00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:57.380
<v 0>This is the mayor has been in office now for three years and he finally did a</v>

672
00:40:57.381 --> 00:40:59.180
press conference two days ago,

673
00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:03.680
nine days after my talk to address this controversy. Right.

674
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.840
And what was so frustrating is that the,

675
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.820
the police chief had, um,

676
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:17.410
publicly stated that she thinks the city or the state should adopt a law that

677
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.860
makes it illegal to wear a mask while committing a crime.

678
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.680
That should be a no brainer. It's shocking that in Portland a

679
00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.920
<v 1>better idea. How about no,</v>

680
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:30.420
you can't wear a mask in public at these events cause you can say you can't wear

681
00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:34.910
a mask while committing a crime. You're wearing a mask. How do you,

682
00:41:34.911 --> 00:41:36.940
who the fuck do you know committed the crime? You,

683
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:39.830
unless you take the mask off than you can't even identify them. It's stupid.

684
00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:41.240
Do you can't wear a mask.

685
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.280
<v 0>Yeah. So this, you know, it sounds like a baseline. Somebody,</v>

686
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.390
a policy that you should start advocating for, right? Like don't kick babies.

687
00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.330
Yeah. Well the mayor said he hasn't decided if he's supported it.

688
00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.000
<v 1>He hasn't decided if it supported whether it should be illegal to wear a mask.</v>

689
00:41:57.001 --> 00:41:59.520
While you're committing a crime. Right. That's hilarious.

690
00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.490
<v 0>And he had no policy proposals and he spoke as if, uh,</v>

691
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.810
like it was his first day in office when this was like,

692
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:10.520
this is becoming routine now it's almost, but now in Portland and Portland is a,

693
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:13.070
is a harbinger and, and wanting to,

694
00:42:13.071 --> 00:42:16.490
what can happen in other cities when you have a,

695
00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.393
<v 2>a</v>

696
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.940
<v 0>governant those in the upper echelons of governance,</v>

697
00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:26.770
turning a blind eye too far left militancy and just letting

698
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.020
these dogs go on the street.

699
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.690
<v 1>Just imagine if that was the case. If they were doing that,</v>

700
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.640
it'll be all about fall, right? Militancy.

701
00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.570
Imagine if there were far right people who,

702
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:41.780
who were doing this and committing violence and the government was just like,

703
00:42:41.781 --> 00:42:42.650
well, you know,

704
00:42:42.651 --> 00:42:45.740
I'm not sure if they shouldn't be allowed to wear masks while they commit

705
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:48.020
crimes. People would be freaking the fuck out.

706
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.940
It's the weird justification of this stuff that's, that's so disturbing.

707
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:56.390
I just don't, and I fucking love Portland. It's one of my favorite places.

708
00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.170
It's great. The city's great. I mean, it's fucking cool people.

709
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:05.320
It's not all of them that are involved in this is a very small number and the,

710
00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.520
even amongst the small number,

711
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.300
it's the very small number of them that are radical, that are violent.

712
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.180
When you look at the people that are attacking you, not to minimize it,

713
00:43:14.181 --> 00:43:16.520
but it's very few. You look at that video,

714
00:43:16.521 --> 00:43:20.210
it's a couple people out of thousands of people that are in that group.

715
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.990
There's a few people that are attacking is about a dozen. Was it really?

716
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:28.190
Okay if you count throwing milkshakes but actually hitting you,

717
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.930
how many people you think hit you? I'm not sure. Three, four, maybe.

718
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.140
Something like that. Okay. That's the problem.

719
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.330
The problem is these fucking assholes.

720
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:40.130
It's not the people that disagree with you.

721
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.920
It's the people that think you should be able to throw milkshakes at people and

722
00:43:42.921 --> 00:43:45.230
guys like Carlos Mesa who don't think it's a big deal.

723
00:43:45.231 --> 00:43:48.770
Throw milkshakes at people. It's a fucking big deal. It's a big deal.

724
00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:50.780
Cause you April, it calls her a response.

725
00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.050
This is why it's a big deal and people don't understand assault.

726
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.650
They don't understand violence. You can't just do that. You, you,

727
00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.730
you live in some comic book world or some fucking Disney show world where you

728
00:44:01.731 --> 00:44:03.770
can just throw a milkshake at someone, they don't do anything.

729
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.110
They're going to turn around and punch you in your fucking face.

730
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.490
And then what happens? Well,

731
00:44:07.491 --> 00:44:09.830
you might fall and hit your head and die because that's real.

732
00:44:09.831 --> 00:44:11.090
That's the real world we live in.

733
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:14.720
Or you might cause a giant brawl cause people don't want to be hit with

734
00:44:14.721 --> 00:44:19.040
milkshakes or there's enough of you where you think you can get away with it.

735
00:44:19.041 --> 00:44:22.040
So you are an awful bully and you throw in milkshakes at someone because you

736
00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:25.550
don't like what they stand for and you're meeting in a public place and you're

737
00:44:25.551 --> 00:44:29.300
disagreeing about something. So to write this disagreement,

738
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:30.500
you're assaulting people.

739
00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.090
<v 0>Well for that very reason. Ante Fund</v>

740
00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:36.150
<v 1>never engages in like a quote unquote fair fight one on one. They, uh,</v>

741
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:41.510
what they do usually as a group while mast up one or several of them will

742
00:44:42.431 --> 00:44:47.280
distract the person either by speaking to them perhaps or blinding them with a

743
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:51.180
chemical spray. And then they take tons, the beatings.

744
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:56.210
So there's even no opportunity to like no.

745
00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.640
You know, you don't even know how many people hitting you at that point.

746
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.960
So that's what they do. Blind you and then a top. Hmm. Itself.

747
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:06.270
It's so scary because it's so dumb.

748
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.780
It's not just scared because like you watching what happened to you was scary.

749
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:10.981
Cause you know,

750
00:45:10.981 --> 00:45:13.110
and watching that old man who got hit in the head with a crowbar,

751
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.220
it's fucking horrific. All that stuff's terrific.

752
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.630
And apparently that guy had pulled out some sort of a rod and was swinging at

753
00:45:18.631 --> 00:45:21.990
people before he got hit with a crowbar. I do not know.

754
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:24.750
But I do know when you start hitting people in the head with Crowbars,

755
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.660
that is the beginning of the end. Horrible,

756
00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:30.840
horrible shit happens in response to that. And it hasn't yet.

757
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:32.820
But this is 10 days ago.

758
00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.900
Who knows what's going to happen if there's another one of these rallies and you

759
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:41.670
get people from the far right who organized this is when the proud boys really

760
00:45:41.671 --> 00:45:46.260
radicalized. They radicalized to go against MTV. They were attacked,

761
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:50.730
they attacked them and then it became this fucking shit show that you're seeing

762
00:45:50.731 --> 00:45:51.564
right now.

763
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.260
<v 0>Yeah. I want to state for the record though, the,</v>

764
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:58.340
the violence that happened after I was beat up was involving the,

765
00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:03.400
the men's rights activists group and Antifa proud boys was holding a,

766
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.640
they held this operate event and in different parts of the city,

767
00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.400
a as far as I know, they did not,

768
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.940
there was no conflict with this in this particular,

769
00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.900
but in the Sewickley who was the men's rights guy? It was actually a woman,

770
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:19.840
<v 1>a woman who's a men's rights person. Yes. That's hilarious. She must love Dick.</v>

771
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.910
Right? If you had to guess,

772
00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:29.120
no comment. Sorry, I'm a comedian. I couldn't help it. Um,

773
00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:33.760
you don't even have to say her name. So she's, she, she organized this thing.

774
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:38.850
<v 0>Yeah, I would say. Um, here's the other thing, you know,</v>

775
00:46:38.851 --> 00:46:43.170
like I might, what needs to be stated as well about,

776
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.810
I guess the right wing movements that, um,

777
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.570
are in Portland or come to Portland to do these events.

778
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.570
There's an element of being a provocateur as well,

779
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.040
but that should never ever justify the violence. Cause I mean w w

780
00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:58.750
<v 1>explain what you mean by being a provocateur.</v>

781
00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:01.840
<v 0>Well, for example, holding uh,</v>

782
00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.500
an event in the middle of downtown titling it, um,

783
00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:07.203
like any event,

784
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:11.710
justice for victims of domestic terrorism and then having a picture of Antifa

785
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:16.950
like that is an, you know, it's an flavor train. It's an infant,

786
00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.550
you know, it causes a reaction. Um, so there's a,

787
00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.193
you know, there's a,

788
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:28.710
there's an element of coming in and seeing let's enrage these lunatics on the

789
00:47:29.771 --> 00:47:34.300
far left or whatever. But at the same time,

790
00:47:34.301 --> 00:47:38.830
I want to make sure I state that just because somebody is quote unquote

791
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.250
provocative your tools in their words with a writing,

792
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:47.790
that it's unfortunate that people now find that that's justification for you to

793
00:47:48.611 --> 00:47:50.020
react violently.

794
00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.020
<v 1>Well, I think again,</v>

795
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:55.070
it's a small percentage of people that find that this justification and you look

796
00:47:55.071 --> 00:47:58.010
at the number of people that were there, what does it thousands,

797
00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:00.590
thousands of people, how many people actually engage in violence?

798
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:04.060
<v 0>Small number but small number. That's the problem.</v>

799
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:08.950
It's important to note that they caught morale from the crowd who were cheering

800
00:48:08.951 --> 00:48:09.390
them on.

801
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:13.410
<v 1>The cowards, the cowards who don't disavow this horrific action.</v>

802
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:18.120
<v 0>They cheered them on, laughed and clapped as I was getting beaten.</v>

803
00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.260
And then the other thing about the people showing up in numbers who don't engage

804
00:48:22.261 --> 00:48:25.590
in the violence is they PR. They are like literal human shields.

805
00:48:25.591 --> 00:48:26.700
They dress the same.

806
00:48:26.701 --> 00:48:30.900
So they make it easy for the few violent militants to [inaudible] back into the

807
00:48:30.901 --> 00:48:31.770
crowd. Exactly.

808
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:35.850
And these people also watched the cops and they keep an eye out on potential

809
00:48:35.851 --> 00:48:37.250
outsiders as well. And yeah,

810
00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:42.300
<v 1>become a game. It's become a game has become a gigantic team war.</v>

811
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.340
There's our team versus their team. It's,

812
00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:47.460
it's literally like playing a child hood game.

813
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:52.500
It's really disturbing then. And so since this,

814
00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:57.860
has anyone from antifa apologized about what happened to you or disavowed the

815
00:48:58.981 --> 00:49:01.680
actions of these few extreme violent people?

816
00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.013
<v 0>Of course not.</v>

817
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:08.280
I'm Antifa has an iron fist on the people who support its movements.

818
00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:13.250
They don't allow any type of design actually in there. Like press releases,

819
00:49:13.251 --> 00:49:15.230
you can call, call them. Um,

820
00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:19.340
they explicitly state that even basically,

821
00:49:19.341 --> 00:49:22.190
even if you disagree with their tactics, you will not publicly state it.

822
00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:27.200
It's to create, I guess this image of unity, right, for a quote unquote in,

823
00:49:27.201 --> 00:49:30.770
if you disagree inside the organization. Yes. So how organized are they?

824
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.610
They are a leader.

825
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.970
They're intentionally anti Phi as we understand it today,

826
00:49:37.971 --> 00:49:42.890
really crystallize only after 2016 there's been very little academic research

827
00:49:42.891 --> 00:49:46.430
until how they actually organize. But basically as a movement,

828
00:49:46.431 --> 00:49:51.431
they have essentially cells across the country that are semi autonomous United

829
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:56.180
by an ideology of Aki and Arco,

830
00:49:56.181 --> 00:49:59.600
communism and is support for violence.

831
00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.920
So it's not so much a group itself,

832
00:50:03.921 --> 00:50:07.820
it's the people who are part of that movement are drawn from other actual groups

833
00:50:07.821 --> 00:50:11.930
who draw from the DSA. They draw from various workers, unions,

834
00:50:11.931 --> 00:50:16.931
other anarchist groups and like other terrorists entities,

835
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:23.270
they have PR processes to radicalize, um,

836
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:27.170
sympathizers. Essentially. They have their own literature as well.

837
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:32.660
And so it's much more organized than people give them credit for.

838
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.930
They think of them as just, Oh, you know,

839
00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.160
people showing up to fight on the street. It's, there's,

840
00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.050
there's meaning to that,

841
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:43.340
to that violence and there's literature to back it up and they have PR,

842
00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:48.320
you know, they actively recruit people to join the movement. So,

843
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:50.270
um, I've been asked like,

844
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.630
do you think the federal authorities should stopped in? And my responses,

845
00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:58.490
I think it's come to the point that they do because with Antifa, um, it's not,

846
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:03.170
it's beyond what local authorities can do because a lot of these people,

847
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.920
a lot of them are in Portland from Portland, but a lot of them come from,

848
00:51:06.921 --> 00:51:09.080
for example, from Eugene, from Seattle,

849
00:51:09.081 --> 00:51:14.081
from neighboring areas that have other antifa people come in to participate in

850
00:51:14.361 --> 00:51:16.130
the violence for that day or to help out.

851
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.710
And then they go back to where they're from. So they're,

852
00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:23.380
they're coming in and out of jurisdictions. Makes it hard for one local body of,

853
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.720
of authorities to address it. I think, um,

854
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:32.420
the Goj needs to stop then. I think it's gotten to that point and with 20,

855
00:51:32.421 --> 00:51:35.540
20 coming up soon, um,

856
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:40.900
there could be potential for a lot more political violence if the results don't,

857
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.330
if the elections results don't go as they wish.

858
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.350
<v 1>Well, that's a, an obvious one.</v>

859
00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.850
Considering the fact that this all became a thing after Trump was elected. Yes.

860
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:55.800
Um, with the, if the DOJ did step in, what do you think they could do?

861
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:00.230
<v 0>So that's, well,</v>

862
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.760
<v 1>I mean, do you believe in the,</v>

863
00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:07.820
the ability to meet up and express yourself publicly and the ability to protest

864
00:52:10.801 --> 00:52:13.350
and the ability to just, uh,

865
00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:18.390
get together and have groups and, and you know, express yourself?

866
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:23.780
<v 0>Yes. However, that's not just what Antifa does.</v>

867
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.720
Like I said, the violence is a feature of their movement.

868
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:29.110
So what federal authorities can do

869
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.400
<v 1>stop you there. When you say the violence is a feature of your,</v>

870
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:33.790
their movement is there, is it, did they have anything written,

871
00:52:33.791 --> 00:52:37.600
like the tenants or their movement where they say that violence is acceptable?

872
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:45.410
<v 0>There's a book called the antifascist handbook is written by Mark Bray.</v>

873
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.920
He's an academic at doc myth. He is,

874
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:53.880
I would call him one of ANTIFA chief ideologues.

875
00:52:53.881 --> 00:52:58.881
So not only does he explain what Antifa does and in his writing,

876
00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:01.380
he's makes it very clear that the, um,

877
00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:05.340
the quote unquote self-defense is what justifies the offensive violence.

878
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:09.120
He actually argues why that's ethical.

879
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:12.960
So because he's an academic, um, well spoken,

880
00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:18.540
um, he's invited onto mainstream media to explain to basically, like I said,

881
00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:20.250
early mainstream Antifa

882
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:22.510
<v 1>what, can you explain what he says?</v>

883
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:28.080
<v 0>Yes. I highly recommend that. Take a look at his book. Um,</v>

884
00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:31.050
the attorney general in Minnesota, um,

885
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:35.490
Keith Ellison was photographed a year ago holding, holding up that book of, uh,

886
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.980
the Antifa book and that kind of went, um,

887
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:40.560
he's been criticized a bit for that and he deleted that and then shopped it

888
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:44.750
might be eating. Was holding it up in support. Yeah. He said this, he said, uh,

889
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:48.510
something about like this book or Antifa strikes fear into the heart of Donald

890
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:50.130
Trump. Yeah.

891
00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:54.690
So there's people in government who has sympathetic to,

892
00:53:54.691 --> 00:53:58.620
and this professor can explain what he says.

893
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.960
He outlines and explains essentially why Auntie's fuzz violence is ethical.

894
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:16.280
That it's because they're opposing fascism and fascism is a violent movement.

895
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:22.530
This is sort of a preemptive move. Like we have this word fascism. Yeah.

896
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.540
It is a problem, right? Yes.

897
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.630
Cause it seems like that's definitely something you should oppose.

898
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.470
But what is the, what's the actual definition of fascism?

899
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:34.980
Fascism as a fall, right.

900
00:54:34.981 --> 00:54:38.550
Political ideology from what I understand is the definition,

901
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.980
<v 1>Jamie, so we can just read what fascism,</v>

902
00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:43.830
what the actual word fascism means.

903
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.750
Heir form of radical right wing authoritarian, authoritarian,

904
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:53.370
ultra nationalism characterized by dictatorial power,

905
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:58.020
forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of

906
00:54:58.021 --> 00:55:02.010
the economy which came to prominence in early 20th century Europe.

907
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:06.750
Um, forcible suppression of a, put the back up please.

908
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:11.310
Forcible suppression of opposition is what they're doing. Yes.

909
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:14.730
Strong regimentation of society. I mean they're,

910
00:55:14.731 --> 00:55:19.731
they're literally telling people how to behave and what they will tolerate.

911
00:55:20.011 --> 00:55:21.750
I know it's not right wing ideology,

912
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:26.940
but it's almost like fascism and I'm sure there's other definitions of fascism.

913
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:32.010
The idea of supporting someone who opposes fascism sounds wonderful.

914
00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:34.020
Sounds great. Let's, let's stop fascism.

915
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:39.380
But are we really experiencing authoritarian ultra nationalism characterized by

916
00:55:40.351 --> 00:55:45.090
dictatorial power in this country? I mean, is that, is that a fair thing to say?

917
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.890
I know people don't like Donald Trump.

918
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.980
I know people don't like right wing ideologies running this country.

919
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:54.750
I understand that. But this is not, this is not what's happening.

920
00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:56.670
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

921
00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:01.670
The issue like fascism as defined by political theorists who have been

922
00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:04.170
researching this for decades,

923
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:08.220
it has a particular definition and meaning and that's, um,

924
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:10.020
I think that summarizes it pretty well.

925
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:15.000
I'm very concerned that people use it so flippantly to just refer to the right

926
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.520
or to even authoritarianism.

927
00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:20.460
Like there's much more to it than just being authoritarian.

928
00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:24.520
There's all the other components. And I need it is,

929
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:28.630
it's important to the state that Antifa is not just supposed to the far right or

930
00:56:28.631 --> 00:56:31.360
the right. They're also against liberal democracy.

931
00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:36.620
There's a reason why they hate the police on much hate border enforcement and

932
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:38.650
hate the rule of law.

933
00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:43.680
It's there against died the concept of the nation state as we understand it and

934
00:56:43.781 --> 00:56:48.460
they're working to dismantle that, to delegitimize it. So, um,

935
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.450
this is what I mean when I say it's a, it's a dangerous ideology that for now,

936
00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:56.230
you know, enemy and my underneath is your, um, is your friend.

937
00:56:56.710 --> 00:57:00.550
But at some point, if this movement becomes bigger,

938
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.860
more mainstream and more people are sympathetic,

939
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:07.861
at some point it's going to come back against the moderate left because these

940
00:57:09.071 --> 00:57:12.980
people, um, they want to see the,

941
00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.770
the destruction of the nation.

942
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.930
<v 1>They'd want to see the destruction of the nation state for what purpose?</v>

943
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:23.490
They want anarchy. Yes. So there are political antivirus, antiques,

944
00:57:23.491 --> 00:57:27.180
social anarchists state. They don't want borders. They don't want nations.

945
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.210
They don't want police. Okay. What do they want?

946
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:35.720
B? I mean, what do they expect?

947
00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:40.010
<v 0>What's the ultimate goal? They seem to believe in</v>

948
00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:45.070
a utopian, utopian mocks.

949
00:57:45.071 --> 00:57:50.071
This ideas right of this restrict free distribution of wealth where we can be,

950
00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:56.980
we can only be truly equal and egalitarian when we dismantle everything about

951
00:57:58.191 --> 00:58:01.580
the country. So not just, you know, it's institutions of rule of law,

952
00:58:01.581 --> 00:58:06.380
but the state itself, like everything just has to be broken down and start over.

953
00:58:06.381 --> 00:58:11.360
Cause it's irredeemable. I'm not quite sure if, I mean they've, um,

954
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:14.810
you know, Antifa um,

955
00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:17.090
I can't think of like where they have had,

956
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:20.960
if there was any somewhat comparable examples around the world of what it looks

957
00:58:20.961 --> 00:58:24.410
like for them to, um, do state building. Right.

958
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:27.620
So we don't know what it would actually look like, but I mean,

959
00:58:27.621 --> 00:58:32.621
the examples we see from these smaller anecdotes is it's chaos and anarchy,

960
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:36.320
like absolute chaos and, um,

961
00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:40.280
violent suppression of opposing views, um,

962
00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:46.910
indiscriminate violence at times. Um,

963
00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:48.403
I wonder,

964
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:53.410
and what I've been asking over and over is how many more people have to be drawn

965
00:58:53.421 --> 00:58:54.254
into,

966
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:59.180
have to be victims of this violence before something changes.

967
00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:01.400
And I put in Portland,

968
00:59:01.401 --> 00:59:06.401
now we've had three years with us and literally no policy changes have happened.

969
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:10.520
No. Even proposals have even been accepted by the man.

970
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:16.020
<v 1>The previous mayor was, what was his political persuasion or her,</v>

971
00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:16.770
<v 0>I don't even know.</v>

972
00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:20.460
These are all the people who've become the elected mayor in Portland's are

973
00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.820
typically establishment Democrats, right?

974
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:27.260
So they themselves are moderate, very much. Uh, you know,

975
00:59:27.261 --> 00:59:30.830
in the vein of I'm a Hillary Clinton type of thing.

976
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:36.040
But does the constituent we'll see in Portland that they have to play two,

977
00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:38.480
four votes, which is the

978
00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:44.290
radical people who are sympathetic to very,

979
00:59:44.291 --> 00:59:46.780
very progressive causes.

980
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:52.230
And so there's a reason why to date the mayor has never named Antifa one time in

981
00:59:53.051 --> 00:59:56.980
any of his press conferences. He has no problem blaming prop boys,

982
00:59:56.981 --> 01:00:00.790
a patriot para the right four issues, patriot prayer. What's that?

983
01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.810
Then another group, Patriot prayers, one of the other right wing movements in,

984
01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:05.501
uh,

985
01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:10.501
in and around Portland that have held pro Trump events in town that antifa comes

986
01:00:11.051 --> 01:00:15.220
to to fight and oppose and how those turnout,

987
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:20.910
they devolve until riots and the police allowed us,

988
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:26.940
they allow it through then auction. Wow.

989
01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:29.910
It's just,

990
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:34.910
it's interesting to see a city that's gone so far off the rails like Portland in

991
01:00:35.891 --> 01:00:38.100
this regard with this issue. Yeah.

992
01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:43.130
When you see this inaction and what the consequences are and how,

993
01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:47.260
how it happens and was particularly for Personal IQ, you physically see it,

994
01:00:47.261 --> 01:00:51.670
you personally see it. Um, are you going to continue to do these things?

995
01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:53.943
<v 3>Okay.</v>

996
01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:56.880
<v 0>Because it seems like you're obviously a target. Oh yeah. Um,</v>

997
01:00:57.150 --> 01:01:01.920
when I was asked this, uh, in my interviews this week, last week,

998
01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.130
the, the, the response that I,

999
01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:09.360
that comes to my mind right away is of course I'm going to continue doing it. I,

1000
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.300
these people threatened me before I'd been a talked before.

1001
01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:16.050
I'm not going to be cowed, I'm going to continue, I won't be intimidated.

1002
01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.890
But with the, the brain injury that they gave me,

1003
01:01:19.891 --> 01:01:23.520
it's like I can't continue doing it the same way as I did before.

1004
01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:28.970
And being naive to think that police would actually uphold the rule of law.

1005
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:33.720
Um, they gave me a brain injury and like I never had one before,

1006
01:01:33.721 --> 01:01:38.721
but I'm dealing with some cognitive and neurological issues or I will memory

1007
01:01:39.511 --> 01:01:42.930
issues, I have issues. So I have upcoming physical,

1008
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:47.430
neuro physical therapy as well as speech therapy. So, um,

1009
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:51.990
as much as like on the surface I have improved a lot since the beating.

1010
01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:56.160
There are some longterm consequences and I'm going to have to work through and

1011
01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:01.760
um, you know, I have to be honest,

1012
01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:05.600
I have certain fears and anxieties of being in Portland.

1013
01:02:05.601 --> 01:02:08.480
I've continued receipt threats, violent threats,

1014
01:02:08.481 --> 01:02:13.280
and they've been reported to police and just people promising to make sure next

1015
01:02:13.281 --> 01:02:15.260
time that I won't even be able to walk away,

1016
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:18.200
that they will repeat what happens mean when they see me on the streets.

1017
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.000
So like have they caught the people that did this to you?

1018
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:25.890
So it's been 10 days now, more than 10 days since my beating.

1019
01:02:25.891 --> 01:02:27.630
There have been no arrests.

1020
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:30.450
I don't know where the police are in the investigation.

1021
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.700
They haven't been keeping me informed.

1022
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:36.690
There was a photograph of someone they released. Yeah.

1023
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:41.691
So the Portland police released photos of potential suspects and asking for help

1024
01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:46.740
in identifying, one was on mouse, two, two of them were a mouse and a,

1025
01:02:46.741 --> 01:02:51.090
I forgot to say earlier that in addition to the, the beating the robs me of my,

1026
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.040
my camera equipment. So that was my,

1027
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:57.720
my evidence for that day and I tried so hard to hold onto it, but, um,

1028
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.823
I couldn't.

1029
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:05.040
What about you attending this with security? Have you thought about doing that?

1030
01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:05.431
Yeah.

1031
01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:10.431
So moving forward once I feel well enough and once I'm cleared by the doctors,

1032
01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:15.090
um, it may be worth it to cover these events.

1033
01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:19.080
But with professional security, um,

1034
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.310
<v 1>gorillas. Yeah. Big giant dudes. Yeah.</v>

1035
01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:26.130
Would they wear what black armor? Like what would you have?

1036
01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:29.140
How far would you take this?

1037
01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.600
<v 0>I Dunno. W how far do you think I should take it?</v>

1038
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.740
<v 1>I don't think you should go to those things anymore. Okay.</v>

1039
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.080
I mean it seems like you've been, I mean, it is part of your job,

1040
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.070
you're a journalist,

1041
01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:44.880
but it seems like you've been singled out and targeted and it seems like they

1042
01:03:44.881 --> 01:03:48.810
don't have any problem justifying attacking you and assaulting you. Uh,

1043
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.050
if I was going to go, I'd bring the biggest,

1044
01:03:52.051 --> 01:03:56.220
baddest dudes that I could find and a bunch of them and have them surround you

1045
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.030
and have them protect you. What's that telling you about America?

1046
01:04:00.031 --> 01:04:05.031
That in 2019 tobacco it's this one particular area and this one particular group

1047
01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:11.070
and not even the group. I think it's the most ridiculous people in that group.

1048
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:12.270
I don't think it's most,

1049
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:15.480
I think most of these people that probably are a part of this really don't want

1050
01:04:15.481 --> 01:04:20.481
fascists and they really don't want some awful right ring totalitarian regime

1051
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:26.400
running this country and in marginalized people of Color,

1052
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:30.960
gay people and immigrants and all those things that I support 100% I'm left

1053
01:04:30.961 --> 01:04:35.340
wing. I mean, I would be on their side ideologically about a lot of things.

1054
01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:38.970
It's the implementation of it that I have the biggest problem with.

1055
01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:42.720
It's the group mentality. It's the wearing the masks, the salts,

1056
01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.140
so not understanding the consequences of violence, all these things.

1057
01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:47.520
This is what I have a problem with.

1058
01:04:47.521 --> 01:04:51.750
The way the the mayor allows us to take place, the way handcuffs the police,

1059
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:53.850
that that is what I have a problem with.

1060
01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:58.830
It's not that they don't want horrible people running the government and running

1061
01:04:58.831 --> 01:05:01.020
the world. I understand that. That makes sense,

1062
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.540
<v 0>but you're not for the dismantling of the nation state, right? Nope. No, no.</v>

1063
01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:07.850
I'm not. Or the breakdown on democracy. No. Yeah,

1064
01:05:07.851 --> 01:05:10.430
so these are the points that I'm trying to hit on.

1065
01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:12.560
Those are the points that are hidden, right?

1066
01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:17.120
These are important things that make up the ideology, events if a and the,

1067
01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.630
the larger, uh,

1068
01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.530
those who are sympathetic because of the antifascist aspect of the anti

1069
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:28.270
right-wing, they are ignorant of it. And I hope to become more aware of that.

1070
01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:30.200
<v 1>I think that's what's important about your work.</v>

1071
01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.570
That's what's important about these discussions. That's,

1072
01:05:32.571 --> 01:05:34.970
it's important about people getting the word,

1073
01:05:34.971 --> 01:05:39.200
understanding what this really means, not what it seems on paper.

1074
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:41.540
It's like where the Anti Nazi movement, Whoa.

1075
01:05:41.541 --> 01:05:45.200
Who the fuck could go against that? Of course your anti Nazi.

1076
01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.860
That's no who everybody should be. That's what it seems like. What we're,

1077
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:52.100
we're antifascist good. We don't want fascists.

1078
01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.930
I think that's what Chris Cuomo was saying.

1079
01:05:54.110 --> 01:05:56.720
I think that's what Don Lemon was saying. I think they're too busy.

1080
01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:58.460
I don't think they're really investigating this.

1081
01:05:58.461 --> 01:06:01.940
I don't think they're deep diving and understanding the ideology at it's core,

1082
01:06:01.941 --> 01:06:04.320
the way you're describing it. And um,

1083
01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.100
whoever that professor was that you were discussing that is, uh,

1084
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:10.040
somehow or another condoning violence,

1085
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:12.440
that that is ridiculous.

1086
01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:17.060
Anyone who considers themselves an intellectual who condones violence,

1087
01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:22.370
all this punch and Nazi stuff, goddammit, you don't understand violence.

1088
01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.350
You don't know what you're talking about.

1089
01:06:24.351 --> 01:06:26.420
You don't understand the human condition because if you,

1090
01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.870
if you understood violence, it's the last thing you would ever be calling for.

1091
01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.810
<v 0>Can I talk about the, um, the next step of what's next? For sure.</v>

1092
01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:39.670
So a lot of people listening in are frustrated and have expressed support,

1093
01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.950
are asking, well, what can I do?

1094
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:45.200
I'm just one person and this is the power. Now we,

1095
01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:48.790
we live in a time where there's crowd funding and you know,

1096
01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:50.440
with all the points that we brought up earlier,

1097
01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:55.441
it seems to show a lot of evidence to suggest that there's something seriously

1098
01:06:56.771 --> 01:07:01.771
wrong in up echelons of policing and governing in Portland.

1099
01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.690
And that's what the, the legal fund is. So, um, I'm working with, um, how neat.

1100
01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:10.590
Dylan, she represented Jane's De Moore. Um,

1101
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:15.430
she's taken a neon is the first client for the nonprofit that she started

1102
01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:19.240
called. Um, if you go to Publius, lax, P U B, l, I,

1103
01:07:19.241 --> 01:07:22.890
U s l e x.com, you'll see, um,

1104
01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:27.430
information for how you can donate and anything helps. And we're trying,

1105
01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:32.510
we, you know, lawsuits if they happen against, um,

1106
01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:37.560
the city or a mayor or police department costs a lot of money and takes a lot of

1107
01:07:37.991 --> 01:07:38.950
time, takes, you know,

1108
01:07:38.951 --> 01:07:41.600
there's a lot of overhead costs in the amount of people you know,

1109
01:07:41.601 --> 01:07:45.070
you have to take in to do all the investing, um, to do your investigations.

1110
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:50.110
So there's an opportunity for the public to get involved. Um, you know,

1111
01:07:50.111 --> 01:07:54.250
I don't want the story to pass just about Andy, you got beat up. So what,

1112
01:07:54.251 --> 01:07:54.941
let's move on.

1113
01:07:54.941 --> 01:07:59.320
But rather there's systemic issues happening in Portland and there are

1114
01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:01.420
implications for the rest of the country.

1115
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:08.630
<v 1>What do you think is going on with media that is supporting this attack on you?</v>

1116
01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:12.830
Because I,

1117
01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:17.830
I've seen so many journalists dismiss this as being not a big deal.

1118
01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:18.560
Why?

1119
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.220
Why do you think that anybody would look at something like that or someone's

1120
01:08:22.221 --> 01:08:25.910
being beaten publicly and not think it's a big deal?

1121
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:27.560
What do you think is behind that?

1122
01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:31.030
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1123
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:36.030
<v 0>Extremist ideologies are very good at dehumanizing the opposition and that's</v>

1124
01:08:37.841 --> 01:08:38.890
what Antifa does.

1125
01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:43.180
So there has been a lot of disinformation as information put out about me.

1126
01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:46.420
You know, I'm not, I'm not, they say for example, I'm not really journalists,

1127
01:08:46.421 --> 01:08:51.250
I'm just a far right, provocative. I'm somebody who's sympathetic to Nazis.

1128
01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:56.860
Um, and so when you put these ideas out that not only are lies,

1129
01:08:56.861 --> 01:08:58.180
but I meant to

1130
01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.710
remove one's humanity, they just become, you know,

1131
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:05.050
like Andy's no longer Andy.

1132
01:09:05.051 --> 01:09:10.051
Andy is to face of far-right ideology and it makes people feel comfortable.

1133
01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:12.410
What's violence against that?

1134
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.920
And it was so disheartening to see so many writers come out and say things like,

1135
01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.020
you know, I don't really support what happened to Andy, but he's done far worse.

1136
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:26.090
Or he was provocative here. His writings,

1137
01:09:26.091 --> 01:09:29.780
like he came and he got exactly what he was looking for.

1138
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:34.970
What happened to me should happen to nobody, um,

1139
01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.910
much less to journalists. Right? I'm like,

1140
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.320
this is an America in a major American city. We're not, you know,

1141
01:09:42.321 --> 01:09:45.200
this is not enough guidestone or Iraq where the state is weak.

1142
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.020
We have a strong state, we have police force.

1143
01:09:49.190 --> 01:09:53.580
Why are the laws not being enforced? Why is such a sons having to suffer, uh,

1144
01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.840
arrest? Why are they no arrests?

1145
01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.590
<v 1>It's really absurd and it's obscene. Yeah.</v>

1146
01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.253
Um,

1147
01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:06.283
<v 3>okay.</v>

1148
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:09.420
<v 1>When is the next one of these things supposed to take place</v>

1149
01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:16.000
<v 0>on the 17th of August is supposedly the next event.</v>

1150
01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:21.150
I think the proud boys have announced that they're encouraging all of their

1151
01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:22.600
members across the country to,

1152
01:10:22.601 --> 01:10:27.250
to fly into Portland and it's always fucking Portland. Yeah.

1153
01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:31.240
They're kind of reacting I think to the 29th of June. So,

1154
01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:33.003
<v 3>um,</v>

1155
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:37.670
<v 0>we'll see what happens. I'm concerned. Are you going to grow up?</v>

1156
01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:40.993
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

1157
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:43.310
<v 1>You should go and get a pope mobile. Yeah.</v>

1158
01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:48.530
Let 'em throw milkshakes at the Pope Mobile. Get a big old fish tank.

1159
01:10:48.531 --> 01:10:53.230
Put some wheels on it. Have some giant dude to push around the,

1160
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:55.550
I'm joking around about it obviously to try and make light,

1161
01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.440
but do you really think you're going to go?

1162
01:10:59.010 --> 01:11:02.340
<v 0>I don't know if I feel safe and I hate you shouldn't feel safe.</v>

1163
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:06.300
While I hate using the language of the identitarian left, you know,

1164
01:11:06.301 --> 01:11:09.810
like I feel unsafe and all that. I'm trying to remain rational. Okay.

1165
01:11:09.811 --> 01:11:13.140
But you were assaulted twice and I continue to receive threats.

1166
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:13.980
You were assaulted

1167
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.790
<v 1>what? In May? Yes. And then you were assaulted again in June. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

1168
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.250
So, and you can see continued to receive threats.

1169
01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.880
Um, is this necessary to go to these things? To cover them.

1170
01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:31.563
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1171
01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:35.630
<v 1>Do you think maybe that's part of the problem with people that like Don Lemon</v>

1172
01:11:35.631 --> 01:11:38.540
and Chris Cuomo who are talking about this, who haven't actually been there,

1173
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:40.520
they really don't understand it.

1174
01:11:40.521 --> 01:11:43.730
And maybe you do because you're covering it with boots on the ground.

1175
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:44.900
<v 0>You got it. You know,</v>

1176
01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.650
when you're all the way in New York City and you work for elite media and you

1177
01:11:48.651 --> 01:11:50.630
always, even when you traveled to protest,

1178
01:11:50.631 --> 01:11:54.170
you have a very large crew of security around you.

1179
01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:58.850
It does, it removes you a bit from the reality of the situation.

1180
01:11:58.851 --> 01:12:03.680
And I don't think any of these people who are opining on these mainstream media

1181
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:08.890
television shows have actually embedded themselves to covering these violent

1182
01:12:09.021 --> 01:12:12.950
riots that are happening in Portland or in Berkeley.

1183
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:14.603
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1184
01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:20.950
<v 1>Um, how many of the people that are involved in Antifa do you think really</v>

1185
01:12:20.951 --> 01:12:25.060
understand that they're trying to dismantle the government,

1186
01:12:25.570 --> 01:12:28.960
really understand that they want the state to absolve, dissolve?

1187
01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:31.680
<v 0>I don't have a number for that. It's definitely small.</v>

1188
01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.210
It's the same people who engage.

1189
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:37.980
It would probably be around those who are engaging in violence and those who are

1190
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.280
eating and that violence, for example, creating shields or whatever,

1191
01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:42.660
allowing them to hide among them.

1192
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.020
Those people I think understand very much what the ideology is.

1193
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:49.530
Those people who come unmasked, you know, and just read the,

1194
01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:52.770
the Facebook event page, oppose fascists, come protect Portland.

1195
01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:57.870
Those people I think are ignorant of the ideology behind the movement and groups

1196
01:12:57.871 --> 01:13:00.660
that are organizing these events. Um,

1197
01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:04.740
I can't put a number on that and this is like where there needs to be a research

1198
01:13:04.741 --> 01:13:09.570
by academics and um, and think tanks to look into. Um,

1199
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.470
and this is where federal authorities need to be looking into as well.

1200
01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:15.240
Like how are they organized?

1201
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:19.380
Where are the businesses that are helping them fund some of their causes?

1202
01:13:19.381 --> 01:13:22.830
Cause they, you know, when some of them member members get arrested,

1203
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.750
they have money for bail. Who's involved in funneling that money on,

1204
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:30.270
uh, who's helping to,

1205
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:34.260
to disperse the literature that they use to radicalize people like these are,

1206
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:38.510
this requires research and intelligence gathering. And as far as I know,

1207
01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.480
it's not being done.

1208
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:46.250
<v 1>There's a real concern among some people that we're entering a phase of this</v>

1209
01:13:47.461 --> 01:13:49.150
country where it,

1210
01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:54.200
there's a real possibility of having some sort of a civil unrest,

1211
01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:55.283
civil war.

1212
01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.030
When you see something like these Portland events,

1213
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:01.860
when you see this kind of chaos,

1214
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:05.370
do you think that that's a valid concern?

1215
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:07.100
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1216
01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.740
<v 0>Not for something that is across the country,</v>

1217
01:14:09.741 --> 01:14:14.741
but perhaps very regional or to the city itself and not so much like civil war,

1218
01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:22.141
but the violence that is done plan by Antifa.

1219
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:26.650
It's meant to make the wider public,

1220
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.990
not just polarize and hate each other,

1221
01:14:28.991 --> 01:14:33.991
but also began to distrust than to institutions that are in place.

1222
01:14:34.151 --> 01:14:35.920
I meant to uphold democracy.

1223
01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:40.960
So the police in Portland have come under fire, for example,

1224
01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.030
not just from the radical left,

1225
01:14:43.031 --> 01:14:47.860
but a lot of people who are normally very pro police are finding like what is

1226
01:14:47.861 --> 01:14:52.530
wrong with them pulling police? Like we can't even trust them. So there's um,

1227
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.450
if things just continue,

1228
01:14:55.451 --> 01:15:00.070
I think the violence would continue to escalate leading to a death or death.

1229
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.460
Um, that's my real concern. Um,

1230
01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.900
<v 1>this is my real concern as well.</v>

1231
01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:08.590
And you think this is particularly unique to Portland in the way that they're

1232
01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:09.610
treating it and addressing it?

1233
01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:14.640
<v 0>I'm trying to think of comparable other cities that have had some of these</v>

1234
01:15:14.641 --> 01:15:19.310
issues. So for example, in San Jose in 20s,

1235
01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:24.450
16 Trump supporters when they were leaving a Trump rally were brutally assaulted

1236
01:15:24.451 --> 01:15:26.190
by mobs of people.

1237
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:31.110
And then there was a lawsuit that was launched against the city for basically

1238
01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:33.660
putting citizens in the way of danger.

1239
01:15:33.661 --> 01:15:35.550
The way they were funneled outside of this event,

1240
01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:40.560
led them directly in front of these violent protesters who had talked them,

1241
01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:42.260
you know, in those footage that, um,

1242
01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:45.960
went viral that that year since then,

1243
01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:51.420
policing tactics have changed in San Jose as far as I know,

1244
01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:53.940
and you know, involved the lawsuit.

1245
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
So like sometimes it takes lawsuits for the local government to start protecting

1246
01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:08.490
people's civil rights. So right now, as bad as it is,

1247
01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.670
it does seem confined to Portland. We haven't seen that. For example,

1248
01:16:11.671 --> 01:16:15.170
in Berkeley, the type of, uh, violence as, um,

1249
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:19.730
in 2017 when Milo came, like, you know, that hasn't been repeated, uh,

1250
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:24.120
uh, for a year and a half now. So, um,

1251
01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:30.400
but it takes the political will of those in power to enforce the law.

1252
01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:34.730
<v 1>All right. So you mentioned lawsuits. What lawsuits are you pursuing?</v>

1253
01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:36.411
<v 0>Well, immediately,</v>

1254
01:16:36.411 --> 01:16:40.280
right now what I would like to see is the city or Portland carry out a full

1255
01:16:40.281 --> 01:16:42.830
investigation and hold accountable.

1256
01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:46.670
All those who involved in attacking me or aided in that as well.

1257
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:49.850
And then as the evidence where the evidence leaves,

1258
01:16:49.851 --> 01:16:54.851
if this shows that there were was dereliction of duty from those in power,

1259
01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.440
then you know, I reserve my judgment and my lawyer reserves judgment for,

1260
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:06.530
you know, uh, who, if anyone gets sued at that point.

1261
01:17:06.531 --> 01:17:09.710
But right now I'm very focused on that,

1262
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:15.610
putting pressure on the city to arrest people who are responsible in charged on,

1263
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:17.630
in kept convictions as well.

1264
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:20.550
<v 1>All right. And in closing, cause I know you got to get out of here.</v>

1265
01:17:20.551 --> 01:17:22.620
Is there a silver lining to any of this? I mean,

1266
01:17:22.621 --> 01:17:27.240
do you think that perhaps your assault and the fact that the police didn't

1267
01:17:27.241 --> 01:17:31.650
intervene is actually allowing people to understand the,

1268
01:17:31.651 --> 01:17:35.940
the real significance of this, the real problem of this, that it's,

1269
01:17:35.970 --> 01:17:37.950
this is a real issue,

1270
01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:43.140
a gigantic one in fact that goes against the core tenants of value of free

1271
01:17:43.141 --> 01:17:47.910
expression and the ability to gather and communicate safely in public?

1272
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:49.111
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1273
01:17:49.111 --> 01:17:54.111
as hard as it was for me to see a silver lining when I was laying in hospital

1274
01:17:54.121 --> 01:17:56.420
with so much pain. Um,

1275
01:17:57.350 --> 01:18:02.350
there is one and that is that everybody paid attention to what happened to me.

1276
01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:08.430
It was a big story. Even the mainstream liberal press cannot ignore it.

1277
01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:14.930
And I'm hoping that from that it goes beyond just being a headline but forcing

1278
01:18:14.941 --> 01:18:19.920
the national discourse to change on how it views and talks about Antifa we'll

1279
01:18:19.921 --> 01:18:20.990
see if that happens.

1280
01:18:22.690 --> 01:18:27.690
I feel encouraged that we're beginning to see some cracks in the way that Antifa

1281
01:18:28.151 --> 01:18:33.151
has been protected by sympathetic writers in journalists in those,

1282
01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:34.360
in mainstream media.

1283
01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:38.920
I mean the fact that Keith Ellison deleted that photo that he showed a year ago,

1284
01:18:39.490 --> 01:18:42.850
um, right after that was attacked I think indicates that did even,

1285
01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:44.290
he faces a certain impression of that.

1286
01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:49.350
It may not be good for a mainstream politician to so actively promote this

1287
01:18:51.281 --> 01:18:53.140
movement. Um,

1288
01:18:54.490 --> 01:18:56.620
and I hope it continues to move in that direction.

1289
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:59.980
<v 1>If you had a crystal ball and you were looking at the future, what do you,</v>

1290
01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:00.940
what do you think you'd see?

1291
01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:06.510
<v 0>Well, based on the press release,</v>

1292
01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:11.600
a press conference at the mayor did two days ago in a not sure not having any

1293
01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:16.260
proposals. Um, it seems like more violence has to happen.

1294
01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:22.450
<v 1>All right, Andy, I hope you Brung me too, but, uh, thank you for being here.</v>

1295
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:26.350
My pleasure. All right. Take it easy. Thank you. Stay safe out there with you.

1296
01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:28.450
Thank you. Smile too.

1297
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.630
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].</v>
