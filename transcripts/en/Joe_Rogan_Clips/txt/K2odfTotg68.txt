Speaker 1:          00:01          The seven piece meal specialist back at KFC. Why are we wasting this seven pounds on me? That seven pieces of the colonel's world, famous chicken for 1299 they have wings. It's flesh comes complete with a large mashed potato, large Cole slaw, and to drink for only 1299 it's a deal. So good. It should be illegal. Oh, the government not involved. Hurry in and you can also get our gizzards and liver meal for eight 99 and they take the organs and they take the skin joke. KFC knows how to take care of you. Yeah, I'm comfortable. The seven piece meal special is back only at KFC. See, it's a southern love of bows.
