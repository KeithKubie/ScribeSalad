HAOHSIANG LIAO: In
a second culture,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.040
you have a couple roles to play.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.820
I'll give like five levels.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.370
You can be a tourist and
you can be an observer.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.450
And you can be a participant,
and you can be a contributor,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.300
and you can be a shareholder.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.375
And I always ask my students,
ask yourself, what kind of role

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.460
you want to play in
a second culture.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.700
And that will also
guide you through when

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.190
you are learning how to do these
kind of things with a language.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.200
And our goal here for Chinese 1
and Chinese 2 until Chinese 4,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.170
we really-- we really
push our students

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.750
hard to the level at
least to be participants.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.220
What is a tourist?

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.290
I mean, being a
tourist is totally OK.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.560
So, for example,
when you go to China,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.720
you see so many cars and
the air is really bad.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.100
And so you say, as a tourist,
that the air is so bad.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.320
An utterance like that
would not get you too far

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.090
in communications.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.350
But if you can start
to be observer,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.970
for example, so you observe
what are the reasons

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.300
involved and start to give
you some time and absorb them.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.920
Then the next--
then the next level

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.070
is you can start to
participate in the discussions

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.410
so that the words
coming from your mouth,

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.690
they're much more
sophisticated-- they're

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.350
much more sophisticated, so that
the native speakers would have

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.880
the interest to speak with you.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.796
So those are the five
roles that I always

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:44.920
encourage students to think
about what kind of role

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.660
you want to play in
the second culture.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.450
And that would,
for the most part,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.790
determine your efforts
when you-- when

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.290
you're learning a language.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.650
It can be applied in
many, many aspects.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.140
If today, the issue is
really about a [INAUDIBLE],

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.340
for example, the
structure's not right.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.560
I always-- I
always-- I always ask

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.360
my students, what
if, what would you

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.940
react if a native--
if a foreigner speaks

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.990
to you with English like, "I
go to the park yesterday."

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.440
What would you react?

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.570
Think about a
sentence like this.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.390
His beat-- his beat is
not-- it's not fluency.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.900
And he has some
grammatical errors.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.040
How would you react?

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.500
You can still react
without any difficulties,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.010
because you understand.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.940
But think about that
if you have to interact

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.510
with this person for 30 minutes.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.130
What is your [? maximum? ?]
And that would also

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.840
become the motivation to
work on your language forms,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.030
that's for sure.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.584
Second thing is,
there would also--

00:02:51.584 --> 00:02:53.000
there was-- that
will also give us

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.090
the opportunity to think
about what kind of level.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.660
And the level
we're talking about

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.900
includes cultural competence and
language proficiency that when

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.990
you push yourself to be.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.950
But I will state that as long
as you put in the efforts,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.790
it's always rewarding.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.810
It's always rewarding.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.120
And I'm very happy to
state that our students,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.310
they are usually--
they're usually

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.470
very good at this regard.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.410
They usually find
a lot of resources

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.490
either on campus or the
greater Boston community,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.280
to interact with
the-- to interact

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.950
with the speakers of Chinese.
