00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.560
We wanna make Psychology come alive, for you.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.040

[Simple and thoughtful music fades in]

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.420
It's hard to talk about things.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.900
That's why sugar-coating exists.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.320
Pain, in fact, makes some of the world's greatest actors,

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.795
because they know which face to put on to hide it.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.900
As we go through life, we accumulate more difficulties along the way.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.900
It's impossible not to feel jaded at times,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.660
and we may often find ourselves on the verge of giving up,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.840
but, not all hope is lost.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.380
Here are 5 things to remember when your life is falling apart.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.900
Number 1 - Pain is temporary.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.900
It might not seem like it right this second,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.860
but everything you're going through right now will pass.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.000
Even the heaviest rainstorms eventually find calm.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.780
Whether you're going through a break-up, job loss,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.380
or the death of a loved one, things will slowly stabilize again.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.460
You may not always fully recover from traumatic events,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.300
depending on the severity of them, and grieving is never a linear process.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.340
Some days you may plunge back into the familiar darkness,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.760
and wonder when things will stop feeling heavy,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.580
but no matter how brief, subtle, or unpredictable,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.420
there will always be moments of light you'll find in between.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.280
Sometimes, pain doesn't listen to our cries for instant gratification.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.520
Instead, it asks for patience.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.615
The heart is a strange place.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.200
Just as much as it knows how to drown, it also knows how to endure.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.820
Number 2 - Realize you have what it takes to turn things around.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.360
We don't get to choose where we come from,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.880
but we can still manage to do things to take us where we want to be.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.300
If you find yourself in a dead-end job,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.440
or don't feel as passionate about what you're studying,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.540
know that the situation won't change unless you make one.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.360
Sometimes it may take more than a few tries until you feel satisfied,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.900
but, people are often scared to make changes

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.680
because they're afraid of disappointing themselves if things don't work out.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.620
[Music becomes quiet and thoughtful]

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.020
Admitting it isn't easy.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.880
We've become a world driven by results,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.480
more than giving ourselves credit for the risks we do take to better our lives.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.100
Don't focus so much on what may fall further apart,

00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:48.575
but rather, on what can fall into place.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.600
Number 3 -  Allow what you can't control to just be.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.460
It's great to take responsibility for your own actions and be proactive.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.320
This is how you can live an active, meaningful life when you strive for your goals and dreams,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.480
but it's important to recognize that there is only so much that we have control over.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.300
Instead of analyzing the things we think we can prevent,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.895
or taking extreme precaution to make sure something doesn't happen again,

00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:16.615
we should assess what degree of control is healthy.

00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:20.115
There will always be some things, no matter how carefully we plan,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.800
that happen unexpectedly,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.260
and the only thing we can do is wait it out.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.660
[Music becomes more happy and up-beat]

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.660
Number 4 - You're not alone.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.340
When your problems feel unbearable,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.800
it's easy to become attached to them and focus only on YOUR pain,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.060
but if you take a good look around, you'll come to realize that you're not alone.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.355
Someone else in this world is also still up at 3 am,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.340
because their thoughts are consuming them.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.760
Someone else, just like you, is trying hard to make it through another day without collapsing.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.640
People aren't robots.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.180
That's why we face all the confusion and hurt,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.680
but also the happiness and victories for times we never thought we'd get through, but we did.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.460
Number 5 - It's OK to break, but when you're ready, starting over is always worth it.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.840
You have to be in the right mindset to start over,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.020
and if you're not there yet, it's OK.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.360
Continue breaking until there's nothing left to break,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.840
but, when the breaking gets old, a switch will turn on inside of you,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.820
[Music is quiet again]

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.140
and you'll want to get off the couch and face the world again.

00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:22.445
Things have a habit of coming around when we least expect it.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.160
These are the best coincidences that we have to run with when they show up.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.660
What do you do to keep holding on?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.620
