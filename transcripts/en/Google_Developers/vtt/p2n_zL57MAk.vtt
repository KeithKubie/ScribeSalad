00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.830
PAUL RASHIDI: Hello, everyone.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.080
Thanks for joining
our Hangout.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.890
My name's Paul Rashidi,
and this is Jeff Sham.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.060
We're members of the
DFP API team.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.010
We're excited to host another
API integration Hangout, this

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.190
time with Yieldex.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.970
They integrate with DoubleClick
to optimize

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.850
publishers' revenue.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.570
Today, we have distinguished
members of Yieldex's team.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.650
Tom Shield's the founder
of Yieldex.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.560
Without further ado, I'll give
the floor to Tom, who'll

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.970
introduce the team and then talk
about Yieldex's product.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.090
TOM SHIELDS: Great.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.260
Good morning.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.300
Hello, everyone.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.280
My name is Tom Shields.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.210
I'm co-founder of Yieldex.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.850
We started Yieldex about five
years ago, and it helped

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.450
publishers optimize revenue
through inventory forecasting

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.840
and analytics.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.280
And we'll obviously talk a
little bit more about that as

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.340
we go through.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.700
Previous to this, I was a
founder of a company called

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.298
Net Gravity, which also became
a Google product, ultimately.

00:01:28.298 --> 00:01:31.590
So I've been in the ad tech
business for a long time.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.990
Craig?

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.770
CRAIG MILLER: I'm
Craig Miller.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.676
I am the Chief Technology
Officer here at Yieldex.

00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:37.935
And I've been intricately
involved in the buildout of

00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:40.030
all our tech items.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.080
JOSH BERNSTEIN: I'm
Josh Bernstein.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.680
I'm a solutions consultant
here at Yieldex.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.716
And I spent some time
at Google as well.

00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:47.682
TOM SHIELDS: Fantastic.

00:01:47.682 --> 00:01:48.884
All right, let's dive
in and talk a

00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:50.134
little bit about Yieldex.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.570
All righty.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.440
So, let's start with--

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.310
we'll talk a little bit about
the product, give you a little

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.345
demo of the product, give you a
taste of what it can do, and

00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:09.582
then, obviously, we're going
to talk a lot about the API

00:02:09.582 --> 00:02:12.210
and integration because
that's why we're here.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.980
So what do we do?

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.170
We increase publisher revenue.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.270
We help the publishers increase
revenue by doing big

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.180
data analytics.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.910
Big data is like my
favorite buzzword.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.030
It's one of those things on
buzzword bingo you check off

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.780
because everybody says it.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.350
But we process terabytes of
data, and we help people

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.665
understand how to forecast,
how to manage, and how to

00:02:34.665 --> 00:02:35.990
price their ad inventory.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.990
And we do this across display.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.415
We do it across mobile.

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:41.030
We do it across video.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.212
And we work with a lot of
different players in the ad

00:02:44.212 --> 00:02:46.800
technology ecosystem.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.465
We work with a number of
very large clients.

00:02:49.465 --> 00:02:53.360
Here's some of the clients that
we work with, ranging

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.530
from "Wall Street Journal" and
the "New York Times" to NBC

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.980
and ComCast to more specialized
ones like Pandora,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.930
cars.com, Weather Channel.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.090
So these are all clients that
are getting a lot of value out

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.280
using the Yieldex system to
understand their inventory,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.640
forecast it, and price it.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.875
So we've gotten a lot of
traction within the industry.

00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:19.380
And a lot of these, of course,
are also DFP clients.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.530
So we consider ourselves the
next logical piece in the

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.610
publisher ad stack.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.390
So for most publishers, they've
built out a stack that

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.350
looks like an ad server, which
might be a DFP or another one.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.946
It might be an order management
system, or maybe

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:36.450
it's a homegrown order
management systems, such as a

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.900
DSM, or Operative, or FatTail
or something.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.815
And then now many of them are
adding data management and

00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:45.030
third-party data systems.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.440
I know that DFP's been working
on one of these.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.640
And there's Demdex, and BlueKai,
and, Lotame, Krux,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.090
and all these other
ones as well.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.940
So we find ourselves on top of
this stack, helping with the

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.163
inventory forecasting, and the
management, and the pricing.

00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:02.490
And we integrate with all these
other pieces within the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.480
stack to unify all that data
and give the publisher the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.440
insights that they
need to maximize

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.660
their overall revenue.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.010
So just to talk specifically
about some of the integration

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.089
partners-- of course, we
integrated with DFP and DSM,

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:23.780
and then a number of other ad
servers on the list, a number

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.900
of other order management
systems on the list.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.510
And then the number of data
management platforms are

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.780
rolling out as we speak.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.190
So we find ourselves integrating
a lot of this data

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.870
together and giving
the publishers the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.035
insights they need.

00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:40.300
And we'll talk to you a little
bit about the insights.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.570
The basic idea behind our
technology is that the

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.780
publishers have been able
to sell content.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.305
They've been able to sell
what they have.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.150
But they haven't been able to
figure out how to sell other

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.870
kinds of things that
relate to that.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.175
So they've been able
to sell content.

00:05:02.175 --> 00:05:04.460
And they can see availability
and sold.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.090
But as soon as you start
targeting things like that

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.630
behavioral targets, or
demographic targets, or things

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.475
like age and gender, you start
to run into a problem where

00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:19.490
the inventory is getting
fragmented.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.040
You don't understand how
things are overlapping.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.740
And it's very, very difficult
to know what

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.060
things are going on.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.510
So as soon you start getting
pictures like this, and this

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.750
is a picture that's very
familiar to most ad operations

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.240
and yield management people,
then you need try and figure

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.180
out, how do you tease apart all
this and really understand

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.950
what's going on.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.950
So you need to be able
to see the overlaps.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.040
And you need to be able to see
simple things like just what's

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.810
available for each one of these
different segments,

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.380
taking into account the fact
that a lot of the other

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.480
segments have been sold.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.100
So that's the very basis
of what we do.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.430
And once you have the capability
to do that kind of

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.560
thing, then there's a lot of
market capabilities that you

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.060
build on top of it in terms of
the ability to do pricing and

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.440
management.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.780
So just to give one case study
of a news publisher looking at

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.760
year-over-year revenue, as they
looked at their top seven

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.690
products that they sell
on an ongoing basis--

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.036
these are high CPM, high
sell-through products, as a

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:20.970
general rule--

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.240
they were able to dramatically
increase their revenue and

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.940
their sell-through on all of
these high-value products and

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.560
have pretty dramatic impact
on their overall revenue.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.090
What's important about
this to understand

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.440
is, this in not REM.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.720
This is not the low CPM stuff
that we're trying to bring

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.340
from $0.50 to $1,
or $1 to $1.50.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.930
This is their highest-value
inventory.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.940
These are the products
that generate the

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.250
most revenue for them.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.430
So this is the $15 and $20 CPM
stuff that they sell very

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:01.700
effectively, that already
generates 80% or 90% of their

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.100
overall revenue.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.790
So if you can increase that
by 35% or 50%, that has a

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.653
dramatic impact on their overall
revenue number and

00:07:09.653 --> 00:07:11.220
their overall top line number.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.010
So it's a very powerful thing
once a publisher really

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.890
bookrates it and starts
to use it.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.070
Now what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to turn this over,

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.810
actually, to Josh.

00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:30.150
Oh, hold on a second--
screenshare.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.670
And I'm going to let Josh talk
more specifically about

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.600
exactly what the product
can do for you.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.890
JOSH BERNSTEIN: Thanks, Tom.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.400
So I'm going to jump back into
the presentation and show you

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.810
some high-level concepts as
far as how the product

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.664
addresses these challenges
that Tom's talking about.

00:07:56.065 --> 00:07:58.390
And just wait for that
to queue up.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.090
So what we have here, basically,
these five bubbles

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.200
represent the different areas
of the product where we can

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.005
help publishers in
their workflow.

00:08:22.005 --> 00:08:25.090
So as we go through the product,
we can see how, from

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.200
a sales manager's perspective,
we can help publishers drive

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.740
more revenue.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.140
From an availability and
capacity section, we can find

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.070
more inventory to sell.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.390
From a delivery management
perspective, we can help add

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.520
on, subtract, and get their
assets delivered on time and

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.020
on schedule.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.640
From product delivery, we can
help the inventory team find

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.010
new products to sell.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.470
And from the price optimization
perspective, we

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.140
can help publishers determine
what the best price is to be

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.840
selling their inventory.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.900
So if we look at the sales
management piece, it's really

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.090
about helping publishers get
the right information, the

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.720
right availability, at the
point of sale so that

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.710
salespeople know what inventory
they have to sell.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.100
With integrations like we have
with DSM, we can take our

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.210
highly accurate forecasting
numbers that incorporate both

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.870
revenue forecasts and CPM or
impression forecasts with the

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.650
deals a salesperson is looking
at and push those numbers

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.440
right into DSM at the point of
sale, so when they're setting

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.260
up those line items they
know exactly what

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.010
they have to sell.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.200
From a capacity, forecasting,
and availability--

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.120
we have a UI where we can easily
jump into our tool and

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.660
run the numbers.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.190
But if you have RFPs that you
use or templates that you use,

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.890
if your salespeople just want
to jump into Excel and pull

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.160
some numbers, you can use our
API and pull those numbers

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:50.260
directly into Excel or a web UI
customized for those users

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.480
to make it very easy for them
to find the numbers they're

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.320
looking for with simple
templates

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.390
that they can be using.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.380
For delivery management and
pacing campaigns, you can

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.290
literally see how the campaigns
are delivering and

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.840
easily identify campaigns that
are under goal either by

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.085
revenue or impressions.

00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:10.355
And when folks run these
metrics, if you have campaigns

00:10:10.355 --> 00:10:13.070
that have a lot of revenue
behind goal and less

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.890
impressions, it can help you
focus your ad operations to

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.000
campaigns that'll drive more
revenue with the least impact

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.370
on other campaigns.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.980
From a product discovery
perspective, you can look at

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.240
all of your inventory on a nice
bubble chart and see,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.275
before you ever deliver a
campaign, which one might get

00:10:31.275 --> 00:10:34.260
the most uniques, have the
highest click-through rate,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.700
drive the most revenue, really
determine the value of that

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.595
inventory before you start to
sell it, so when you do sell

00:10:40.595 --> 00:10:42.890
it, the advertisers who buy
that inventory know that

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.775
they're going to get
good results.

00:10:46.775 --> 00:10:48.980
And as these campaigns are
delivering and you're setting

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.240
up different inventory, how you
price it determines how

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.836
much revenue you're going
to make as a publisher.

00:10:54.836 --> 00:10:58.340
So by tracking the different
prices for your inventory and

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.790
tracking that against revenue,
you can find out what prices

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.030
drive in the most revenue and
drive in the most demand.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.980
And when you raise their price
and the demand starts

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.440
dropping, you can really see
where that inflection point is

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.080
and make sure you try not to
cross that next time to keep

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.860
revenue coming in
the front door.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.470
So now what I want to do is
actually show you the UI and

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.720
run some reports.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.250
So here we have the UI.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.040
This where you can come in an
run a lot of your reports.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.270
You can see in reports there's a
lot of customization you can

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.740
do with the product.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.270
Now, some reports I was just
showing you in the UI is just

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.270
be able to target against
different graphs.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.580
You can switch to data views,
line charts, bubble charts.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.640
It's all available
in this system.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.770
Now, the way we usually go about
it is have different

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.730
saved reports, so you can come
in, and you can load up the

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.010
sales manager reports.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.490
This particular report,
we're at high

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.750
sell-through inventory.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.560
Utilization basically refers to

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.920
sell-through and the discount.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.965
So where publishers have high
sell-through of 95-plus

00:11:59.965 --> 00:12:03.030
percent, this particular
publisher was seeing high

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.500
discounts as well.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.660
So by having visibility to this
information, publishers

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.240
can set up business rules to
say when our inventory is

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.550
greater than 80% sold
out, we want to

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.910
cut back on our discount.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.200
Looking at some of the other
reports, we can do

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.860
availability reports.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.140
Looking at these all by the
different products that a

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.620
salesperson might look at, we
can see what are the available

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.590
impressions and the
available revenue

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.490
if I sold that product.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.700
So available impressions are
green, which is typically what

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.760
publishers look at.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.536
if publishers start looking at
available revenue for each

00:12:36.536 --> 00:12:40.090
deal, you can see here in these
blue dots represents how

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.870
much revenue you can make by
selling that inventory.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.642
So where a salesperson might
have typically focused on

00:12:44.642 --> 00:12:48.520
sports enthusiasts, now maybe
they'll focus on people who

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.500
travel because there's more
potential revenue.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.960
And you can go through a
lot of these reports.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.810
You can do product discovery,
looking at uniques and

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.170
click-through percentage.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.350
You can do pricing optimization
where I show the

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.220
inflection point for all
these predefined

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.905
products and inventory.

00:13:02.905 --> 00:13:05.830
Or maybe you want to come
in here and just

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.230
run a dynamic forecast.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.650
You can have all those targets
predefined, but we also have

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.265
tools where you can come
in and run your own

00:13:13.265 --> 00:13:14.515
availability lookup.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.640
So I come in here, and just on
the fly, I can say I want to

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.246
look at my US inventory.

00:13:22.246 --> 00:13:24.985
And I can come in and type in
the country I'm looking for.

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:29.770
I can come in and
choose the size.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.760
So maybe I'll only want to
look in my leaderboards.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.390
And they'll pull those up.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.640
And then something else I can
do that's really interesting

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.820
from certain perspectives is
being able to run more than

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.210
one forecast at a time.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.750
So I would hope that just for
the next week, I want to see

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.520
what I can run for the
holiday season.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.710
And this particular advertiser
is looking for things that

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.720
they want to take over a
whole day for certain

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.290
parts of the inventor.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.510
So I can look at day and
week as a variant.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.300
So I can actually run a forecast
for every single day

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.950
of the week, all at once, and
see what is the best day that

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.200
I want to set in my inventory.

00:14:17.445 --> 00:14:20.290
So by doing this, by choosing
the country and the different

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.285
targeting criteria, I'm setting
up what content I want

00:14:23.285 --> 00:14:24.420
to serve it to.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.270
And by using the things like a
target variance, I actually

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.010
run seven different forecasts,
one for each day of the week.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:30.890
And this is all for a

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.833
completely customized inventory.

00:14:32.833 --> 00:14:36.570
And you can see here, in a few
seconds, I just ran seven

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.660
different forecasts.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.220
So this way, I can literally
come in, and I can see Friday,

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.163
Monday, Saturday, Sunday-- all
the different days, the

00:14:45.163 --> 00:14:47.650
available impressions, and
the total capacity.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.030
So I can go back to my
advertiser and tell them which

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.230
is the best day I can be
selling my inventory.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.260
So that's the quick demo.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.310
Now I'm going to turn
it back to Craig.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.720
We'll talk a little bit more
our API technology.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.380
CRAIG MILLER: So as Josh
mentioned, I'm here to talk a

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.750
little bit about how our
technology works, how we work

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:16.840
with the DoubleClick API for
publishers, and how we

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.460
leverage that API to access all
the data we need to offer

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.110
the product functionality
that we offer.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.000
I'll jump right into the
screen show here.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.780
We are not sharing.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.320
Little technical difficulties.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:06.300
So here at Yieldex, and
throughout our product, we

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.630
consider accessibility of the
data that we've built out to

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.750
be critical to the application
and usability of our product

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.610
for our customers.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:21.240
We do this by offering charts
and graphs as well as analytic

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.730
tools on top of all of the data
to make sure that that

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.100
data is most accessible to end
business users within the

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.642
customer performance.

00:16:29.642 --> 00:16:33.600
In addition to that, we offer
data in low-level

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.450
accessibility forms such as
Excel or CSV formats.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.540
That's all available
via exporting

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.140
throughout the product.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.660
Finally, we offer APIs to let
our customers integrate our

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.070
data back into any systems that
they feel make this data

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.440
most accessible and most
understandable to the business

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.510
processes that they have
in their environment.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.830
That could be anything from
custom user interfaces to

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:04.450
third-party integration, such
as an operative or any

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.790
existing reporting or BI systems
that the customer has.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.900
So we offer very powerful APIs,
analytics tools, and

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.740
data access capabilities
within our platform.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.579
This is absolutely critical
to our success.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:25.050
Yieldex works by effectively
connecting out and reaching

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:29.430
out to all of your ad servers,
order management systems, data

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:34.940
management platforms to
integrate all the data into a

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:39.210
unified environment that are
required to fully understand

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.032
the inventory model within
a given publisher.

00:17:41.032 --> 00:17:45.020
To do that, we obviously need
very rich connectors and

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.900
accessibility via APIs and data
feeds from each of our

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.250
partner vendors.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:55.920
Once we acquire that data, we
crunch or distill that into

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.350
our proprietary inventory
models.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:04.272
On top of that, we take all of
the historic feeds from the ad

00:18:04.272 --> 00:18:08.320
servers themselves and look at
each and every one of the

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.530
impressions historically.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.930
Finally, we forecast that using
our patented algorithms

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.550
and then predict or simulate the
ad server delivery on top

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.480
of that inventory model.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.525
Ultimately, our goal is to make
that data accessible in

00:18:23.525 --> 00:18:26.280
the ways we mentioned earlier
in order to allow the

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.590
publisher to make better
business decisions and thereby

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:30.940
maximize the revenue.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.900
With the Dart for Publishers
platform, we've actually

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.310
leveraged the new APIs.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.420
In fact, many of those new APIs,
we go very rich and deep

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:48.500
to pull up all of the order,
line item, and corresponding

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:53.270
targeting data to understand
exactly how the demand that

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.860
those orders represent are
trafficked or targeted against

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.060
our inventory model.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.190
We do this each and every day,
and, in some cases, multiple

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.680
times a day or every one of our
customers using the Dart

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.930
for Publishers platform.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.690
So we've actually leveraged the
new API and found definite

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:22.550
benefits in this over other
integrations that we have in

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.900
providing the services that
we have for our customers.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.110
So one of the key benefits that
we've noticed with using

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:32.580
the new API is related to the
API performance itself.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.385
We are now able to import,
throughout the given course of

00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:39.270
the day, the campaign
trafficking data and targeting

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:43.860
constraints in significantly
improved time than previously.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.630
Typically, it's now less than
10 minutes, whereas

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.530
previously, we'd seen
times up to an hour.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.800
And to do that, we're actually
leveraging the filtering

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.400
capabilities of PQL
in the new API.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.180
One of the other key benefits
that we've seen in moving to

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.140
Dart for Publishers premium
is the log and

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.170
data transfer system.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:10.040
So previously, we had some
limitations related to how we

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.965
can access the data that we
require to fully understand

00:20:13.965 --> 00:20:16.310
the inventory on behalf
of our publishers.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.850
And our publishers have had to
do things such as use the U

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.860
equals tag to ensure that
the data that we need is

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.910
transferred in the logs.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:28.490
Using the new login transfer,
this is no longer required,

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.980
which is a decided benefit for
Yieldex and our customers in

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.470
that there's less
configuration.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:38.060
We're also able to access that
log data more frequently and

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.420
much more quickly throughout the
day than we had been able

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.040
to previously.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.560
And finally, being able to get
logs at a more granular level

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.250
allows us to actually build
better functionality around

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.710
how we handle date and
time zones for our

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.010
international clients.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.320
One of the best things about
the new API for Yieldex has

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.160
really been that we're able
to do more out-of-the-box

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.560
reporting, leading to less
implementation time, less

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.135
setup and configuration by our
services organization when

00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:11.930
they engage with
a given client.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.690
That's a key benefit for Yieldex
that allows us to

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:18.640
realize revenue ourselves
much more quickly.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.770
We also have noticed that we get
much cleaner data out of

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:26.920
the new API given that there's
more formalization, more

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.340
structure, around the keywords
and key values and the data

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.010
that we actually receive.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.850
That cleaner data also helps our
implementation teams get

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.730
up and running and offer the
data benefits that we offer to

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.900
our customers more quickly.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.630
Internally, our development
organization has been able to

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.870
benefit from a better
development paradigm.

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:52.620
We find that the new DoubleClick
APIs and their

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.800
service-oriented architecture
give us a better development

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.330
paradigm with cleaner
code and easier

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.700
frameworks to develop against.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.670
So many of our customers are
using the current DFP system,

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.800
and therefore, Yieldex
is able to offer

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.850
them an upgrade process.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:15.100
When we go about the upgrade
process to the new DFP, we

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.430
offer seamless continuity of
reporting across the old and

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.650
new systems.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.620
Our customers benefit from all
of the historic data that they

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.590
benefited from in the Yieldex
platform in arrears and

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.980
historically, and then going
forward once they get to the

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.640
new DFP system.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.040
In order to do that, we link the
line item level data from

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.150
the old system to
the new system.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.020
And we also link all of the
targeting constraints that the

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.090
publishers apply to those line
items that constrain the

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.260
delivery against our inventory
forecasts.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.300
In order to enable that, we
switch data connectors

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.570
seamlessly on behalf of the
given customer from the old

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.970
API to the new API.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.775
That happens during the cutover
period where we phase

00:23:03.775 --> 00:23:07.140
data from the legacy system
to the new DFP system.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.590
That takes, effectively, about
seven days, during which time

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.500
the Yieldex system remains
available, and customers

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.330
benefit from all of the
analytics and historic

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.035
reporting that they've been able
to perform as well as our

00:23:19.035 --> 00:23:22.620
given forecasts looking
in the future on the

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.290
previous DFP system.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:29.270
After seven days, we have new
forecasts up and ready to go

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.430
and all of the delivery
predicted

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.380
for the new DFP system.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.760
And customers move on
seamlessly, benefiting from

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:41.430
the Yieldex environment on top
of the new DFP platform.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.720
Any configuration changes that
may be required are performed

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.000
by the Yieldex services
organization.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.020
So it's critical for customers
and their organization

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.890
representatives here at Yieldex
to work together to

00:23:54.890 --> 00:24:00.470
understand any tagging changes
or targeting restructuring

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.420
that is going to occur
when moving

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.250
to the new DFP platform.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.930
So that's how Yieldex works
with the new DFP.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:11.890
JEFF SHAM: Great.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:12.870
PAUL RASHIDI: Great.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.080
Thanks, Craig.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:20.210
I'm excited to see how you
guys like the new API.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.800
I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit more about

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.996
how you're using PQL to reduce
your load times?

00:24:25.996 --> 00:24:27.870
CRAIG MILLER: Sure, sure.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.620
So one of the things that I
mentioned is we have to go

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.470
very deep and very wide and
effectively pull in all of the

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:42.390
publishers' orders, campaigns,
line items from the API and

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.980
all of the targeting constraints
related to that.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.872
So a critical aspect of that is
knowing which campaigns are

00:24:48.872 --> 00:24:52.990
active, which campaigns are
recent or have undergone

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:57.320
changes, and we do that using
some of the PQL filtering

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.500
relating to date, time ranges.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.355
So we actually go ahead and
request, rather than doing

00:25:04.355 --> 00:25:07.470
what we used to do with the
old API, where we'd

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.633
effectively start with an
advertiser and then traverse

00:25:10.633 --> 00:25:16.440
the tree of all the campaigns
related to that advertiser,

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.550
interrogating one at a time,
those items making cross-wire

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:24.240
calls to do so.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.280
And that's really what we did at
the time to determine if a

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.110
campaign or line item was active
and ready to be pulled

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.090
into Yieldex.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:35.340
That took a significant amount
of time as each individual API

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.640
call was made.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.205
Under the new system, what we
do is use PQL filtering to

00:25:41.205 --> 00:25:44.640
effectively say let me fetch all
of the campaigns and line

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.770
items that need to
be processed in

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.830
one given API call.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.015
We were then able to catch that
on the Yieldex side in

00:25:54.015 --> 00:25:56.700
memory and then effectively make
a couple of finer-grain

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.500
calls to a much more limited
extent to pull back the

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.670
individual line item data and
process that into the Yieldex,

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:10.420
what we call import model,
which then backs our

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.530
predictions and our
forward-facing predictive

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.760
analytics as well as add
dimensional data to our

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.010
historic-facing analytics.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.020
PAUL RASHIDI: Great.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.280
JEFF SHAM: That's really
interesting to know.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.900
So that talks about downloading

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.210
data or fetching data.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:32.830
Do you use PQL for updating
or pushing data at all?

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.780
CRAIG MILLER: You know,
Yieldex is currently a

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.140
read-only system.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:40.460
So what we do is we actually
take a reflection of all of

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.450
the data in what we consider
to be the system of record,

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.210
which is the customer's ad
servers and order management

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:51.130
systems, and we unify those into
a given model that allows

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.113
them to run very deep analytics
about how those

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:58.710
campaigns and flights both have
consumed the inventory

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.960
that the publisher has
historically and predicted for

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.740
the future.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:10.310
So to do that, we take a
snapshot of all of the traffic

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.830
campaigns and all of the
upcoming proposals out the

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:17.120
variety of trafficking systems
and order management systems

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.180
the publisher has, unify those
into one given model, predict,

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.970
simulate the future, and then
allow the publishers to access

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.850
that information through
our analytics APIs.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.540
We don't require write-access
to do that.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.420
We're a read-only system.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:37.970
And what we've found, the value
of our system, we've

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.246
talked about some of the
customers that have seen huge

00:27:40.246 --> 00:27:43.300
increases in revenue was because
we can provide real

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.046
actionable information to the
operations team, to the Yield

00:27:47.046 --> 00:27:51.340
team, and to the sales team
to help them price more

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.417
effectively, so they know when
they should discount and when

00:27:54.417 --> 00:27:56.230
they shouldn't discount, when
they should raise prices or

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:59.280
not-- that has a major
impact on revenue.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.660
What they have available to sell
or what other things that

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.650
they should sell at this
time of trying to

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:05.470
consummate a deal.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.570
If something's sold out, what
other things can be proposed.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.320
And then at the time of
delivery, how do we make sure

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.400
this thing is actually
going to deliver.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.780
What is competing with it?

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.750
How do we move things around to
make sure that we're going

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.840
to collect all that revenue?

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.265
So you think about the key value
propositions that we're

00:28:19.265 --> 00:28:21.855
providing, and they're not
things that require us to push

00:28:21.855 --> 00:28:22.860
back in the DFP.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.660
They're things that provide
information to the people who

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.800
are doing these jobs.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.580
JEFF SHAM: Great.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.560
PAUL RASHIDI: Yeah, thanks.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.100
So another thing that I was
wondering if you could go into

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.880
a little bit more detail about
is it's very important for

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.930
upgrading publishers around
continuity of

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.330
their reporting data.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.840
And your system allows
reporting to

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.460
cross the upgrade boundary.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.320
So I was just curious if you
could talk a little bit about

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.070
how you're able to do that
from a technological

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.630
perspective.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.340
CRAIG MILLER: Yeah,
so absolutely.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.403
We completely agree.

00:28:54.403 --> 00:28:58.160
And we hear from our customers
that it is critical to provide

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.115
seamless data across the systems
in general to help

00:29:01.115 --> 00:29:03.660
smooth the transition.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.450
So what we do is we work with
Google to effectively get a

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:12.290
line-item level mapping from
the ad flight IDs in the

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:17.060
previous DFP system into the
new DFP system as those IDs

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:21.830
change and work with our
services team here at Yieldex

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:25.670
to perform a mapping,
internally, that allows those

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:29.200
same flights to connect
to one another.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.460
As our import process runs on
a periodic basis against the

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.230
DoubleClick API, we're able to
pull in any new targeting

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.020
constraints related to
those line items.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.965
And our system has some internal
data constructs that

00:29:44.965 --> 00:29:48.520
allow for different versions
of targeting to occur over

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.970
time, either in what we call our
reporting products or on

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.390
what we call our traffic
or order line products.

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:59.160
And so our system connects up
all of that data seamlessly

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.000
for our customers once we have
the mapping that we receive

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.653
from Google and we do some
services work to enable that

00:30:06.653 --> 00:30:07.810
on our end.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:11.200
That takes us really
just a couple days.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.300
And then our forecasting
algorithms, we need

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.590
effectively to see the new
DoubleClick traffic on the new

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.560
ad server for approximately a
week to be able to start to

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.330
predict those into the future
and provide very accurate

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.745
forecasts and overlap models for
the publisher to run those

00:30:28.745 --> 00:30:30.540
analytics that allow them to
make the better business

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.780
decisions and maximize
their revenue.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.480
TOM SHIELDS: And the historical
data gives us the

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.900
seasonal models that we need to
really help make sure that

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:45.755
the forecast reflects the
higher-level variability that

00:30:45.755 --> 00:30:48.088
happens at many of
our publishers.

00:30:48.088 --> 00:30:52.210
CRAIG MILLER: One of the key
pieces to that I touched upon

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:56.230
in one of those slides is that a
lot if the publisher changes

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:59.880
their tagging architecture
related to moving over to the

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.470
new DoubleClick for publishers,
we need to be

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.460
aware of that here at Yieldex to
ensure that the seasonality

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:10.000
models that we're applying to
our forecasts accurately

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.010
reflect the type of traffic that
we're going to see in the

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:19.890
future related to any traffic
changes that may occur in the

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:21.620
tagging structure itself.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.330
PAUL RASHIDI: OK, great.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.120
Not all publishers are changing

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.150
their tagging structure.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.665
But that's good to know,
if they are, to

00:31:28.665 --> 00:31:30.340
let you guys know.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.970
JEFF SHAM: Well, great.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.780
One more question, I guess.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:38.630
So Craig, you mentioned that you
found a better or improved

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.560
development paradigm
in the new DFP API.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.330
And I'm sure a lot of our
publishers are interested in

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.870
knowing what the key
differences are.

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.670
So if you could share
some of the

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.435
features that you've found.

00:31:51.435 --> 00:31:52.890
CRAIG MILLER: Well, we have
many efficiencies.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.660
As I mentioned, PQL itself gave
us a giant efficiency.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.870
But my developers are able
to actually use more code

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.440
commonality or share some
of the implementation by

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.760
interacting with multiple
services that all come from a

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.290
similar-based interface.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:16.650
That's allowed us to leverage
development paradigms and have

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.890
efficiencies in our
implementation itself that

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:22.095
weren't otherwise possible in
other ad servers APIs or

00:32:22.095 --> 00:32:24.576
previous versions of the APIs.

00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:30.120
So it's really an internal
benefit for my developers that

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:35.300
they've definitely benefited
from and declared loudly.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.000
We're very happy about it.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.540
PAUL RASHIDI: Great.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.220
JEFF SHAM: Great.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.980
TOM SHIELDS: Now, just in
conclusion for us, we are a

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.066
big data analytics company.

00:32:43.066 --> 00:32:45.990
We help publishers
forecast, manage,

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.990
and price their inventory.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.880
We've got a lot of big clients
who are using this very

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:54.010
successfully with legacy DFP
transitioning to the new DFP.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:58.640
And we've had great experience
with the new DFP API.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.000
We're delighted with our
implements, and we're

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.640
delighted with our partnership
with Google, so thank you.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:03.890
PAUL RASHIDI: Great.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.950
We're happy as well.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.390
Thank you very much for your
time, gentlemen, and everyone

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:15.970
watching us on the internet
either live or after the fact.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:17.840
