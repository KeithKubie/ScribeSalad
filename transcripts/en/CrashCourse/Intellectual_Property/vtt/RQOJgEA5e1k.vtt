Hi, I'm Stan Muller. This is Crash Course and today we begin our miniseries on Intellectual Property.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.960
Hey, isn't the entire concept of
Intellectual Property illegitimate?

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.700
I mean, how can we justify locking up the world of science and arts so corporations, publishing houses

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.780
and other gatekeepers can control what we know and what we think! Information wants to be free, man!

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.011
Hey, me from the past! There's a Stan from the past! This is great!

00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:22.020
Stan: Hey! Me from the past! There's a Stan
from the past, this is great!

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.020
Anyway. I can tell by looking at your vacant and bloodshot eyes that you've been up all night

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.900
downloading Chumbawumba records over a
dialup connection. I remember those days,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.820
and I remember desperately trying to cling to any ethos
that justified your rampant copyright infringement.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.550
That is if you ever participated in such activities.
And even if you had participated in said infringing

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.100
activities, the statute of limitations has likely
run out. I don't even know what LimeWire is!

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.620
[Theme Music]

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.600
I like how this is getting started, because
Stan from the past raises some interesting points!

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.780
There's a good chance that he, and
a lot of you watching this video, might think

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.950
about aspects of Intellectual Property as
outdated and pretty much irrelevant.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.700
Maybe lots of you don't think of it at all!

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.660
That line, "Information wants to be free",
has been used to argue that current intellectual

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.810
properly laws are outdated, over-broad and
generally awful.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.680
The quotation is attributed to Stewart Brand and he
said this to a group of computer programmers in 1984.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.940
"On the one hand Information wants to be expensive,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.890
because it's so valuable. The right information
in the right place just changes your life.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.240
On the other hand, information wants to be
free, because the cost of getting it out is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.790
getting lower and lower all the time. So you
have these two fighting against each other."

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.130
The full quote, which you hardly ever hear,

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.060
actually spells out the major tension between
intellectual property and technology quite well.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.760
And it did it more than 30 years ago, when
the digital age was just beginning. As information

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.360
technology becomes more and more pervasive
and important in our day-to-day lives in the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.140
information society, information itself becomes
exponentially more important and more valuable.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.380
Paradoxically, as our information technology
improves, and as our computers and connections

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.930
get better and faster, and sharing becomes
easier, we're less able to control the copying

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.390
and dissemination of this incredibly valuable
information. The law of supply and demand

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.820
pushes down the information's value.
This tension is nothing new.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.960
Technology, especially in the context of copyright
law, has always presented challenges.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.790
Socrates's and Plato's 'Phaedrus' bemoaned
the advent of books, arguing that they "will

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.209
implant forgetfulness in [human beings'] souls;
they will cease to exercise memory because

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.229
they rely on that which is written, calling
things to remembrance no longer from within

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:24.610
themselves, but by means of external marks."

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.950
One way that humans have attempted to deal
with these new technologies, with varying

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.490
success, is by passing laws. The scourge of the piano
roll was contemplated in the 1909 Copyright Act,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.650
the photocopier in 1976, and the Internet was covered
in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.530
But we're going to try to avoid this simplified
intellectual property versus technology binary.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.360
The idea that we have to choose between devaluing
the fruits of intellectual talent and labor,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.940
or devaluing the revolutionary information
sharing capacity of our networks, is wrong-headed.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.760
The more interesting and more difficult question
is how we can strike a balance; how we can

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.510
incentivize and promote this revolution in
the way we share information, while at the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.459
same time incentivizing and promoting the
production of creative works and inventions

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.489
by having respect for the human beings that
actually created them.

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.160
The difference between today's debates and
those that took place 100 years ago is that

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.800
intellectual property pervades our lives more
and more every day.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.960
This is especially true for anyone viewing
this video. I know that about 90% of you view

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.120
Crash Course in a web browser, so consider
the layers of IP in this very YouTube page.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.489
A lot of what you're looking at is covered
by copyright. This video, for example, is

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.440
covered as a motion picture work. The website
itself is considered a literary work.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.519
The Thought Bubble, the theme song, and the
video you watched right before this one, all

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.310
have copyright protection. The software that
streams the video is also a literary work.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.970
The web browser you're using is most likely
registered as a computer program, as is the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.950
operating system. Lest you Linux weirdos think
that you don't have a copyright on your OS:

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.800
You do. You're just not enforcing it.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.540
Even your comments could be covered by copyright.
That haiku you just posted:

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.720
"Who is this person?
What happened to Mr. Green?

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.140
Dislike. Unsubscribe."

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.340
That's copyright-able! When you agreed to
this [image of YouTube user agreement],

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.140
you granted YouTube a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive license to use your content in any way they see fit.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.379
There are also patents in play here. There's
proprietary video streaming technology, and

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.760
many of the components in your computer are patented. But wait! There's more!

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.940
YouTube is a registered trademark, and if
you saw an ad before this video, there was

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.120
most likely a trademark in there. This is
a trademark

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.669
and under this sticker is an image
of a piece of fruit, also a trademark.

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.680
And behind the camera, our most precious and
valuable mark, Mark Olsen. Mark Olsen, everybody!

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.819
The search algorithm that got you here? That's
a trade secret. My appearance in this video,

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.579
and subsequent marketing of commemorative
mugs with my likeness fixed on each one- that

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.120
implicates my right of publicity.

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:43.309
If you're watching this on an iPhone or an Android, there's a whole other world of copyrights and patents that apply.

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:47.860
When you start to deconstruct it like this,
it's dizzying. But despite all this complexity,

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:51.479
most of the time the system moves along with
a fluidity that sometimes makes it easy to

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.430
put it out of your mind. Kind of like the
internal functioning of your digestive tract.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.610
But it's there. Always there. Gurgling and churning
and functioning. Did anybody order lunch?

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.520
Now most of this fluidity and seamlessness
is borne on the back of hundreds or thousands

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.440
of lawsuits, many of them against Google,
thousands of pages of intricately complex

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.080
contracts, and hundreds of millions of take
down notices.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.689
The point is that none of us, or very few
of us, can go about our daily lives without

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:20.500
being impacted by intellectual property. It's
only when it hits home, like when you receive that

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.280
cease-and-desist letter from a trademark attorney
for opening a restaurant called Burger Queen,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.700
or digital rights management software stops you from listening to your iTunes downloads on your Zune.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.440
Maybe your YouTube video gets taken down
because of that T-Swizzie song in the background

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.620
(that's what the kids call Taylor Swift).

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.680
Maybe you get a letter from your internet
service provider, informing you that someone

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.919
using your account has downloaded every episode
of Game of Thrones and that if it keeps up

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.679
you may be fined or imprisoned- or beheaded!
That's when it flares up.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.900
Flare up! God, are we still on the digestive
tract metaphor? Somebody get me a Tums. Tums,

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:52.999
by the way, registered trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline
group of companies.

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:55.179
Most of us encounter IP only on its borders.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.820
We hear horror stories about the motion picture and recording industry suing grandmothers.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.540
We watch those unskippable FBI messages warning us about the consequences

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.180
of copyright infringement, or we complain about paying thousands of dollars per pill for medicine.

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:12.379
We tend to encounter intellectual property
law in places where we, as users, are basically

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:17.149
being told 'no'. And being told 'no' over
and over again is irritating, especially when

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:20.619
these "no's" don't seem to make any sense.
And they're really irritating when they come

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:22.599
with threats of fines or imprisonment.

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:26.679
So in this course we're going to focus less
on enforcement and the "no's" and more on

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:31.859
the part of intellectual property that often
says 'yes', 'sometimes', 'maybe', 'it is certain',

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.840
or even 'ask again later'.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.659
I'm speaking, of course, of the "Liquid filled
die agitator containing a die having raised

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:46.159
indicia on the facets thereof", registered as patent
US 3119621, which you might know as the Magic 8-Ball.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.819
Before we get too far, we should probably
define intellectual property. This is going

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.169
to get pretty abstract, so let's go to the
Thought Bubble.

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:55.549
The theoretical definition of intellectual
property would begin by saying that it is:

00:06:55.549 --> 00:07:01.980
"Nonphysical property that stems from, is identified as, and whose value is based on an idea or some ideas."

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:05.809
There has to be some element of novelty; the
thing that we describe as intellectual property

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:09.419
can't be commonplace, or generally known,
in the society where it's created, at the

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.140
time that it becomes property. You can't claim that
you invented the wheel or that you wrote Moby Dick.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.880
Even though the source material for all IP
is social -- the inputs are our education, our

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:22.999
human interactions, and basically all the
sensory data around us that we take in -- the

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:28.319
thing that we call 'IP' is the product of
us putting together all these social inputs

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.680
into something that we're gonna call "the
idea".

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.760
"Only the concrete, tangible, or physical embodiments
of the idea are protected by intellectual property law."

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.100
The idea has to be fixed into a form and location in which humans have access to it. That could be a novel,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.380
or a logo, or a liquid filled die agitator containing a die having raised indicia on the facets thereof.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:54.020
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So in its purest and best form, IP is the propertization of intellectual effort and talent.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.320
In its most corrupt and worst form,
intellectual property can be, and has been

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:03.069
used by the propertied and powerful to protect
concentrated markets and broken business models.

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:05.889
At its very worst, it can be used a a censorship
tool.

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:10.050
Intellectual property differs somewhat from
real property like cars or houses because

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:15.360
it's limited in duration and scope. For example,
copyrights last for the life of the author plus 70 years.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.139
Copyrighted works can be copied under the
fair use exception for certain personal or

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:23.199
publicly beneficial uses. Let's say a book
reviewer quotes long passages of a novel,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.959
then pans the book. It's likely the author
of the book wouldn't grant permission for

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:31.330
this type of use. But we want to encourage
informed public discourse. So there's a good

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.459
chance it would be found to be a fair use.

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:37.229
Patent laws carved out a limited experimental
use exception that permits minimal use of

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:42.009
a patent for amusement, to satisfy idle
curiosity, or for strictly philosophical inquiry.

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:46.720
Again, the patent owner probably wouldn't like this,
but the law wants to encourage individual

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.029
tinkering. Both these limitations exist to
serve the primary objective of intellectual

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:55.960
property: that's to promote the progress of science
and useful arts by increasing our stock of knowledge.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.280
So in this series, we're going to focus on
the 3 main branches of intellectual property:

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.579
copyrights, patents, and trademarks. We won't
have time to get into some of the lesser cousins

00:09:04.579 --> 00:09:08.800
of the family like trade secrets or the right
of publicity, but all of these are included

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.899
under the umbrella of intellectual property.

00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:14.110
So in the coming weeks we're going to try
to get at some of the nuts and bolt of what

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:18.170
intellectual property is, because like it
or not, IP is only going to become more and

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.890
more relevant as our lives become more and
more digital.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:25.399
So regardless of what or how you feel about
any aspect of IP, it's probably a good idea

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:29.740
to have some basic knowledge of it. It doesn't
matter if you're a consumer or a creator of

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.500
protected content or both. Is understanding
IP going to help you?

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.240
You may rely on it. See you next week.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.019
Crash Course: Intellectual Property is filmed

00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:42.079
in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz here in sunny
Indianapolis, Indiana, and it's made with

00:09:42.079 --> 00:09:45.120
the help of all of these nice workers for
hire.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.149
If you'd like to help us make Crash Course
in a monetary way that doesn't imply any ownership

00:09:49.149 --> 00:09:53.839
in the final work, you can subscribe at Patreon,
a voluntary subscription service where you

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:58.389
can support Crash Course and help make it free
for everyone forever. You can get great perks,

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:03.490
but the greatest perk of all is the satisfaction of
spreading knowledge. Right? So thanks for watching.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.510
We'll see you next week.
