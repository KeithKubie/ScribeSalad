00:00:01.736 --> 00:00:03.110
[? RUCHICA: ?] Hi everyone.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.380
Welcome to the
[? G Pause ?] Talk today.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.300
I am very glad to
present and welcome

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.720
John Osborne, who is the
National Director of Project

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.610
Welcome Home Troops.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.380
It's a program of the non-profit
organization International

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.710
Association for Human Values.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.810
John has been teaching
specialized courses

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.110
in human development
and leadership

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.440
to public corporates,
government,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.820
and military professionals
for over 40 years,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.350
a long journey in this field.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.020
John has also spoken at the
United Nations, the World Bank,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.124
the World Health Organization,
and many other technology

00:00:43.124 --> 00:00:45.040
companies that we are
familiar with in the Bay

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.630
Area and outside.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.880
He is also a speaker at Harvard
University and Wharton School.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.580
I will hand over to John,
and let him say a few more

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.170
words about him, and walk
us through this lovely talk

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.030
on harnessing the
healing power of breath.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.356
Thank you.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:08.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.030
JOHN OSBORNE: Thank you,
[? Ruchica, ?] and everyone

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.210
for allowing me to be here.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.270
And I'd like to begin
today by taking you

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.030
on a slightly imaginary journey.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.910
Imagine that here in
the United States,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.830
there's an outbreak
of a great pandemic.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.550
The pandemic exists
all over the world,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.650
but there are at least 300,000
or 400,000 cases of people

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.200
coming down with this
disease, and 22 people

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.180
are dying of it every
day in the United States.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.519
Imagine if you knew about
a pandemic like that,

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:42.060
it would be on the front page
of the "New York Times," right?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.820
Well, actually, it does exist.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.180
Pandemic has a name.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.520
It's called Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.810
It's affected at least
300,000 or 400,000

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.040
Americans coming back from
Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.130
and contractors and civilians.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.430
And 22 vets a day are
committing suicide

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.540
because of the effects
of this disease.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.960
So it's a big problem.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.920
And I'm part of an
organization that

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.979
has one solution or one method
of dealing with this problem,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.370
and that's what I'm going
to talk to you about today.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.911
But first, I'd like to talk to
you a little bit about myself,

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:17.270
what I'm doing here,
and why I'm here.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.780
I am a retired
venture capitalist,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.720
and so I've been spending a
lot of time in Silicon Valley.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.260
And also, I've been
meditating for about 45 years

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.180
and teaching different forms of
meditation and self-development

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.920
for about 40 years.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.440
Two reasons that I'm here.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.090
One has to do with a
person named Walter,

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.810
whom I'm happy to
tell you about.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.890
And another has
to do with my dad.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.440
My dad was a World War II
hero in Pacific theater,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.580
was nominated for a Silver
Star for knocking down

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.210
48 kamikaze planes who
were trying to shoot down

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.770
his ship in 24 hours, and
always held the values

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.830
of military service
as I was growing up.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.790
Now, you've probably
figured out from my age

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.610
that I grew up during
the Vietnam era.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.040
And as hard as he wanted to
get me in military service,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.240
I was running the other way.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.720
I was not at all interested.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.000
And it was only because
of an experience

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.605
I had with my dad late in life.

00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:13.230
Right before he died,
I took him to see

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.990
the movie "Saving Private Ryan."

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.610
And we had about a four-hour
conversation afterwards.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.220
And it was then
that the light went

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.855
on in my mind as to why my dad
was so interested in getting

00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:25.350
me involved in the military.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.100
Because for my dad,
being in the service,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.210
as they used to
say in those days,

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.836
laid the groundwork for him
for a lifetime of service.

00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:34.960
I grew up in a small
community in upstate New York,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.860
and my dad organized the
volunteer ambulance corps.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.242
And he raised money for the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:43.450
And later on, he joined a
human development committee

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.660
that took little old ladies to
the hospital when he had to.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.640
So being in the military
provided him with a basis

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.117
for a lifetime of service.

00:03:51.117 --> 00:03:52.700
And it was only at
the end of his life

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.860
that I understood
that when he wanted

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.234
to get me in the
military, it was

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:57.670
because he wanted me
to have those values.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.910
So when I started getting
involved with soldiers,

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.650
I did it and continue to do
it in memory and in honor

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.540
of my dad, who passed
away shortly thereafter.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.350
I was teaching these breathing
techniques to civilians

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.982
in, it was about 1996
in Santa Barbara,

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:13.940
when I got a call from
a psychologist who said,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.320
I think I have someone who
could use some of your breathing

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.240
and meditation skills.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.323
He said, but I'm not sure
if he's suitable for you

00:04:19.323 --> 00:04:22.210
guys, for your course.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.780
And when I asked
him why, he said,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.860
because this person is
drug-addicted, he's violent,

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.320
he's suicidal, he's a danger
to himself and to others.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.330
And oh, by the way,
he's a Vietnam vet.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.100
And so what I did
on that course was

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.650
to give the course away so that
someone else could teach it,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.230
and I became the buddy of this
person, whose name was Walter.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.930
And he had a little
bit of a difficult time

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.780
with the meditation and
the yoga and the breathing,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.290
but he got through the course.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.334
And I saw that it had
transformed him a lot.

00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:50.750
And I lost touch with Walter
until about five years later.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.596
I was doing a
meet-and-greet kind

00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:54.152
of a reception in Los Angeles.

00:04:54.152 --> 00:04:55.610
And there was a
long line of people

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.050
that were coming up
to say hello to me.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.675
And all of a sudden,
I saw this person.

00:04:58.675 --> 00:04:59.970
He was about 6' 6" in a suit.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.210
And I vaguely recognized him.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.100
And he came up and
he gave me a hug

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.400
and lifted me off the ground.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.140
And I'm like, who
is this person?

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.680
And he said, John,
he said, I'm Walter.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.650
And Walter, by that
time, was the head

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.270
of data processing services for
the county of Santa Barbara.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.330
He owned a car.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.200
He had a girlfriend.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.390
He had an apartment.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.730
He was off his drugs, and
he was leading a happy life.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.690
Now, I'm not sure what
the complete connection

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.240
between the course
that I took with Walter

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.674
and his present state.

00:05:25.674 --> 00:05:26.840
But it planted a seed in me.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.360
I thought, wow, for people
who are in such anguish,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.670
having such trouble being
in the present moment,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.770
this might be something
that would be useful.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.260
So about eight years
ago, I was asked again

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.910
by a colleague to
join them in doing

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.780
a brief introduction
at a Vet Center.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.530
For those of you who
are not very familiar

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.946
with the military, since the
Vietnam War and people coming

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:48.960
back having so much trouble
transiting to civilian life,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.070
the VA has set up these
neighborhood Vet Centers

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.000
where vets can come
and talk to each other,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.620
maybe get some help with
their processing of papers,

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.310
and join a group,
and meet other vets,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.340
and deal with their problems.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.280
And I taught some just
initial breathing techniques

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.130
to some of these vets, and the
results were so transformative.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.132
These are people that
were running red lights

00:06:10.132 --> 00:06:12.340
in Santa Monica, California,
because they were afraid

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.630
that there was an IED
at the side of the road.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.240
How many people are
familiar with PTS,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.030
some of the symptoms of PTS?

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.595
Some of them are
memories which crowd out

00:06:21.595 --> 00:06:23.970
the real estate inside them
to the point where they can't

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.390
be in the present moment,
emotional numbness,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.620
having trouble with extremes
in emotions, especially

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.130
anger, suicidal thoughts,
depression, sleeplessness,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.895
and for a lot of them, a
tendency to self-medicate,

00:06:36.895 --> 00:06:39.360
either with drugs or alcohol.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.470
These are people
that have either

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.130
seen something or lost
someone or done something

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.090
that they regret
hugely, and come back.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.150
And the problem with PTS is
that it doesn't go away just

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.010
by itself.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.610
I've treated a lot of vets that
were even in the Vietnam War.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.610
40 years later, they're
still having problems.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.060
I'll tell you more about
this in a little bit,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.060
but I thought you'd like to
meet some of my students.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.990
So we're going to start by
seeing a short video with some

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.520
of their experiences, and then
we'll talk a little bit more

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.300
about what I do.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.800
OK?

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:14.386
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.240
TRAVIS: When I was a freshman
in high school, 9/11 happened.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.450
And I think that kind of planted
the seed for my eventual going

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.200
into the military.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.120
DON: My name is Don Rodriguez.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.690
I was born and raised
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.190
I went into the
military in 1985.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.320
ROGER: You can't walk through
that amount of bloodshed

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:59.120
and bodies and black
bags and-- you just

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.885
can't walk through that
and not be affected by it.

00:08:02.885 --> 00:08:04.510
KYLE: We spent 16
months on the ground.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.470
We were actually the longest
unit to serve in Iraq.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.980
And then I deployed
to Iraq again

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.915
in 2009 for another nine months.

00:08:11.915 --> 00:08:13.290
LOUIS: You know,
you have to kind

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:18.920
of detach from your humanity
to do that over there.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.250
And then you come back,
and you have a hard time

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:27.406
reattaching to
normal civilian life.

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:30.057
ROGER: You could see somebody
die in the sidewalk in front

00:08:30.057 --> 00:08:32.140
of you and step right over
them and keep on going.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.679
They're not personal to me.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.549
JIM: I think the
death and the dying

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:44.080
that I saw there grabbed
a hold of me daily.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.760
We were getting mortared daily.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.340
LOREN: I realized within
a few weeks of being there

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.440
that the odds of any of
us living through a year

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.035
there didn't feel
very good at all.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.410
TRAVIS: On the
second deployment,

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.640
there was a rocket attack on
my base that killed three guys

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.940
and injured another one.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.800
ANTHONY: When the next
generation of roadside bombs,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.740
the EFP came in,
I was terrified,

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.740
because they would go
right through our armor.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.050
But even when you're
on base, I mean,

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.630
they're firing rockets in.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.630
They fire mortars in.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.800
REMO: We had been there
less than 30 days,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.290
and we lost one helicopter
with everybody onboard.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.150
It was shot down.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.075
DON: Well, I came back
injured, came back blind.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.720
I really had no support
of any family or anything.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.110
I felt alone, isolated.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.907
TRAVIS: For me, when I got
back, life was the same.

00:09:38.907 --> 00:09:40.740
For my girlfriend at
the time, apparently, I

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.760
was very different,
very-- totally changed.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.060
And she would tell me this,
and I never understood it.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.720
REMO: I know I lost
something, but I'm not

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.660
really quite sure what
it was that I lost.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.020
RICH: I had changed enough
and didn't recognize

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.140
it enough that it actually put
a lot of strain on my marriage

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.880
and was one of the
factors that led up

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.220
to what turned into a divorce.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.670
NATHAN: My fiancee and I
started having some trouble.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.880
And I was drinking a lot.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.230
LOUIS: I had bad dreams,
panic attacks, anger.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.640
I had a lot of anger.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.180
ROGER: The anger
that was there--

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.820
anger became my best friend.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.920
And if I wasn't angry
about something,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.020
I was looking for something
to get angry about.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:36.970
EILEEN: Roger was never abusive,
but I was afraid of his anger.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:42.010
You start just not knowing what
it's going to be like one day

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.020
to the next.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.020
STEPHEN: She didn't know
when I would get angry,

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.820
what I would get angry about.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.950
And it would happen
so quickly that she

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.050
wasn't prepared for it.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.120
ANTHONY: There is
no graduated scale.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.220
It's 0 to 10, that's it.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.470
LOREN: Something unknown would
flare up something in me,

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:12.380
and I would lose track of
what was going on around me.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.130
GREG: I lived on
antidepressants,

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.950
which I have lived on
for the last four years.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:22.040
I've been on every one that's
probably been available.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.590
JIM: The life, as
I saw it inside,

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:32.220
if I have to continue life this
way, it's not worth living.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.870
DON: I felt lost.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.925
I attempted suicide twice.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.510
Substance abuse.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.117
Just anything that
would ease the pain.

00:11:47.117 --> 00:11:49.200
NATHAN: I white-knuckled
it for about nine months,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.065
and then it just--
the nightmares

00:11:51.065 --> 00:11:54.800
and the flashbacks, all
that stuff just finally

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.160
overwhelmed me.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.300
DON: They tried putting me
through prolonged exposure,

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.290
cognitive processing
therapy, all

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.180
the other different therapies
that they could possibly

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.245
think of.

00:12:07.245 --> 00:12:11.240
And it helped a little bit
more, but I was still in a hole.

00:12:12.319 --> 00:12:14.860
JOHN OSBORNE: If it's not too
personal a question to ask you,

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.810
can you describe what it
felt like being in that hole?

00:12:25.295 --> 00:12:26.730
DON: Like being in hell.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.320
Whatever the worst
thing you could possibly

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.070
imagine about hell,
that's where I was at.

00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:41.550
JOHN OSBORNE: I
think that there's

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.450
been combat trauma and
Post-Traumatic Stress syndrome

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.430
as long as men and women
have been fighting wars.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.840
Project Welcome Home Troops
started in Southern California

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.990
about seven years ago,
answering a need for some vets

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.550
at a Vet Center who wanted to
learn more about breathing,

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.120
stress management,
meditation in an effort

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.270
to help them manage their
combat trauma symptoms

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.710
and Post-Traumatic
Stress syndrome.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.530
ROGER: The first time I took
the course in Fort Worth, Texas

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.060
was 10 months ago.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.530
JIM: I had no idea
what to expect.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:23.680
And as we got into the program
and started to do the exercises

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.142
and do the breathing
and so on, I thought,

00:13:28.142 --> 00:13:30.120
eh, this might be all right.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.070
This might help.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.440
LOUIS: At first, I thought
it was a little bit hokey,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.155
you know, first coming in.

00:13:35.155 --> 00:13:36.530
STEPHEN: The more
we got into it,

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.280
the more it stopped being just
a bunch of hippie nonsense.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.690
It started dislodging
certain internal barriers

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.840
I guess I had built up.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.980
TRAVIS: I think also by,
like, day two or three,

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.720
you started building that
camaraderie between the people

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.290
within the group,
which was nice.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.840
JIM: The end session
there where we

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.330
did the power breathing
was the ultimate.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.840
I thought, wow.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.560
I was just so relaxed.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.550
TRAVIS: You know, right away,
with the breathing exercises,

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.540
it taught me how to relax.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.830
GREG: It's almost like you have
to get way deep down in there

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.667
with all of that deep breathing.

00:14:15.667 --> 00:14:17.250
And then it just
seems to take it all,

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.200
and you exhale it all out.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.110
ROGER: My son stopped over, and
we were shooting the breeze.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.480
And he's a pretty direct kid.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.220
He says, hey, Pop, the VA got
you on some new drugs or what?

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.110
[LAUGHS] So I thought,
you know, it's not just

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.240
me that notices it.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.890
RICH: When I
finished the course,

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.880
I didn't notice the
changes immediately.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.290
Everyone around me did.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.050
ANTHONY: I felt like
I did before I ever

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.339
want to Iraq the first time.

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.380
RICH: It's surreal to have
someone come up to you

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.770
and say something like, why
are you happy all the time?

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.220
You're smiling again.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.580
Did something change?

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.990
STEPHEN: I am a
different person now.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.110
Just night and day.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.640
RICH: You know, you're really--
it's like you're you again

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.350
from three or four
or five years ago.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:03.530
NATHAN: My ex, she said, I
really like this new guy.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.560
You remind me of the guy
that I had met years ago.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.860
LOUIS: So I can focus
and concentrate better

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.695
when I'm at school.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.500
And I can be around
other people.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.305
STEPHEN: My mood goes like
this as opposed to spikes.

00:15:18.305 --> 00:15:19.930
JOHN OSBORNE: The
particular techniques

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.840
that we teach are very
effective and very

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.760
popular with
veterans-- number one,

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.410
because they like
learning something

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.660
that they can do on their own.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.130
They're very self-reliant,
independent people.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.120
Number two, it's preferable
to a lot of people

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.680
to other treatments,
like psychiatric drugs

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.690
or long-term psychotherapy.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.357
And number three,
it's highly effective.

00:15:38.357 --> 00:15:40.440
And they like doing it in
a class with other vets.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.540
They bond with other vets.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.610
They do the program
ongoing with other vets.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.410
And many of them now are
out finding other vets

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.660
that need to take the program.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.390
DON: I don't know.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.220
The breathing just
opened up something in me

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.790
where I could just feel
better about myself.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.440
And I realized that there were
some things I may have done,

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.817
but that I had to do
in order to survive,

00:16:10.817 --> 00:16:11.900
in order to be here today.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.670
If not, I wouldn't be here.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.270
STEPHEN: Just on a
completely practical level,

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.420
I sleep at night, and I don't
have to take a handful of meds

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.590
to do it.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:26.390
ROGER: I am not taking any
medication for anxiety.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.200
I'm not taking any sleep aids.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.270
I'm not taking any meds.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:34.407
And that is not a giant
step, that's a giant leap.

00:16:34.407 --> 00:16:36.490
TRAVIS: Now I'm a teacher
for Project Welcome Home

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.600
Troops, which is great.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.560
Sharing this information, these
techniques, and the knowledge,

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.180
seeing the change
in people, I think,

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.720
is the biggest driving force.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.760
GREG: About a week before
I came on this course,

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.960
I was in the hospital
for five days.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.673
Major depression.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.125
Really didn't give a damn
if I lived, you know?

00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:03.960
I really think that
I have improved

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:09.560
about 75% in just
the last two months.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.250
ROGER: I'm going
to keep doing it.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.210
I don't know how it works,
I don't know why it works,

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.550
but it works for me.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.966
GREG: And that's where this
program really probably helped

00:17:17.966 --> 00:17:21.720
me more than anything is it
kind of gave me myself back,

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.750
you know?

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.800
DON: At the path that
I was going prior

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:31.960
to having done the exercise
with you guys, I don't think I

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.620
would have made it 10, 20 years.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.860
So when you're asking me now
20, 30 years down the line,

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.540
I am looking at it as
a present, something

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.810
that's just a gift
that's been given to me,

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.685
maybe one more chance
to get things right.

00:18:58.446 --> 00:19:00.139
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.930
JOHN OSBORNE: So this
Power Breath workshop

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.360
is a five-day workshop
that we offer for vets.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.770
It's a combination
of yoga, meditation,

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.190
and a very specialized
form of rhythmic breathing

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.990
called the Sudarshan
Kriya yoga technique.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.960
Most people at Google
know that breathing

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.260
is one of the main
sources of energy, right?

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.902
You can live for several weeks
without food, several days

00:19:21.902 --> 00:19:23.860
without water, but you
can't live for very long

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.560
without breath.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.000
So breath is, we all know,
a major source of energy.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.850
It's also a major
part of our health.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.820
About 80% of the toxins
that leave the body

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.236
leave the body
through the breath.

00:19:33.236 --> 00:19:35.250
But there's a third
mysterious aspect

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.970
to the breath that allows this
workshop to be very powerful.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.130
And that is that the breath
is a very powerful link

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.837
between the mind and the
body and the emotions.

00:19:44.837 --> 00:19:46.420
How many people have
been at a meeting

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.879
at Google where you
know that somebody's not

00:19:48.879 --> 00:19:50.670
having a very good day
or not having a very

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.670
good time at the meeting,
because you look over,

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.936
and they're like--
[BREATHES VERY DEEPLY].

00:19:54.936 --> 00:19:56.579
And you think, in
about five seconds,

00:19:56.579 --> 00:19:58.370
I don't want to be in
this meeting anymore.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.310
How many people have had an
experience in or out of Google

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.660
like that?

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.076
When you see that, emotions
change and the breath changes.

00:20:03.076 --> 00:20:05.020
We see it often backwards.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.230
We see the breath
change and we think, OK,

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.890
there's an emotional change.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.840
Any mothers here
with small children?

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.340
Anybody?

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.710
Right.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.930
And so have you ever sung
a lullaby to your child,

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.780
and you see the breath getting
slower and getting longer,

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.780
and you're thinking,
in 30 more seconds,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.010
my child is finally
going to sleep?

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.490
So there's this important link.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.290
And it's that link that we use
in the Power Breath workshop.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.930
Because most of the time, we
notice the emotional change,

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:34.050
and then we notice the change
in the rhythm of the breath.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.080
But we teach specific
rhythms of the breath

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.190
to the vets, which allow them
to come to a center place

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.200
no matter what else is
going on in their life,

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.020
and to come back in
the present moment.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.170
These are people
that are trapped

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.295
in their memories and their
physiological reactions

00:20:46.295 --> 00:20:46.874
to the past.

00:20:46.874 --> 00:20:48.290
I said at the
beginning, these are

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.807
people that run red
lights in Los Angeles,

00:20:51.807 --> 00:20:54.390
because they're afraid there's
a bomb at the side of the road.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.330
They're not able to live
in the present at all.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.300
Most of us, our mind swings
from the past to the future,

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.480
and sometimes lives in
the present, hopefully.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.770
But for them, their mind
is trapped in the past.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.130
And these rhythmic breaths, the
[? Sky ?] Sudarshan Kriya yoga

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.180
breath work not only
brings them to the present

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.340
but allows the body
naturally to begin

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.980
to let go of trauma and
stress-- not just in that day,

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.460
but on a permanent basis.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.330
And they refer to some research.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.900
There's just been one pilot
study done on this program.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.731
It was done at the Center for
the Study of the Healthy Mind,

00:21:26.731 --> 00:21:28.730
Dr. Richard Davidson--
some of you may know him.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.271
I think he's actually
come and spoken

00:21:30.271 --> 00:21:32.480
at Google-- at the
University of Wisconsin.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.350
And that research showed,
with a control group

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.500
of 10 vets taking the course and
10 vets doing something else,

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.320
over a period of seven
days, that their symptoms

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.420
of Post-Traumatic Stress lowered
on an average of 40% to 50%.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.480
That's interesting.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.979
But what is also interesting
is that when they measured them

00:21:48.979 --> 00:21:51.380
six months later, the
symptoms were still lower.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.210
And when they measured
them a year later,

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.710
the symptoms were still lower.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.190
Now, it's still too early to
know what that pilot means.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.020
But it means generally
that their experience

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.990
of their own trauma,
the sleeplessness,

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.910
the hyper-arousal,
the flash to anger

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.237
was lessened during the course.

00:22:06.237 --> 00:22:08.320
And whether or not they
practiced these techniques

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.940
afterwards, that
level of symptom

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.350
was still lower after six
months and after a year.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.360
So now, eight years later,
we've taught about 1,000 vets.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:24.000
And we are training teachers
as fast as we can, because,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.322
as I said earlier, there's
300,000 to 400,000 people

00:22:26.322 --> 00:22:28.030
walking around with
Post-Traumatic Stress

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.440
from these wars.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.940
And a lot of them don't want to
be on drugs, because the drugs

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.870
have a lot of side effects,
and they mask the symptoms,

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.370
but they don't really
cure the cause.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.175
And they don't want
to go-- especially

00:22:40.175 --> 00:22:42.050
if they're still in the
service for-- there's

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.690
a great stigma for going
for psychiatric care.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.720
So programs like these
provide an alternate way

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.480
of dealing with the
Post-Traumatic Stress.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.021
And as I said earlier,
it's something

00:22:51.021 --> 00:22:53.250
that they can do by
themselves for themselves.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:56.060
So it's a program that
the soldiers like a lot.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.470
I thought I'd teach you
maybe one of the very

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.089
preliminary forms of
breathing, if you'd

00:23:01.089 --> 00:23:02.380
like to have that demonstrated.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.330
I was just at the
Aspen Brain Forum,

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.417
and I thought I had made
it safely off the stage,

00:23:06.417 --> 00:23:09.000
and I was just ready to step off
the stage, and somebody said,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.090
can you show us one of
the forms of breathing

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.930
that the soldiers do?

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.402
So this is a form of yogic
breathing called Bhastrika.

00:23:15.402 --> 00:23:17.610
How many people would like
to learn just a little bit

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:18.380
about it?

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:18.470
OK.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.136
So sit back in your
chairs a little bit.

00:23:20.136 --> 00:23:21.650
Sit up.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.240
And we're going to breathe
in and out through the nose.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.620
This is a form of breathing
that will give you

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.578
a little bit of energy.

00:23:26.578 --> 00:23:29.497
In Southern California, it's
nicknamed the Starbucks breath.

00:23:29.497 --> 00:23:31.830
So we're going to put our
hands in baby fists like this.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.190
Yeah?

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.856
And we're going to
breathe in, and we're

00:23:33.856 --> 00:23:35.730
going to allow
our hands to go up

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.040
into what I call the
Glory Hallelujah pose.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.170
And then we're going to
grasp an imaginary bar

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.010
and breathe out through
the nose sharply.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.180
Come down.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.500
Breathe in and go up.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.290
Exhale, come down.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.780
And we'll do it in rhythm, and
we'll do maybe 10 repetitions.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.630
Should we do that?

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:53.130
OK.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:58.019
Take a normal breath in and out.

00:23:58.019 --> 00:23:59.560
Let's see if we can
do this together.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.860
Ready, begin.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.240
In, out, in, out, in, out.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.875
And put a little energy into it.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.530
And relax.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.910
Close your eyes.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.785
Take a transition breath
in through the nose.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.140
And out.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.390
And just close your eyes and
see if you feel somewhere

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.730
inside a little bit more energy
than you had 10 minutes ago.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.628
Open the eyes.

00:24:46.628 --> 00:24:48.235
You can even do
this at your cubicle

00:24:48.235 --> 00:24:50.120
if nobody thinks
you're looking too

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.760
strange in the middle
of the afternoon.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.426
Instead of going to
get a cup of coffee,

00:24:53.426 --> 00:24:55.334
you can do maybe
three sets of 15 to 20

00:24:55.334 --> 00:24:57.250
of these with a little
bit of rest in between.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.890
Not something you'd like to
go home and do for 45 minutes

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:01.460
while you're watching
TV, you know.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.620
Three sets of maybe 10 to 15.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.852
I thought maybe, too,
you'd like to experience

00:25:06.852 --> 00:25:09.060
a kind of guided meditation
that we do with the vets.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.143
Would you like to do that?

00:25:10.143 --> 00:25:11.190
OK.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.917
We'll do this for
maybe 10 to 15 minutes,

00:25:12.917 --> 00:25:15.250
and then I'll be around to
answer any questions that you

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.208
have about the program.

00:25:18.564 --> 00:25:20.980
So anyone who came in late,
if you'd have your cell phones

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.710
turned to vibrate,
that would be great.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.704
Can everybody see me OK?

00:25:25.704 --> 00:25:28.120
So all you have to do with
this guided meditation is close

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.900
your eyes and
follow instructions.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.520
Let's sit comfortably with
both our feet on the floor,

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:41.830
spine straight, palms up
on the lap, eyes closed.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.700
Let's begin by taking a normal
breath in through the nose.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.460
And out.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:26:02.180
Begin by finding ourselves
in this environment,

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:10.840
listening to all the noises
around us-- conversations

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:21.195
from the other room, the hum
of the electrical system.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.600
And feel that connection
between our body and the chair

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.308
we're sitting on.

00:27:07.439 --> 00:27:09.730
Now perhaps you're feeling
a little bit more in harmony

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.646
with your environment.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.170
Become aware of
your physical body.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.910
It may be feeling tired.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.710
It may be feeling rested.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.780
It may be feeling
a little agitated.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.445
There could be some
aches or pains or twinges

00:28:01.445 --> 00:28:05.190
in certain parts of the body.

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.320
Just be with your body
just as it is right now.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.720
Innocently, put your
awareness on your right foot.

00:28:47.906 --> 00:28:48.894
Right knee.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.402
Right thigh and hip.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:07.780
Left foot.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.540
Left knee.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.819
Left thigh and hip.

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.590
Stomach.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:42.890
Abdomen.

00:29:49.231 --> 00:29:49.730
Chest.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:58.550
Right arm.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:05.880
And shoulder.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.075
Left arm.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.440
And shoulder.

00:30:35.083 --> 00:30:35.583
Face.

00:30:41.106 --> 00:30:41.980
Between the eyebrows.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.650
Top of the head.

00:30:58.745 --> 00:30:59.245
Whole body.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.620
Allow your awareness
to flow like a river

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.120
through your whole body.

00:31:21.054 --> 00:31:26.360
The top of your head to
the soles of your feet.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.775
Through your whole body.

00:32:12.141 --> 00:32:13.390
Become aware of your thoughts.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:40.028
Positive thoughts,
negative thoughts,

00:32:40.028 --> 00:32:43.350
it doesn't much matter.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:46.150
Just watch them flow by
like they're in a river,

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:49.850
and don't try to control them
or judge them in any way.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:34.060
Underneath our thoughts,
we all have feelings.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:38.300
Allow yourself to become
aware of your feelings.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:08.350
Happy feelings, sad
feelings, anxious feelings,

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:12.323
angry feelings,
peaceful feelings.

00:34:12.323 --> 00:34:14.614
Whatever kind of feelings
are there, just observe them.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:07.260
Underneath the bodily
sensations and the thoughts

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:11.650
and the feelings, there's a
deeper place within each of us.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:18.404
Deep and silent like an ocean.

00:35:18.404 --> 00:35:21.710
Allow yourself to drop into
that deeper, silent place.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.930
In that deep, silent
place, there's

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.490
a well of peace and joy.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.575
Once again, put your
awareness on your feelings.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.070
Become aware of your thoughts.

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:23.365
Become aware of
your physical body.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.070
Take a breath in.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:50.525
And let go.

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:57.791
Begin to become aware of the
environment in which you find

00:38:57.791 --> 00:38:58.290
yourselves.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.532
Feel once again the contact
of your body with the seat

00:39:22.532 --> 00:39:23.490
that you're sitting on.

00:39:43.703 --> 00:39:47.715
Take another deep breath in.

00:39:47.715 --> 00:39:51.290
And let go.

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:52.550
Begin to stretch a little.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:56.040
You can wiggle your
fingers and your toes.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.360
Move in your chair a little bit.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.160
And taking your own time,
as much time as you need,

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.812
you can slowly and
gradually open your eyes.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.892
It was good?

00:40:35.892 --> 00:40:37.890
Great.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:39.950
I forgot to ask if there
are any vets present.

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.270
Anyone here?

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.766
So whenever I see
a vet in uniform

00:40:43.766 --> 00:40:46.390
at an airport or anywhere else,
I always take the opportunity--

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.681
although, it always embarrasses
them-- to say thank you

00:40:48.681 --> 00:40:50.890
for your service to our country.

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:53.380
I was talking to someone who
was born in a foreign country,

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:57.670
and they were trying to
decide whether they wanted

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:02.250
to contribute and
support our organization.

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.912
And they said, well, you know,
I give to my home country.

00:41:04.912 --> 00:41:06.620
I give lots of things
to my home country.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.899
And I said, well, while
you're here in Silicon Valley,

00:41:09.899 --> 00:41:11.940
it's not your home country
that's protecting you,

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.060
it's the American
servicemen and women

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.320
who have risked their lives.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.270
And coming back,
they're the people

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:19.360
that can really use our help.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.010
They've stuck their
necks out for us,

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.630
risked their lives for us.

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:26.140
And it's now time for us
to be able to help them

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.670
in whatever way we can.

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:32.422
I want to tell you just one
or two more stories from-- one

00:41:32.422 --> 00:41:34.380
came up for me during
meditation about the vets

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.970
that I've been lucky enough to
work with, and then to tell you

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.600
why I'm here at Google today.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.810
I had a Vietnam vet.

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:45.090
He wasn't in this film,
but he was a dog handler

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:47.680
in Vietnam, which meant that he
had a dog that he worked with.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.090
And they'd send the dogs
into the Viet Cong tunnels,

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:52.810
and they'd come
out the other end.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.626
And one day, he sent
his dog into a tunnel,

00:41:54.626 --> 00:41:56.250
and a whole bunch of
Viet Cong came out

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.560
the other end of the tunnel, and
they started shooting at him.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.210
He wasn't really a combatant,
but he had a weapon,

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:01.020
and he shot back.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.540
And when they did
the body count,

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:04.684
he had a special
weapon, so he knew

00:42:04.684 --> 00:42:07.100
who had been killed by other
people and who he had killed.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.600
And one of the
people he had killed,

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.167
unfortunately, was a
13-year-old Vietnamese girl.

00:42:12.167 --> 00:42:14.000
And on the last day of
this five-day course,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.440
he came up to me and he
grabbed me and he shook me,

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.090
this guy did.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:18.520
He was about 70 years old.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:21.335
And he said, she's
gone, she's gone.

00:42:21.335 --> 00:42:23.322
And I'm like, who's gone?

00:42:23.322 --> 00:42:25.280
And he said, that girl
I killed, he said, she's

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.520
been in my dreams every
night for the last 40 years.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.020
And last night was the first
night I slept through the night

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.440
and she didn't come
back in my dreams.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.980
So imagine what it would be
like to live a life like that,

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.640
and then to live a life
free of that kind of thing.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.000
Another Vietnam vet I taught,
when he did this breathing

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.060
for the first time, he
experienced a memory

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.591
that he had repressed
ever since Vietnam.

00:42:46.591 --> 00:42:48.090
He had forgotten
completely about it

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:51.292
where a hand grenade had
come down in a foxhole

00:42:51.292 --> 00:42:53.500
that he was in, and he had
thrown the hand grenade up

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.495
in the air, and saved
himself and his comrades

00:42:56.495 --> 00:42:57.120
in the process.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.794
And it exploded about
30 feet above his head.

00:42:59.794 --> 00:43:01.210
And he said, during
the breathing,

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.770
not only did he smell the
sulfur of the grenade--

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.800
I think that's sort of
an interesting fact.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.200
He said, but there was
a whole part of his mind

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.860
that had been trapped behind
this repressed memory, he said,

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.240
that started to come
out during the course.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.580
He had access to it for
the first time in 40 years.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.829
And he got actually a little
angry at the instructors.

00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:18.371
He said, where were
you 40 years ago?

00:43:18.371 --> 00:43:19.745
He said, my whole
life would have

00:43:19.745 --> 00:43:22.130
been different had I had
access to this particular part

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:23.614
of my mind.

00:43:23.614 --> 00:43:25.780
So there's a lot of people
out there waiting for us.

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.970
And a lot of people in
American corporations,

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:32.880
especially in Silicon Valley,
are taking an interest in vets.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.621
I spoke to Vets
Network at Cisco.

00:43:35.621 --> 00:43:37.870
I don't know if there's a
Vets Network here at Google.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.820
But I spoke to one, and they're
reaching out to other vets

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.720
to help other vets.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.220
And when I was at
Microsoft, they

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.565
sponsored a course in Seattle.

00:43:44.565 --> 00:43:46.440
So maybe there's some
people in this audience

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.559
that would like to help.

00:43:47.559 --> 00:43:49.100
We're a volunteer-based
organization.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.766
We don't charge the
vets for what we do,

00:43:50.766 --> 00:43:53.212
but that means we rely on
lots of different volunteers

00:43:53.212 --> 00:43:54.420
for lots of different things.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.961
So if anybody here
thinks that they'd

00:43:55.961 --> 00:43:58.100
like to get involved and
help vets, as I said,

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.060
there are 300,000
or 400,000 vets out

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.380
there who need our help.

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:04.670
And I can use the
brain power at Google,

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:08.050
I'm sure, to figure out new
ways to help reach out to them.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:11.600
I thought I'd just
save 5 or 10 minutes

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.100
to see if anybody
has any questions.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.994
And there's no question that's
impolite or too direct to ask.

00:44:15.994 --> 00:44:17.410
I'd be really
grateful if somebody

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:18.400
had a couple of
questions that they

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.840
want to ask me
about the program.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:20.339
Yeah?

00:44:20.339 --> 00:44:21.786
MALE SPEAKER: Mic please.

00:44:21.786 --> 00:44:23.160
AUDIENCE: So at
Google, we always

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.710
think about scaling things.

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:29.150
And I'm just wondering,
have you tried

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:32.520
to get this into the
out-processing process

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.994
within the military
organizations themselves?

00:44:34.994 --> 00:44:35.910
JOHN OSBORNE: We have.

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:37.780
And there's some people
at very high levels.

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.240
I mean, the head of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.960
has seen our program
and is acting about it.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.418
But if you've been
in the military,

00:44:42.418 --> 00:44:45.700
you know things don't happen
necessarily at breakneck speed.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.482
So yeah.

00:44:47.482 --> 00:44:49.440
Some people at very high
levels are aware of us

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.350
and are watching us.

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.840
It could be a little
while before they--

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.310
but in the VA, the Veterans
Administration for people

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:57.020
who have been released
from the military,

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.645
there are different
layers of treatment

00:44:58.645 --> 00:45:01.206
that are like the
layers of an onion.

00:45:01.206 --> 00:45:02.580
And the outermost
one of these is

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.121
the neighborhood Vet Centers,
which you may be familiar with.

00:45:05.121 --> 00:45:07.540
And slowly but surely,
people at these Vet Centers

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.750
are sponsoring courses
and sending their people

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:10.740
to our courses.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.040
And that's our way into the VA,
because then the VA hospitals

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.870
want to do research on us,
and then it goes straight up.

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:19.120
But it could take
a little while.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.100
That's all right.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.350
I have a little time.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:25.110
And I never thought when
we taught our first course

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:28.570
that we would have
taught 1,000 vets by now.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.230
But there's 1,000 down
and 300,000 to go,

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.230
so we have a ways to go.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.640
Scalability, there's
several factors.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.690
I know you're great at
analysis here in Google.

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:40.030
One is training teachers
who are good at working

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:42.270
with this population.

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:44.207
Vets come in not trusting
very many people.

00:45:44.207 --> 00:45:45.540
They don't trust the government.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.819
They don't trust the military.

00:45:46.819 --> 00:45:49.110
They have a really hard time
relating to civilian life,

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:51.570
because their values and
experiences are so different.

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:54.410
So you need to find teachers
that can-- especially vets.

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:56.310
And we're training
vets to be teachers now

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:58.420
who can reach out
and relate to vets.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.340
So it takes a certain amount
of skill to teach teachers.

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.090
And also, obviously,
finances are a factor,

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:06.660
because we have to not
only train teachers

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.130
but have them travel
around to where vets are.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:11.920
And access to government
resources and government

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:12.840
places.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.880
I had somebody call me--
it broke my heart-- who

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.870
was in the middle of a PTSD
residency program in a VA

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:21.090
hospital, and we couldn't
get in to teach him.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.750
He was like, I need your help.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:23.750
Please come and help me.

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:26.230
But we couldn't get access
to that particular part

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:27.320
of the program.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.900
So government access,
funds, and the ability

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.550
to train many more teachers.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.579
I think that the
vets that we teach

00:46:33.579 --> 00:46:35.370
will become the inheritors
of this program.

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:37.599
I think it will eventually
be vet-run by people

00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:38.890
who graduated from the program.

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:41.157
And I'm really
working as hard as I

00:46:41.157 --> 00:46:43.240
can to make sure that
happens as soon as possible.

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.830
AUDIENCE: The thousand you've
been able to touch and teach,

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:47.417
is it regional or global?

00:46:47.417 --> 00:46:49.250
JOHN OSBORNE: It's
interesting you say that,

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:52.380
because it started out
just in the United States.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.570
But someone made a documentary
film of us in Europe.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:59.080
It was actually about the
work of Richard Davidson, who

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.590
did our research, but it
included one of our workshops.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:05.100
And so now we're teaching all
over Europe, and especially

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.030
in Eastern Europe and
Sarajevo and places like that

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:09.330
where there's a lot of PTS.

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:12.630
And we just trained our first
two teachers in Australia.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.070
It's also been taught in Russia.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:17.680
It's also been taught
in-- it's beginning

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.570
to be taught in South
America as well.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.020
So it's beginning to be global.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.670
But right now, it's strongest
in the United States.

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:26.310
We're the ones who have the
most veterans coming back

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.730
from the latest wars.

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:31.850
AUDIENCE: So yes, also, thank
you very much for what you do.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:34.360
So my stepbrother was in Iraq.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.760
And I know for a fact
that he suffers from it.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:43.150
He hasn't been diagnosed with
PTSD, but he was a medic.

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:51.310
And I don't know how to--
I believe in my heart

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:54.930
this would help him, but I
don't know how to approach it.

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:58.484
And I was wondering if you
could speak of-- because there

00:47:58.484 --> 00:47:59.900
was themes in the
film of the vets

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:03.230
who had taken the
program of seeing it

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:08.040
as hokey and kind of-- it's
a lot of times associated

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.110
with pseudoscience, in a way.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:16.725
And how do you introduce
it to vets that are--

00:48:16.725 --> 00:48:18.475
where this is a
completely new thing and--

00:48:18.475 --> 00:48:19.345
JOHN OSBORNE: And
they're skeptical.

00:48:19.345 --> 00:48:19.690
Right.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:20.190
Yeah.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:21.655
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:21.655 --> 00:48:23.950
JOHN OSBORNE: First is that
they can go to the website.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.220
They can see this
film for themselves.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:29.190
And secondly, we can put them,
if they write into the website,

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.334
in touch with a vet
who's taken the course.

00:48:31.334 --> 00:48:33.000
And there's something
about vets talking

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.220
to vets which has
instant credibility.

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.830
This fellow Roger,
the one who said,

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:39.100
I don't know how it works,
I don't know why it works,

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.230
we sent him around.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:42.630
And he just went to a
Vets Center in Texas

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:45.310
and sat in to a vets
support group, and said,

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:46.940
my name's Roger,
I'm a Vietnam vet,

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:48.830
I used to be on 20
different medications,

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:50.420
I'm not on any
medications anymore.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.490
And they're like,
where do I sign up?

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:54.040
So vets have a lot
of credibility.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.200
And if we can put him
in touch with one who's

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.234
taken the course,
they trust each other.

00:48:58.234 --> 00:48:59.900
They don't trust very
much else in life,

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.140
but they trust each other.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.530
So either the website.

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:06.684
Or I have business cards if you
want to get in touch with me,

00:49:06.684 --> 00:49:08.350
I'll put him in direct
touch with a vet.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:11.197
But there has to be at least
a little interest on his part.

00:49:11.197 --> 00:49:13.780
Just if you tell them they can
get off their drugs-- what they

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:15.238
don't tell you
about these drugs is

00:49:15.238 --> 00:49:16.820
that they have
many side effects.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.980
Some people have been on
them for 30 or 40 years.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.740
And one of them is
sexual dysfunction.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.640
They don't talk about it much,
but if you can get them off--

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.806
you know, if they think
they can get off those drugs

00:49:24.806 --> 00:49:27.816
and have a life again,
it's pretty motivating.

00:49:27.816 --> 00:49:29.550
AUDIENCE: You
thought that it was

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.912
a wonderful way of
servicing people who

00:49:31.912 --> 00:49:32.990
were returning from war.

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:34.504
How did you get into meditation?

00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:35.670
JOHN OSBORNE: Way back when?

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:36.602
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:36.602 --> 00:49:39.102
JOHN OSBORNE: I was teaching a
program called Outward Bound.

00:49:39.102 --> 00:49:40.810
Some of you may know
about Outward Bound.

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:43.140
But it's a program of take
people out in the wilderness

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.817
and develop skills, you know,
self-confidence, and things.

00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:47.650
And I was teaching kids
from the inner city,

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:50.090
and it was a really
high-stress situation.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:53.490
And we didn't have any time off,
and the kids were demanding,

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:56.700
and you're pretty exhausted
all the time in a wilderness

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.310
environment keeping them safe.

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:01.100
And I noticed that
one of my colleagues

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.320
had more energy than I did.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.799
His sense of humor
was indestructible.

00:50:04.799 --> 00:50:05.840
He gave more to the kids.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:06.680
He got more back.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.120
And so it being the '60s, I
took him aside and asked him

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.020
what drug he was on, you
know, what he was doing.

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.180
And he said, it's this
thing that I do twice a day

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.640
for 20 minutes, this meditation.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.460
And I said, that
sounds really weird.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.100
And if it sounds weird in 2010,
it sounded much stranger back

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.482
in the late-60s.

00:50:22.482 --> 00:50:23.940
And then he did
something for which

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:25.120
I'll be forever
grateful, because he

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:25.700
was a really good friend.

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.057
He put his arm on my shoulder.

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:28.390
He says, I know it sounds weird.

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:31.395
He said, but for my sake,
he said, check it out.

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:33.270
And that was in the
summer before my freshman

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.936
year in college.

00:50:33.936 --> 00:50:36.660
Luckily, I found a meditation
instructor that year,

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:39.330
my freshman year in college, and
I started because of my friend.

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:42.250
And that's how I started,
and it went on from there.

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:43.750
AUDIENCE: The
courses you mentioned

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:45.320
are really for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.870
What about for the civilians?

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:48.500
Like, I'm really
interested in starting

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.930
on the path of meditation.

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:53.930
I agree that in the 15
minutes, I am more calmer.

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.580
When I stepped into this
room, I was very anxious

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.420
about a lot of things.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.576
I am way more calmer, and
I feel that, you know,

00:51:00.576 --> 00:51:03.660
I have certain solutions
to my issues now.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.410
So I'm really wondering, how
can I get introduced to it

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:07.732
and kind of pursue it?

00:51:07.732 --> 00:51:09.690
JOHN OSBORNE: There's
many kinds of meditation.

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:12.023
I understand you already have
meditation and mindfulness

00:51:12.023 --> 00:51:13.670
being taught here.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:16.830
This breathing meditation
is an especially powerful

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:20.170
introductory version of
meditation or introduction

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:21.530
to meditation.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:23.430
For people like
the vets, something

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:26.116
as subtle as mindfulness
is beyond their grasp.

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:27.740
But the breathing
meditation brings you

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.065
to a very, very deep
place very quickly.

00:51:30.065 --> 00:51:32.440
And you're lucky that you have
some people in Google that

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.070
actually teach that
form of meditation.

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:36.240
One of them's right
over there, Mark Ball.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:40.871
He's one of my-- I respect
Mark's teaching more than many,

00:51:40.871 --> 00:51:42.120
many other people that I know.

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.830
You're very lucky to
have him at Google.

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:45.825
And I believe he offers courses
in this breathing meditation.

00:51:45.825 --> 00:51:46.530
Is that right?

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:47.230
MARK BALL: Yes.

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:47.870
JOHN OSBORNE: Periodically.

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:49.360
So see Mark if
you're interested.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.590
We do teach civilians.

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:54.225
I teach a program that
teaches in corporations.

00:51:54.225 --> 00:51:56.350
I've taught at Harvard
Business School and Wharton.

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:58.170
And a lot of people
are understanding now

00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:03.820
that the greatest resource that
any company like Google has

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.684
is the resource that's in here.

00:52:06.684 --> 00:52:08.850
And we don't always have
full access to that, right?

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:10.360
You didn't have full
access to that resource

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.280
when you walked in here today,
right, because of your anxiety

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.080
and whatever.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.680
So whatever a company can do
to maximize people's access

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.320
to that resource
is going to show up

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.110
in many, many ways for the
benefit of the company.

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:23.347
So when I'm not teaching
vets, sometimes I

00:52:23.347 --> 00:52:24.930
teach people in
corporate environments

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:26.269
around the country.

00:52:26.269 --> 00:52:28.060
Once again, I'd like
to thank [? Ruchica ?]

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:30.650
and her colleagues and everybody
at Google for having me

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:31.180
here today.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.130
Thank you very much.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:35.180
[APPLAUSE]
