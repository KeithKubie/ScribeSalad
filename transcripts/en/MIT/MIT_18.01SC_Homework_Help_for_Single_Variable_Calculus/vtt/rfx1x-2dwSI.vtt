JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.150
Welcome to recitation.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.840
In lecture you've learned
how to compute derivatives

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.900
of polynomials,
and you've learned

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.050
the relationship between
derivatives and tangents lines.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.340
So let's do a quick example that
puts those two ideas together.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.450
So here I have a
question on the board:

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.840
compute the tangent
line to the curve y

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.710
equals x cubed minus
x at the point (2, 6).

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.210
So why don't you
take a minute, work

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.559
on that yourself, pause
the video, we'll come back

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.600
and we'll do it together.

00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:39.190
All right.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.170
Welcome back.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.510
So we have this function,
y equals x cubed minus x.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.270
Let's just draw a
quick sketch of it.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:57.760
So looks to me like it has
zeros at 0, 1, minus 1.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.860
And it sort of does something
like this in between.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.070
Very rough sketch there.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.820
And way over-- well, OK.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.060
We'll call that
the point (2, 6).

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.560
Feel a little sketchy,
but all right.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.060
OK.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.220
So we want to know
what the tangent line

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.270
to the curve at that point is.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.440
So in order to do that, we need
to know what its derivative is,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.050
and then that'll
give us the slope.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.799
And then with the
slope, we have the slope

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.930
and we have a point,
so we can slap

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.320
that into, say, your
point-slope formula for a line.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.150
So, all right, so the derivative
of this function is y prime.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.940
So, OK, so here we have
a sum of two things,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.810
and they're both powers of x.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.060
And so we learned
our rules for a power

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.440
of x that the
derivative of x to the n

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.510
is n times x to the n minus 1.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.640
And so we also learned
that the derivative

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.470
of a sum of two things is
the sum of the derivatives.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.230
So in this case, so the
derivative of x cubed

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.076
minus x is 3 x squared minus 1.

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:08.576
OK.

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:13.480
So this is the slope of
the function in terms of x.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.840
But in order to compute
the tangent line,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.035
we need the slope at the
particular point in question.

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:20.535
Right?

00:02:20.535 --> 00:02:22.120
This is really important.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.870
So we aren't going to use 3 x
squared plus 1 as our slope.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.780
Right?

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.750
We want the slope at
the point x equals 2.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.250
Right?

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.030
OK.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.100
So what we want for the
slope of the tangent line

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.640
is y prime of 2.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.410
Right?

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.050
We want it at this point
when x is equal to 2.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.155
So that's equal to, well, 3
times 2 squared is 12, minus 1

00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:47.655
is 11.

00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:01.180
So this is the slope, this is
the slope of the tangent line.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.310
I just want to say this
one more time for emphasis.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.690
This is a really
common mistake that we

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.500
see on lots of homework and
exams when teaching calculus.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.460
You have to remember
that when you compute

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.390
the slope of the tangent line,
you compute the derivative

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.980
and then you need to
plug in the value of x

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.160
at the point in question.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.620
Or the value of x and y.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.970
You know, you need to plug
in the values of the point

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.380
that you have.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.410
So here, the derivative
is 3 x squared minus 1,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.760
so the slope at the
point (2, 6) is 11.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.240
It's just a number.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.940
The slope at that point
is that particular number.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.910
OK, so now, to compute
the tangent line,

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.950
we have a point, (2, 6),
and we have a slope, 11.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.400
So we can plug into
point-slope form.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:11.572
So the equation of the-- on
the-- tangent line is y minus 6

00:04:11.572 --> 00:04:16.107
is equal to 11 times x minus 2.

00:04:16.107 --> 00:04:16.870
Right?

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.340
So it's y minus y_0 is equal
to the slope times x minus x_0.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.530
If you like, some
people prefer to write

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.209
their equations of their
lines in slope-intercept form.

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:30.000
So if you wanted to do
that, you could just

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.500
multiply through by 11 and then
bring the constants together.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.680
So we could say, or
y equals 11x-- well,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.050
we get minus 22
plus 6 is minus 16.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.540
So either of those is
a perfectly good answer

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.720
to the question.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.410
So that's that.
