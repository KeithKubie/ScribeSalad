00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150
 
 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.590
 
now we know one of the great discoveries

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600
now we know one of the great discoveries
 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.930
now we know one of the great discoveries
of our time is that there are limits to

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940
of our time is that there are limits to
 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.330
of our time is that there are limits to
what we can take out and what we can put

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340
what we can take out and what we can put
 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.820
what we can take out and what we can put
in without dire consequences to the

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830
in without dire consequences to the
 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.430
in without dire consequences to the
nature of the ocean thus to the

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440
nature of the ocean thus to the
 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.409
nature of the ocean thus to the
underpinnings of what makes life

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419
underpinnings of what makes life
 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:03.510
underpinnings of what makes life
possible from us

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520
 
 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.629
 
now that we know we can do what it takes

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639
now that we know we can do what it takes
 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.119
now that we know we can do what it takes
to reverse the troubling trends to treat

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:09.129
to reverse the troubling trends to treat
 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:12.350
to reverse the troubling trends to treat
the ocean as if our lives depend on it

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360
the ocean as if our lives depend on it
 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:22.519
the ocean as if our lives depend on it
because they do

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:22.529
 
 

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:32.190
 
you

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:32.200
 
 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.260
 
you
