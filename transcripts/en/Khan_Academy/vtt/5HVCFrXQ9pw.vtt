00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.350
What I want to do in this video
is explore how trade

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.150
imbalances, in theory, should be
resolved by freely floating

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.150
currencies.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.400
So let's just say in the
beginning of our time period,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.560
like we did in the last video,
that the exchange rate between

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.200
the Chinese yuan and the
U.S. dollar is 10:1.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.480
So we have 10 yuan.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.220
So the last time people traded
these currencies, they

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.950
exchanged 10 yuan for
1 U.S. dollar.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.030
And, when I say, dollar, I'm
going to implicitly mean the

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.170
U.S. dollar.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.410
Now, let's think about two
entrepreneurs in each of the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.500
countries, or one in each
of the countries.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.110
So let's talk about a Chinese
entrepreneur.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.840
So we are in China here,
and he makes dolls.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.400
And in order to profitably sell
a doll, he needs to sell

00:00:49.400 --> 00:01:00.120
them for 10 yuan.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.890
If he's able to sell for the
equivalent of 10 yuan in the

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.480
United States-- and we won't
talk a lot about shipping and

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.840
what currency you'd have to pay
and all of that-- then he

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.910
can pay all of his needs.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.600
Maybe even the shippers across
the Pacific, maybe their

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.190
employees are also Chinese.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.490
So they want their
money in yuan.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.530
And, obviously, most of
the cost would be for

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.040
manufacturing this doll.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.440
And all of his employees want
to be paid in yuan.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.560
His own rent for the factory,
or even his own rent for his

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.250
own house, all has to
be paid in yuan.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.110
So this is what he needs to sell
his doll for, 10 yuan.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.050
And at the current exchange
rate, that would be $1.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.890
Now, let's go across
the Pacific.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.130
Let's go to the United States.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.330
And let's say that we have
another entrepreneur who is

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.770
making soda, or making
cola, for export.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.200
So let me draw a can of cola.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.720
And similar to this guy in
China, he needs to sell his

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.080
product abroad for the
equivalent of $1, so that it

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.600
can cover shipping costs,
manufacturing costs, and the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.460
high fructose corn syrup,
and all of that.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.380
And once again, he cares
about dollars.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.810
Because he has to pay his
own mortgage in dollars.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.360
His employees need to
be paid in dollars.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.980
Maybe the shippers he used,
they only accept dollars.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.850
So this is how both of these
characters think about it.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:36.910
Now, at the current exchange
rate, let's say that there's a

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.030
demand for 100 dolls in
the United States.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.060
This guy is exporting.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.470
And so is this guy.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.760
We'll make it very simple.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.810
They're only focused
on exports.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:55.490
So at current exchange-- and
I'll do it for both-- for the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:07.770
doll guy, there is demand
for 100 dolls

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.330
in the United States.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.190
So what does that mean?

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.450
That means that if he can sell
these dolls for $1, which is

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.890
equivalent to 10 yuan, then
there's going to be 100 people

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.420
in some time period, let's say
it's a year or month, who are

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.310
going to be willing to buy
the dolls at that price.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.140
And let's say, also at this
current exchange rate, in

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.160
China, 50 people are willing
to buy this cola.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.045
So at the current exchange
rate, demand

00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:41.180
for 50 cans in China.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.910
Obviously, these are
ridiculously low numbers.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.170
But we're just dealing
with simple

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.690
numbers to help our thinking.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.980
Let me write the at current
exchange rate as well.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.230
So what we're saying is that, in
China, he needs to get $1.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.040
At the exchange rate,
that's 10 yuan.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.460
So if he were to, at a store in
China, or to a distributor

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.540
in China maybe, sell each of
these cans for 10 yuan,

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.190
there's demand for
50 cans in China.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.320
Now, what's going
to happen here?

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.570
I think some of you all might
already see that a trade

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.090
imbalance is developing.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.520
So what's going to
happen here?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.170
So this guy, he likes
doing this.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.120
And this guy like doing it.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.269
So what's going to happen in
this time period, this Chinese

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:32.850
guy is going to ship over 100
dolls to the United States.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.820
Let me write this down.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.370
This is China.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.090
This is the U.S. over here.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.730
And what's the U.S.
going to do?

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:46.890
Well, the U.S. is going to ship
over-- remember, he's

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.560
selling this in the
United States.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.460
So each 10 yuan is $1.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.520
So for each doll, he's
going to get $1.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.110
So he's going to
get back $100.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.080
He is going to get back
$100 for his dolls.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.300
And then once he gets back $100
for his dolls, he's going

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.290
to want to convert
them into yuan.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:25.130
So then he will try to convert
the $100 into yuan.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.420
So this is what'll end up
happening for this guy.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.990
And let's say these are the
only two people trading

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.840
between China and the United
States, just to really

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.940
simplify things.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.120
Now let's think about
what happens on the

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.850
right side over here.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:44.320
This guy is going to ship
50 cola cans to China.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.850
He is going to ship 50
of them to China

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.420
from the United States.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.550
And what is he going to
get back in return?

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.050
Well, it's being sold to
Chinese distributors.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.040
So they're going to
pay him in yuan.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.410
So for each can, at the current
exchange rate, or at

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.730
the current price, he's
going to get 10 yuan.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.980
So when you convert it
back, he's going to

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.960
get 10 yuan per can.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:18.060
So 10 yuan times
50 is 500 yuan.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.270
500 yuan is what he's
going to get.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.520
And then, he's going to try to
convert-- let me write that in

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.230
a different color just really
for the sake of it.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.980
So he's going to try to convert,
because he has to pay

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:43.350
his expenses his dollars, his
500 yuan into-- Now, what's

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.830
the exchange rate that he
wants to, his goal is?

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.780
To cover his costs, he
has to get 10:1.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:55.170
So 500 yuan into $50.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.120
And let me make it clear.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.060
This guy thinks he's going to
get 10 yuan for every dollar.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.920
So he wants to convert his
$100 into 1,000 yuan.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.710
Let me write it here.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.570
1,000.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.820
I should have written
it over here.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.070
So what just set up?

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.960
If these are the only people
trading goods and currency in

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.030
this time period, what
did we just set up?

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.380
Well, clearly, this guy is
shipping more value to the

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.050
U.S. than this guy is
shipping to China.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.370
There's a trade imbalance.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.460
If you think of it in terms of
dollars, this guy is shipping

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.910
$100 worth of goods to the U.S.
This guy is only shipping

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.110
$50 worth of goods to China.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.710
So there's a net trade
imbalance of $50.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.890
China is shipping $50 more to
the U.S. Then, the other way

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.100
around, if you think about it
in yuan, it would be a trade

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.290
imbalance of 500 yuan.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.830
And because of that, this guy is
trying to convert many more

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.680
dollars into yuan than this guy
is trying to convert the

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.710
other way around.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:08:05.440
Notice there is more demand
for yuan than dollars.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.550
What's going to happen,
especially if these are the

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.980
only two people trading?

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.390
If these are the only two people
trading, this guy is

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.000
going to say, hey,
I've got 10 yuan.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.300
Let me convert it
into dollars.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.940
It'll be just like what we
saw in the last video.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.710
And, obviously, there'll
be more actors here.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.760
But this guy has more stuff
to convert than this guy.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.250
In fact, if these were the only
two people trading, he

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.980
wouldn't even be able to
convert all of his

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.460
currency into yuan.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.070
Because there's only 500 yuan
available on the market.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.250
This guy thinks he should
get 1,000 yuan.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.460
And, obviously, if the price
of the yuan goes up, like

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.870
we've seen in the previous
video, maybe there will be

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.840
more people who want to convert
yuan, or maybe fewer

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.350
people who'd want to
convert dollars.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:45.870
So we can think about
all of those.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.510
But I really want to think
about how this will

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.580
potentially resolve the
trade imbalance.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.350
So we have a situation
with more demand

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.520
for yuan than dollars.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.220
There's a demand for
1,000 yuan here.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.250
There's only 500 yuan
being sold.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.040
Or you could view it
the other way.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.180
There's only demand for $50.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.810
And there's $100 being sold.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.060
Either way there's
an imbalance.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.540
So what's going to happen?

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.730
Well, you're going to have
either, depending on how you

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.680
want to view it-- you could
say that the price of the

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.250
dollar will go down.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:32.720
Or you could say that the price
of the yuan will go up.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.300
And the dynamics would be like
we saw in the last video.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.540
This guy over here would sell
a couple of his yuan.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.980
And he'd say, wow, there's this
guy over there who really

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.010
wants to buy it.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:48.930
And then maybe he'll keep
saying, instead of giving me a

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.210
dollar for every 10 of my yuan,
why don't you give me a

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.710
dollar for every 9 of my yuan?

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.410
Or eventually, why don't you
give me a dollar for every 8

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.260
of my yuan?

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.320
And so he'll keep raising
the price of the yuan.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.730
He'll keep giving fewer
and fewer yuans

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.750
for each of the dollar.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.190
Let's say this goes on
for a little bit.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.620
And I really want to explore
the trade imbalance.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.130
Let's say at some point-- and,
obviously, maybe more and more

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.110
people come into the market.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.150
So, eventually, it clears.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.210
Because, right now,
there isn't enough

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.350
yuan for this guy.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.900
But as you can see, the price
of the yuan goes up.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.740
So after all of this, because
of this trade imbalance,

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.870
because more people want to
convert dollars into yuan than

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.170
yuan into dollars, the
currency changes.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.330
So you could imagine-- and I'm
just going to make up some

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.710
numbers here-- that the yuan
becomes more expensive.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.320
It was 10 yuan to the
dollar, now maybe it

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.245
is 8 yuan to dollar.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.190
So this is where we
get to eventually.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.460
Because of this supply demand
imbalance right over here.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.720
8 yuan to a dollar.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.080
Now, what's the reality
over here?

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.700
This guy over here needs to sell
his dolls for 10 yuan,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.630
which before was the
equivalent of $1.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.640
But now how much is he going
to sell his yuan for?

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.450
He needs to sell for 10 yuan.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.460
That's 8 yuan per dollar.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.740
So let's think about how much
his dolls cost. So his dolls,

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.030
in the U.S., now that the
yuan has appreciated,

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.895
they were 10 yuan.

00:11:19.895 --> 00:11:28.820
And then, times-- we have
$1 for every 8 yuan.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.030
So this is going to be equal
to the yuans cancel out.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.250
This is really just dimensional
analysis you might

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.470
have learned in chemistry.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.840
So 10 over 8 is what?

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.480
That's 1 and 1/4.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.400
This is $1.25.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.330
Notice the price of his dolls
went up in the United States

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.410
in terms of dollars.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.830
And let's think about what
happened to the cola

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:56.330
manufacturer right over here.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.970
So his costs, or the price he
needs to sell them for are $1.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.010
And now what's the
exchange rate?

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.650
Let me write it the other way,
because I need to cancel out

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.250
the dollars.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:14.830
We have 8 yuan for every $1.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:15.420
Dollars cancel out.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.550
8 times 1.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:23.770
His selling price in China
will now be 8 yuan.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.580
So notice, neither of these
people changed their prices in

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.090
terms of their home currency.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.190
No change in price at all.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.850
But because of the currency
movements, because the yuan

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:39.410
became more expensive, the
Chinese manufacturer's goods

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.450
are now more expensive
in dollars.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.260
And the American manufacturer's
goods are now

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.700
less expensive in yuan.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.940
So what's going to happen?

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.760
What's going to happen here?

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.300
At $1, there was a demand
for 100 dolls

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.290
in the United States.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:57.020
But now that the price has gone
up to $1.25, there will

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:07.720
only be demand at this higher
price for 50 dolls in the

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.620
United States.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.050
And let's say this
guy over here.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.500
Before, there was demand for 50
cans of his cola in China

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.380
because it was 10 yuan.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.000
But now, the price
has gone down.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.420
So, now, you can imagine that
there is demand, or actually I

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:26.060
should say there's demand
for 50 dolls.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.430
And, now, because this guy's
price has gone down, instead

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.140
of demand for 50 cans, maybe
there's demand for-- and I'll

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.590
just make up a number--
80 cans.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.935
Maybe there's now demand
for 80 cans.

00:13:36.935 --> 00:13:39.220
So what just happened to
the trade imbalance?

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.680
Before, in terms of either
currency, we were buying more

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.590
dolls, if you think about from
the U.S. perspective, and

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.100
shipping fewer cola.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.310
But now, we're buying fewer
dolls, because it's now more

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.210
expensive in the
United States.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.000
And we're shipping more cola.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.860
So I don't even know how
this math works.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.200
I'm going to let you
figure that out.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.830
But as one currency gets more
and more expensive, those

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.690
exports, the demand for those
exports from those countries,

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.940
are going to go down, like
we saw with these dolls.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.400
And on the other side, as the
other currency gets cheaper

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.030
and cheaper and cheaper,
the demand for those

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.050
exports will go up.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.820
Because, in other currencies,
it will look cheaper.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.060
And, eventually, you
should have some

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.450
type of trade balance.
