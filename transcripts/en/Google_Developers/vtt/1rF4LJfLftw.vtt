TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.150
I'm Timothy Jordan
coming to you this week

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.325
from our New York office.

00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:06.450
Here's your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.617
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:10.950
Getting the best results out
of a machine learning model

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.410
requires that you truly
understand your data.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.140
However, ML datasets
can contain hundreds

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.990
of millions of data points,
each consisting of hundreds

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.036
or even thousands of features.

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:22.410
Working with the
PAIR initiative,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.040
we've released Facets, an
open source visualization tool

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.820
to aid in understanding
and analyzing ML datasets.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.310
For more details and some
very cool screenshots,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.980
head on over to the post linked
in the description below.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.120
The 2017 Conference on Computer
Vision and Pattern Recognition

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.994
happened in Hawaii this week.

00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:42.660
But don't worry if
you couldn't make it.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.201
You can learn more
about the research

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:47.280
we presented from this post.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.760
Last year, we introduced Open
Images, a collaborative release

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.850
of about 9 million images
annotated with labels spanning

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.300
over 6,000 object
categories designed

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.330
to be a useful dataset for
machine learning research.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.430
We just introduced
an update to Open

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.099
Images, which contains the
addition of about 2 million

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.710
bounding boxes to
the existing dataset,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.170
along with several million
additional image-level labels.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.690
More details and a link to
the GitHub are on the post.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.400
Given the benefits
of Strong Mode

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.220
and the large number of
users already using it,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.890
we have decided to make
Strong Mode the standard type

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.810
system for Dart.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.760
This will happen
in three phases--

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.180
Strong Mode is opt in,
Strong Mode is the default,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.730
and Strong Mode
is the only mode.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.530
For details on how
we are making sure

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.780
that you have a smooth
transition to the new type

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.500
system, check out the post.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.580
We recently introduced
bolder warnings

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.680
to inform users about
newly created web

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.900
apps and app scripts
for the G Suite

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.820
that are pending verification.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.320
In the coming
months, we'll begin

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.470
expanding the verification
process and the new warnings

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.420
to existing apps as well.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.580
For screenshots and
tips on getting ready,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.560
take a look at the post.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.930
With Cloud Spanner,
you have direct access

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.230
to a horizontally scaling,
cloud native infrastructure that

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.640
provides global transactions.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.570
Think apps that involve
payments, inventory, ticketing,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.790
or even financial trading.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.070
Thanks to the Google
Cloud Platform free trial

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.120
that offers $300 and credits
for one year and this guide,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.320
you can get your feet wet with
Cloud Spanner in five minutes.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.930
We recently introduced
Transfer Appliance.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.840
With a capacity of up to
1-petabyte compressed,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.810
it helps you migrate your
data to Google Cloud Platform

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.200
orders of magnitude faster
than over a typical network.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.350
Simply fill this rackable,
high capacity storage server

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.650
from your data center
and then ship it to us.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.590
And we'll upload your data
to Google Cloud Storage.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.000
More details are on the post.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.049
Please remember to like,
subscribe, and share.

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:48.840
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.760
And I'll see you next week.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.300
Thanks for joining me this
week from New York City.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.520
If you'd like to catch some
of the previous episodes

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.640
of The Developer Show,
they're right over here.
