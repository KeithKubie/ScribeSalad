00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.080
In this unit you'll cover videos
from a couple different courses.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.830
You'll look at some videos from
Sebastian Rune's Introduction to

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.080
Machine Learning course,
produced here at Udacity.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.750
And you'll also look at some videos from
Georgia Tech's Machine Learning course

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.930
with Charles Isabelle and
Michael Litman.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.740
Along the way you'll cover several
methods for doing supervised learning

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.590
like neural networks, ensemble learning,
regression, classification.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.110
These are different ways of
approaching supervised learning.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.790
One of the main learning goals here is
to be able to evaluate those different

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.490
methods and test whether or
not they're the best idea for

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.560
a certain incoming data set.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.360
And so those are really the two
dual learning goals for this unit.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.730
We want you to understand how to apply
these methods, but we also want you to

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.690
understand how to evaluate when
you should apply each method.
