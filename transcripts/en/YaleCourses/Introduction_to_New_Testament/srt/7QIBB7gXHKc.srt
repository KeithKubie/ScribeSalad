1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,200
The chronological end of the Old Testament
Hebrew Bible takes place in the sixth

2
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:11,820
century BCE that is in
the five hundreds BCE.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,210
I say the chronological end of the text
is that because that's actually not the

4
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:22,320
latest that our literature comes from a,
it's just, that's the end of the story.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,000
What happens basically is that, uh,
the Jews are taken out of Judea,

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,290
they're taken into captivity,
or at least the upperclass is in Babylon,

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,770
and then they wait 70 years.
And in that brought,

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,600
they're allowed to come back into Judea
to rebuild the temple and the walls of

9
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:43,110
Jerusalem. And it's the rebuilding
of the material, the tear,

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,680
the temple and the walls of Jerusalem
that are narrated in the books,

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,000
Ezra and Nehemiah.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,290
But then that's kind of where
the story of the Jews are.

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,730
The Israelites ends, uh, at the
end of the sixth century BCE.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,080
That's not actually the latest document
because as we'll talk about a little bit

15
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:04,620
later today, the book of Daniel,
which claims of course to be,

16
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:08,880
to be written in Babylon,
Babylonian captivity, but also, uh,

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,250
by a guy named Daniel who
lived in the sixth century.

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,840
It's actually not written then.

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,680
It's written around the year one 64 BCE.

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,660
So that's the latest document that we
have that's in the Hebrew Bible or the Old

21
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,560
Testament. So there's a difference in
the actual timing of the documents. Uh,

22
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:27,300
and the chronological end of the story,

23
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,710
I'll remind you of what we talked about
last time with Alexander the Great,

24
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:36,350
just very briefly, Alexander the great,
remember wanting to set up a oneworld,

25
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,000
a unify, a universal empire. He,

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,980
he taught us sort of syncretism
of religion. He taught a
common language, Greek,

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,520
he set up these Greek cities all around
these things will all be very important

28
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:51,630
for us. Uh, in that process that we
call is what we call Hellenization.

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,250
So the Hellenization of the world in
that time means that we even call that

30
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:59,400
period Hellenistic Greek,
the Hellenistic period,

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,490
to differentiate it from
classical Greek period,

32
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,120
say classical Athens in the fifth
and sixth and fifth century,

33
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,840
and then the Greco Roman period,
which will come later the period of Rome.

34
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,240
The reason Hellenism is so important for
us is because Alexander what happened

35
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:16,680
to us in power after he died,

36
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,470
after much confusion and fighting among
his major generals, uh, after his death,

37
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,480
Alexander's kingdom ended up being
divided up into four major empires.

38
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,990
For our purposes,
only three of those really matter.

39
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,590
And on your handout you'll see the name
Salukis and Antiochus and the solutions.

40
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,980
Salukis was one of the
generals of Alexander and he
ended up getting the part of

41
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:46,350
his empire that had been Babylonia.

42
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,130
That is modern day Iraq and Syria.

43
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,640
And what happens is you'll find over and
over again, that's an a man named Lucas.

44
00:02:56,641 --> 00:03:00,690
We'll have a kid named maybe Antiochus
who I'll have a kid named Lucas who,

45
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,180
Alvin cadamen ticas. The solutions
was what we call their dynasty,

46
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,270
their family name.
They tended to use those two names.

47
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,740
Salukis Lucas and entire cuss a lot. So
you'll see just Salukis the first, second,

48
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,720
third, and Ticus the first,
second, third and forth.

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,540
Those two names were used quite in
their family over and over again.

50
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,080
So it gets very confusing and historical
literature when it's hard to keep them

51
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:25,050
straight. But that's the reason his
general Ptolemy, the second, uh,

52
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,880
got the kingdom of Egypt,
which was very,

53
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:31,660
very important because Egypt was one
of the wealthiest parts of the ancient

54
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:33,850
world.
So Ptolemy,

55
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:38,851
the second t took Egypt and set up his
own sort of Greco Egyptian kingdom there.

56
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,070
So when we talk about these things,
sometimes you'll,

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,150
you'll hear us talk about
the Syrian empire or the
Greco steer empower or simply

58
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:47,110
the Greek empire.

59
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,700
That's because there was a Greek sort
of the near over what would have been

60
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:56,020
local differences. So you'd have Egyptian
speaking ancient Egyptian languages,

61
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,260
but the elites in the cities would
be speaking Greek. So the culture,

62
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,200
the elite culture was to be Greek.
And the same way in Syria,

63
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,900
Tommy's are easier to keep
straight because they tended
to all be named Ptolemy.

64
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,900
And so they might have
a nickname like Ptolemy.

65
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:14,140
Philadelphia is a very famous one, but
then they get, we give them numbers.

66
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,500
So Ptolemy, the second was the first
general who ruled Egypt and then his, uh,

67
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,970
assets is DC. Um, descendants would
be named second, third, fourth,

68
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,800
and that sort of that so forth.

69
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,720
The other empire that was important but
will not talk about it too much today is

70
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,180
what was Macedonia and Greece itself.

71
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,190
And the general antagonists Gennady us
was the one who took that and that would

72
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:39,760
be its own sort of area until the Romans,
uh,

73
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,970
defeated the different Greek rulers
there and took over Macedonia and Greece.

74
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,990
What's important for us though,

75
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:51,790
it was really the solutions and the
Ptolemies because if you draw a line

76
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,130
separating Syria from Egypt,
the line goes right through Palestine.

77
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,290
The Jews were kind of caught
therefore on the border. So Judea,

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,940
uh, at this time was on the border
between these two empires and they were

79
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:11,560
constantly fighting,
trying to aggrandize their own kingdoms.

80
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,820
The Jews were often therefore caught
right in the middle and tie cost.

81
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:21,821
The fourth epiphany's rain
from one 75 to one 64 BCE,

82
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,830
he's called the fourth obviously
cause he's in the fourth of Antiochus.

83
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,990
Epiphanes though is a sort of
nickname and it means manifest.

84
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,340
It's just a Greek word for manifest.

85
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,350
But what Antiochus was doing with this
name is saying he was claiming divine

86
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:41,080
honors for himself because what
he's saying is, I'm in Tacos.

87
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,090
God made manifest among you.
This was not that unusual.

88
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,020
Uh, as I said last time, Alexander had
sort of claimed divine honors from self.

89
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,070
He was following the lead of a lot of
eastern monarchs and rulers who would

90
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:57,260
claim to be the descendants of a god
and claim to be a god themselves would

91
00:05:57,261 --> 00:06:01,670
receive cult and worship. And Taika is
the fourth though was ruling at this time.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,410
And he had control. He
gained control of Judea. He,

93
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:10,040
at one point, he almost conquered
Egypt. As a matter of fact, he, again,

94
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,910
there were always these battles,
but then Rome intervene.

95
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,670
Rome was not in control of the
eastern Mediterranean at this time,

96
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,490
but they started getting
more and more powerful.

97
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:23,480
So Rome came to Egypt and a
Roman general basically said,

98
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,110
you've got to withdraw and forced and
Tacos to forth to pull out of Egypt.

99
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,460
Why did Rome do that?

100
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,410
While Rome wanted Rome didn't want any
other empire in the Mediterranean to get

101
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:35,180
too powerful.
So they wanted small,

102
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,550
they didn't want to really control all
the eastern part of that train at this

103
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:39,320
time.
They would have been stretched too thin,

104
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,910
but they wanted these two kingdoms to
balance each other out. So they didn't,

105
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,980
they weren't particularly for,
and Tacos the fourth,

106
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,120
they just didn't want him to destroy the
Egyptian Ptolemies and him to take over,

107
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,760
eat it because it would make
him too powerful. So Ron,

108
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:57,150
those shows that they have enough power
that they can kind of, uh, play, uh,

109
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,980
the referee, uh, between different
kingdoms, even in the east of this time.

110
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,750
What, while Judea though
was under Antiochus control,

111
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,400
a lot of Jews tried to figure out how
do you deal with this whole process of

112
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:12,500
Hellenization.
In other words,

113
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,790
if you want your own kids to get ahead
in the world in this time and you're

114
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,330
going to have an elite family
yourself and a town and a city,

115
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,170
it makes sense for your kids to get a
Greek education. You want your sons,

116
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:27,560
for example, to be able to speak
and read and write Greek. Why?

117
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:30,260
Because that's the Lingua
Franca of the elite,

118
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,100
of the business and of government and
all that sort of thing is precisely the

119
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:36,890
way it is now with English
around the world. Uh,

120
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,000
elite families want their kids
to have English education.

121
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,690
They want them to be familiar with
American culture. And if possible,

122
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:48,200
they'll even send them to a
university in the states, uh,

123
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,730
are to graduate school in the states.

124
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,990
And this is part partly because there
are a good universities in the states,

125
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:56,750
but it's also partly because
they know that, but to get ahead,

126
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,170
there are kids need to use English.
They need to be become in some sense,

127
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:03,020
to some extent, Americanized.
This is what's going on.

128
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,100
Even in places like Jerusalem. At this
time, Jerusalem wasn't a huge city,

129
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,280
but it was important enough that
there were elites. They're themselves.

130
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,520
And so when they responded to this urge
of hellenized culture to have their kids

131
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:19,270
educated in the goon
nauseum, remember, uh,

132
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,540
that so they would themselves get this
sort of Greek rhetorical education.

133
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:24,681
In fact,

134
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:28,640
what we'll call for the purposes
liberals and conservatives and Jerusalem,

135
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:33,410
because there was conflict in Jerusalem
at this time over how much Hellenization

136
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,440
you should go along with apparently a
majority of the priests and the lay no

137
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:43,430
milk nobility supported the
hellenized group. That is the,

138
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,090
the one that the Jewish leaders who
wanted to bring more Hellenization into

139
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:51,830
Jerusalem itself. The high priests
at this time was named Jason.

140
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,730
His name was on here
and in one 75,

141
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,020
he built a gymnasium in Jerusalem.

142
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,810
Why did he build a gymnasium in Jerusalem?
Well,

143
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,350
if you're going to have Greek education,
you have to have a good ad nauseum. This.

144
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,270
He also founded a Greek Polis
that is a Greek city structure.

145
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,410
And Jason apparently paid Antiochus
for the privilege of having Jerusalem

146
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:20,370
recognized as a Greek city.

147
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,810
This would have consolidated the power
of those Jewish leaders who wanted to

148
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:30,510
press Greek culture more rather than
those Jewish leaders who want it to hold

149
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:33,720
back on Greek culture.
The cause,

150
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,870
if you control the gymnasium and
you control the means of education,

151
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,220
you actually control the citizenry because
you can't become a citizen of a Greek

152
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,470
Polis, a Greek city, unless you yourself
have Greek education. So sons would,

153
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,940
uh, sons of people would go
to dig of nauseum and notice
what this would do. Also,

154
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:58,890
it would disenfranchise those leading
families who didn't want to have their

155
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:03,090
sons hellenized. So by holding
the control of the education,

156
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,740
you disenfranchise conservative Jews
who are resisting this Greek influence

157
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,620
about this time, apparently Antiochus
offered citizenship status to the Jews.

158
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,030
But, and like I said, admission to the
gum nauseum and the EFA debate member,

159
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:18,631
the EFA Bait,

160
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:23,130
we talked about how the boys around the
year [inaudible] 18 to 22 or so around

161
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:24,360
the age that you guys are,

162
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,570
you have to be enrolled in this
sort of quasi education quality,

163
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,990
quasi military training,
uh,

164
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,910
club sort of thing of the
town that was the Efa Bait.

165
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,190
And you had to go through
that to be a citizen.

166
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:38,920
Jason and his party controlled this
and in fact they renamed Drew's, uh,

167
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,550
Jerusalem,
Antioch of Jerusalem.

168
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,560
There are lots of different
cities named Antioch, uh,

169
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,720
in the ancient world and we're all
done in honor of and some Antiochus.

170
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,450
So Jerusalem is renamed
Antioch of Jerusalem.

171
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,270
Yeah.

172
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,560
The high priesthood was the main
ruler of the Jews at this time.

173
00:10:57,561 --> 00:11:00,170
They didn't have a king and
didn't have a direct governor.

174
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:03,710
So where whoever controlled
the high priesthood with
sort of the political ruler

175
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,120
also at this time,

176
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,550
but Antiochus was the one who had the
privilege of appointing the high priest.

177
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,440
Min allows another leading
Jew. It's names on your, uh,

178
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,960
handout seems to have offered and tie
because more money for the priesthood

179
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:24,290
trying to get it away from
Jason and he couldn't afford it.

180
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,410
So in order to pay for his own priesthood,

181
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,010
he took gold vessels and instruments
out of the temple treasury.

182
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,770
And this seems to have caused a riot.
Now notice

183
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,520
Jason,
is that a good Jewish name?

184
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,910
No,

185
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,970
that's not a good Jewish name.
Men allows,

186
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,830
is that a Jewish name?

187
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,740
No.

188
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,030
Jason and mental health are
both famous Greek names.

189
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,170
You have two guys fighting for
the high priesthood in Jerusalem,

190
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,910
both with Greek names,
not traditional Hebrew names.

191
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,860
And both of them apparently trying to
get in with his hellenized process.

192
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,750
They get into a big fight to
settle things down in Jerusalem.

193
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:23,751
Antiochus takes control of Jerusalem
and he stationed Syrian troops that he's

194
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:28,410
the Greco Syrian troops
in Jerusalem and one 67.

195
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,700
Now things are heating
up around this time.

196
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,710
Changes were made to
the temple in Jerusalem.

197
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,620
It may have been basically
to accommodate the soldiers.

198
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:42,240
They may have had to house, uh, soldiers
from the Greco, Syria and empire.

199
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,540
And they may have used the Temple
Mount apparently to house some of them.

200
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,600
This caused changes to
the temple at this time.

201
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,170
Men allows is in charge
and his Helen Ising party,

202
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,720
which we could call the radical reformers,

203
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,600
they saw this lady's the beginning of
the Anti Judaism laws about this time.

204
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,070
Uh, several laws were passed
that for bad circumcision,

205
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,290
you can't circumcise your boys anymore.

206
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,460
You're forbidden from observing the Torah,
the Jewish law.

207
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,960
It may have been that even a pig was
sacrificed on the altar in Jerusalem,

208
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,980
in the holy of holies.

209
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:23,310
And the temple was turned into a
syncretistic Jewish Pagan Grove.

210
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,120
You know, in Greek, traditional
Greek religion and other religions.

211
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,780
Having a grove of trees is sort
of considered the sacred area.

212
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,560
It's like when you walk through a forest
now and you come upon a nice open kind

213
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:37,770
of grove of trees and all of a sudden
you just kind of feel like, you know,

214
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,150
some men for something is going to jump
out at you and you know, God is there.

215
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,630
So the Greeks liked these sorts
of groves of trees. So they,

216
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,280
this is often what they
would use as a sacred area,

217
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,620
that they did this to the temple and it
was renamed as a shrine to Zeus, Olympus.

218
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,310
Now notice what's happened.
I talked about syncretism last time.

219
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,260
If you're one of these liberal Jews,

220
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,020
you may not really believe
you're doing anything bad.

221
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,290
You're not forsaking Judaism,
you're just updating it.

222
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,580
You're just bringing it up in the
modern era and you had to say, well,

223
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,230
what's wrong with calling it Zeus?
Olympus?

224
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:14,100
We all know these are just different
names given to the same God. Anyway,

225
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,570
there's this one,
supreme god,

226
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,930
so they may well have identified the
Jewish God ya'll way with this god Zeus

227
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,280
Olympus and said,
it's just two different names.

228
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:26,730
One Greek name and one Jewish
name for the same Jewish God.

229
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,440
That may have been what
they were thinking about.

230
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,990
That could also have been thinking
about this Syrian God by all that,

231
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:36,450
by all mom was a Syrian God,
so they just saying, well,

232
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:39,480
we'll have an altar here and Ticus will
be happy because we're worshiping this

233
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:42,210
Syrian God here. The Greeks are
happy with were springs Zeus,

234
00:14:42,211 --> 00:14:44,990
Olympus and the Jews will be happy
because it's identified as Yahweh.

235
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,850
This whole process of Hellenization,

236
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:51,860
therefore I'm interpreting this and a
lot of history books times you'll get the

237
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:55,630
idea that the Jews were all good, loyal
Jews. Just trying to keep the law,

238
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,160
trying to keep Torah
and that the antichrist,

239
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:03,140
the for the epiphany's is putting all
this on them and forcing Greek religion in

240
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:05,900
Greek culture on them.
That's not really the way it happened.

241
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,680
I've told the story the way I perceive
if you read between the lines of some of

242
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:11,640
these ancient Jewish texts,
it's more like it's a,

243
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:14,390
it's a debate that's going
on within Judaism itself.

244
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,150
How Greek should we be?

245
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,450
How much do you accommodate
the dominant culture?

246
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,840
Precisely the way you get a lot of this
kind of debate in the modern world.

247
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,090
Our time of how much
do you want your kids,

248
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,630
your Jewish boys and girls to assimilate
to be just as American as everybody

249
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:32,750
else? How much intermarriage do
you want to have or do you allow?

250
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,160
If you're a Muslim and immigrant to the,
to this country, the first generation,

251
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,510
do you let them listen to hip hop? Do you
let the women stop covering their hair?

252
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,370
Where,
where do you draw the line?

253
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,370
What I'm arguing is that this was what
was going on and it was an internal

254
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,260
Jewish conflict that was going on.

255
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,400
There were several responses to the
Hellenization. Therefore among Jews,

256
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,420
it wasn't just that the Helen I that
Greeks are here putting this onto Jews.

257
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,320
There were just responses within Judaism
itself, as I've already said, Mina, Laos,

258
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:03,320
and the liberals except it and promote it.

259
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,290
Another priest that had been dislocated
from the high priesthood earlier,

260
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,310
who his family had originally been the
high priesthood family, Oneidas, I think.

261
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,830
Oh Nice. The fourth is on
your hand up there. Oh, nice.

262
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:19,070
The fourth actually withdrew
from Jerusalem and went
off and built a new temple.

263
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,720
So he says, well, if you're gonna
destroy the existing Jewish temple,

264
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:26,210
we're going to have an
alternative temple elsewhere.

265
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,220
You also have these people that come
to be called the Hasa deem it's on your

266
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:33,080
handout.
That's from a Hebrew word,

267
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:35,480
meaning the holy ones are pious
ones or something like that.

268
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,920
And they're not to be confused with the
modern Hasa deem who live in Brooklyn

269
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,600
under and who come from eastern Europe.

270
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,170
That's a modern movement that came about
in the medieval period and has come

271
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,870
through. But this the same
word used for these people.

272
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,310
These were Jews who decided to be very
strict and they seem to reject a lot of

273
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:56,180
Greek culture. They certainly rejected
Greek religion and Greek sacrifice.

274
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,730
They seem to promoted
the speaking of Hebrew,

275
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,450
the use of Hebrew texts
and particularly pious, uh,

276
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:04,340
observations of Jewish law.

277
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,600
You even have a group of high priest,

278
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,630
a former high priests who had been
dislocated and other priestly families

279
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,350
withdrawing from Jerusalem and apparently
going out in the desert and maybe

280
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,620
building a community out there.
And we find out about them.

281
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:23,570
And the 20th century when the Dead Sea
scrolls were discovered in the late 1940s.

282
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,950
And so there are a lot of the theories
are these dead sea scrolls were the

283
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:32,951
writings of a sect of Jews led bri
people who had been priestly families who

284
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:34,760
moved out into the desert,

285
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,480
set up camp on the shores of the
Dead Sea and had their own little.

286
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,790
So maybe cause I'm monastic community,

287
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,970
they're very strict in their
observation of the law.

288
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,260
They keep their documents, they have
some documents in Greek, some in Hebrews.

289
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,123
I'm an Aramaic.

290
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,670
So that may have been another way to
respond to this increasing halalization is

291
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:55,500
just to pull away and form
a different community.

292
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
And then you have the
reaction of [inaudible] bias.

293
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,410
Matt [inaudible] was a
priest from Jerusalem who
had settled in a village in a

294
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,690
called Modine and the
hill country of Judea.

295
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,140
And apparently according to the
texts that come down to us, uh,

296
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,370
some of which have to be sort of legends
and that sort of thing, hero worship.

297
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,410
But the story goes that mattifies was in
his village and a priest and a soldier

298
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,820
come from Jerusalem to the village and
they're trying to force the Jews to

299
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:27,690
sacrifice on an altar. Now what an
alter is most of the time is the,

300
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,920
y'all see this little, uh, base over there
in the corner. There's just a little,

301
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,550
a pillar that might be this high and to
offer something you don't actually have

302
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:37,830
to sacrifice a chicken
or anything like that.

303
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,750
You can have obviously sacrificed animals,

304
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,350
but you can just pour out some wine or
you can of course some grain or something

305
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:44,850
like that on the altar and burned it up.

306
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,800
And that will suffice as an offering
to a god without killing an animal.

307
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,470
Something like this may have
been going on. Mac, Matthias,

308
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:57,471
it is said took the sword away from the
soldier and killed this priest and the

309
00:18:57,751 --> 00:19:02,370
soldier for encouraging Jews in his
village to sacrifice to the gods.

310
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,800
This was course was against the law.
So Matthias runs off to the hills,

311
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,290
taking his family with him,
his sons,

312
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,570
he had several sons and
this is the beginning of the
war that comes to be called

313
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,220
the Maccabean revolt.

314
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,600
It's called Maccabean because
after Matt [inaudible] has died,

315
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,950
shortly thereafter, he was the leader
of the revolt and beginning his son,

316
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,870
Judas becomes the head general
of the, of the bunch. Uh,

317
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,900
and Judas early on named earned the
nickname maccabaeus and we're not really

318
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:38,820
sure what the nickname means,
where it comes from.

319
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,240
It could be something like the hammer.
So you know,

320
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,230
he could be due to the
hammer. Uh, but it may have,

321
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,800
it may have been an attribute from him
being a very good general and winning a

322
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:52,530
lot of battles.
But against all odds,

323
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:58,130
this rag tag bunch of basically guerrilla
fighters up against a far superior

324
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:03,180
army of the, of Antiochus, the
fourth epiphany's, they beat them.

325
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,360
They retook Jerusalem.
They didn't actually beat them in Syria.

326
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:08,820
They just beat them
several battles and Judah.

327
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,390
And Judas was able to recapture
Jerusalem and the temple.

328
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,720
And in the year one 64,

329
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,650
they cleanse the temple
of the Prophet nation,

330
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,510
the pollution of having maybe pigs
and things like that sacrificed being

331
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:29,250
polluted as a Greek temple.
And so one 64 is the beginning of the,

332
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,860
the celebration of the Jewish holiday,

333
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,320
Hanukkah. Oh, Hanukkah song. Now,
no, we don't seem to Hanukah song.

334
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,990
So one 64 and the cleansing of the temple
is what Jews celebrate with Hanukkah.

335
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Judas Maccabeus reigned as not
an official king at that point,

336
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,920
but he reigned over Judea of this time
and there was still battles that rage

337
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:59,380
between him and his family and his
army and talk is the fourth epiphany's.

338
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:02,710
And then other descendants after he died,
his brother,

339
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:05,620
one of his brothers became the leader and
then another brother became the leader.

340
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,070
Gradually, uh, these different, uh, uh,

341
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,680
people of this family came to set up
their own dynasty of rulers themselves.

342
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,620
Their family name was not Maccabeus,
that was just a nickname.

343
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,240
The family name was [inaudible]. And so
we call this the has money and dynasty.

344
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,530
That's the descendants of Mathias.

345
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,330
Some of them actually
were then proclaimed king.

346
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:32,560
There were recognized as with the
title king by the later rulers of the

347
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:37,030
neighboring areas like the,
the Syria, Greco Syrian empire.

348
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,200
So that has many in die
dynasty was empower from the
year one 65 to the year 60

349
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,670
BCE.
Now

350
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,760
that's the way one people responded to
this as they revolted against the rulers.

351
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,140
But another way p some Jews
responded was by bleeding.

352
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:59,380
That military volt wasn't the way to go,

353
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,160
that God would somehow
intervene miraculously,

354
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,880
that God was sent an angel or some
kind of heavenly figured down to Earth,

355
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:12,150
and an army of heavenly figures would
defeat Antiochus and usher in the New

356
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,693
Kingdom of Israel.

357
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,520
And that's where you get the story
of that from the book of Daniel.

358
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,480
So I asked you to read Daniel, uh, at
least the last part of Daniel for today.

359
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,920
If you've got your bibles,

360
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,160
take it out and turn with me
first to Daniel chapter nine.

361
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,600
I'm Chapter Eight,
verse 20.

362
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,140
Now the book of Daniel is in two halves.

363
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,310
The first half of it tells about the
adventures of this young man Daniels,

364
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:41,890
who's very,
very wise and very smart and very loyal,

365
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,700
and who refuses to
worship the Persian God.

366
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,291
And of course this is,

367
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,470
these are more Allity stories written
for Jews who were living under Greek

368
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:54,640
domination, encouraging them
not to a worship Greek gods,

369
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,100
but it's cast in the,
in the distant past.

370
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,690
Then the second half of Daniel is a
whole series of visions and prophecies.

371
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,500
And Daniel says, I was in a dream. I
was in the vision on the, on the day,

372
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:08,440
and I saw this and this angel told
me to this and this person did this.

373
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,710
And so it's a narration of
the history of humankind.

374
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,520
That's part of which has already
happened by Daniel time enter.

375
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,810
But most of which has to happen
in the future for Daniel.

376
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,430
And some of this stuff actually does
happen. So for example, uh, end,

377
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:24,280
he tells about different beasts. There's
the ram that does this. There's the,

378
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:25,210
BCIT does this,

379
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,320
but [inaudible] you know that these beasts
represent different kingdoms because

380
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:33,100
in chapter eight, verse 20, he says,

381
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,480
as for the ram that you saw in
your vision with the two horns,

382
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,630
these are the kings of media and Persia,
okay?

383
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,210
There was the kingdom of the meat and
the kingdom with the Persians who came

384
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:47,510
together under Cyrus.
The male goat is the king of Greece,

385
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,590
and the Great Horn between
its eyes is the first king.

386
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,610
So that would be Philip
Alexander's father.

387
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,690
As for the horn that was broken in place
of which four others arose for kingdom

388
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,670
shall arise from his nation
but not with his power.

389
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,220
So this is Alexander his,

390
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:12,221
he's broken and his kingdom is divided
into four empires like I told you about

391
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,530
earlier.

392
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,000
But none of those four empires enjoys
the same power that Alexander the great

393
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,050
enjoyed with his.

394
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:23,510
So now notice how you're already given
clue right here in Daniel that these

395
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:24,350
different images,

396
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:27,470
these different beasts are to refer to
kingdoms that are going to come in the

397
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:31,010
future. From Daniel's perspective, we
know actually that they already did.

398
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,190
Then what happens in Daniel
is in each different chapter,

399
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:36,950
the last part of Daniel in a sense,
tells the story over again.

400
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,120
He has another vision,

401
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,350
and instead of reading it chronologically
as if chapter nine told about one

402
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:45,620
century, then chapter 10 or chapter 11
in the next century, the next century,

403
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,450
you actually have to
read them like cycles.

404
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:51,070
Because what Daniel's doing is he's
giving you a prophecy of what's going to

405
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,810
happen politically related to the,
to Judea,

406
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,380
but he's given to you in several different
visions that all tell the same story

407
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,730
just in different kinds of symbols.
So turn over now to chapter 11.

408
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,910
Uh,
here again,

409
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:14,820
it's sort of like the
fourth chapter 11 verse two.

410
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,010
The four shall be far
richer than all of them.

411
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,810
When he has become strong to his riches,

412
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:21,690
he shall stir up all against
the Kingdom of Greece.

413
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,040
So this is actually talking about the
Persian ruler who will attack Greece.

414
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,300
Then a warrior king shall arise
who sharrow with great dominion.

415
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,810
That's Alexander,
while still rising in power,

416
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,500
Alexander member was still young and
increasing his power when he died.

417
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,380
His kingdom shall be broken and
divided to the four winds of heaven,

418
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,210
but not to his posterity. Alexander
had a child, but the child dies.

419
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,270
Alexander's Kingdom did not go
to any of his own offspring.

420
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,500
It went to these other four generals.
Then notice in verse five,

421
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,940
then the King of the south shall
grow strong. And the next verse,

422
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,120
the daughter of the king of the South
shall come to the king of the north to

423
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:03,570
ratify the agreement. Okay.
What's the king of the south?

424
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,460
Who's the king of the south?
Ptolemy? Some Ptolemy.

425
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,730
One of the Ptolemies. So whenever
you see king of the south in Daniel,

426
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,210
it's always referring to the top
Ptolemaic dynasty, one of the Ptolemies,

427
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:20,700
who's the king of the
North Salukis or Antiochus.

428
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:23,730
So whenever you see the king of the north,
it refers to one of the solutions.

429
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,730
So over and over again in Daniel,
you're going to get the king of the north,

430
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:30,180
the king of this out the king of the
north. And notice how it says, um,

431
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,460
the daughter of the king of the South
shall come to the king of the north to

432
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:34,350
ratify the agreement.
And if you look down,

433
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:37,200
if you have a study Bible and
you look at your footnotes,

434
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,160
it'll actually give you the names of
these different people that historians can

435
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:42,270
identify. So it's like, oh,

436
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:46,970
this may be because we know that she
was a daughter and Antiochus or Salukis,

437
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,720
she was married to one of these
Ptolemies if you follow in your,

438
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,040
your study about it and it has to be a
good critical study Bible. I mean, if you,

439
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,430
uh, you know, by real
scholars, if you use, you know,

440
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,310
these bibles that take all
this as prophecy that relates
to the Soviet Union or

441
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:01,320
to Russia, you know, they might
tell you things like, well,

442
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:05,180
the king of the north here refers to,
um, you know, the head of the, uh,

443
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,740
pullet borough or something like this.
And, and, uh, so if it's, if it's a,

444
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:12,720
a Bible by some by contemporary
church that takes all,

445
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:15,450
this is referring to our time at the time,
immediately the future,

446
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,080
which of course a lot of Christians do,
then their footnotes might be different.

447
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,270
But the footnotes in any good study Bible,

448
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,890
we'll place these people to the history
of what's going on in Judea as this time.

449
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,470
Now go over

450
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,690
to chapter 11 verse 29

451
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,310
Cause I'm not gonna lead you through all
this stuff that happens in chapter 11

452
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:41,730
because if you read it and you read it
with the footnotes is basically telling

453
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:45,840
you a history of the battles and
alliances between the solutions and the

454
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:49,980
Ptolemies and where Judea was caught
in the middle at different times at the

455
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:54,270
time appointed, he shall return and
come into the south. This is um,

456
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,960
one of the, this is Antiochus
not intact is fourth be doing,

457
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,070
but this time it should not be
as before four ships of ca team

458
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,920
shall come against him and he shall lose
heart and withdraw. Who are the QA team?

459
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,830
Romans.
Exactly.

460
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,700
The Qa team is a term that's
used in Hebrew in a lot of
different ancient Jewish

461
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:17,310
texts and sometimes it seems
to refer to the Greeks.

462
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,630
And here it's clearly refers to the
Romans because the Romans come and they

463
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:26,450
forced the king of the North back. Notice
what it says, forces sent by him. Oh,

464
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,580
he shall turn back and pay heed to those
who forsake the holy covenant and tie.

465
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:36,690
Cause the fourth will pay attention to
the Jews who have forsaken the Torah

466
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,400
forces sent by him shall occupy and
profane the temple and the fortress.

467
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:46,380
They shall abolish the regular burnt
offering and set up the abomination that

468
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:51,090
makes desolate or in some modern English
translations like the the, the uh,

469
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,280
abomination of desolation.

470
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,850
That term will be used also in the
new testament in several places.

471
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,680
He shall seduced with intrigue
those who violate the Covenant.

472
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,650
That is the bad Jews
who violated the Torah.

473
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,820
He will be in cahoots with and Ticus but
the people who are loyal to their God

474
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:10,620
shall stand firm and take action.

475
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,490
The wise among the people shall
give understanding to many.

476
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,270
And for some days however they shall
fall by sword and flame and suffer

477
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:21,060
captivity and plunder who are the wise,

478
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,060
the author of the Book Memories.

479
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,780
He spent the whole first part about
setting up Daniel as a wise man.

480
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,930
So this author writing
into the name of Daniel,

481
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,960
a wise man identifies other wise Jews
of his own day and he says they're gonna

482
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,830
oppose and Ticus the fourth and
some of them will die because of it.

483
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,630
When they fall victim,

484
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,950
they shall receive a little
help and many shall join them.

485
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,800
Insincerely some scholars
believe that this is this,

486
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,210
that this little help may be this
author's reference to Judas Maccabeus

487
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,100
and maybe that he knows that there is an
armed resistance and it's a little bit

488
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:01,430
of help,

489
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:06,020
but he doesn't believe himself that the
answer to Antiochus the fourth is going

490
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:10,040
to be an armed revolt. He believes that
it's not going to ultimately succeed. Why?

491
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,070
Because God's going to be
the one who'll intervene,

492
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,390
not Judas Maccabeus the king shall act
as he pleases. He shall exalt himself,

493
00:30:17,391 --> 00:30:19,880
consider himself greater than any god.
Remember,

494
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:24,170
Antiochus Epiphanes God manifest and
shall speak horrendous things against the

495
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:27,830
god of Gods. He shall not prosper
until the period of wrath is completed.

496
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,480
For what is determined shall be done.

497
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,530
He shall pay no respect to the gods of
his ancestors or the one below by women.

498
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,360
He shall pay no respect to any other God.

499
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,030
He just consider himself greater than
all, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

500
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,300
So it's all about setting himself up.
Now look,

501
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,240
he shall come into the beautiful land,

502
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,920
obviously talking about Judea and
tens of thousands shall fall victim,

503
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,270
but eat and Moab and the main part of the
ammonites, shell escape from his power.

504
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,270
He shall stretch forth his
hand against the countries.

505
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,270
And the land of Egypt shall not escape.
In other words, and talk is the force.

506
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,750
This time is actually
going to capture Egypt.

507
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:07,100
He's predicting he shall become ruler
of the treasures of gold and silver and

508
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:11,630
all the riches of Egypt and the Libyans
and the Ethiopians shall follow in his

509
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:14,000
train.
Not only will he overrun Egypt,

510
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:19,070
he's going to oh go west of
Egypt and Libya and south
of Egypt and take Ethiopia,

511
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:23,240
but reports from the east and the north
shout alarm him and he shall go out with

512
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:26,240
great fury to bring ruin and
complete destruction. Too many.

513
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,070
He shall pitch his palatial tense
between the sea. What's The c?

514
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,100
What's the c Mediterranean. Thank you.

515
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:40,330
Somebody is awake and the beautiful
Holy Mountain. What's the Holy Mountain?

516
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,820
Say it. Zion Mount Zion, which
is where Jerusalem is founded.

517
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,600
Yet he shall come to his
end with no one to help him.

518
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,780
He's not gonna do it.
Then wait a minute.

519
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,050
He conquers Egypt, takes
Livia, takes Ethiopia,

520
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,080
comes back through Judea,

521
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:05,970
sets up camp somewhere in that
coastal area between Jerusalem and the

522
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:08,190
Mediterranean and there he dies.

523
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,873
That didn't happen.

524
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,520
And talk is the fourth.
Never took all of Egypt.

525
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:22,100
He never took Ethiopia. He never
took Libya and he did eventually die,

526
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,180
but he died way over in Babylon.
He didn't die here.

527
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,980
How do we know that this document
was written around the year one 64

528
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,250
because this author doesn't
know the end of the story.

529
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,300
Notice how throughout history
he's gotten everything right.

530
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,640
We're not every detail,
but he's got a lot of it right?

531
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,660
He knows when Antiochus the
so and so wins a battle.

532
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,610
He knows when one of the
Ptolemies wins a battle.

533
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,270
He knows when they tried to have a treaty
between them and Mary off one of their

534
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,460
daughters to each other to,
to establish peace.

535
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,080
He knows when they've called truces.

536
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:02,090
He knows when the Romans intervened
and stopped, uh, battles between them.

537
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:06,950
He knows, he knows all that. He knows
that Antiochus profaned the temple.

538
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,970
So He's,

539
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,690
this has gotta be written after one 67
cause he's telling us all about this

540
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:12,770
stuff that happens with the temple.

541
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:18,770
He knows everything that happens up to
one 67 and there may be a little hint

542
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:20,570
that even knows about Judas Maccabeus,

543
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,280
but he doesn't know about anything that
happened to the cleansing of the temple.

544
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,250
He doesn't know about
the victory of Judas,

545
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,150
which happened in one 64 notice how
this is wonderfully convenient for us.

546
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:33,140
Modern scholars.

547
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:38,830
He gets everything right up to one 67
and every thing wrong at one 64 because

548
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:44,831
notice what happens then chapter 12 right
as Antiochus the fourth dies according

549
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,510
to his prophecy at that time,
Michael,

550
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:50,870
the great prince to protect your
of your people. Michael's an angel.

551
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,240
The greatest angel shall arise.

552
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,610
There'll be a time of anguish has
never been about, in other words,

553
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:58,070
this is when all hell breaks loose,
the heavens come down.

554
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,840
Michael swoops in the on a chariot from
the sky with angelic armies and they are

555
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,640
the ones who bring the final victory.

556
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,270
God breaks into history and
brings the final victory.

557
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,530
Judas Maccabeus doesn't win,
win the battle. So this,

558
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,680
this is how we date
apocalyptic literature.

559
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,430
Daniel is one of the earliest cases of
what we call apocalyptic literature.

560
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,300
It gives a apocalyptic CISM gives you
this vision of what's going to happen in

561
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:26,990
the very near future and it
answers the problems of suffering.

562
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,800
And the answer is not arm yourselves and
fight the battle yourself because the

563
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,600
odds are overwhelmingly against you.
You can't defeat all around,

564
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,460
you can't defeat all of Greece. You can't
defeat Antiochus Epiphanes by yourself,

565
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,960
but God can.

566
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:47,150
And so angelic armies will break into
history and bring about the solution to

567
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:47,984
the problem.

568
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:53,230
And that the apocalyptic
writer sets himself up usually
far in the distant past.

569
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,200
Like this guy says he's Daniel Riding
in the sixth century and they narrate

570
00:34:57,201 --> 00:35:01,070
history through the agent. And you
can tell, wow, he's got it. All right.

571
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,340
Daniel foresaw this stuff writing
way back in the year, you know,

572
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:08,630
580 and yet he's, he knows about the
Persians, who knows, but the meats,

573
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:10,070
he knows about the Greeks,
he knows about Alexandra,

574
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:12,740
he knows about the splitting of veterans,
came go. He knows about Berenice,

575
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:15,740
he knows about the Romans.
And so you think he knows all this stuff,

576
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:16,580
he got it all right.

577
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,850
And you pick it up and you're reading
it in the year one 64 yourself,

578
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,630
one 65 and you think, well, he must be
right about what's gonna happen next.

579
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,480
So you think God's going to break
in any day. We're going to be saved.

580
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,210
We don't have to fight ourselves.
We're going to be saved.

581
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,890
And this is how we date apocalyptic
literature. Where do they get the history?

582
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,600
And then when does the history go?

583
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,380
When does the history just
all of a sudden go wrong?

584
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,930
That's when it's dated because
they're riding up to that point.

585
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,450
So one of the wet that won't,
that kind of apocalyptic mentality,

586
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,040
that apocalyptic worldview will become
very important for early Christianity

587
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,300
because what I'll argue in the rest
of this course is who else was an

588
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:05,490
apocalyptic prophet?
Jesus,

589
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,050
who else was in Apocalyptic Prophet Paul?

590
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,840
All of the earliest followers of Jesus
seemed to have been apocalyptic minded

591
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:20,080
Jews and that's the beginning of
early Christianity earning Christian.

592
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,910
He starts off as an
apocalyptic Jewish sect.

593
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,020
They all were reading Daniel and they are,

594
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,190
when they read other prophecies
from the Hebrew Bible,

595
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,530
they also read those apocalyptically.

596
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:37,470
So the apocalyptic response is another
one of these responses to Hellenization

597
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:45,370
in not in 63 about a hundred years
after the cleansing of the temple first.

598
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:47,480
Are there any questions
about any of that so far?

599
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,910
I'll give you a lot of both in confusing
history and confusing terminology.

600
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,420
A hundred years after the cleansing of
the temple Maso Menos in the year of 63

601
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,690
BCE Pompei the general of the Roman
General Pompei enters Jerusalem,

602
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,230
and this is when you have the
beginning of Roman control of Judea.

603
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Herod the great gets himself appointed
as King of the Jews by the Romans,

604
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:23,060
by the Roman Senate. Only the Senate at
this time can proclaim anybody a king.

605
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,250
So the Senate would sometimes have
client kings on the different, the edge,

606
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,830
the frontiers of their control.
They couldn't,

607
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,410
they didn't want to be
bothered with controlling her.

608
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,150
The same thing themselves with their
own armies directly or their governors,

609
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,860
so they would appoint local kings,
whether in Asia, minor Greece,

610
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,610
different parts.

611
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:45,470
Herod the Great was appointed King by
the Roman Senate and he ruled from the

612
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:49,490
year 37 to the year for BCE.

613
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,940
After Herod the great died,

614
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,200
his kingdom was split up first
among his different sons,

615
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:03,100
but Judea itself eventually was placed
under direct Roman rule under procurators

616
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,880
that were appointed by the Senate
or sometimes by the emperor.

617
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,850
And this is what pilot's
job was punches pilot,

618
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,850
who was the governor of Judea.

619
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,090
His actual title wasn't governor
that he was a procurator,

620
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,850
but he was the one in control
of Judea during the life.

621
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,280
During the time that
Jesus was killed himself,

622
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,790
pilot was one of these
direct Roman rulers of Judea.

623
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,510
Galilee was ruled by a son of Herod,

624
00:38:29,511 --> 00:38:34,511
the Great Herod Antipas and different
and set a descendants of Herod would rule

625
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:38,560
in different parts of that of
Palestine for many years after that,

626
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,590
during the first century,

627
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,460
there were sporadic
uprisings among the Jews.

628
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,190
Some of them were apocalyptic.
That is,

629
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:51,450
they seem to have been Jews who
are expecting the end to come, but,

630
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,160
but sometimes they seem to have expected
that they were supposed to start it.

631
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,661
So for example,

632
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:59,500
you have PR Josephus tells us about
Jewish prophets who would arise and say,

633
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,580
follow me to Jerusalem and thought of
me to Jerusalem and then stand on the

634
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:03,610
Mount of Olives,

635
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,940
which is this mountain is right
opposite the main mountain of Jerusalem.

636
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,230
And they'd say,
okay,

637
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:10,570
tomorrow we're going to go out and
we're gonna March around the walls of

638
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:12,280
Jerusalem and the walls
are all going to fall down.

639
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,310
Sound like anything you familiar with
the walls of Jericho and the Hebrew Bible

640
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:21,730
falling down after the Israelites
marched around it for seven days and then

641
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:26,731
seven times the last day prophets were
arising using inspiration from Jewish

642
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,790
prophets from the ancient past.
And they were setting themselves up again,

643
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:33,790
his profits and again
expecting God to break through.

644
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:38,830
So sometimes these profits arose and
they were themselves apocalyptic profits

645
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,970
announcing the end of the known
world soon. Sometimes also,

646
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:47,380
they seem to have been setting themselves
up as king of the Jews and that would

647
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:51,400
make them a messiah because the word
Messiah and he booed just means the

648
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:54,430
anointed one. And what do you
do when you make someone a king?

649
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:58,360
In the ancient world, you put oil
on their heads. That's how you,

650
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:03,220
you anoint a king. So if someone's called
the anointed one, that's a kingly title.

651
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,910
Now this is very dangerous because what
did I just say about how did you get to

652
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:11,650
be a king and run when controlled area?
The senate had to punch you.

653
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,570
Anybody who set himself up as king without
being appointed king by the Senate,

654
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,030
that was itself an act of treason.

655
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,790
So there were the other messianic figures
who would rise and try to provoke some

656
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,080
kind of revolt.

657
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,530
The most important revolt of the Jewish
people during this time started the year

658
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:35,350
66. Now we're in the common
era. So this is 66 CE.

659
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:42,330
It started in 66 with Jews in both Judea
and Galilee revolting against Roman

660
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:47,350
rule. They drove the Roman,
uh, squadron out of Jerusalem,

661
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,670
and in the year 70, the Romans, finally,
after four years, four years of warfare,

662
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,460
they had surrounded Jerusalem
for a full two years.

663
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:02,380
They finally took Jerusalem itself.
They flattened,

664
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:07,240
they destroyed the temple. So the
destruction of the temple is the year 70.

665
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,480
And that's probably the most important
date for this course because a lot of

666
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:17,720
important things in Christianity,
the early Jesus Movement, uh,

667
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,650
happen either before 70 and
there one kind of event.

668
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,020
Some of them happen
right around the year 70.

669
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,510
We'll talk about that when we get to the
gospel of Mark and a couple of times.

670
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,510
And then some of them, uh, most
things happen after you're 70.

671
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,770
But the destruction of the
temple in Jerusalem in the
year 70 is not only hugely

672
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:35,720
important for Jews, right?
Because ever since then,

673
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,130
Jews have not had a sacrificial
cult where if you're a Jew now,

674
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:43,220
where do you go to sacrifice?
You can't go to the temple.

675
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:46,490
There's the Dome of the rock sitting
there on a where it's supposed to be.

676
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,590
Jews substituted different forms of piety,
reading the Torah,

677
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,540
studying, praying, meeting in
synagogues, meeting and other places. Uh,

678
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,900
so Judaism changed radically
beginning in the year 70,

679
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:04,070
precisely because the place where
you sacrificed was destroyed.

680
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:08,420
Every er, every ethnic group around the
Mediterranean, in the ancient world head,

681
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:11,390
it's religion as some part of sacrifice.
They all did.

682
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,750
Sacrifice was just common among different
groups around the Mediterranean.

683
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:20,260
The year 70 calls the Jews to stop being
primarily a sacrificial people cause

684
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:24,050
they hadn't heard the sacrifice.

685
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:29,870
The end of the Jewish war is
dated by most people to 74,

686
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,940
because that's the time when
the final battle took place.

687
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,240
And the fortress that fell was called

688
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,110
Masada.
So if you go to Israel now,

689
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,170
Masada is a shrine for
tourist spot in a shrine

690
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:51,710
that celebrates the, uh, defeat
of the last or Jews, Jews,

691
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:52,970
uh,
at Masada.

692
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:57,920
The fortress that Herod the
great had built after that
Judaism changes. You have,

693
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,140
um, I'm not going to go into much
detail because the way rabbinic Judaism,

694
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:05,750
what you know is Judaism today,
if you know anything about it at all,

695
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,320
is a result of developments
that happen after 70.

696
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,130
It's the result of the rabbis recognizing
that the temple cult is no longer

697
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:17,480
there. The rabbis who are teachers of
the law and commentators on the law,

698
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,780
they become the central organizing
feature, not the priests.

699
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,580
So priest, the priesthood, you
still have Jews named Cohen, right?

700
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:29,510
Which means priest, but priest and
Judaism don't really do much anymore.

701
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,780
It's the rabbi's you become important.
So at the beginning of,

702
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,310
around the year 200,

703
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:39,350
you have the rabbinic Judaism starting to
develop its written texts, the Mishnah,

704
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,170
the Babylonian Talmud,
the Jerusalem Talmud.

705
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:47,180
And this is the birth during these
centuries of ribbon ism that is rabbinic

706
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:52,130
Judaism as it comes to be important.
There was another Jewish revolt in one 32,

707
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,010
two one 35 called the Bar Kokhba revolt.

708
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,910
But that was suppressed by the
emperor Hadrian and one 35.

709
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,150
And that you had the complete
destruction of Jerusalem. It was leveled.

710
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,990
It was renamed Eylea capitol,

711
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:08,570
Alina or Roman name and Jews after that
were forbidden even to enter Jerusalem

712
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,100
for a long time. Okay. What's
important about all this? I told you,

713
00:44:13,101 --> 00:44:17,390
I warned you last time, that last
lecture on the Grock, the Roman empire,

714
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:22,130
the Greek world was going to be some just
boring historical narrative and you've

715
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:25,370
had some of the same thing this time
where I just had to tell the story of what

716
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,550
was going on in these centuries,
but why was this unimportant for us?

717
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,290
Here are the main things
to take away from it.

718
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:36,230
Hellenization was extremely
important because it United,

719
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:39,870
the Mediterranean world,
the eastern Mediterranean,

720
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,950
but then the Romans even took over some
of the aspects of Hellenization when

721
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:47,880
they took over all of Mediterranean.
By Jesus time,

722
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,930
all of Palestine was
hellenized to some extent,

723
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,900
only to different degrees.
So yes,

724
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,300
if you are living in a village
or in the country, you didn't,

725
00:44:57,301 --> 00:45:00,300
you may not have spoken Greek
may I spoke in Hebrew or Aramaic,

726
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,870
but if you were an elite person in
any city, even in Palestine at time,

727
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,550
you are expected to be
able to speak Greek.

728
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,840
You had some exposure to Greek culture.
Syncretism was very important.

729
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:13,230
The idea that religions around
religions borrowed from each other.

730
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:16,560
Religions were mixtures of things and
cultures borrowed from each other.

731
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,540
So syncretism was very important.
There was also conflict within Judaism.

732
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,160
I tried to emphasize that Jews weren't
all agreed about how to respond to the

733
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:28,260
things, to the politics and
the cultures around them.

734
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:31,590
Jews conflict with Jews over how to adopt,

735
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:35,760
adapt to a Greek and Roman
domination and culture, political,

736
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,930
social, religious,
linguistic, cultural issues.

737
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,270
We're all effected in some way.

738
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,900
The next really important thing is the
smallest of Judea from the modern world.

739
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:52,290
We tend to think of Jerusalem and Judy
as being very important because of course

740
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,130
that's where Judaism started off and
that's where Christianity started off.

741
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,030
But by the standards of
the Greek and Roman worlds,

742
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,450
Judea was a kind of insignificant
backwater. It wasn't a big empire,

743
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,820
important place economically
or politically and Jerusalem
was not that terribly

744
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:12,870
important. Judea was relatively
unimportant from a world
historical perspective,

745
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,010
but,

746
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:18,180
and this is also very important for how
this lecture plays out for the rest of

747
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:19,014
the course.

748
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:23,340
The Jews were never truly
independent during this time,

749
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:27,540
nor were they ever truly powerful
during this time, even when the Hazmat,

750
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,290
Ian's Judas Maccabeus in his brothers
and their descendants were ruling for 100

751
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:32,124
years or so,

752
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:37,220
they never were politically very powerful
outside of that narrow area of Judea.

753
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,220
They were never truly independent.

754
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:46,221
They always had to fend off the greater
power of Syria or Egypt or Rome.

755
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:48,840
That difference.

756
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,960
The important thing though is Jews had
an ideology that supported imperial

757
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:56,100
pretensions.

758
00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:01,370
Go back and read the first few songs
where God says to my anointed one,

759
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:07,200
and here he's either talking to King
David or whoever is supposed to be sitting

760
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:11,370
on King David's throne.
You are the king of the world.

761
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,250
I will make all the
nations flow to Jerusalem.

762
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,610
All of them will come and
worship me in this holy place.

763
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,660
The songs are full of language that
imply that whoever is in control and

764
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:24,630
Jerusalem is the king of the world,

765
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,990
and yet the Jews looked around themselves.
And again,

766
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,570
we haven't had anybody who
approached that in centuries.

767
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,890
The Jews had an ideology of empire
and world domination embedded in their

768
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:40,084
scripture,

769
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,470
and yet their social and political
situation was just the opposite.

770
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:50,820
And it's in that Maelstrom of
Jewish ideology not fitting
reality that Jesus was

771
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:53,674
born

772
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:01,130
no sections this week. Look
at the syllabus. On Monday,

773
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,960
you'll be asked to come in with lists
of historical events as you see them in

774
00:48:05,961 --> 00:48:10,370
acts and list of historical events as
you've seen them in Galatians one to come

775
00:48:10,371 --> 00:48:13,820
in with your lists on paper, because
we're going to put it up on the board.

776
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,870
Be prepared to tell me what you do for
your homework and do the homework for

777
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:21,290
Monday. Okay? It's not very difficult.
I won't take you a long time,

778
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:25,250
but follow the syllabus instructions
and come Monday ready to talk.

779
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:26,570
Thank you.
