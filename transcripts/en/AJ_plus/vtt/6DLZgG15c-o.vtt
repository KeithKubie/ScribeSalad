00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.100
It's Canada's secret shame: an epidemic
of missing and murdered Indigenous women

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.420
and girls. Indigenous women face a murder
rate six times the national average.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.240
Every time you come out to this river,
do you wonder if you'll recover her body?

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.080
We come across remains and you don't
know if they're human or not. Or if they're your sister.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.560
The UN has censured Canada for its ongoing failure to address the crisis.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.500
The march is to send a message to the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.620
men who prey on them that they're being
watched by the community.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.780
We see what's going on. We don't believe that our people deserve it.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.960
These guys do not discriminate.
they go after anybody and everybody.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.280
Now, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's
government is taking action:

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.360
Those touched by this national tragedy have
waited long enough.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.500
But after years of failure on the part of the police and the government, many here questioned if it could

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.100
possibly go far enough to bring justice
for the families and keep women safe.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.140
It flashed through my mind that it could be
a body that we were trying to pull up.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.520
We're in Winnipeg, which is one of the
most violent cities in Canada. It also

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.580
has the largest urban Indigenous
population in North America. And more

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.730
Indigenous women have gone missing or
been murdered here than anywhere else in

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.700
the country. The Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, or RCMP, says nearly 1,200

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.340
Indigenous women have gone missing or
been murdered across Canada since 1980.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.390
But advocacy groups put the figure far
higher at about 4,000 women. Prime

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.410
Minister Justin Trudeau's predecessor,
Stephen Harper, largely dismissed the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.100
issue. Then in 2015,
Trudeau announced the creation of a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.240
two-year national inquiry to examine the
epidemic as part of what he called a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.530
"total renewal" of Canada's relationship
with its Indigenous people. But the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.520
inquiry has been plagued by delays,
resignations and allegations of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.400
government interference. Many here feel
it may be destined to fail. Bernadette

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.060
Smith's younger sister, Claudette Osborne-Tyo, has been missing since 2008.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.440
Bernadette started "Drag the Red" in
2014 to support other families looking

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.330
for answers after the bodies of several
women were found in the Red River. The

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.170
group uses homemade dragging bars with
built-in hooks to search the bottom of

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.140
the river. They hand over what they find
to police and a team of forensic anthropologists.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.019
Every time we go out, we
offer tobacco to give thanks for

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.500
being able to be out here and do
this work, but also to offer prayers to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.400
the families that are missing
someone, that don't have answers

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.700
or who had been murdered and nobody's
been brought to justice.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.360
Why this spot in particular?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.580
So this was the Alexander
Dock. There were two young girls that were found here.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.900
In August 2014, the body
of a 15-year-old Indigenous girl named

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.940
Tina Fontaine was found in this river,
wrapped in plastic.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.850
Tina's death was a turning point that
opened up a lot of people's eyes to this

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.020
epidemic and sent shockwaves across the
country. For many, it highlighted the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.340
failures of the system. In the hours
before her death, she encountered the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.400
police, hospital staff and child welfare workers.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.040
Tell me about your sister, and how she went missing I know she was only 21 at the time, 10 years ago.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.379
She had been sexually abused when she was 12, and

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.970
started running away from home. She
ended up with a much older man and was

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.100
exploited, and was pushed on to the
streets. Claudette wasn't someone who

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.000
didn't stay in contact with someone
daily. Nobody had heard from her in two

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.709
days, so my sister Tina went and she
filed a missing persons report. And the

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.269
police basically said, "She's out
there somewhere, just give it a few days."

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.079
We kept going back to the police
station and saying,

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.120
"Something's wrong." They didn't take
us seriously. They didn't investigate her

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.700
case for 10 days. So there's a
prime example. That's what they pulled up.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.430
So there's no blood on it, but we pull
up clothing all the time. We've pulled up

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.310
lots of underwear, women's underwear. And
people weight bodies down with cement,

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.080
right? When they found Tina Fontaine's
body, she was weighted down.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.560
Here we go!

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.320
Oh wow. That's a strong tug. Yeah, something definitely got caught on here.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.800
So that's a boot?

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.080
More cloth, possibly clothing … and a boot.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.340
It looks like there’s a what?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.320
Remains inside.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.960
They're telling me to check for a foot in here.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.500
It's a branch, or a rock. Could be bone stuff?

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.200
It flashed through my mind that it could
be a body that we were trying to pull up,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.920
and it made me feel sick to my stomach,
thinking that's what you guys are here to do.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.720
Our first year, there were seven
bodies recovered from this river.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.880
Every year we've helped, and I don't even
know how many.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.440
Your sister went missing 10 years ago. Every time you come out to this river,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.220
do you wonder if you'll recover her body?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:13.340
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. That’s … that’s a reality.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.020
You come across remains
and you don't know if they're human or

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:24.240
not. Or if they're your sister. It's an emotional roller coaster, because you just never know.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.440
Three other women in
Bernadette's family have gone missing or

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.740
been murdered. Only one case has been solved.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.680
Should it be the police doing this?

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.040
Absolutely it should be. Policing is
an issue in this country. We were on the

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.780
streets putting up posters, talking to
people, going to different organizations,

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.740
going to different places we knew Claudette went to. We were basically

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.540
doing the police's job for them. No
family should have to do that.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.260
The Winnipeg Police declined to speak with
us on camera or give us a statement.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.800
“Meet Me at the Belltower” is an anti-violence movement, and we exist to build community.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.120
Michael Champagne is an activist who
organizes weekly anti-violence rallies

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.510
in Winnipeg's primarily Indigenous North
End neighborhood. A new mural dedicated

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.560
to missing and murdered women has just
been painted in this weekly meeting place.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.380
It’s nice that we have these beautiful images in our community, but it’s frustrating

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.680
that they have to be memorial images.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.320
I wanted to know why it was
necessary to hold weekly anti-violence rallies here.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.220
There was a time when, in a
year, we had over 52 vigils, funerals,

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.810
hospital room visits, and the same
group people got together but always

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.680
centered around the negative things. We
need to host weekly anti-violence

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.970
rallies here to send a message. Not only to the
community, but to the people that prey on

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:58.480
our community. And our message is that we are united.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.100
Michael grew up in the child welfare
system here and says that 1 out of 6

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.580
children in this neighborhood are
currently in the care of the system.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.330
Seven percent of children across Canada
are Indigenous, but they make up nearly

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.800
half of all foster children in the
country. The government cites poverty or

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.440
lack of adequate food or housing as
reasons for separating them from their birth families.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.480
What connections do you
see between the child welfare system and

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.720
the epidemic of missing and murdered
Indigenous women?

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:33.020
In the child welfare system, often what ends up happening is a devaluing of Indigenous life, especially

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.580
for Indigenous women and girls. As they
age out of care, they turn eighteen unequipped

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.150
with life skills, severed from their
biological families or their home

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.750
communities. They're at risk of
homelessness, harmful substance use,

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.530
sexual exploitation. Part of the reason
why we have such difficulties in child

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.610
welfare today is that many of those
children right now are actually children,

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.460
like me, of Indian residential school survivors.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:02.300
From the 1840s to the mid-1990s, some 150,000 Indigenous children were removed from their

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.900
families and sent to church- and
government-run Indian residential

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:11.030
schools. Their aim was to "kill the Indian
in the child" by assimilating them into

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.170
dominant Canadian culture. Many children
suffered emotional, physical and sexual

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.280
abuse while attending these schools. As
we know now, Indian residential schools

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.810
were a failed experiment that did a lot
more harm than it did good.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:28.490
And unfortunately, that that history of
family separation over so many

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.800
generations continues to this day with
child welfare.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.800
It's 12:30 a.m. here in the North End
neighborhood in Winnipeg, and we've

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.939
joined this Midnight Medicine Walk
organized by the community to reach out

00:09:45.939 --> 00:09:50.079
to women here that are being sexually
exploited, to offer them prayers and

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:54.519
medicine and let them know that they're
being watched after. And also, the march is

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:57.490
to send a message to the men who prey on
them that they're being watched by the

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.990
community. Lauren Chopeck is the
founder of the walk. She was once a

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.639
missing Indigenous woman herself.
Lauren ran away from home as a teenager

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.440
and was trafficked on these streets,
where she narrowly escaped a serial killer.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.100
How did the idea of the Midnight
Medicine Walk come about?

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:24.820
Through my own experiences of
being exploited. I wanted to do something

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.760
to acknowledge those people as really
actually really are, and acknowledge

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.550
their spirits and honor their spirits, instead of
just walking past them every day,

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.940
or driving past them every day, thinking of them as homeless people or as prostitutes.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.380
Because that’s not who they are.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.160
Tell me about some of the interactions you

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.640
have with these women that you're reaching out to on the streets, and what really sticks with you.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.760
They tear up, these women, because they're finally

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:58.610
being recognized. And they might not feel
like they deserve

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.740
this kind of standing ovation that we
give them, when we stop and sing for them

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.080
or we offer them a smudge. They feel like they don’t deserve it.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.600
But they do, and they're finally being paid attention to.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.400
Is this process really healing for you?

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.100
It is. It is really healing for me. Out of
all those negative experiences I had as

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.360
a young girl being sexually exploited,
now people recognize me and they respect

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:39.620
me for those things, I guess, but in a different way, because now I turned it into something beautiful.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.400
As we turned the corner onto the main

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.540
boulevard, we were told that no one takes
this road at night unless they're looking for sex.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.760
What message are you guys sending to the men out there who prey on these vulnerable women?

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.970
That we see what's going on and that we don't

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:11.920
believe that our people deserve it. I
want them to see the community coming together.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.720
Because the police's response has been
insufficient, Indigenous activists have

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.140
been stepping up in various ways to ensure the safety of their community members and streets.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:31.400
OK, so two groups of seven. We've got 14, right?

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.690
James Favel is the executive director of the
Bear Clan Patrol, a community safety

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:40.820
patrol that operates in some of Winnipeg's toughest neighborhoods five to six nights a week.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.070
When we talk about
the epidemic of missing and murdered

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.630
Indigenous women and girls here in this
country, do you see your work as trying

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.160
to put an end to that, in a small way?

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.120
That's exactly why we started. In the wake of what

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.520
happened with Tina Fontaine, I just wasn't
prepared to sit around and watch anymore.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.250
I had to do something so I could at
least sleep at night and my conscience be

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:04.000
clear. We started out with 12
volunteers in 2014, and now we have 1,200.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.920
How does that make you feel?

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.500
It’s pretty f*cking good.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.840
Tell me a bit more about the sexual exploitation you see on these streets.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.160
Well, I mean, it's – yeah, the prostitution here, it was
pervasive for a very long time, and there

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.550
was nobody doing anything about it. It
was like it was permitted in this area.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:24.410
and for us here in this
community, that's not suitable,

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:29.270
right? We have the exploited
women, standing up against

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.750
buddy's fence, and the kids are
playing in the yard and we've got Johns

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:36.020
coming. These guys do not
discriminate, they go after anybody and

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.060
everybody, they don't care if you're 10
years old or if you're 40 years old.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.060
Why hasn't the state or the city done more
to crack down on these Johns?

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.360
... the political will is not there.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.320
Canada’s National Inquiry into Missing and

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.600
Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is
expected to conclude in April of 2019.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.550
The inquiry is examining the systematic
causes of violence against Indigenous

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.790
women and girls, and making
recommendations for how to keep them

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:06.860
safe – at a cost of $53.8 million. During our time in

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.540
Winnipeg, we heard from those who feel
the inquiry may not be up to the task.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.580
Our family didn't participate in that
inquiry. We called for a national action

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:21.100
plan. Women are still going
missing. They're still being murdered, and

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:28.540
there's no real resources or prevention put in place to stop that from happening.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.350
I feel like this inquiry needs to be led

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.160
by experiential family members that
actually know what it's like to lose a

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.660
loved one, so that we have an appropriate
amount of urgency behind the work that we're doing.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.920
Tasha Spillett is an academic and educator who's been following the inquiry.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.120
I don't see that there will be

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:51.140
any outcome in it, unless there's real
legal teeth from that from that inquiry.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:56.800
We’re going to have another inquiry in 50 years, another one in 100 years, another one in 150

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:03.050
years if we don't understand that at the
bottom of this is a really harmful power

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:08.740
dynamic in which Indigenous women and
girls are situated at the bottom.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.020
We wanted to take these concerns to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:17.120
but his office declined our request for
an interview. Instead, they directed us to

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.920
Carolyn Bennett, the Minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations. For months, we

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.339
reached out to her office for an
interview, and eventually received a

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.260
statement that stresses the government's
commitment to, in their words, "end this national

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:36.940
tragedy," and lists the initiatives it's taking to support affected communities and prevent future violence.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.400
In the meantime, as Canada's

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.740
government struggles to repair its
relationship with its Indigenous

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.060
population, the communities here are
continuing to search for their missing

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.820
women – while trying to stop the next one
from being murdered.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:16:01.620
We've made it part of Claudette's legacy to help other families, to do whatever we can to create awareness,

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.780
to honor her.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.200
Hey everyone, it's Dena. So how much did you know about the epidemic of missing and murdered

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.800
Indigenous women and girls? Let me know
