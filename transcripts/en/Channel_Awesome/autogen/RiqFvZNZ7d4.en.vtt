like I think I really got that from like
Sonic<00:11:15.660><c> and</c><00:11:15.840><c> probably</c><00:11:16.380><c> Tiny</c><00:11:16.650><c> Toons</c><00:11:16.950><c> they</c><00:11:17.160><c> had</c><00:11:17.250><c> a</c>

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
Sonic and probably Tiny Toons they had a
 

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.190 align:start position:0%
Sonic and probably Tiny Toons they had a
bear<00:11:17.430><c> that</c><00:11:17.460><c> too</c><00:11:17.730><c> but</c><00:11:17.850><c> in</c><00:11:18.000><c> Sonic</c><00:11:18.510><c> it's</c><00:11:18.990><c> what</c>

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
bear that too but in Sonic it's what
 

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.930 align:start position:0%
bear that too but in Sonic it's what
those<00:11:19.380><c> heads</c><00:11:19.680><c> would</c><00:11:19.830><c> just</c><00:11:20.010><c> fucking</c><00:11:20.310><c> fall</c><00:11:20.640><c> over</c>

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
those heads would just fucking fall over
 

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.730 align:start position:0%
those heads would just fucking fall over
they'd<00:11:21.090><c> have</c><00:11:21.210><c> to</c><00:11:21.330><c> drag</c><00:11:21.510><c> them</c><00:11:21.660><c> around</c><00:11:21.960><c> I'm</c>

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
they'd have to drag them around I'm
 

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.150 align:start position:0%
