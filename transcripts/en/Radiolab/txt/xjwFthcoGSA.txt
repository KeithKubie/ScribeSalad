Speaker 1:          00:04          You're listening to radio lab from New York public radio, public radio, w. C. N. N. P. R. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich and this is radio lab. You ever wondered why it is, um, that all living things die? I do wonder about that actually, which it keeps me up at night, which always leads me to the next question. Do we have to, do I have to the topic of our show as a matter of fact and the natural place to begin to look for an answer. [inaudible] a rush. [inaudible] here we are in your garage. Three are in my garage. The owner of this particular garage is one Leonard Hayflick. He is a biologist. He takes me to the corner where he's got this above. So describe what we're looking at here. Well, what we're looking at is I barrel shaped a device, metal canister, metal. The side is shaped kind of like a thermos except big opening.

Speaker 1:          01:10          He twists off the top and look at that. Out comes all of this smoke dry ice from Halloween is what it looks. Well, this look at hydrogen is used in a lot of movies. He reaches his hand into the liquid nitrogen fog right into the bowels of this canister and pulls out, and this is what I'd come to see, what some test tubes, boobs in which these animals are cut immediately. They're not how much to look at. If you know what's in there, it's almost holy. Each tube has millions of frozen human cells in there, and these cells have completely changed how we think about mortality and mortality. And You keep it in your garage. Yes. Why? I mean, I think it's pretty cool, but why? Why it goes, nobody else think of looking here. Oh, okay. Well, I won't, I certainly won't divulge your address or anything, but just don't tell him.

Speaker 1:          02:05          No, of course I wouldn't, but that's in California is all I'll say. Well, where else would you want me to put it in mind? But no, I don't know. I mean, it's, uh, I imagined something like this, you would find it in the most started for Leonard Hayflick about 50 years ago. I got the back story actually not in California. In Philly. I'll check. Do you want to tell me where we are? Where we're sitting on the 12th floor of the William [inaudible] House in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which happens to be my mother's apartment who has just celebrated her hundredth birthday. Just that day, appropriately enough. In any case, let's rewind to the 50s biology was facing a problem. Basic problem. How do you study human cells? Cells are us. It is what we are, but you can't exactly put a microscope up to your wrist. I willing, you know, I guess you could, but I wouldn't say it's impossible, but it's certainly highly impractical. What you can do instead, and Hayflick was among the first to perfect. This is, well, he explained it to me.

Speaker 2:          03:03          If I take a tiny biopsy from any part of your anatomy that you're willing to surrender to me, like say a fleck of mine, like my wrist, your wrist, kind of anywhere you want, the tip of your nose and to be your toe, I don't care where it is. And then you raise a pyramid of skin by grabbing onto the tip of a hair, pull it up. And then with the other hand you'd take a sterile scalpel and one little tip of that pyramid of skin off. And I drop it into a test tube and I introduce an enzyme preparation called trypsin. And that material dissolved. It's the cement that holds all the cells together. Think of your tissue as a brick wall. And once I dropped that brick wall into my test tube, I need to dissolve the mortar. Right. And now I have your individual cells NFI feed them and treat them nicely. They will divide

Speaker 3:          04:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          04:02          Each cell produced two cells.

Speaker 3:          04:05          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          04:06          Each cell produced two cells

Speaker 2:          04:09          to sell to sell. Can you do the math? You'll find that they'll cover the city of New York and about three weeks.

Speaker 1:          04:18          I mean, you know, that's if you had a big enough petri dish. In any case, this process, it's called cell culturing, is the simplest thing in the world these days. I mean, modern biologists can do it with their eyes close the back in Hayflick's Day in the fifties it was very fuzzy because no one really understood the mechanics of it. No one knew exactly what a cell liked or what it didn't like. And so the people that were really good at getting the cells to divide from two and a four and eight and 16 whatever. Yes, they, it was like they had the touch. They had what was called a green thumb. There was a mystique about them because, you know, don't forget, this was the early days biology. No, biology at that time was still kind of a black art.

Speaker 2:          05:01          Well, I'm interested in the use of the term black art because that attribute was given to the field by a single individual who dominated the field for about 20 or 30 years. His name was Alexis corral. He believed that the contamination of tissue cultures with airborne bacteria could be eliminated or prevented by maintaining sterile circumstances. That in his mind included everything being painted black

Speaker 3:          05:32          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          05:32          No, don't ask me the rationale for that because I can't explain it. It's so gothic. I love it. Exactly. All of his technicians on he himself were dressed from head to foot and black, and he had a gallery around the lab where reporters could wander to see these mystical black figures roaming the laboratory and keep lore doing strange things with strange implements and ending up

Speaker 1:          05:57          with cells growing. It must've seemed like wishcraft on. It didn't seem like they believed it was witchcraft, especially because Alexis corral claimed to have kept a chick heart alive for 46 years at chick heart. Yes. Like the heart of a baby chicken. It was a fragment of tissue from the chick heart. So for 46 years, the cells divided and divided every couple of days. That's what was alleged. Now, 46 years is a long time. Right. And so scientists thought that if they've gone this long, they'll probably go forever because of corral. And a couple of other scientists, they always thought that cells are immortal under the proper conditions, the grow and definitely and Carell's little chicken heart seemed to be proof of this. It just kept spewing new cells, which he'd keep dividing into new bottles. It was the New York Post said quote, if all of the cells produced by Dr Carel from his culture, chicken heart were kept together, they would produce a rooster that could cross the Atlantic Ocean in a single sheet.

Speaker 4:          07:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:13          Boy, I wish I'd come up with that myself now. Or was that a quote that was made lovingly or admiringly or was that a sort of sneer made to sell the New York Post? It did. People bought it, I guess is what I'm asking. You're darn right. They bought it until it was torpedo.

Speaker 4:          07:30          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:34          right. Well that's the story that I want to get to next. It happened by accident. You did not set out to torpedo the rooster or the whole idea of cellular immortality. It just kinda happened. He was in the lab. It was the 50s he was just a kid and he becomes worried. This was an ordinary worry at the time that his little cells would become contaminated. I knew at the time that if you cultured normal human tissue from adults, you might grow simultaneously unwanted viruses because in adults the viruses would sometimes sneak into the cells and hide there. And I didn't want, of course, my culture is to be contaminated with these viruses. So I zeroed in on human fetal tissue, human fetal tissue as in from abortions, sorry to ask an ignorant question, but it w abortion at that time was, was it anything like the crazy political thornbush that is now no farm or rational?

Speaker 1:          08:30          It was actually quite easy. He says he just picked up the phone and called my friends at the University of Pennsylvania and said I want wanted fetuses whenever they were surgically boarded. And as you might expect when you put your order in for a fetal tissue, you know, not when the phone will ring. He never knew when the shipments would arrive. I would receive maybe one fetus one week and then two weeks later, another one. So to keep track of, and this turns out to be key. He kept a log. Every time he'd get a new shipment, he would jot down the arrival day and then dropped the cells into the flask and Washington divine, do you all deal. And then every couple of weeks he would come check on them and that's when it started. I began to realize that some of the cultures are unhappy. The stop divided. At first it was just one, one batch. What were you thinking at this point? Uh, I didn't know what to say cause it's just an observation and it was just one batch batch a, let's call it yet. All right, no biggie. We'll see how it goes.

Speaker 5:          09:29          Let's come back a and a month later I find out that not only ey is still not doing its thing, but B and c aren't either.

Speaker 1:          09:39          No three batches of cells had gone. Caput said to myself, well that's peculiar. Peculiar because here he'd done the same with these cells as he'd done with all the others, put them in the same glasses, same solution, same conditions, didn't add up. Now I have to find out what the cause is. So I'll go back and look at my records.

Speaker 6:          09:56          Sure.

Speaker 1:          09:58          And that is when it smacks him in the face.

Speaker 6:          10:01          What

Speaker 1:          10:02          the thing that all three batches of sales hadn't come in, and he knew this because he'd kept the logs, is that they were the oldest

Speaker 6:          10:12          [inaudible],

Speaker 1:          10:12          so to speak. He'd received each batch of fetal tissue from the hospital received from the hospital roughly nine months ago. At nine months or thereabouts. They just kind of hit a wall and they stopped divide. But the ones received one month, two or three, one for them. Upon the six months ago though sales were doing just fine. Perfect, beautiful. And he kept seeing this simultaneously. Two thoughts enter his mind thought number one, this can't be an accident.

Speaker 5:          10:40          If it was a accident, it should be rand thought number two. Wait a second. This has to be an accident because I hadn't been taught by experts. It's cells are, they will grow forever.

Speaker 1:          10:54          Okay. All right. Fast forward a few months. Those two conflicting thoughts are still fighting it out in Hayflick's mind. Along comes the annual biology

Speaker 5:          11:03          for the biggest scientific meeting in the world. That time the meeting was held in Atlantic city.

Speaker 1:          11:08          Hayflick and a few friends decide to hop in a car and crashed the meeting because the featured speaker was a guy. Hey flick really admired guy by the name of Ted puck

Speaker 5:          11:16          because I want to hear what he has to say and I'm gonna if I can get enough guts, I'm going to ask him a question. I remember distinctly it was a big whole house and people, I'm sure it's exaggeration, but huge are lots of people and I'm somewhere in a little listening to this talk. You see the match previously developed whereby single cells and at the end as is customary, asked for question. Are there any questions? I timidly raised my hand.

Speaker 1:          11:46          So yes. The young fellow was sent to you. Yes.

Speaker 5:          11:49          And I asked him the following question, Dr Puck, have you ever

Speaker 7:          11:54          found that the cells that you culture stop dividing?

Speaker 5:          12:00          Did you want to give him a kind of that? Gotcha. What were you thinking? I want, I was ready to publish. I wanted to know whether I'm in trouble, whether I have an artifact on my hands that nobody has seen because they do it right. I see. I'm still worried. Got It. And so he says he looks at me, you know, like in the video we'll of course

Speaker 7:          12:22          the cell stop dividing occasionally. Of course I lose myself occasionally, but I simply go back to the freezer and reconstitute it.

Speaker 1:          12:31          Meaning that when the cells stop dividing, which he just had been in, they do all the time. He just said, Eh, something happened. I don't know what. I'll just go back to the freezer and get, well that's not right. Because if they stopped dividing, they might've just died. It's not that he was cheating, it's that he thought he had screwed up.

Speaker 5:          12:46          Oh, then I know it was a Gotcha.

Speaker 1:          12:48          Well, he didn't yell. Gotcha. Right at that moment, he just sat back down. But now he knew it was real because even the brilliant Ted puck had seen it too, but like everyone else for the past 60 years, he just hadn't recognized it for what it was. I imagine in labs all over the country, there must've been a lot of moments when cells stop dividing and at every one of those moments you're saying the thought that popped into the technician's mind is

Speaker 5:          13:16          Yup, absolutely.

Speaker 1:          13:19          That seems like a crazy kind of mass delusion.

Speaker 5:          13:22          It's called dog Gerry. Another definition of the word dog. I've heard that word before. That's it. The concept of mortality was absent from people's minds.

Speaker 1:          13:33          Well, wait, if they didn't understand the idea of mortality, then how did they scientists exploring getting older and moving towards death for pre torpedoing? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          13:43          Radiation. What? Radiation?

Speaker 1:          13:46          Well, what do you mean? No, seriously? I mean it was this idea that like stuff is happening outside the cell, that the radiation is bombarding the cell, like gamma rays and Alpha rays and these kinds of things. Okay. And then that somehow ages the cell. So the trigger is outside the being not inside this owl in, right.

Speaker 5:          14:02          My discovery and I pointed it out that first paper was to indicate that it's in the cell, not outside the cell. That's where the action is.

Speaker 1:          14:11          Hayflick argued that somewhere in the cell there, there's a counter one too. There's gotta be for something on sale is the keeping track eight nine 10 11 because after about nine months of happy dividing in a petri dish, when the cell gets to 50 divisions, sometimes the few takes more. If you takes less than 50 is the average and when it reaches 54 45 little counter inside cell 49 50 says, ah, 50 is the magic number. Where did this number 50 come from?

Speaker 5:          14:43          Ah, you'll have to ask God that question

Speaker 1:          14:45          nonetheless. Hayflick not God has his name forever attached to that number because it's known as the Hayflick limit.

Speaker 4:          14:58          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          14:59          Now, one of the interesting things hatefully told me while we looked at a secret stash of fetal cells in his garage is that there is a way to tinker with the cellular counter. If you lower the temperature by say, putting the sales in liquid nitrogen as he has the dividing one will get slower and slower and slower.

Speaker 8:          15:18          I don't know

Speaker 1:          15:20          until it stops at 250 degrees below zero, the cells will not divide and they won't die. They'll just wait for as long as you keep them frozen. The sales I have in my freezer, I've been frozen for 44 years, is that make them long. These cells are the longest frozen normal human cells in the world. The fetal cells these talking about incidentally, are the ones that he use to discover the Hayflick limit. He calls it WWI 38 what do we know about the mother of the fetus that created WWI 38 she was a Swedish woman and she wanted an abortion because she had many children and was very poor. Her husband was not a good father and uh, that's where this tissue came from. Here's the kicker. After the Hayflick limit experiments, these cells, this particular strain was used to incubate and produce vaccines, all different kinds. Polio, German, measles, measles, mumps, rabies, and anybody born in the last 50 years who's had any of these vaccines has had these cells in their body. The numbers of people who have benefited from these vaccines now exceed 1 billion people. That's billion with a B billion with a B. Wow. One aborted child creates a fleet of cells that vaccinate a billion people. Think about that for a second.

Speaker 1:          17:03          And is it true that that you have a cell and from, is it your daughter? Yes. I also have cells in there from the amnion of my daughters, Susan Hayflick. Do you keep them for purely scientific reasons or is it sort of like stamp collecting? You have them. Oh, well it would be is a scientist now herself and so I'll probably give the ampules to her so she can do it with a monk. She what she wishes. But You keep them because it's your daughter mostly? Yes. Mostly. Yeah, sure. Yeah. That's really sweet. Here's the interesting thing. Scientifically, if you were to warm these cells up, give them some food,

Speaker 8:          17:36          alright.

Speaker 1:          17:36          They'd start to divide again, five six and not only that, they pick up right where they left off. Oh. And even if you froze them again, 30 the 1615 doubling 16 and kept them that way, a thousand million years wouldn't matter because as soon as you unfroze them off, they'd go 1718 1920 on their way to 52 23 without missing a beat.

Speaker 5:          18:01          What does that tell you? Tells you that the cells, remember they have a memory.

Speaker 1:          18:06          Somehow the cell always remembers where it is in the count to 50 oh, the cells can't count. How did they do that? Oh, that's, and that was the next big question. So we set about to do a number of experiments. However, the next big breakthrough came in 1971 and not by Hayflick while he was doing his experiments in Philly, halfway across the world, the very same moment, a Russian name, Alexia Lubna cof was attending a lecture to lecture in the house. He flicks research and he left that lecture puzzled by this question that you asked. How do the cells remember? And when he, have you ever been in Moscow? Hmm. Well.

Speaker 5:          18:42          Anyhow, so he ended the Moscow subway station, went down to the railroad platform, and suddenly he had an insight. He had a brilliant insight. When he lifted the railroad track,

Speaker 1:          18:53          the first thing you thought was those tracks look a lot like DNA. If you take real attraction, you tuition, you got DNA. Okay, say it some DNA and that DNA job is to count to 50 and then yellow

Speaker 9:          19:05          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          19:05          Well, we know part of the DNA has the job of yelling, but the other stuff, the rest of it, what if it's just a long sequence of nonsense? Nonsense. What if every time that cellular copier comes along to cut

Speaker 5:          19:18          you, you sell it, you lose one little piece of it.

Speaker 1:          19:24          The nonsense. Well, if you had seen 50 pieces of nonsense as a buffer around the cents part, the switch, well then it would take 50 copies to snit away all the nonsense until you left with the switch, which would turn on entail.

Speaker 9:          19:39          Listen to stop divine

Speaker 1:          19:45          back in Philadelphia. As we were wrapping up that first interview, a question occurred to me. If we kind of understand how that off switch works, shouldn't we theoretically be able to take her out? How to tinker with when the switch gets switched? In theory, I suppose you could. Yeah, sure. And within that allow us to have a longer amount of cell divisions. Well that certainly it doesn't violate any knowledge about the system of course. And wouldn't that theoretically give us something, whether it be extended life or something? Yes, certainly. Hey, flickered clearly been asked this question a million times and he patiently explained to me that there is a way right now that we can tinker with the timing of the switch. You take an enzyme called telomerase, telomerase, throw it into the mix and every time that cell gets copied and loses pieces of track, the telomerase enzyme comes along and adds and back on [inaudible] and maintains the length constant. That way the track is always long. The stop switch never gets switched and the cell can keep going,

Speaker 5:          20:46          going and going.

Speaker 5:          20:48          That's how they become a mortal. So you're not going to tell me, well, let's inoculate everybody with Tom Rice. Yeah. And, well, if you volunteer, we'll have a shot at it. Are you ready there? There must be. If I were to go out and shout from you, how can you right here, get a hundred people who would want to try only not after. I tell you what, you still don't know. What's that? 95% of all tumors contain telomerase, which normal cells do not contain the single most distinguishing criteria between normal and cancer cells. No, today is that fact.

Speaker 1:          21:28          So the tradeoff for cellular immortality, at least in this case, is cancer. But here's the weird thing. If you look around, you will see that our Hayflick limit of 50 is not the only one. We do know that if you look at the normal cells of a Galapagos tortoise, which has been reported in the literature, uh, they undergo about 125 doublings, if I remember correctly. So their Hayflick number is one 25 and ours is 50, apparently. Yes. Does that correlate to the, the Galapagos turtle living twice as long? Well, it's the same. It seems too, but that comparison may be anecdotal. I'm not universal. That's what Hayflick is up to these days. He's become fascinated by animals who age differently than us, who might have a doubling limit of, you know, 200 500 or no limit at all. There are the whole class of animals that don't age will get like what the American lobster lobster doesn't age either does not age or the rate is so slow. We can't measure it. I don't even know how to imagine that. What does that mean? That it does? What it means is that the animal gets bigger and bigger, which is growth. Yes. There are lobsters that have been found. I are recently, I read about one of those over 50 pounds.

Speaker 6:          22:48          Hm.

Speaker 1:          22:51          I looked it up. The largest lobster ever reported was close to yes. 50 pounds found in the 1950s just off the coast of New Jersey. New Jersey. Yeah. Hi, Ho fit. How old is a 50 pound lobster? Who known vacation was wearing a Grover Cleveland for president button. So y'all, I'm Jad, I've been riding I prequel [inaudible] this is radio lab will be.
