00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.560
Newton's First Law tells
us that an object at rest

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.096
will stay at rest, and object
with a constant velocity

00:00:07.096 --> 00:00:08.720
will keep having that
constant velocity

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.420
unless it's affected by
some type of net force.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.620
Or you actually could say an
object with constant velocity

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.130
will stay having a
constant velocity

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.930
unless it's affected
by net force.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.140
Because really, this
takes into consideration

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.040
the situation where
an object is at rest.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.750
You could just have
a situation where

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.700
the constant velocity is zero.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.220
So Newton's First
Law, you're going

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.600
to have your constant velocity.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.360
It could be zero.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.318
It's going to stay being
that constant velocity

00:00:34.318 --> 00:00:35.930
unless it's affected,
unless there's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.600
some net force that acts on it.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.430
So that leads to the
natural question,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.210
how does a net force affect
the constant velocity?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.930
Or how does it affect of
the state of an object?

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.920
And that's what Newton's
Second Law gives us.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.010
So Newton's Second
Law of Motion.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.198
And this one is maybe
the most famous.

00:01:03.198 --> 00:01:04.739
They're all kind of
famous, actually.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.220
I won't pick favorites here.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.970
But this one gives us
the famous formula force

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.830
is equal to mass
times acceleration.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.030
And acceleration is
a vector quantity,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.487
and force is a vector quantity.

00:01:19.487 --> 00:01:21.320
And what it tells us--
because we're saying,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.694
OK, if you apply
a force it might

00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:24.090
change that constant velocity.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.990
But how does it change
that constant velocity?

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.030
Well, let's say I have
a brick right here,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.250
and it is floating in space.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.725
And it's pretty nice for us
that the laws of the universe--

00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:37.850
or at least in the classical
sense, before Einstein

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.975
showed up-- the laws of
the universe actually dealt

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:42.030
with pretty simple mathematics.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.675
What it tells us is if
you apply a net force,

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:49.300
let's say, on this
side of the object--

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.120
and we talk about net force,
because if you apply two forces

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.940
that cancel out and that
have zero net force, then

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.100
the object won't change
its constant velocity.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.670
But if you have a
net force applied

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.950
to one side of this
object, then you're

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.920
going to have a net acceleration
going in the same direction.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950
So you're going to have
a net acceleration going

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.710
in that same direction.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.330
And what Newton's
Second Law of Motion

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.070
tells us is that acceleration
is proportional to the force

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.370
applied, or the force
applied is proportional

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.840
to that acceleration.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.870
And the constant
of proportionality,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.745
or to figure out what you have
to multiply the acceleration by

00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:26.120
to get the force, or what you
have to divide the force by

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.440
to get the acceleration,
is called mass.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.600
That is an object's mass.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.670
And I'll make a
whole video on this.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.670
You should not confuse
mass with weight.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.680
And I'll make a whole
video on the difference

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.690
between mass and weight.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.980
Mass is a measure of
how much stuff there is.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.445
Now, that we'll
see in the future.

00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:49.320
There are other things
that we don't normally

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.810
consider stuff that
does start to have mass.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.429
But for our classical, or at
least a first year physics

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:55.970
course, you could
really just imagine

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.650
how much stuff there is.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.820
Weight, as we'll see
in a future video,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.980
is how much that stuff
is being pulled down

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.530
by the force of gravity.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.190
So weight is a force.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.230
Mass is telling you how
much stuff there is.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.930
And this is really neat that
this formula is so simple,

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.050
because maybe we could have
lived in a universe where force

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.250
is equal to mass squared
times acceleration times

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.750
the square root of acceleration,
which would've made all

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.437
of our math much
more complicated.

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:26.020
But it's nice.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.070
It's just this constant
of proportionality right

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.090
over here.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.300
It's just this nice
simple expression.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.200
And just to get our feet wet
a little bit with computations

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.350
involving force, mass,
and acceleration,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.470
let's say that I have a force.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.640
And the unit of force
is appropriately

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.350
called the newton.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.050
So let's say I have a
force of 10 newtons.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.130
And just to be clear, a
newton is the same thing

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.302
as 10 kilogram meters
per second squared.

00:04:02.302 --> 00:04:04.760
And that's good that a newton
is the same thing as kilogram

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.176
meters per second squared,
because that's exactly what you

00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:09.780
get on this side of the formula.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.620
So let's say I have a
force of 10 newtons,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.400
and it is acting on a mass.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.646
Let's say that the
mass is 2 kilograms.

00:04:18.646 --> 00:04:20.145
And I want to know
the acceleration.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.750
And once again, in this video,
these are vector quantities.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.270
If I have a positive
value here, we're

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.900
going to make the assumption
that it's going to the right.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.483
If I had a negative value, then
it would be going to the left.

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:37.270
So implicitly I'm
giving you not only

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.029
the magnitude of the
force, but I'm also

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.070
giving you the direction.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.200
I'm saying it is to the
right, because it is positive.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.590
So what would be acceleration?

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.740
Well we just use f equals ma.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.952
You have, on the
left hand side, 10.

00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:52.410
I could write 10
newtons here, or I

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.830
could write 10 kilogram
meters per second squared.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.830
And that is going to be
equal to the mass, which

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.293
is 2 kilograms times
the acceleration.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.620
And then to solve
for the acceleration,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.200
you just divide both
sides by 2 kilograms.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.310
So let's divide the
left by 2 kilograms.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.370
Let me do it this way.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.810
Let's divide the
right by 2 kilograms.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.180
That cancels out.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.040
The 10 and the 2, 10
divided by 2 is 5.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.260
And then you have kilograms
canceling with kilograms.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.430
Your left hand side, you get
5 meters per second squared.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.450
And then that's equal
to your acceleration.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:46.250
Now just for fun, what happens
if I double that force?

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.790
Well then I have 20 newtons.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.410
Well, I'll actually work it out.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.870
Then I have 20 kilogram
meters per second squared

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.910
is equal to-- I'll
have to color code--

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.960
2 kilograms times
the acceleration.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.160
Divide both sides by 2
kilograms, and what do we get?

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.330
Cancels out.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.410
20 divided by 2 is 10.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.520
Kilograms cancel kilograms.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.300
And so we have the
acceleration, in this situation,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.140
is equal to 10 meters
per second squared

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.100
is equal to the acceleration.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.500
So when we doubled the force--
we went from 10 newtons

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.780
to 20 newtons-- the
acceleration doubled.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.500
We went from 5 meters
per second squared

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.150
to 10 meters per second squared.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.440
So we see that they are
directly proportional,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.210
and the mass is that how
proportional they are.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.660
And so you could imagine what
happens if we double the mass.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.150
If we double the mass in this
situation with 20 newtons,

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.430
then we won't be dividing
by 2 kilograms anymore.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.640
We'll be dividing
by 4 kilograms.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.060
And so then we'll have 20
divided by 4, which would be 5

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.990
and would be meters
per second squared.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.100
So if you make the mass
larger, if you double it,

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.250
then your acceleration
would be half as much.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.967
So the larger the mass
you have, the more force

00:07:03.967 --> 00:07:05.050
you need to accelerate it.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.820
Or for a given force, the less
that it will accelerate it,

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.923
the harder it is to change
its constant velocity.
