1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,820
Okay, now it's my left ear. Hello Soren.
How are you? Good. How are you doing?

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,450
I'm good. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.
I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

3
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,210
And so far we've been talking about the
value of our lives and then the value of

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:16,800
other people's lives.
Next up, the value of

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,210
[inaudible]

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,560
everything, all of it. Everything. Re
think I'm by everything. Of course.

7
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:29,000
We mean the value of nature.
That's Carl Zimmer, science writer,

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,830
regular blower of minds.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,390
So we think of ecosystems as
just kind of sitting there.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,320
Um, actually they're doing things.
They weren't doing them for us.

11
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:44,240
We would have to pay to do
them artificially. For example,

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,190
cotton farms in south Texas. So you
know, the farmers are doing their thing.

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,560
Like this Guy James Parker plant in their
cotton. They're collecting it. Yeah,

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,710
I farmed about, I don't know, usually
five to six, 700 acres of cotton.

15
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:59,710
So say 2000 bales. They're
doing what farmers do.

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,130
I spent a lot of time on a tractor and uh,

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,160
you have to check your water every
morning, every evening. Meanwhile,

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,930
they have all this extra
help in the air. Yes,

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,410
they have bats. How many bats are
out there? You really don't know.

20
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,710
Flying all around the bats
eat the equivalent of two
thirds of their own weight

21
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,330
in insects every night. Wow.
They eat all night long.

22
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,590
All kinds of bugs.

23
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,060
A whole bunch of pests that would
otherwise be eating the cotton. No.

24
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:32,140
A few years ago,

25
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,190
guy named John Westfall did a calculation
just to see how this arrangement was

26
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:39,190
working out. He came out to my
farm and did it. He did a study,

27
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,250
he had some college girls that worked for
him and those girls were out there all

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,350
hours of the night listening to what the
baths were saying and here the farmers

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,520
collectively, they make about four
or $5 million off of the these farms.

30
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,190
The question was how much of
this was because of the batch?

31
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,940
Cause you know baths are
natural pesticides, you know
the more they're eating.

32
00:01:59,210 --> 00:01:59,270
Alyssa,

33
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,860
I got a spray and here's what the
scientists figured out out of four to $5

34
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,330
million, it was around $700,000
that you could describe to the bats.

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,610
It's just beautiful. Wow. I mean,

36
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:13,700
it does make me think that
if you're those farmers,

37
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,130
you should be compensating
the bets. Yeah. Well, yeah,

38
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,700
it does give you a glimpse at
the kind of scale of value,

39
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,080
economic value that nature has that
we generally just totally ignore.

40
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,150
But we talked to a guy who didn't
ignore it. My name is Robert Costanza.

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,080
In fact, he took this way of
thinking to the absolute limit. Yes.

42
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,010
So the question was what's the value
of all of these ecosystem services

43
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,270
globally? All the services on earth?
Yeah, it's bugs. Eating leaves, worms,

44
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:49,330
turning the soil needles,
chewing tree stump,

45
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,070
or always protecting cities
during storms, everything.

46
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,480
We tried to synthesize all of the studies
that had been done around the country

47
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:59,860
in the world, like that bat study, except
they didn't just look cotton farms,

48
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:03,010
they looked at tropical forests,
rivers and lakes, coral reefs,

49
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,880
coastal wetlands, and then wetlands,
the ocean woodlands, temporary forest,

50
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,530
you know, it goes on and on grasslands,

51
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,750
it's supposed to be some
excel spreadsheet. It's,

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,110
it's kind of the excel spreadsheet
from hell. It can get tricky.

53
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,110
So Constanza and his colleagues
took all these different studies.

54
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,540
Some of them together did
a whole bunch of half and

55
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,780
came up with a number,

56
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,110
which in today's dollars is 142 point
$7 trillion per year of services.

57
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,470
That's more than all of the ghosts
national products of the world.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,700
That's how valuable the
services of nature are. Yeah.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,640
Let me ask you, like I get the, I get
the way this would work with a bat,

60
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,840
like the bats eating the bugs,

61
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:50,490
but like how do you do
it with like with like a,

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,640
like a field or something? Like do you
just walk through and you're like, Oh,

63
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:55,890
that's 20 bucks of services. That's 50.

64
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:58,730
Like how do you even figure out what
the services are? Well, uh, they,

65
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:00,770
they came up with a list. A,

66
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,840
so the list kind of depends on the
ecosystem you're talking about because

67
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:10,560
different ecosystems provide
different services. For example, uh,

68
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,170
a salt marsh and we are in the water.

69
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,190
You're in the water.
What is it? A salt marsh?

70
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:20,780
Is that like the Florida
wetlands? But Salty,

71
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,110
I have suddenly don't know what
a salt marshes, salt marshes are.

72
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:26,110
Wetlands that are on
the coast. Got It. Yeah.

73
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,130
We're standing in about
a foot of water here.

74
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:31,380
We're quickly approaching high
tide Lisa and one of our producers,

75
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,400
Simon Adler to a nearby salt
marsh, partially the Hasan.

76
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,990
Your boots are much more water,
but really to talk to this guy.

77
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,550
My name is Adam Welchol and I'm the
director of science for the Nature

78
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,480
Conservancy here in Connecticut.

79
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,340
And Adam gave Simon a kind of inventory
of some of the services provided by

80
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,960
coastal salt marshes.

81
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,900
It's a stream of goods and
services with confided over time.

82
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,110
One of the things that does is it takes
water that's coming in from inland and

83
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:02,750
that laden with all sorts of
pollutants, all sorts of bad stuff.

84
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:06,050
The salt marsh will trap that water so
that the plutons settle and then very

85
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:11,051
often the marsh grass will suck up that
water into their roots and clean it up.

86
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,720
Yup. So you could ask very simply,

87
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,280
how much would you have to spend to
keep your water that clean second.

88
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,890
Well, there is one other study
I want to add them. Well,

89
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:24,650
she'll said that scientists in New
England have already figured that out. Uh,

90
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,970
for flood control, water supply
protection, pollution control,

91
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,680
it's roughly about $31 and
22 cents per Hector per year.

92
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,550
Then you've got to add the value of all
the plants that could meet the fished.

93
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,800
It ended up on our dinner
plate, $338 annually per acre.

94
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,090
And they're the birdwatchers that buy
lattes and support the local economy or

95
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,080
$190 per Hector. And then
there's habitat provisioning.

96
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,730
The list goes on and on and on and on.

97
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,300
You do get kind of obsessed with it and
you start like you started becoming an

98
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:58,220
accountant and writing down numbers
just furiously. Um, and uh, it

99
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,170
gets you to think about nature in a
different way than you had before.

100
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,320
There's this galling element
though, or this aspect.

101
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:08,630
Like when I first came
across the, at this point,

102
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:11,840
our producer Tim Howard jumped into
the interview and you'll also hear our

103
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,490
producers sworn wheeler in just a second.

104
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,270
I do feel like in an example like
the salt marsh, which cleans water,

105
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,600
that's all reliant on people
being there that need the water.

106
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:24,770
So if you didn't have people there, does
that Salt Marsh Sisa have any value.

107
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,670
But Tim, haven't you ever
had a conversation with
somebody who just doesn't get,

108
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,530
like if you make the aesthetic argument,
which is that nature should be,

109
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,060
should be preserved for its own sake.
There's a whole category of humanity.

110
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:42,170
It just doesn't respond to that argument
is this becomes a way to talk across

111
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:43,070
the aisle,

112
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,750
but it does still feel like it demotes
something of infinite value to something

113
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,670
of a piddly valley and really be infinite
value. I mean, like a mother's love.

114
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,920
You don't think your mother's love
is priceless. I mean, you know,

115
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,770
okay,

116
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,770
I totally accept that there is this
sort of priceless aspect of nature.

117
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,930
But if you are in the government
in a very poor country,

118
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,190
you have some tough choices to make. If
somebody comes to you and says, okay,

119
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:15,100
you've got these lovely mangroves
now. Uh, it turns out that that the,

120
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,770
the sort of setting where the mangroves
are is the perfect place for shrimp

121
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,580
aquaculture

122
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,550
because shrimp farms
need lots of seawater,

123
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,080
so it makes sense to put them by the seat.

124
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,140
We're going to put in these
farms, we're going to grow shrimp.

125
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,650
You are going to get New Orleans and
millions of dollars in tax revenue.

126
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,180
If you're thinking about the, the welfare
of all the people in your country,

127
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,160
many of whom are starving,

128
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,460
that might be a really powerful
argument into that kind of a discussion.

129
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,890
You can bring in the fact that these
mangroves are sitting there very quietly

130
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,510
doing all sorts of incredibly
valuable things. In fact,

131
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:54,720
they've done these kind of
calculations and in some cases,

132
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:00,140
the services that mangroves provide are
four times more valuable than what you

133
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:04,760
could get out with shrimp. So it's
stupid. It's just stupid in a bay.

134
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:06,950
A very basic sense too.

135
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,880
Wantonly replaced lots of
mangroves with shrimp aquaculture.

136
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,340
Is that a hypothetical situation? No,
that's a no, that's what we're asked.

137
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,710
This is Glenn Marie Lang.

138
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:21,180
She's an environmental economist for the
World Bank and she says very often she

139
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:23,790
finds herself in exactly
this kind of conversation,

140
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,600
particularly, you know, I
work for the World Bank,

141
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:30,890
so our primary clients are our
governments, Philippines, Vietnam,

142
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:34,330
and when you're talking to a minister
of finance and saying, you know what,

143
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,360
you I know jobs are jobs, but you
need those marshes, they have value.

144
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,550
They'll say, well, yeah, that's true,

145
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:43,970
but that means I'm going to have to
reduce the money that I put into the

146
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,200
education budget.

147
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,040
So you've got to really make a
strong argument about the benefits.

148
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,130
That's really where the rubber
hits the road. Well, I mean that's,

149
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,010
here's the counter argument.
It comes Doug McCauley and

150
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,520
ecologist of the University
of California, Santa Barbara.

151
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,920
The real danger is that we
actually succeed, that we,

152
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,550
we convince people that nature is
valuable because it makes money.

153
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:07,730
And then where we're really in trouble
in the many instances where it doesn't

154
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:10,070
make us money back, what do
you do in a situation? He says,

155
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:14,780
where say a bunch of rivers are running
dry and they're depreciating in value.

156
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,000
You know, by the same logic
that you train me to think with,

157
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,340
we should go out and liquidate
these natural assets.

158
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,690
That makes me feel really
uncomfortable. He says,

159
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,530
just kind of a weird way
to think about nature.

160
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,510
We had a proposal here in the state of
California to make gay marriage legal and

161
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,010
economists had a look at this legislation
and said this is expected to generate

162
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,400
$163 million annually for
the state of California. Um,

163
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,380
well it's good to know that.

164
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,060
I appreciate having that
information in front of me. However,

165
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:46,700
when I'm making a decision
on this legislation,

166
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:50,900
and I would say that when many
legislators, voters, average citizens,

167
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,310
so we considering the issues at hand,

168
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,540
they're not thinking about whether
they're going to make $160 million for the

169
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,810
state that are thinking about a different
set of values. On the other hand,

170
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:00,620
I want to say,

171
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,640
and this is based on my experience
working in developing countries,

172
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,810
that when you don't put a
value on these services,

173
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,970
basically they don't get counted.

174
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,320
They get implicitly assigned a value
of zero according to Glen Marie Lang,

175
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,500
and as we were debating this and going
back and forth and back and forth,

176
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,760
we bumped into a story about what
happens when all of these value of nature

177
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:28,761
ideas are let loose into a world of
fruits and trees and human uncertainty.

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,540
[inaudible]

179
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,600
the parable of the bees. We
heard this first from writer,

180
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,030
JB McKinnon who says the story begins
in Mao County in central China,

181
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,920
rural area, fairly remote,

182
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,270
lush green mountains filled
with apple orchards and a apple.

183
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:50,100
Orcharding was the main business and
according to JB in in the 1990s the wild

184
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:53,610
bees of Mao county slowly
started to disappear.

185
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,630
Am

186
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,660
there a few different
reasons given for that?

187
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,260
That could have been the destruction of
the habitat that the bees nested in the

188
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,470
heavy honey harvesting that wasn't
leaving enough food for the bees.

189
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,060
But the prevailing theory is actually
an economic one because in the 1990s as

190
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:12,280
China was shifting to
a market based economy,

191
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,000
apple producers were under
pressure to produce more apples.

192
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,980
So they started spraying pesticide
probably it was a constellation of all of

193
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:25,390
those things in a few others, a end
result is a stopped buzzing in Mal county,

194
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,470
which if you are an apple
farmer, that's a disaster.

195
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,040
As bees travel from flower to flower
in search of nectar, they are,

196
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,620
they're dusted with pollen,

197
00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:39,730
which is the means by which flowers
engage in sexual intercourse.

198
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,600
So if you don't have the bees making
the birds and the bees on the blossoms,

199
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,160
then um, Ben, you don't get
fertile flowers to turn into,

200
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:49,000
to turn into fruit.

201
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,240
And obviously if you're a fruit
farmer and you have no fruit to sell,

202
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:56,590
you have no, so what do you do?

203
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,300
You're an apple farmer
and you don't have bees.

204
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,960
Then you need to find some other
way to pollinate the flowers.

205
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,120
And I guess they concluded, well we'll
have to do that ourselves by hand.

206
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,580
In Mandarin Chinese we say [inaudible]
show fan, so it would basically a,

207
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,620
that means a manual putting nation.

208
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,700
This is Harold t boat.

209
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,380
I'm a correspondent in China
for the French newspaper alone.

210
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,470
A couple years ago you heard about
the apple farmers in Mal County,

211
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:27,460
so he flies to Chengdu and he and a
friend hop in a car and we drive for like

212
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,970
five or six hours until we reach a this
village and mansion tiny little village

213
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,350
like around the a few houses. And then
we took our smaller roads in between the,

214
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,420
the fields and uh,

215
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,770
we actually saw that there were lots
of farmers in the, in the trees,

216
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,780
like on the apple trees traveling

217
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,850
on these often fin and spindly branches,

218
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,970
men and women that I've
seen in photos. In any case,

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,210
Harold and his friend took pictures
and if you look at those pictures,

220
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:58,760
you'll see the farmers
holding little brush,

221
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,080
little pollen brush that
they'd constructed using
things like chopsticks and

222
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,390
chicken feathers and cigarette filters.

223
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,690
And they'd have a little bottle filled
with pollen. And then what they do,

224
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,920
they dip the brush into the bottle and
they paint a flower blossom with the

225
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:13,730
pollen.

226
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,850
They dip the brush back into the pollen
and they paint the next flower blossom

227
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:19,970
again and then they dip the brush back
in again and they paint again and it dip

228
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:21,830
again. And they been
to make sure that that

229
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,960
all of the blossoms that they could
possibly fertilize would be fertilized so

230
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:27,520
that they would go onto produce fruit.

231
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,490
We're talking hundreds and
hundreds of flowers per tree.

232
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,760
It was very strange to see,
uh, uh, humans doing the,

233
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,520
the job of the bees. God,
what a pain in the ass

234
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,840
that sounds like. Yeah. The image of this,

235
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,960
of these Chinese orchardists standing up
in these spindly trees traveled around

236
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,050
the world through
environmental circles and it,

237
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,100
the message that it seemed
to send was that, you know,

238
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,220
this is what happens if you,
if you lose biodiversity,

239
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,730
you end up standing in the trees doing
the job that the bees used to do on the

240
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:00,750
wing for free,

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,020
for free. Those people just like human bs.

242
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,120
But then this guy interests the story.
This is Ian Son. Chen. Yeah. Human bees.

243
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,890
Four years ago he traveled to Mal county
to do a sort of economic analysis of

244
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:18,580
just how much the loss of the bees
was hurting the farmers of Mao county.

245
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,100
But what he discovered weirdly was that
the trees were producing more apples

246
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,530
than ever. Well,
production oil production,

247
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,690
this can be a confirmed zone.
More production for hand,

248
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:35,170
pawn nation, uh, apple chase
and uh, be punish apple tree.

249
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,300
You'll miss I'm white patient. Really

250
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,890
evil. We're doing it better
than the bees had been doing it.

251
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,440
Yes, a lot better.
Fruit production went up

252
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,180
30%. That's what the farmers told you,

253
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,920
which is kind of amazing. The all
new word I remember. Amazing because

254
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,620
I think Hemphill nation
campaign, h Massarelli a,

255
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,420
they can pollinate every flower and
bees don't. Pauline. Every flower

256
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,500
bees are a little bit, uh, you
know, they're a little bit, uh,

257
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,060
uneven when on their, they
don't like it. If it's cold,

258
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:10,340
they don't like it. If it's
damp, uh, they don't like it.

259
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:12,050
If it's windy in all those cases,

260
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,720
bees often decide to stay indoors
and just take the day off.

261
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:19,680
But you send people out there and tell
them to pollinate every damn blossom and

262
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,543
they're going to do it.

263
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,530
And there was the additional
benefit of the people that you paid.

264
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,360
They'd go to the bar,
they'd buy groceries,

265
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:30,680
they'd spend those earnings in their
local communities in a way that obviously

266
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,053
bees never did.

267
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,240
So here you had this whole story that was
supposed to be about how important the

268
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:38,930
bees are and this whole parable of
biodiversity turns up maybe the lessons,

269
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:43,931
just the opposite that actually we
don't need bees and maybe we never did.

270
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,320
If we only measure things economically,
then we might conclude that that uh,

271
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,131
some species are,

272
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:54,131
some ecological processes just aren't
necessary in certain places or that we

273
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,750
might even do better to,

274
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,930
to take care of those processes ourselves.

275
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,980
Right. So let me find my notes
about the wages. Exactly.

276
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,660
But there's one more chapter to the story.

277
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,560
Heraldo told us that when he visited
and then chin, I talked with one farmer,

278
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,580
his name is a Zanes ago. Is
there a certain age and uh,

279
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,000
he said in his opinion, uh,

280
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,960
do the hand nation, uh,

281
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,280
may disappear in a few years.

282
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,890
Apparently as China's economy
has continued to grow,

283
00:16:25,891 --> 00:16:28,140
workers have started demanding better pay.

284
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,240
Xu wages are getting so high for the
workers that the farmers have to employ to

285
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:34,470
help them. Basically,

286
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:38,220
it's not efficient economically
to do the in nation anymore.

287
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,790
That's what a lot of farmers say this to
you. Now they're likely thinking, damn,

288
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,710
we need those bees back, right? Yeah.

289
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,430
Problem is there are no bees
are in those villages anymore.

290
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,910
One farmer told Harold beekeepers in
other parts of China aren't gonna bring

291
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:54,330
their bees to this area because they worry
about the pesticides that the farmers

292
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:57,150
have used. As for when
wild bees might come back,

293
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,920
whether for this we have a new idea. It's
very hard to make a prediction if you,

294
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,180
as the farmers, they're like, uh,
well, Bridget, oh, I don't know.

295
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,170
[inaudible]

296
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,600
here's where that story leaves me.

297
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,960
It leaves me thinking that economics
is just not a good way to go.

298
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,730
And putting an AARP a value,

299
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,060
even a even a precise and thoughtful
value on a bee or on a pound of pesticide.

300
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,630
You do it and you think you're
smart, but then the value changes,

301
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,720
the bees go from being worth a lot
to being worth nothing to being worth

302
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,740
everything all within a few years.
This, this is what markets do.

303
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:38,741
They swing back forth and we pretend
that we can predict but we never can.

304
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,940
So you can't put a value on cause you're
always going to be wrong or is it dumb?

305
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,580
When I, Winona I'm in love. I would
argue the other side for a second.

306
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,950
No where in the story did someone walk
into the middle of the proceedings and

307
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:50,580
say,

308
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,580
you know what, the bees do have
value. Here's the number. In fact,

309
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:56,010
you know Carl, when we were
talking to him, told us, you know,

310
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,480
there've been estimates that the value
of the pollination that comes from wild

311
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:04,260
bees is $190 billion. So
that's globally, right?

312
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:07,970
But still there was nobody in the
room giving that kind of number.

313
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:10,890
So the bees were inherently
valued at zero. But remember,

314
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:14,510
bees are valued at zero only until humans
get valued more than bees go down and

315
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,800
just go, I got to have a
lot of numbers in your head,

316
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:20,780
but here's what I like about this idea
is that when you put a number on a bee or

317
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:21,980
a bat or a marsh,

318
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,660
it's like an attempt to force a kind of
longterm thinking. You can't just say,

319
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:29,240
don't do that. I mean that's the thing
that like conservation to say don't,

320
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,930
don't, don't. But if you say don't
do that because here's the value,

321
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,030
here's the loss. Yeah, here's the loss.

322
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,070
Well then that actually gives
the whole precautionary,

323
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:40,040
don't think some teeth except for this,

324
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,160
that if you go businessy
on nature and you're wrong,

325
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,040
there are irreversibility [inaudible].
That's how environmental economists,

326
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,360
Glen Murray Lang boots.

327
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,360
This is one of the differences between
nature ecosystems and what we produce.

328
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,320
You smash your car, Hey, someone can
build a new one. If you lose the bees,

329
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,440
many instances you cannot bring them back.

330
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,900
So the question we got to is,

331
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,950
is there another way to think about
the value of nature in a way that's not

332
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,830
economic and therefore
shortsighted and all about us,

333
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,880
but also not simply about the
aesthetics and the beauty?

334
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,400
Cause that can be sort of limiting
too. Is there another way?

335
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,050
The Best I was able to do thinking
about this writer JB McKinnon again

336
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,120
was when it struck me that that in a way
all of this diversity that's out there,

337
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:31,950
all this biological diversity,

338
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:36,951
all these wonderful and amazing and
alien things that other species can do is

339
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:40,770
like an extension of our own brains.

340
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,400
There's so much imagination out there
that we simply could not come up with on

341
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:51,140
our own. That we can
think of it as as a, uh,

342
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,230
pool of imagination and creativity from
which we as humans are able to draw.

343
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,410
And that when we draw down on that,

344
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,610
on that pool of creativity
and imagination, we,

345
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,940
we deeply impoverish ourselves.
You know, in a sense we are,

346
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:13,180
we are doing harm to our
own ability to think and to,

347
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,270
and to, and to dream.

348
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,960
JB McKinnon's book is called the once
and future world. He's written many,

349
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:36,570
but this one is my fav
deep thanks to Carl Zimmer,

350
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,290
who's a reporting in the New York Times
on this topic is really what got us

351
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:44,040
launched into this whole thing and what
got us through this whole thing is Simon

352
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,960
Adler, who's production
assistants, was invaluable.

353
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:49,690
That was him freezing his ass off
in the marsh. I talked so long,

354
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,640
he nearly died. His toes fell off.

355
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,430
Anyway, thank you. So sir, thank you
Simon, and a thank you guys for listening.

356
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:02,890
I'm jet up and run. I remembered
[inaudible] we'll see you next time.
