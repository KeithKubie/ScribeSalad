00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.380
You have a box. A ring. And a marble.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.469
And they’re all at the top of a ramp. Because
you know how physics loves ramps.

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.839
Especially hypothetical ramps! So, let’s say this ramp would allow for static friction, but not kinetic friction.

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.530
Now, you let go of all of these objects at
the same time, so that the box starts sliding,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.980
and the ring and marble start rolling, all
at once.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.240
So, which of them will hit the bottom first?

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.210
The answer might not be what you’d expect.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.130
I mean, we already know that when you drop
two objects from the same height -- in a vacuum

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.090
at least -- they’ll hit the ground at the same time. Even if you tried it with a feather and a bowling ball.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.650
So you might think that all of the objects
would get to the bottom of the ramp at the same time.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.120
But they won’t.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.310
The reason has to do with how energy is distributed
in an object when it’s rolling.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.340
And in order to understand who wins the ramp-race, and why, we have to investigate some qualities of rotational motion:

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.240
Specifically, torque, and the moment of inertia.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:04.160
[Theme Music]

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.280
Have you ever tightened a bolt with a wrench?

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.180
Or pulled a door open?
Me too!

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.360
When we do those things, the wrench and the
door’s handle do their jobs using torque.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.180
That is, they apply a force perpendicular to the axis of rotation, which makes the bolt turn and door swing open.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.580
That’s what torque does -- it makes things
rotate faster or slower.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.310
In other words, torque changes an object’s
angular velocity.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.560
For the first few weeks of this course, we described net forces as changing an object’s linear velocity,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.260
how fast it moves through
space, and in what direction.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.480
Torque essentially does the same thing, but
for rotational motion.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.720
This means that a lot of the relationships and equations that apply to forces will apply to torque in a similar way.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.740
But first, let’s talk about how to calculate torque, by analyzing what happens when you open a door.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.880
The harder you pull on the handle, the more torque you’ll generate, and the more you’ll change the door’s angular velocity.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.060
More net torque then, means the door
starts moving faster on its hinges.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.900
So, the strength of the force that’s applied
is one factor that affects torque.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.140
Another is the distance between the force
and the axis of rotation -- or the radius.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.500
A larger radius means more torque.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.300
You know this if you’ve ever tried opening a door with a handle that’s too close to the hinge.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.789
I’m guessing you haven’t tried
that, though, because there’s a reason doorknobs

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.640
are generally placed far from the hinges.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.580
A door with a handle close to the hinges would
be much harder to open, because you get less

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.590
torque for the same amount of force.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.450
The last factor that affects torque is the
ANGLE BETWEEN the applied force and the radius.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.890
If you tried to open the door by pulling the
handle, say, parallel to the door --

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.190
in the direction opposite from the hinges --
the door wouldn’t move.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.850
Because the only part of the force that affects
the door’s rotation is the force that’s

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.380
Perpendicular to the radius.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.349
To put this idea in mathematical terms, torque
-- represented by the Greek letter tau -- is

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.970
equal to the perpendicular force, times the
radius.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.870
And, you know how we keep saying that for
translational motion, a net force on an object

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.310
is equal to its acceleration times its mass?

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.090
Well, something similar applies to rotational
motion, too:

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.140
The net torque on an object is equal to its angular acceleration, times what’s known as its moment of inertia.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.879
Now, we’ve talked about inertia before,
at least as it relates to translational motion.

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.279
Basically, it’s an object’s tendency to
keep doing what it’s been doing.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.599
An object with lots of inertia is harder to speed up or slow down.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.129
And in translational motion, the inertia of
an object depends on mass.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.929
The MOMENT OF INERTIA works in a somewhat
similar way for rotational motion …

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.360
but the best way to define is mathematically.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.239
Specifically, the moment of inertia is the
sum of all the individual points of mass in

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.940
an object, times the square of their distance
from the axis of rotation.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.360
So, much in the same way that inertia relates
to an object’s mass in translational motion…

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.980
… the moment of inertia relates to mass,
too, but it depends on how that mass is distributed.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.420
The farther away the mass is from the axis
of rotation, the higher the object’s moment of inertia.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.090
It’s possible to derive the equation for
an object’s moment of inertia,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.340
by integrating the square of the object’s radius over its mass.

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.360
But those integrals can get complicated.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.500
So this is one of those rare cases where,
if you’re asked to solve problems using

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.280
moments of inertia and you don’t have access
to the equations, it’s probably worth memorizing them.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.930
Now, there’s another thing that torques
and forces have in common,

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.090
and it’s going to be the key to figuring out which object wins the race down the ramp.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.120
Namely: torques, like forces, have the ability
to do work.

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.269
As you might remember from our episode on
work and energy, the work done by a force

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.049
is just the integral of that force over a
certain distance.

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.709
In a similar way, the work done by a torque
is the integral of that torque over a certain angle.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.919
Meaning: the more torque you apply while rotating
an object, the more work you do.

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.519
We also know that work changes the
energy of a system.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.979
For example, it can change its kinetic energy, which is the energy of its motion.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.740
In the case of objects that move without rotating, all of that kinetic energy goes into translational motion.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.580
In this case, keep in mind that -- as we’ve
gone over before -- the kinetic energy of

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.139
translational motion is equal to half of the
object’s mass, times its velocity squared.

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.599
But when an object is ROTATING, some of its
kinetic energy is also taking the form of Rotational Motion.

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.919
And calculating the kinetic energy of rotational
motion is pretty easy.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.720
Because, first, the moment of inertia affects rotational motion in the same way that mass affects translational motion.

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.159
And second, rotating objects have angular
velocity, just as translating objects have linear velocity.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.720
So, the kinetic energy of an object’s rotational motion is just half of its moment of inertia, times its angular velocity squared.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.400
OK, there’s just one final factor we have to consider, before we finally get back to the box, the marble, and the ring racing down the ramp:

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.260
And that factor is angular momentum.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.599
We’ve talked about linear momentum -- and
how it’s equal to an object’s mass times its velocity.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.040
Well, there’s also angular momentum, which is equal to an object’s moment of inertia times its angular velocity.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.460
And, like linear momentum, angular momentum
is always conserved.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.620
That’s another one of those super-fundamental principles of physics:

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.680
You can’t create or destroy angular momentum. It always has to go somewhere.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.999
So, now, let’s get back to The Great Crash
Course Physics Ramp Race.

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:45.619
All three objects -- the box, the marble,
and the ring -- are covering the same distance.

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:48.649
And what we want to know is, how fast do they
cover that distance?

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:52.809
The answer has to do with what happens to
each object’s energy as it moves down the ramp.

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:57.800
When they’re at the top of the ramp, all the energy of each object takes the form of gravitational potential energy,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.760
which is equal to the object’s mass, times small g, times the height of the ramp.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.480
As they move down the ramp, all of that potential
energy gradually gets converted into kinetic energy.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.720
In the case of the box, all of its potential energy will be converted to translational kinetic energy,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.740
because that’s the only
kind of motion it has.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.100
So the object that gets to the bottom of the ramp first is … the box!

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.780
Because, for both the marble and the ring, some of their potential energy gets converted into rotational kinetic energy.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.939
And energy that goes into their rotation isn’t
being used to make them move faster down the ramp.

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:31.419
So really, anything that slides -- at least
on our hypothetical ramp with no kinetic friction

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.789
-- will reach the bottom before anything that
rolls.

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:37.569
And the masses of the objects don’t even
matter, because the energy of an object with

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.639
more or less mass will increase or decrease
accordingly.

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.809
So, the box wins.

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:42.729
But what’s the runner-up?

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.101
Does the ring reach the bottom next, or does
the marble?

00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:50.100
That question is a little more complicated, but it turns out that the marble reaches the bottom before the ring,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.560
because it has a lower
moment of inertia.

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:56.360
The marble is a solid sphere, so its mass
is distributed closer to its center.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.169
But the ring’s mass is distributed in a,
well, ring -- so its mass is distributed far

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.909
from its center, giving it a higher moment
of inertia.

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:06.249
What does that mean for the marble’s speed
versus the ring’s?

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:11.059
Well, since the marble has a smaller moment
of inertia, its velocity can take up a larger

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:14.689
proportion of its kinetic energy -- which
means it moves faster down the ramp.

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:15.899
So, the final results of the race?

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:19.209
The box wins, the marble comes in second,
and the ring finishes last.

00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:22.869
Today, you learned about torque, and how it
relates to an object’s angular acceleration

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:27.319
and its moment of inertia. We also talked
about how to calculate moments of inertia,

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:31.479
angular momentum, and the fact that torques
can do work. Finally, we figured out what

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:34.779
would happen if you let a box, marble, and
ring move down a ramp.
