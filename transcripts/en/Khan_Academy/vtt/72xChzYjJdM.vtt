00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.263
- [Teacher] We're given
a differential equation

00:00:01.263 --> 00:00:02.875
right over here, cosine of y plus two,

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:04.319
this whole thing times the derivative

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.140
of y with respect to x is equal to two x,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.282
and we're given that for
a particular solution,

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:12.364
when x is equal to one, y
of one is equal to zero,

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:15.982
and we're asked what is
x when y is equal to pi?

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.410
So the first thing I like to look at

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.317
when I see a differential
equation is: is it separable?

00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:23.123
Can I get all the ys and dys on one side,

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.426
and can I get all the xs
and dxs on the other side?

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.165
And this one seems like it is.

00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:30.748
If I multiply both sides by dx,

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:34.986
where you can view dx
as the x differential

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:37.177
of an infinitely small change in x,

00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:39.677
well, then you get cosine of y

00:00:41.543 --> 00:00:45.543
plus two times dy is
equal to two x times dx,

00:00:49.487 --> 00:00:51.529
so just like that I would've
been able to, all I did is

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:54.565
I multiplied both sides of this times dx,

00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:56.545
and I was able to separate
the ys and the dys

00:00:56.545 --> 00:01:01.483
from the xs and the dxs, and
now I can integrate both sides.

00:01:01.483 --> 00:01:05.726
So, if I integrate both
sides, what am I going to get?

00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:09.893
So the antiderivative of
cosine of y with respect to y,

00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:14.566
with respect to y, is sine of y,

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:19.250
and then the antiderivative
of 2 with respect to y is 2y,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.475
and that is going to be equal to,

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:26.536
well, the antiderivative
of 2x with respect to x is

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:30.442
x squared, and we can't forget
that we could say a plus

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:32.582
a different constant on either side,

00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:36.558
but it serves our purpose just
to say plus c on one side,

00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:38.940
and so this is a general solution

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.663
to the separable differential equation,

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:43.938
and then we can find the
particular one by substituting in

00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:47.445
when x is equal to one,
y is equal to zero,

00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:50.145
so let's do that to solve for c.

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:54.236
So we get, or when y is equal
to zero, x is equal to one,

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:57.319
so, sine of zero plus two times zero,

00:01:59.898 --> 00:02:02.720
all I did is I substituted
in the zero for y,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.071
is equal to x squared, well now x is one,

00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:09.959
is equal to one squared plus c.

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.023
Well sine of zero is zero,
two times zero is zero,

00:02:12.023 --> 00:02:13.770
all of that's just gonna be zero,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.660
so we get zero is equal to one plus c,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.023
or c is equal to negative one.

00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:21.966
So now we can write down
the particular solution

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:24.577
to this differential equation
that meets these conditions.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.731
So we get, let me write it over here,

00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:29.398
sine of y plus two y is equal to

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:36.475
x squared, and our constant
is negative one, so minus one.

00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:39.984
And now what is x when y is equal to pi?

00:02:39.984 --> 00:02:43.651
So, sine of pi plus two
times pi is equal to

00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:50.184
x squared minus one, see
sine of pi is equal to zero,

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.131
and so we get, let's see we
can add one to both sides,

00:02:56.131 --> 00:03:00.298
and we get two pi plus
one is equal to x squared,

00:03:01.895 --> 00:03:04.943
or we could say that x is
equal to the plus or minus

00:03:04.943 --> 00:03:07.860
the square root of two pi plus one.

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:11.774
So I would write the
plus or minus square root

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:14.691
of two pi plus one, and we're done.
