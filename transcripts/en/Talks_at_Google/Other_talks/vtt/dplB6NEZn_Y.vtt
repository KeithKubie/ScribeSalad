00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Authors@Google and MarketingTalks@Google.
Today, we're proud to present Dave Murray.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:17.240
He is a scientist and entrepreneur and all
around a pretty cool guy who's come to share

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.949
his insights. In the past, he's worked in
marketing. He has worked as a rocket scientist

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.650
and he's been the head of--innovation, excuse
me, at Intuit. So, I'm proud to present David

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.420
Murray and his book: Borrowing Brilliance.
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Thank you. Thanks. It's good to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.780
be here. There were two questions that I asked
myself that led to the writing of this book.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:53.570
The first question was "Can you teach creativity?"
The second question was "Is innovation a definable

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.859
process?" And the answers to those questions
were "Yeah, I actually believe that you can

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:06.660
teach creativity" and the answer to the second
question is "Maybe as far as innovation being

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.430
a definable process." So, what I'd like to
talk you about is about answering those two

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.530
questions maybe teach you a little bit about
what I learned about creative thinking, I

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.490
mean, then, how you can apply it in your business.
The title of the book is Borrowing Brilliance.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.310
And I named it that because I wanted the title
to reflect the primary premise of the book.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.830
And what I did is like Effie [ph] said that
I was the head of innovation at Intuit and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.460
it was in that job that I first started thinking
about creative thinking as a subject itself

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.329
and it's kind of a strange subject. So, what
I did is I started studying creative thinkers,

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.380
creative processes. But most importantly,
what I did is I studied creative ideas themselves,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.899
and I asked myself, "You know, what makes
a creative idea? What – how do you construct

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.810
a creative idea?" And in that course, you
know, I studied scientific ideas. I mean,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.390
I looked at Einstein and Darwin and Newton.
I studied business people: Bill Gates, Steve

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.930
Jobs, the Google guys. And in that process
of looking at that, I realized that creative

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.730
ideas are made out of existing ideas, always.
I mean, I could always, as you dug deeper

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.590
in you could always see the roots of an original
idea and an existing idea and that's why I

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.720
say that brilliance is borrowed. I think it's
why Einstein said, "The secret to creativity

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:54.420
is knowing how to hide your sources." So,
I was at--like I said, at the time I was working

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.870
at Intuit, so, Intuit was run by GE people.
GE people were process people. So, they were

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.230
like, "Dave, you've got to make a process
out of this." But I'm not sure it really was

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.099
a process, you know, and I'm not sure that
creative thinking, you can actually define

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:18.300
it in this series of steps, but I took that
challenge and I started thinking about it.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.409
And these are what I came up with; these were
the six--when I called the six steps to innovation.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:34.040
And I think about them, I break them into
separate parts and I think of two different

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.510
metaphors to describe them; the first one
being the origin of an idea. An idea is like

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.099
constructing a house, that's kind of a metaphor
that I use to think about that. The second

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.819
part is the evolution of a creative idea and
I have to separate them and I had to have

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.870
two different metaphors because the first
metaphor which is, which I thought it was

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.890
very powerful to the origin of an idea, the
construction metaphor, doesn't extend to the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.920
process itself, because the process is a trial-and–error
process. So, that's why I switched metaphors

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.329
and the book is actually broken into two separate
sections. So, let's talk about the origin

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.711
of an idea and those three steps. And again,
it's a construction metaphor that I use and

00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:24.690
I think it's very helpful to think about it
this way. The problem is the foundation of

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:33.790
that house. You build your ideas on a well-defined
problem. Borrowing then provides the materials

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:41.320
to build the solution to your problem. And
then you take the pieces and you make something

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.990
new out of them, you combine, you combine
the materials that you've grabbed. Let me

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.970
give you an example, I don't know if we have
any engineers in the house, but Isaac Newton

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:02.140
dabbled in Mathematics and he created Calculus,
and what he did is first he defined the problem.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.570
He actually defined two problems. Does anybody
remember what those problems are? It was--no?

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.600
The area under a curve and the tangent to
a curve. And then he went out and he borrowed

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.070
some materials to solve that problem. In this
case, he borrowed--he went to Algebra, Trig,

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.530
Analytical Geometry and Infinitesimals, and
he combined that stuff in a unique way that

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.910
nobody else had done and created a solution
to the problems that he had defined, and that's

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:36.350
how he created the Calculus. And there's an
interesting side note about that; Isaac Newton

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.160
was, after he came out with Calculus, he was
accused of plagiarism, which isn't unusual

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.680
for creative thinkers. And he actually had
to defend himself in a court of law because

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.760
somebody else in another part of the world
had created Calculus at the same time. And

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.070
it was during his defense that Isaac Newton
said, "Yes, if I've seen farther, I've stood

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.880
on the shoulders of giants." And when he was
talking about the shoulders that he was standing

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:13.870
on were the creators of Algebra, Trigonometry,
Infinitesimals. So, I think it works in both

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:22.040
very complex idea creations like Calculus,
Physics, scientific, a lot of the problems

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.750
that you, guys, work on and it in works in
very simple problems too, very simple business

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:35.920
problems, marketing problems. The second part
of innovation and creativity is the evolution

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:48.930
of ideas. Ideas need time to evolve. I break
this into four steps, I mean, three steps.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:54.690
There is incubation, that's where the subconscious
mind--the subconscious mind, all creative

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:01.310
thinkers are subconscious thinkers. The subconscious
is really good of doing the first three steps,

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.240
at defining, borrowing, combining and that's
kind of what's going on. You need to put your

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:12.980
ideas away, let them incubate. Then, you need
to pass judgment on your ideas. You know,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.540
I don't know if you guys have a formal brain
storming process here at Google but, my experience

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:27.050
is that brainstorming such as don't work so
good because they lack judgment, and you need

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.890
strong judgment of an idea to figure out what's
wrong with an idea so you can evolve it. Judgment

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:37.910
is like, you know, it's like the fight for
survival in Darwin's theory of evolution.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.590
And then finally, the sixth step is the enhancement
step, and that's trial and error, just keep

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:48.510
doing it over and over and sometimes it's
just restructuring the materials that you

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:58.680
have. In 1820, Hans Austred [ph], he did an
experiment and he noticed that with wires,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:06.600
magnets and a compass, and he noticed that
when he passed a current through the comp--when

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:13.400
you pass the current through the wire, the
compass went, went haywire. He created a magnetic

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.720
field, that was an interesting idea, but 20
years later Michael Faraday took that idea

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.590
and restructured it and when he did is he
passed the magnets around the wire and created

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:28.520
the current. Now, that was a huge innovation,
I mean that's how power plants work now like

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:35.710
in a hydroelect--in a hydroelectric plant.
A turbine spins magnets around the wire and

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.900
that's how it creates current. The point being
is when you get to that last step, sometimes

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:50.110
you just take the materials that you have
restructure them, move them around. So, I

00:08:50.110 --> 00:09:03.940
was just thinking—sorry, I lost that. Give
me just a second you, guys, I'm sorry. Let's

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:12.000
take in and talk about the six steps in a
more depth. There's the problem step. You

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.100
know, my experience is that were we have a
lot--we're very good at solving problems but

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:27.780
we're not necessarily very good at defining
problems, and there's three parts to, or to,

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.820
to the problem step. There's the identification
of a problem. There's the understanding of

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:38.000
the problem which is finding out the root
cause, and then, the third one is describing

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.430
the problem, and sometimes it's just changing
the description of the problem a little bit

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:47.560
that will lead to in innovation. Let me give
you an example, I was working with the Fortune

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:53.990
500 company and the CEO called me in and there
was a marketing group and he's like, "You

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.520
know, I keep giving these guys the same problem
and they keep coming back with the same answer.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.080
We need to get them, you know, we need to
get innovations out of there" and I was like

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:14.800
"What we really need to do is change the problem."
Henry Ford, back in the 1920s, he had, he

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:22.770
defined his problem as building the least
expensive car and he was very successful with

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:30.020
it, and all of his ideas were built off building
the least expensive car. William Durant over

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:35.290
General Motors then took that problem and
kind of redefined it just a little bit. He

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:42.530
said, "Let's build a car that people can afford"
and that just by, just by changing the, the

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:48.460
definition of the problem just a little bit
led to a huge innovation which was GMAC. And

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.460
so what they did is they solved the problem,
they built more expensive cars but people

00:10:53.460 --> 00:11:01.320
can afford them through monthly payments.
The--so when I work with a conceptual development

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.700
team, what you guys need to do is keep going
back to that problem and keep trying, just

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:13.530
subtle differences and how you define it,
it can change how you solve it. The next step

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:20.440
is the borrowing step, and this is where you
gather the materials. And I think of this--imagine

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:28.590
thinking the--of this as on a continuum and
what you want to do is the way that you define

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:33.970
the problem will determine where you look
for your solution, and this works, again,

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:40.040
in both a simple--in both simple problems
and complex problems. You know, for example,

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:47.530
my daughter is studying fashion right now,
so she bought a book on Coco Chanel, and Coco

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:55.220
Chanel was--she was named one of the Time
magazine--excuse me--one of the most influential

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:01.670
people of the, of the 20th century, and what
she did is she defined the problem. She wanted

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:07.440
to liberate women and that was the problem
that she defined. And when she defined it,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.130
she, she said, "Okay, if I'm going to liberate
women, where am I going to look for solutions?"

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:19.070
and where she looked was men's clothing. So
she combined men's clothing with women's clothing

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:30.500
and that solved her problem.
John Nash, the economist from the movie A

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:38.890
Beautiful Mind. You know, he--well, the way
that he developed his ideas is he, he defined

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:46.460
the problem and then went to--he didn't noticed
that the problem--and his problem was the

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:52.040
looking at or making decisions with incomplete
information and he--he noticed that; well,

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.021
that's the same problem that people that have
in a poker game. So what he did is he borrowed

00:12:56.021 --> 00:13:05.700
poker game strategies and solved economic--he
solved economic problems with that. So, what

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.779
I--what I like to teach is, when you're solving
your problems, first, what you do is you start

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:16.310
close to home. If you're a software engineer
and you've got a navigation problem, then

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:22.690
I would look at how other software engineers
solve that navigation problem. Then, I would

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:29.540
take this a step away, and I would look at
maybe web designers, how do they solve that

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:34.540
problem? And I'll borrow ideas from there
and then I would take a step outside of business.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:39.800
How do sailors, truck drivers, search and
rescue teams--how do they solve their navigation

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:47.100
problems, and then combine all that. And,
again, that leads to the third step which

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.520
is the combination step. You take all these
materials and then you combine them to form

00:13:52.520 --> 00:14:03.820
a new solution.
Combination is really the essence of creativity.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:09.540
You know, it's taking two existing things
and making a new thing. It's funny, and this

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:17.360
was a big "aha" moment for me as I was thinking
about this and thinking about creative thinking.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:24.720
And I was like, you know, is it really that
simple, is creativity, is it--is it a new

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.150
idea or just two existing ideas and I think
it is, and I sort of thinking about that.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:33.100
And as--I was in a meeting, actually, at Intuit
and across from the table was sitting a friend

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.950
of mine, and I guess I kept glancing at her,
and staring at her. Subconsciously, I didn't

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:43.040
realize it until she kind of mouthed the words,
"What the hell are you looking at?" And, then

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.250
I've realized why I was staring at her, because
I kept asking myself the question--well, actually,

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.390
let me take a step back--I was asking myself
the question, what is the most important or

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.550
the biggest idea in the history of the human
race? You know and I was thinking is it Einstein's

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:06.490
idea, is it Darwin's, is it--I don't know,
is it Star Wars. And that's when I started

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:10.860
glancing at my friend, and then I realized
why I was staring at her, because she was

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.470
pregnant. And I went, "aha," I go, that's
the answer to the question, that's probably

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.051
the most creative thing, the most important
idea, is a new human being. And what is a

00:15:20.051 --> 00:15:27.810
new human being? It's a combination of two
existing human beings. The fifth step--or,

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:32.410
I'm sorry, the fourth step is incubation,
that's when you bring the subconscious mind

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:44.600
into it. And, I think the--you need to--most
creative, or all creative thinkers have a

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:51.950
very strong relationship to the subconscious
mind. And I work hard with myself to try to

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:57.899
establish that relationship, and I do three
things, and I think about it three ways. It's

00:15:57.899 --> 00:16:04.020
input to the subconscious mind, so that's
when I tell my subconscious, "Okay these are--this

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:10.410
is my problem, these are some of the borrowings
that I have, and then here's some interesting

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:18.500
unique combinations." The--and then, I just
put it away and give it time. The subconscious

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.860
mind is kind of like a parallel processing
computer, and it can make all these combinations

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:28.970
behind the scene. The third part, and this
is probably the most critical part, and maybe

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:36.230
the hardest part, and that's output; listening
to the subconscious mind. You know, as I discuss

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:41.310
this with a lot of people, and does everybody
have the shower experience, the "aha" moment

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:46.550
in the shower? And I wondered that's kind
of weird that everyone is having that same

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:53.270
experience. And then I realized why, the subcon--I
mean, the morning shower is one of the few

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:59.820
times of the day when your conscious mind
isn't like aflutter with information. You're

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.399
kind of relax, it's in the morning, so, in
other words, you're not thinking at all and

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:10.010
that gives the subconscious time to have something
to say. The ideas pop in, and I think that's

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.790
why the ideas keep popping in, and the book
I talk about, how you can kind of simulate

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:24.790
that shower experience. The fifth step is
the judging step. Judgment is so critical

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:32.550
because without it, your ideas are going to
be frivolous and useless. I think I--what

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:38.420
I do is, is I separate my judgment into two,
maybe three areas, but two primary areas:

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:46.990
the positive judgment and negative judgment,
and I use the problem as a criterion. And,

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:54.870
I think it's not judgment of whether you like
the idea or not, it's judgment, what do I

00:17:54.870 --> 00:18:01.000
like about the idea and what don't I like
about the idea? And there's a magnificent

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.770
side effect that you get when you start doing
that, and it's creative intuition, because

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.860
what you get, as you start--as these ideas
start flowing and you start passing judgment,

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:15.380
positive and negative, you start being able
to describe an idea that doesn't exist. It

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.809
has these attributes from your positive judgments
and it doesn't have this other attributes

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:32.440
from your negatives. Steve Jobs, who--if anything
that--or probably his greatest creative attribute

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:40.040
is his creative intuition. He knows a good
idea when he sees it. And, he's also notorious

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:46.670
for having a contra--a contrary personality,
in other words, he's really positive one moment,

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:52.309
and really negative the next moment, and I
think that's what gives him the creative intuition.

00:18:52.309 --> 00:18:57.150
He's able to say, "I really like these points,
and I really don't like those points." Now,

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:02.460
you and I are never going to be Steve Jobs.
I think it's innate in his thinking, but if

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:08.430
you start doing it consciously, making those
two different positives and negatives, you'll

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:13.150
start to develop it too and then, as you're
going through like your work and stuff, you'll

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:18.530
see an idea and you'll be like, oh, my God
that's the idea that I was looking for. And

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:26.720
then finally, there's enhancement, the enhancement
step. The creative process is a trial and

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:38.850
error process, and ideas need to evolve, products
need to evolve, you know. In the enhancement

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:44.809
process you're basically going back and you've
redefined your problem, you re-borrow materials,

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:52.580
you re-combine and re-structure and you come
up with the next iteration of the idea. And

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:58.120
I think Facebook is probably a good example.
Facebook started out--the original conception

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:07.460
of Facebook was basically borrowing the Hot
or Not site, at, Mark Zuckerberg was a freshman

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:12.870
at Harvard University and he started the Hot
or Not site, where you would rank the incoming

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:17.110
Harvard freshman. He borrowed the name Facebook
from--that's what they called, they actually

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:26.720
printed a yearbook where you can look at the
faces of the incoming freshman. And now, but

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.330
if you look at the evolution--so that's where
they started with the idea, and now they're

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:36.130
like, you know, 250 million users; they've
just passed MySpace. They just keep evolving,

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:43.179
they keep working it, they keep redefining,
keep restructuring their problems and their

00:20:43.179 --> 00:21:03.711
solutions to the problems. So, there is--you
know—any, yeah, any questions? You know,

00:21:03.711 --> 00:21:11.040
I think, we've got some books in the back,
I'd appreciate anybody would like to buy--oh,

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.850
you have a question...
&gt;&gt; All right. Well...

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.200
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, thank you very much

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:19.670
for spending with us today; it's a very, very
awesome talk. I'm in, in the creativity research

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:25.170
and the literature, you know, the two big
questions that that come to my mind or like,

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:31.950
first, how you can sort of, you know, create--creativity
like I envision somebody telling me, like,

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.840
be creative and then that's kind of difficult.
And then also, I was wondering if you could

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:41.420
comment on the role between, you know, similarly
between creativity and control. Like how,

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.700
how, you know, how like, how it should ramp
in instead of like instead of blue sky in

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.170
order to make forward progress?
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Right.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.230
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Well, yeah and that's an interesting

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:57.440
point. I think there was a paradoxical intention
to creativity. That thing were, you know,

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:03.299
do it and then, I think, that's because we
use our subconscious minds to come up with

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:08.670
ideas. And when you demand something from
your subconscious mind, it'll tend to like,

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:14.309
you know, shut you off. The way that I think
that you come over that is you start doing

00:22:14.309 --> 00:22:19.100
things consciously. In other words, when you
can't come up with an idea, you go back and

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.950
you say, okay, what problem am I working on?
All right. There is a problem. Okay. What

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:28.190
materials do I have to--and you start doing
it consciously, and then your subconscious

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:32.720
then will pick up on it, does that makes sense?
Okay.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:39.520
&gt;&gt; So, again, thank you so much for coming.
Another question for you--when you've mentioned

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:44.679
these different areas that people have borrowed
from, they tend to be--well, they somehow

00:22:44.679 --> 00:22:48.420
seem very different from the area in which
they're trying to solve the problem. Like,

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:54.490
the poker, example, can you talk a little
bit about tips perhaps to get people thinking

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.289
in sort of broader ways without just going,
again, off the deep end.

00:22:58.289 --> 00:23:03.320
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think, it
all comes back to the problem. You define

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:08.790
the problem and then you look for places with
the similar problem. The reason John Nash

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:14.020
went to the poker game is because he recognized
that poker players were making decisions with

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:19.100
the incomplete information. And he's like,
wait a minute, that's the same, that's the

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:26.180
same problem that people in the economy have,
and once he recognized the same problem then

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:30.620
he was able to borrow from it. So that's,
I think, the key to it is how you define a

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.920
problem and then you go to places, and actually
think of it on the continuum, I start this

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.740
at home then I do something similar and then
I look really far away. So, you know, if I'm,

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.880
if I'm a business person, I'm looking to science.
How does scientist solve a problem like this,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:51.370
and then I borrow ideas from there. You know
if I'm a scientist, I might look to business,

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:59.690
say how they solve it and kind of swap it
out.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:00.910
&gt;&gt; Hey.
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Yeah.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:01.910
&gt;&gt; Thank you as well. Kind of a related question...
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Yeah.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:08.240
&gt;&gt; I remember BMW or like other car manufacturers
looking at biology and nature to improve their

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:14.770
products. For instance, wires for their tires,
they look at, you know, frogs' hands and see

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:20.870
why, why are they sticking so well to, to
objects? If I think now, I mean, I'm working

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:27.110
in marketing and if I would think to looking
at, you know, the nature or problems in the

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:32.910
nature, it's such a huge area, how would you
define the, I mean, the process or some kind

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:40.090
of, of way of approaching such a broad area
to improve your own problems to work on it?

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:46.470
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Right, right. And I think the answer
to that question is, again, it comes back

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:51.630
to the problem. There's a whole branch of
engineering called bionics, and they look

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:59.570
at, you know, I think, I think, people studied
the lotus flower because it repels water,

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.360
so then with sci--what the scientists, what
the business people did was they said, what's

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:09.780
going on there? And, took ideas from that
and created products out of it. So, again,

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:15.049
it really comes back to, this all comes back
to the problem. How you define it will determine

00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:19.730
where you look, does that make sense? It's
just not random places out there that you

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:24.381
borrow. You borrow from similar places with
the same problem.

00:25:24.381 --> 00:25:35.320
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the talk; extremely interesting.
So, your slides relates to an individual.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.169
It's supposed to process...
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Yeah.

00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:45.640
&gt;&gt; You know like in, in going in a creative
direction, put it that way. But, could you

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.580
expand a little bit, you know, like, you know,
in a typical corporate setup. How would each

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.300
one of these steps...
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Yeah.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.539
&gt;&gt; Be supported by say, a larger organization?
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Right.

00:25:57.539 --> 00:26:03.200
&gt;&gt; Could you give in like, what do you need
to do, what do you need to put in place for

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.620
individuals to actually be able to sort of
have less friction in going through these

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:13.000
six steps?
&gt;&gt; MURRAY: Yeah, yeah. So, let me make a couple,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.910
a response to that in a couple ways. So I
believe the creative process does take place

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:21.970
in your mind. The ideas are going to come
from your mind and that's really what my book

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:29.429
is about. It's--the book is a personal book
and I tell personal stories and I get into

00:26:29.429 --> 00:26:35.840
my own mind. Now with that said, understanding
the creative process and how it works does

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:43.370
translate into how you would create processes
at your company. So, for example, I would

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:49.160
separate these, I mean, I would, when I brainstorm
or when I'm in a concept development team,

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.549
we will separate and we'll just work on the
problem, and we won't brainstorm, we won't

00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:59.850
talk anything about solutions, it's just pure,
okay, defining problems and a hierarchy of

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.240
problems. I mean, problems don't exist in
isolation. There's high problems, low problems,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:10.549
there's a whole bunch--you have internal problems,
external problems so, I'd separate that. I'd

00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:14.870
look at the problems, then I would do another
meeting where I'd like, okay, I've picked

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:21.430
out a couple problems and it say, let's send
everybody out and find places outside of our

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:25.120
business that are solving these kind of problems,
and we would send like the whole organization

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.590
out to look at that. People would come back
in and then present back here's, so they,

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:38.191
you know, we would do the second step. Now,
then, we would do brainstorming, and then

00:27:38.191 --> 00:27:42.290
maybe even in a separate meeting, we would
do judgment where we'd bring in some, you

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:47.470
know, usually the top, the top managers are
usually really good at judgment, at telling

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:53.049
you why your idea doesn't work, and telling
you why your idea might work. So, you know,

00:27:53.049 --> 00:27:58.030
the incubation thing, that is, that's a real
personal thing, but it also means that, you

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.620
know what, we have to understand that our
ideas are going to take a little bit of time,

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:13.039
we need to work on them a little bit, so.
Any other questions? Cool. Well, thank you,

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:13.389
guys.
