(Greg) Hey Mitch! (Mitch) Hey Greg.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.560
What do you call a nosy pepper?

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.880
I... I don't know. JalapeÃ±o business!

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.740
(Theme Song)

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.460
Hello and welcome to the first episode of the Lab,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.140
A new series here on Asap Science, where we take your questions and turn them into experiments,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.220
so we can experience science firsthand.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.080
My name is Mitch -And I'm Greg and we are ASAP Science.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.380
And don't worry, the animated videos are still gonna be coming out every week, but on Sundays leading up to the new year,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.920
is our first series of the lab.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.660
so tune in on Sundays

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.820
And Mitch, what exactly are we doing today

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.500
So today, we are actually looking at the science of pain

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.720
and we're gonna start out by having a lot of spicy peppers to understand

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.560
why spice feels like pain

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.100
And then, we're gonna be putting our hands in some really cold water and see if swearing can actually can help with pain

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.220
And finally, we are gonna be getting electrocuted to talk about the anticipation of pain and how awful that is.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.140
Do you think you are gonna be good at this?

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.700
No? I'm like so weak. Okay, I'm the weak one of this group.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.980
I have red hair genes, so you know, I can like handle anything.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.040
They are all gonna be challenges, by the way. So, should we just... should we just start?

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.560
Yeah, let's do this

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.020
Alright, first up, we have our spicy pepper challenge

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.560
We've ordered these peppers from the least spicy to most spicy

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.400
And then, we have a list of facts. So, every time we bite a pepper, we have to spew off a spicy pepper fact

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.780
And, this is the hottest pepper in the world: the California (Carolina) Reapers

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.420
So, we are really excited about this one

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.100
Hopefully, we are not gonna projectile our vomit on the camera

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.580
And the first person who grabs this milk for release... relief loses the challenge

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.540
So, are you ready?

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.100
I'm ready I'm ready

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.240
Ok heh heh

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.440
Spicy peppers excite receptors that usually respond to heat, and these are known as nociceptors

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.140
These nociceptors respond to temperature, extremes.... Oh my God, it's actually really hot.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.480
And mechanical stimulus, but they can also obviously respond to chemicals

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.340
I wanna just spit it out and drink my mlik

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.120
Big...

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.660
When you eat a hot pepper like this one, your central nervous system gets very confused.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.740
*Laughing*

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.500
Bring it!

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.640
AAAAH

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.560
Okay!

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.820
Capsaicin is the active ingredient in hot peppers

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.980
Which stimulates the nerve to respond to mild temperature increases,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.360
It sends two signals to the brain, that it's warm and that it's an intense stimulus

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.520
which causes this burning sensation.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.480
-This is awful

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.580
*Laughing*

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.320
Should we just have the milk?

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.040
-I'm so white, like I'm just so in pain.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.440
I don't... I don't think I can do this any longer.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.360
It's getting worse, like it's going.. -Look I'm drooling

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.180
My glasses are fogging up!

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.820
Okay, I quit.. I quit, I'm...

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.400
Oh my god that feels so good, just drink your milk. - NO

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.240
So this is a Ghost Pepper

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.900
Be careful man *ping*

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:55.760
The signal creates the same physical reaction to heat, that includes vasodilation, sweating and flushing...

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.100
I feel tingling in my fingers

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.220
Uhm.. and that's it! You sweat and you flush, and you vaso.. My hand!

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.780
My hand feels weird. - I'm sweating, I'm sweating.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.940
Okay, I'm gonna read my other fact, because I already lost.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.220
My right hand is tingling.. I TOUCHED MY EYE!

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.180
-Oh my god, are you okay? Don't touch it more!

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.740
Okay I'm done. - Go wash your hands.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.840
Wait, I think I need to put milk in my eye.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.500
No, okay, go wash your hands.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.880
(Greg in the background) AAAAH

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.380
-Okay

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.900
It was interesting, one researcher actually gave rats spicy foods to see if they would actually like it,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.600
and it turns out humans are one of the only animals in the world that will choose to eat spicy things

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.080
I'm literally drooling

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.960
Choose to eat spicy things over stuff that actually isn't spicy, so...

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.020
How do you feel, explain to us how you feel.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.440
-Like a fool for saying, that I was like, I am so good at pain.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.320
Okay Mitch, so why is milk helpful for us.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.020
Well, so water is not helpful because Capsaicin is actually hydrophobic,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.040
so the water doesn't really do anything except swash it around all around your mouth,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.260
whereas the milk actually absorbs it, brings it down to your stomach and actually is a chemical reaction

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.480
that makes it feel a whole lot better.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.580
So avoid water, stick to milk.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.240
-And also, the relief that you feel when drinking this milk, excites the pleasure sensors of your brain,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.280
which is why this feels so good right now.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.920
And why people go back to spice, even though they know it's awful.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.140
Also, I'm gonna give up on coffee. Ghost pepper every morning? *snaps fingers*

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.500
Haha yeah. -I'll be awake for 24 hours.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.320
So pain actually is something that is used to protect your tissue from damage,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.800
so for example, if you touch a hot burner, your tissue is getting damaged immediately

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.940
and you feel the pain immediately. But some things actually take more time to feel the pain.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.880
So to elicit some slow pain, we have these buckets filled with ice

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.260
we're just gonna put our hands in them to see how long we can last

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.580
but the one caveat being that Greg is allowed to swear and I'm not.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.400
-Yeah you better f***ing believe it!

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.680
Okay! Are you ready for more pain? -I think so... okay time to roll up and put in?

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.460
Okay, we have to do the exact same time to be as scientifically accurate as possible!

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.320
Okay, ready? 3...2...1...

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.000
(Greg) AAH

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.740
Oooh, okay so... - Oh my god I don't...

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.380
A study actually found that when people were allowed to f***ing swear,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.220
they were able to keep their hands in ice water for on average 40 seconds longer

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.500
it's because it actually releases, in your brain, the fight-or-flight response, it releases adrenaline

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.540
and you feel a lot better.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.320
Holy f***ing pigeon..

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.540
One interesting thing is how when you swear too much you can actually overuse that... -No you f***ing can't!

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.600
Anyway, I'm actually in so much pain. -Well, I'm f***ing feeling great.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.140
Fingering, fingering a BUTT! Fingering a butt. -Ooooh my god.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.900
Oh, it actually like hurts... are you seriously holding it still?

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.940
I am. -That's crazy.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.100
But maybe my hand is gonna pull out, and like my limb is gonna come out and my hand is gonna still be in here.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.060
And I'm like F*****K

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.560
One weird thing was that my body actually like heated up, my face and body felt so hot when that was happening,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.160
and I think that was just like a fear response, I was like

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.380
I'm gonna lose my hand...

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.600
*Laughing* Okay, how do you feel?

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.540
Ooooh it is like when you come in from the cold

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.140
It is kinda nice when that happens.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.480
Well, Greg won challenge number two as well, I clearly am a wimp.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.760
-So one thing that we've learned from this is that swearing is great.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.100
Okay, so it is time for a 'shocking experience'

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.580
they say that the actual antish..atishaputh.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.940
Anticipation of pain can actually be worse than the pain itself.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.000
How does it work, Mitch...

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.280
I don't know, so we've been given this ball and apparently we stick this key in

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.700
and it starts zapping at random intervals.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.380
So also it says on here that this product emits electric shocks, keep out of reach of children under 14

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.780
it may interfere with the electrical devices such as a pacemaker

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.580
and do not use this if you have a heart condition or any other related illnesses.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.640
and then it says, in all caps: THIS IS NOT A TOY.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.920
We have to hold the ball while we're reading a fact and as soon as we're done we can pass it off

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.640
and the other person has to finish the next fact.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.100
We're playing to three, right? -Yeah

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.620
So the first person who gets three, loses. -Three shocks, yeah.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.580
I have really bad anticipatory like fear, so... -But you have to go first, cause I want to see you...

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.220
No! -Go

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.860
Okay...

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.040
Is it like... Oh my god! Okay. -Go go go go!

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.060
Ah! Euh.. Studies have found that both meditation and exercise can reduce or modulate feelings of pain.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.120
AAAH

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.360
(Greg screams) THE PLACEBO EFFECT CAN AAAAH AAH NOO! It's going off!

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.320
It shocked you, stop, no stop stop.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.540
AAAAAH -I think you won that, did you also get electrocuted?

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.600
YEAH! It electrocuted like six times.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.580
I'm actually shaking! What the hell.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.900
Okay, the placebo effect can work for pain if it's high end. In a 2008 study,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.260
patients received painful electric shocks, afterward, ten cents placebo pill was given to the test after,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.840
which alleviated pain 64% of the participants. A $2,50 placebo pill reduced pain for 85% of participants.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.900
Chronic pain can shrink the size of your brain in a study of individuals who, with chronic pain,

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.500
could show up to 11% less- AAAH

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.400
*Laughing*

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.000
You almost broke my laptop! You threw it at the screen of my laptop.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.100
I did not have a choice.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.840
I think I should start this time. -Yeah, that's fair.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.440
Okay, you ready? -Yeah

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:58.940
I'm gonna get shocked again...

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.960
Platypus are one of the few mammals to produce venom.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.840
Though the venom isn't powerful enough to kill a human, the pain is excruciating and can last for a month.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.840
Naked mole rats don't feel the pain of acid or the sting of chili peppers.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.420
NO! Oh you cheated.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.820
The scientific term for brain freeze is... euh.. AAAH

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.060
*Laughing*

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.740
Naked mole rats don't feel spice

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.540
Fascinating! Short and fascinating.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.480
Okay, let's talk about anticipation

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.160
That was... It's not as bad as I thought it was at first, but it is shocking.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.600
No, and the worst part is when you get it handed to you're like, oh I'm gonna...

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.720
-It's, it's gonna come, it's gonna come.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.180
But then as soon as you do get shocked you're right in.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.240
Well, you get scared and then... -For you, you just throw it away

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.280
Well, my hand... You didn't even get it so you don't even know.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.580
I DID! I got your... second-hand electrocution.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.140
Okay. Well okay, so,

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.640
Winner of this entire game, has been Greg.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.040
So! We made it through all the pain and suffering, but it was all for the sake of science.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.580
And now, it's time for

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.220
*together* this week in science talk!

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.780
*Music*

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.660
This week, scientists have started to discover how we actually spend our time

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:07.780
Using information from over one million participants, scientists found that we don't actually work more than we did in the past,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.120
we just tend to multitask a lot more, making our lives seem more hectic.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.300
You might not care much about your poop, but your brain does.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.980
Neuroscientists have found that microbes in your gut can affect your brain development,

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.340
and also your mental health.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.520
Known as the "poop studies', scientists are looking at how microbes affect a baby's brain development.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.200
So next time you're changing a diaper, take a good look at that turd.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.060
Speaking of poo, did you know that naked mole rats actually eat each other's poo?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.500
But, for good reason!

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.920
Researcher's shown that when underlings eat hormone rich poo of a queen,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.140
the added estrogen in their system actually prompts them to help take care of her offspring.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.300
