00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:18.624
At birth, our bodies are roughly 75% water.

00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:20.932
We remain mostly water for the rest of our lives.

00:00:20.932 --> 00:00:24.442
We cannot survive even a week without fresh water.

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:26.038
There's no life without it

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:26.820
for ecosystems,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.455
societies,

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:29.314
and individuals.

00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:32.044
So, how much usable water is there on Earth?

00:00:32.044 --> 00:00:34.153
Most of the water on Earth is ocean,

00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:37.683
a salty 97.5%, to be precise,

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:41.200
and the remaining 2.5% is fresh water.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.099
That little sliver of liquid sustains human life on Earth,

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:46.940
it literally holds up civilizations.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.217
2.5% is a small proportion to be sure,

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.796
and even that is broken down into smaller parts:

00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:53.712
surface water,

00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:56.049
water in ice caps and polar regions,

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.094
and ground water.

00:00:58.094 --> 00:00:59.696
First, surface water.

00:00:59.696 --> 00:01:02.139
All the liquid water above ground is surface water

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:04.225
and it is a tiny blip of an amount.

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:07.819
0.3% of all fresh water is surface water.

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:09.328
It may seem counterintuitive,

00:01:09.328 --> 00:01:12.525
but it accounts for little streams all over the planet.

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:15.395
All rivers, including the Nile, the Jordan, and the Mississippi,

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:17.071
and lakes, large to small,

00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:20.421
like Victoria, the Great Lakes, and Baikal.

00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:22.222
Second, ice caps and polar regions

00:01:22.222 --> 00:01:25.383
freeze up to 70% of the planet's fresh water.

00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:26.504
This water is significant,

00:01:26.504 --> 00:01:30.323
but it isn't available for human use in a regular way.

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:35.286
Finally, nearly 30% of all water on Earth is ground water.

00:01:35.286 --> 00:01:37.561
As the name suggests, that's water in the ground.

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:40.005
It can rest still and deep in huge caverns,

00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.428
or it can snuggle in the little crevices of rock and pebble.

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:46.095
The upshot - thank goodness for ground water!

00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:47.100
It's invisible to us,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.632
but it is much more plentiful than surface water.

00:01:49.632 --> 00:01:50.970
It is much more reliable

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.048
and easier to obtain than frozen water.

00:01:53.048 --> 00:01:56.991
Without ground water, our societies would be parched.

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:58.902
So, how are we using that water?

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:02.057
As a result of industrialization and population growth,

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:05.158
demand for fresh water skyrocketed in the last century.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.957
Where is all that water going?

00:02:06.957 --> 00:02:08.410
First, we have to remember

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.786
that fresh water is a global concern,

00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:11.832
but it is always local.

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:12.999
Context matters.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.086
The Sahara is not Seattle.

00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:17.075
Still, some general information can help us

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:19.386
get a handle on major trends.

00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:21.258
Who consumes the most fresh water?

00:02:21.258 --> 00:02:24.303
And, what sectors consume the most fresh water?

00:02:24.303 --> 00:02:25.522
First, who.

00:02:25.522 --> 00:02:27.973
Well, the United States consumes the most water

00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:30.606
per capita of any country in the entire world,

00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:31.659
followed by parts of Europe

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.410
and large industrializing nations like China.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.441
But, this doesn't tell us what water is being used for.

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:39.907
So let's look at it another way.

00:02:39.907 --> 00:02:42.570
If we ask what kinds of uses water is going towards,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.948
we see a different picture.

00:02:43.948 --> 00:02:48.410
Agriculture accounts for roughly 70% of global fresh water consumption.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.621
Again, remember the numbers vary by region,

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:53.045
but still, it's a staggering amount.

00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:54.582
And, this makes a certain kind of sense:

00:02:54.582 --> 00:02:55.418
we need to eat,

00:02:55.418 --> 00:02:56.855
we need water to grow food;

00:02:56.855 --> 00:02:58.008
the bigger the population,

00:02:58.008 --> 00:02:59.630
the more food we need;

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.174
and, the wealthier we get,

00:03:01.174 --> 00:03:03.092
the more meat we eat,

00:03:03.092 --> 00:03:05.885
and the more water is required to produce our food.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.597
Furthermore, 22% of all fresh water worldwide

00:03:08.597 --> 00:03:10.659
goes to industrial uses.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.351
This includes the production of electricity,

00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:14.271
the extraction of fossil fuels,

00:03:14.271 --> 00:03:17.021
and the manufacturing of all manner of goods,

00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:17.875
from microchips,

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:18.597
to paper,

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:19.898
to blimps.

00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:21.396
70% to agriculture,

00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:23.621
22% to industrial uses,

00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:25.434
what's left?

00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:27.102
8%

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:28.766
All those domestic uses -

00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:29.304
cooking,

00:03:29.304 --> 00:03:29.660
cleaning,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.083
bathing,

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:31.024
drinking

00:03:31.024 --> 00:03:35.136
- it's a drop in the bucket of overall water use.
