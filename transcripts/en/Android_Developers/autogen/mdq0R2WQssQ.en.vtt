write directly to the system content
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.549
write directly to the system content
provider other apps that try and riot

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
provider other apps that try and riot
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.610
provider other apps that try and riot
will fail silently of course any app can

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
will fail silently of course any app can
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.049
will fail silently of course any app can
still read from the system content

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
still read from the system content
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.369
still read from the system content
provider as long as they have the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
provider as long as they have the
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.180
provider as long as they have the
correct permission so you might be

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
correct permission so you might be
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.950
correct permission so you might be
thinking why do we need this new concept

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
thinking why do we need this new concept
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.889
thinking why do we need this new concept
of a default SMS app in previous

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
of a default SMS app in previous
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.500
of a default SMS app in previous
versions of Android you could already

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
versions of Android you could already
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.930

assign some of the SMS intents to any
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.660
assign some of the SMS intents to any
application the difference is that app

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670
application the difference is that app
 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.880
application the difference is that app
had no unique privileges over any other

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
had no unique privileges over any other
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.360

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.600
so let's talk about implementation to be

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610
so let's talk about implementation to be
 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.880

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570
 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.280
additionally you have to define an

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290
additionally you have to define an
 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.130

to become the default they should just

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949
to become the default they should just
 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.010
to become the default they should just
carry on as normal using the message

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020

when they're running on KitKat they
 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.730
when they're running on KitKat they
should really disable the one that's not

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740
should really disable the one that's not
 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.820

method that way they can disable these

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039
method that way they can disable these
 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.529
method that way they can disable these
and they won't be using unnecessary

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539
and they won't be using unnecessary
 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.439

them is to use boolean resource files to

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280
them is to use boolean resource files to
 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.159
them is to use boolean resource files to
automatically enable and disable the

really the difference between these two

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150
really the difference between these two
 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.330
really the difference between these two
is that set component enabled setting is

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340
is that set component enabled setting is
 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.830
is that set component enabled setting is
a little more flexible you can choose

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840
a little more flexible you can choose
 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.950
a little more flexible you can choose

that less flexible so let's quickly look

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900
that less flexible so let's quickly look
 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.360
that less flexible so let's quickly look
at how you would implement the boolean
