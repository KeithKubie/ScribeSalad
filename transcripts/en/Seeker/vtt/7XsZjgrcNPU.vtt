00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.290
Is ADHD really as common as…

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.290
Ooh!

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.290
Shiny!

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.120
Can I play?

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.050
Hey guys!

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.100
Amy focussing hard today on DNews to talk
about ADHD, properly known as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.100
Disorder.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.780
ADHD is, by all accounts, on the rise.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.779
In 2011, 6.4 million schoolchildren were diagnosed
with ADHD in the United States, a 42 percent

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.660
increase since 2004.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.380
But is it a true rise or are we just so much
more aware of ADHD that we’re diagnosing

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.640
kids with it when, really, they’re just
super energetic?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.280
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
recently surveyed 2,976 families to take a

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.930
close look at how children came to be diagnosed
as ADHD.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.970
And it turns out while most diagnoses followed
the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.920
there’s a striking number of instances where
the guidelines weren’t followed.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.719
The AAP stipulates that information ultimately
leading to an ADHD diagnosis be taken from

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.079
multiple sources in a child’s life covering
a variety of settings.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.940
That means a teacher, and a piano instructor,
and a sports coach.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.350
If the piano instructor is the only one giving
evidence of poor attention, the kid might

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.290
not be ADHD, he might just not want to play
music.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.900
The CDC survey found that in 18 percent of
cases, the diagnosis of ADHD was done solely

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.920
on the basis of family members' reports, which
is inconsistent with AAP recommendations.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.830
And because these diagnoses weren’t following
the right methods, one out of every 10 children

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.350
was diagnosed without the use of a behavior
rating scale that is supposed to be administered.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.770
The study also shows that children are getting
diagnosed at an earlier age.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.200
Roughly half of ADHD cases are found in children
age 6 or younger: 17.1 percent at age 6, 14.6

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.490
percent at age 5, and 16 percent of cases
at age 4 or younger.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.770
But aren’t kids supposed to be energetic
and excited to discover the world?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.579
What’s really the difference between being
hyper and having ADHD?

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.170
The core symptoms of ADHD include inattention,
hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.030
Difficulties with concentration, mental focus,
and the inhibition of impulses all impair

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.080
daily functions.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.979
In children, ADHD is typically identified
when they get into a structured setting like

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.079
school, and it’s a lot more than just running
around with boundless energy.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.619
A child who becomes easily frustrated and
overwhelmed, has trouble managing their emotions,

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.689
and struggles to organize, plan, pay attention,
and can’t remember details is far likelier

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.420
to be ADHD than the victim of sugar cereal
for breakfast.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.390
And really, children are just more energetic
than adults, something evolutionary biologist

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.749
Michael Rose from the University of California,
Irvine, says is an evolutionary thing.

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.040
Children are excited to learn about the world
around them, both their environments and the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.219
people within them.

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.569
Playing and running around helps a child’s
brain develop.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.829
Parents, meanwhile, stand by a guardians,
making sure that developmental play doesn’t

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.480
stray too close to traffic.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.900
As children age, they start to learn about
the risks this kind playful behaviour brings

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.439
with it, and slow down, not because they’re
less excited, but because as they near adulthood

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.569
they gain a sense of self-preservation.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.760
So the rise of ADHD cases could be a case
of overdiagnosing excited children mixed with

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.059
parental concern.

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.019
There are a lot of other things that could
be affecting a child’s manners.

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.400
Trace talks about the effects of adrenaline
in the body here.
