00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right, in this next example software under test is some sort of a web service,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and roll this out 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
onto one of the machines in our cluster, but I'm not going to expose this to most of our users.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What I'm going to do is expose this machine 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to some small fraction of our users who have been selected, for example,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
based on their willingness and desire to use new features.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The question is what kind of testing is this most like?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Is this integration testing?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Is it differential testing? Is it random testing?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Or is this system/validation testing?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Okay, so please take a second to go ahead and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
mark what you believe is the kind of testing that's the best match

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
for what it is that we're doing here.
