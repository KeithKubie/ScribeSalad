KURT: Good morning everyone, and
welcome to our Talks at Google

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.280
talk on electric vehicles,
electric and plug-in vehicles.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.903
I'm pleased to welcome--
when I massacre your name,

00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:19.980
you'll correct me--
Gina Coplon-Newfield.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.540
She directs the Sierra Club's
environmental electric vehicles

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.050
initiative which works on
the national and state levels

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.090
to advocate for electric
vehicle consumer initiatives

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.313
and educates the media,
policy makers, and the public

00:00:33.313 --> 00:00:36.230
about the benefits
of plug-in vehicles.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.230
Brian Cali is the co-founder
of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.060
and has served as
the senior vice

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.210
president of pre-clinical
research and development

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.850
since 2010.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.710
Both these people are
members of the Sierra Club.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.100
Both of them own
plug-in vehicles.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.680
And I'd like you to say
good morning to them

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.150
and we'll get going
with the talk.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.105
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:07.980
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD:
Good morning everybody.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.220
It's great to be here.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.890
I use Google products
all the time.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.360
So thank you so much for
making my life so much easier.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.920
And I happen to live
right here in Cambridge.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.020
And as Kurt said, work
for the Sierra Club

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.310
which is headquartered in
California just like Google is.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.570
But I happen to work here.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.790
And also as Kurt said,
I'm a proud driver

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.940
of a plug-in vehicle.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.780
So as you may know,
the Sierra Club

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.580
is the oldest and largest
grassroots environmental

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.910
organization in the country.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.670
We were founded in the
late 1800s by John Muir.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.670
We have 2.4 million members
and supporters and chapters

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.020
in all 50 states.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.880
We work on a range of different
environmental issues including

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.250
wilderness protection
and a range of campaigns

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.060
that are confronting
climate change.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.200
Oil is one of the most
serious threats that we face.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.259
Oil consumption
constitutes about 40%

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.290
of US climate emissions.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.020
And as we all know,
climate emissions

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.600
are leading to some
pretty serious problems

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.980
in terms of increased storms,
droughts, fires, extreme

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.340
weather, floods, et cetera.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.052
So I don't know about you,
but these kinds of things

00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:30.510
do keep me up a
little bit at night

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.890
when I think about my children
and future grandchildren.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.580
Climate change is a
clear and present danger

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.970
that we're facing.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.150
And so oil is a
big part of that.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.580
We also know that we're spending
between a quarter and a half

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.060
a billion dollars every
day to pay for foreign oil.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.270
Often sending money
to countries that

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.180
are not necessarily
friendly to US policies.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.610
And we also know that
there are examples

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.060
like during the height of
the fighting in Afghanistan,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.570
we heard from the
Secretary of the Navy

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.300
that out of every
24 fuel convoys that

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.650
were being guarded
by US soldiers,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.600
one Marine or soldier was
getting injured or killed

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.000
for every 24 of
these fuel convoys.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.400
So that's a pretty heavy price
that we're paying for oil.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.260
Fortunately, there are
alternatives to oil.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.830
So we can get around, we can
move without having to use oil.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.480
So for those of you
who bike to work,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.255
maybe not on a freezing
day like today, but maybe.

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:40.130
Maybe there were some
brave people out there,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.120
or walk to work,
or took-- oh good,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.980
a brave person in the audience--
or took public transit,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.810
those are clearly the
cleanest ways to get around.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.120
But we know that millions
of people in this country

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.350
and around the world
will continue to drive.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.010
So we need to find cleaner
ways to get around in our cars

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.840
without having to rely on
any oil or as much oil.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.270
So I love this graphic that
really makes it tangible.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.690
You think about the BP
Gulf oil disaster that

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.750
happened a few years ago and
you think about all the oil

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.430
that went into the
Gulf of Mexico.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.600
And if we had a million
electric vehicles on the road,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.860
that would be saving
the same amount of oil.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.790
So how many people
in the audience

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.000
saw the State of the
Union Address last night?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.500
Excellent, some fellow
policy nerds like me

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.210
who love that sort of thing.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.630
So this is a quote from
President Obama's State

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.630
of the Union Address
four years ago

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.550
when he said, "we can
break our dependence on oil

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.290
and become the first
country to have

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.540
one million electric vehicles
on the road in 2015,"

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.120
Now it is 2015.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.300
It is four years later now.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.050
Will we have one million
electric vehicles on US roads

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.810
by the end of this year?

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:00.310
No.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.090
We will not, unfortunately.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.390
So we will not meet this goal.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.010
But we will have
somewhere around 400,000

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.580
electric vehicles on the
road by the end of the year.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.560
And we think we'll hit that
one million mark around 2018.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.180
So EVs, or electric vehicles,
are gaining market share faster

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.780
than hybrids gained market
share when they first

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.480
hit the market
about 15 years ago.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.940
So that's encouraging.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.880
The Obama administration
has definitely

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.280
invested in electric vehicles
through the Department

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.210
of Energy's research, through
grants and programs that

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.800
are supporting public charging
stations around the country.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.430
And through the
federal tax credit.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.630
If you bought an
electric vehicle,

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.200
you would get somewhere
between $2,500 and $7,500

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.520
in a federal tax break,
which is certainly

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.950
nothing to sneeze at in
terms of an incentive.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.900
So we're very fortunate to
have an administration that's

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.480
really supportive of this issue.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.310
So now is an exciting time.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.750
Four years ago when President
Obama give that speech,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.550
there were almost no electric
vehicles on the road.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.880
Now there are more
than a quarter million

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.310
and there are about 20
models that are available.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.890
Not all of these models are
available in Massachusetts

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.250
but a lot of them are.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.470
So there's the BMW i3,
there's the plug-in Prius,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.770
there is the Nissan LEAF, the
Chevy Volt, the Tesla Model S.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.010
All the different Ford models,
the Ford Fusion, the Ford

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.080
C-Max.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.170
So there are a lot of
great options out there.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.710
Raise your hand if you've driven
in an electric vehicle before?

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.470
OK.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.290
Fantastic.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.930
Raise your hand if you actually
own one or drive one yourself.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:45.470
Great.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.970
Oh good.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.110
A couple examples.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.610
So if you've been
in one before, you

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.800
know these are really fun cars.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.230
They're quiet,
they're fast, they're

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.740
very technologically advanced.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.712
They are easier and
cheaper to maintain

00:06:58.712 --> 00:07:00.420
than a conventional
vehicle because there

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.900
are fewer moving parts involved.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.140
And they're just
really fun to drive.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.840
We talk in the electric
vehicles world a lot

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.070
about getting butts in
seats because so many people

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.720
out there just don't realize
that they're available

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.980
or they think they're
this futuristic thing that

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.882
aren't accessible to
real normal people.

00:07:22.882 --> 00:07:24.340
But once you get
inside one and you

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.140
drive it or you ride in one you
know that this is, it's here.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.949
It's available now and
it's a lot of fun to drive.

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:33.490
They don't necessarily work for
everybody's lifestyle, right?

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.780
So if you live in an
apartment building where

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.470
you don't have any
access to parking,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.600
or a driveway, or garage where
you could plug the car in,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.970
it's going to be challenging
to have an electric car.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:50.540
Now if you have a place to plug
it in at work or around town

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.580
and that's convenient
for you, great.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.030
That could work out.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.250
But for some people, they're
just not going to work.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.100
But the Union of Concerned
Scientists and consumer's union

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.930
did a survey a year or so ago
and they found that almost half

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.100
of Americans actually could
make an electric vehicle

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.990
work for their lifestyle.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.100
So more people than
one might think

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.600
could be ready for an electric
car as their next car.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.280
So I'll list just a few
examples of some of the things

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.490
that Sierra Club is doing to
advance electric vehicles.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.080
As I said, we're
working on this issue

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.120
because we see oil and climate
change as really important

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.799
issues to address and electric
vehicles as one key way

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.710
to address those problems.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.220
So we're doing a few things.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.710
So one is public education.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.929
So we have public events.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.050
We've been having National
Drive Electric Week.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.410
These are opportunities to
have electric vehicle promotion

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.660
events all around the country.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.080
So last year we had
National Drive Electric Week

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.580
in September where we had EV
promotion events in 150 cities

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.400
around the country.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.920
We got 90,000 or so people to
attend, about 200 media hits.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.490
So it was just a really
good way to educate

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.350
the masses, or at least
some segment of the masses,

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.790
about electric cars.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.240
We do blogging and
media outreach.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.600
We have a website.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.460
We also do policy advocacy.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.810
So I mentioned the federal
tax credit, which is helpful.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.490
But it's also helpful to
have states incentives.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.120
So for example,
state rebates that

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.670
are on top of the
federal tax credit.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.330
And I'll mention the
Massachusetts one

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.520
in a few minutes.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.760
Carpooling access.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.100
If you live in
California, you know

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.760
that those carpooling
stickers are like gold.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.060
There is literally a black
market for these stickers

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.060
because people are so
desperate to get out

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.030
of traffic and the
hours and hours

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.330
that they spend in traffic.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.320
So if you can have that carpool
lane sticker, even if you're

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.100
the only one driving as an
electric-vehicle driver,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.130
that's like gold.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.210
So having those kinds
of carpool-lane access

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.920
in other states, that is
really helpful as well.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.860
A waiver on parking registration
or emissions tests, these kinds

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.550
of small things we found
can make a difference.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.830
So getting more of them
in place in more states,

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.990
like Massachusetts,
is definitely

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.640
going to help accelerate the
electric vehicles market.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.910
In fact, who knows the number
one state right now per capita

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.490
for electric vehicle sales?

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.490
So I'll give you a hint.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.740
It is not California and
it is not Massachusetts.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.260
It is Georgia.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.940
And the reason it is
Georgia is because there

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.030
is a really generous
credit for driving

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.060
an electric car in Georgia.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.030
There's a significant discount
for driving an electric car

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.540
there because there's
this incentive in place.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.404
And so these incentives
definitely make a difference.

00:10:49.404 --> 00:10:50.820
So just to give
you a little sense

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.150
of the scale of how fast
we need to ramp up demand,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.970
we hired a consulting
firm to help

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.940
us evaluate how we can
make the biggest impact

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.100
and how fast we need to
accelerate this market.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.840
And what they
helped us understand

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.420
is that by the year
2025, we're expecting

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.830
to have about four million
electric cars on the road.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.320
Now think about the fact that
we have about 250 million cars

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.390
registered in this country,
cars and light trucks.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:23.430
So that's still a very small
sliver of the vehicle market.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.970
Now with an aggressive
campaign that's successful,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.550
we think we can bump that
up to somewhere between five

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.315
and seven million
electric vehicles by 2025.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.970
Where we think we need to be by
2025 to meet our climate goals

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.940
is more like 10 million
EVs on the road by 2025.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.370
So we really need to
redouble our efforts

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.540
and find other stakeholders,
other NGOs, other companies,

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.930
government agencies,
that we can partner with

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:56.320
to really focus on
accelerating this market.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.200
So I won't get too much into the
weeds in terms of the policies

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.722
that we're promoting.

00:12:00.722 --> 00:12:03.180
We can get back to that during
the Q&amp;A session if folks are

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.880
interested in , but these are
some of the key strategies that

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.050
we think are important.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.850
Public awareness,
which I mentioned.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.100
The consumer incentives.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.610
Workplace charging.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.690
The Department of
Energy has a program

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.700
called the EV Everywhere
Workplace Charging

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.590
Challenge, which
is a mouth full.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.560
And this is a program
that's working

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.540
to recruit about 500 major
businesses around the US

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.760
to join the program,
install charging stations

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.270
at workplaces, and get
more employees excited

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.900
about electric cars.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.810
They did a survey and
found that if somebody

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.950
has access to electric
vehicle charging at work,

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.910
they are 20 times more likely
to drive an electric car then

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:47.880
the average person.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.840
So clearly these workplace
charging programs

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.640
make a difference.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.590
Google is a member of
this workplace charging

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.570
program, which is fantastic.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.880
My understanding
is that there are

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.260
lots of EV chargers in
California at Google offices.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.180
I don't think, correct
me if I'm wrong,

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.260
I don't think
Google has installed

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.160
any here in Cambridge.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.590
I know there are few
charging stations around here

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.034
but not necessarily
installed by Google.

00:13:16.034 --> 00:13:17.450
Somebody in the
audience is saying

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.280
zero which means that there
is a need for more charging

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.130
stations in the area.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.880
So if anyone is actually
interested in working

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.100
with Google to get more charging
stations installed around here,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.040
I would be happy
to partner with you

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.450
to connect with the right folks
in your California offices

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.669
and see if we can
make that happen.

00:13:37.669 --> 00:13:38.960
Public charging infrastructure.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.240
Most people will charge at home
overnight, which is actually

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.660
good for the grid too, right?

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.070
Because most people are using
electricity when they're awake.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.500
And so if we can
be shifting some

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.982
of the load, the electricity
load, to the night,

00:13:53.982 --> 00:13:56.440
that actually makes everything
a little bit more efficient.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.680
So that's a good thing.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.180
But it is nice to have access to
public charging infrastructure.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.100
So if you're taking
a longer trip

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.040
and you want access to charging
infrastructure along the way

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.692
that's helpful.

00:14:08.692 --> 00:14:10.400
If you're going to be
stopping at a place

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.600
to shop for an hour or
so and want to top off,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.140
it's nice to be able to
have a charging station.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.510
So places like
Ikea are installing

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.560
charging stations,
which is great.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.770
And then utility programs.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.580
If you think about the
fact that right now,

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.570
the vast majority
of the market share

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.340
for the fuel for
our vehicles goes

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.240
to companies like
Exxon Mobil and Shell,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.480
and if we can shift some
of that market share

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.800
to domestic utility
companies, that

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.360
could be a really great
opportunity for these utility

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.730
companies to take some
of that market share.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.480
And some utility companies are
starting to figure that out,

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.960
that this is a great
opportunity for them.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.499
But we need more of
them to do the math

00:14:55.499 --> 00:14:57.040
and figure it out
and also figure out

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.780
how to incentivize electric
vehicles through things

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:05.480
like cheaper electricity rates
for electric-vehicle drivers

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.380
or cheaper nighttime rates,
which is again, the time when

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.680
most people will charge
their electric vehicles.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.930
So I encourage everybody to
check out our website which is

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:21.010
www.sierraclub.org/evguide.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.660
If you go there, you
can click on just

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.120
about any electric vehicle
which is on the market.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.880
We're actually
working to update it.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.380
There are few new models that
we haven't gotten up there yet

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.660
but we're working on it.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.380
You click on the
car, you find out

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.060
some information about the car.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.100
And then it gets interactive.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.010
You put in your zip
code and it tells you

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.170
things like how
much money you're

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.290
saving in gasoline
versus electricity

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.120
costs for fueling your vehicle.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.980
How much gasoline
you're avoiding.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.290
How much oil you're not
using and consuming.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.810
How much you're saving
in emissions, right?

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.100
So we've done the
math and figured out

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.800
that even with the
emissions associated

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.880
with the electricity used
to charge your vehicle,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.430
your electric vehicle
is still going

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.190
to be much cleaner than
a conventional vehicle.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.620
You've probably
heard people say,

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.600
oh electric cars
aren't so clean.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.720
They're just coal
cars because we're

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.630
using fossil fuels
to charge them.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.080
Raise your hand if you've
heard people say that.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.020
Yeah, pretty much
everybody has heard that.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.720
I hear it every day from
Sierra Club supporters

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.590
who are understandably
concerned about coal,

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.339
and natural gas,
and fossil fuels.

00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:29.880
That's great.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.940
We want people concerned about
these issues but rest assured,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.850
we've done the math
and figured out

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.440
that even factoring
in the emissions

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.080
associated with charging
electric vehicles,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.470
they are still
significantly cleaner

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:44.740
than conventional vehicles.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.990
And in a region
like New England,

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:51.540
that is especially true because
our reliance on the dirtiest

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.020
form of electricity, coal,
is actually pretty low

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.820
compared to other
parts of the country.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:02.550
So in Massachusetts, if you are
charging your electric vehicle,

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.730
let's say it's a fully
electric vehicle.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.800
It's going to be about
60 to 70% cleaner

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.650
in terms of carbon emissions
than a conventional vehicle.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.119
The average conventional vehicle
that you would buy today.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:17.310
So that's pretty significant
and it's pretty interesting.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.760
So if you go to
this website, you

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.609
can find out
information like that.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:22.040
We also have a quiz.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.560
It's a really short
online quiz that

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.569
helps you figure out which
EV might be best for you

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.670
based on a variety of factors.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.401
So check out the website.

00:17:32.401 --> 00:17:33.900
And now let me tell
you a little bit

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.530
about some interesting
opportunities in Massachusetts.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.580
So I serve on the
Governor's EV Task Force

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.640
in Massachusetts
which has started

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.840
to put in place some exciting
programs and incentives that

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.310
make electric vehicles more
appealing in Massachusetts.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.460
And the most exciting
part of that is a rebate.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.990
So that means if you lease or
purchase an electric vehicle

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.220
in Massachusetts,
you literally get

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:06.890
a check in the mail for anywhere
between $1,500 to $2,500,

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:10.210
depending on the size of
the battery of your vehicle.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.840
So it's a great opportunity.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.290
Our funding source
for that program,

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.854
right now it's a
pilot program, it

00:18:17.854 --> 00:18:20.020
looks like it may run out
in the next couple months.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.270
So I would say if you're
thinking of buying or leasing

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.754
a car in the next few months and
you're thinking about electric,

00:18:25.754 --> 00:18:28.170
now is a great time to do it
before that funding runs out.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.130
We're going to be working to
get that funding source renewed

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.800
but there may be a gap period.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.500
So I'd encourage you to
move faster than slower.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.160
And here is the website where
you can find out information

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.360
about this program
here in Massachusetts.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.620
So it's mor-ev.org.

00:18:49.102 --> 00:18:50.060
Oh, what a coincidence.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.980
I have a picture
here of Brian who's

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.280
going to be the
next speaker here.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.730
So as you've probably gathered,
people who drive electric cars,

00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:58.970
they love their cars.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:03.500
They become EV-angelists,
sorry for the pun.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.560
And I've had the good
fortune of meeting

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.510
Brian who is a Sierra Club
supporter and member and EV

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.820
driver.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.050
And I've had the
fortune of meeting lots,

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.650
and lots, and lots
of very excited

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.750
enthusiastic electric car
drivers around the country.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.350
And since Brian is
based right here,

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.750
we thought it would be great
if he came up and shared

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.290
a little bit about
his experience

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.220
with his Nissan Leaf.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.610
So why doesn't
Brian come up, talk

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.860
a little bit about his
experience, and then both of us

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.109
can do Q and A after that.

00:19:35.109 --> 00:19:37.150
BRIAN CALI: So thanks very
much and good morning.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.014
I own an EV because I met
Gina actually at another event

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:41.680
that we were at.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.092
And it happened to be
at that perfect time

00:19:44.092 --> 00:19:45.800
when I was considering
what we were going

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.204
to do with the Prius that
was at the end of its life

00:19:48.204 --> 00:19:49.870
and the fact that we
needed another car.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.610
So the timing was
absolutely perfect.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.740
And I came here
today because I think

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.350
that early adopters
of technology

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.309
play an important role.

00:19:58.309 --> 00:20:00.016
And there are some of
you who are already

00:20:00.016 --> 00:20:02.170
driving electric vehicles,
which is awesome.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.190
And I'm assuming
that the rest of you

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.460
are here because you're at
least somewhat interested.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.990
And so I think it's an
opportunity for those of us

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:11.340
who own to share our
experiences and answer questions

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.200
that people may have
so that there might

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.080
be some other folks
who decide to adopt.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.371
So actually, I don't have a
lot of prepared statements.

00:20:17.371 --> 00:20:18.850
I think really
ultimately the role

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.016
is going to be to answer
questions that people have.

00:20:21.016 --> 00:20:24.330
But just briefly I'll tell you
about my experience so far.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.900
So we bought our Nissan
Leaf in June of this year.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.980
I did a little bit of analytics
before I came here today

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.932
just to kind of take a
look at average energy

00:20:32.932 --> 00:20:34.890
consumption and other
things that we were doing

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:38.510
to kind of think about what
the cost impact for us has been

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.710
and how that matched up to what
I would expect to have seen.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.522
So before I go into that,
what I will tell you is we've

00:20:45.522 --> 00:20:46.980
been really delighted
with the car.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.760
The car gets most of it's
use for my wife actually

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.580
who commutes up to Salem
everyday from Arlington, MA.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.650
So she drives up
there every day.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.290
It's about a 29-mile
one-way trip.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.650
She comes back down.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.480
So it's 58-mile round
trip and there's still

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.822
miles left on the charge
to get around and run

00:21:03.822 --> 00:21:05.030
some other errands every day.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.980
So we have yet to what's called,
"turtling the car," which

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.680
is totally running
out of energy and be

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.930
stuck on the side of the road.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.056
We haven't turtled once.

00:21:12.056 --> 00:21:13.430
You definitely,
as an experience,

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.805
you always start out thinking,
how much charge do I have?

00:21:15.805 --> 00:21:17.770
And I want to make sure
that I don't use it up.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.404
So you're paying a
little more attention

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:23.070
than you would if you're driving
a gas-powered vehicle where you

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.028
can always find a gas
station and get some gas.

00:21:25.028 --> 00:21:27.290
So that's definitely
there but you

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.250
get used to it very quickly.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.210
I would say that the
surprise that I had is I'm

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.180
not really a car
person in the sense

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.387
that I'm not all that
interested in buying

00:21:35.387 --> 00:21:36.470
high-performance vehicles.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.145
I've never really had, I
drove that Prius I told you

00:21:39.145 --> 00:21:42.191
and before that, we drove the
Honda Civics my entire driving

00:21:42.191 --> 00:21:42.690
career.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:46.002
And I will tell you, this Leaf
is really, really fun to drive.

00:21:46.002 --> 00:21:48.210
Even as somebody who doesn't
care about those things.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.810
It's incredibly zippy.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.045
In traffic it's really
fun to be able to weave

00:21:54.045 --> 00:21:54.920
in and out of things.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.437
It's small, high performance,
that low center of gravity

00:21:57.437 --> 00:21:59.270
makes you feel like
when you're going around

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.882
turns that it really just turns.

00:22:00.882 --> 00:22:02.340
It takes those
turns really nicely.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.570
So it's actually been
really fun to drive.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.153
And we have four
drivers in our house.

00:22:05.153 --> 00:22:07.220
And we all fight for the
Leaf, basically whenever

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.950
somebody wants to
go on an errand.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.530
So it's a really
fun car to drive.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.920
We looked at some other
ones too at the time.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.890
And for us, again,
family of five,

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.300
it really does, and I put
that in my bio that was here,

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.545
we can fit our entire
family and our dog who

00:22:20.545 --> 00:22:23.200
is a 40-pound mutt
down in the bay

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.200
and still feel like,
we're packed in there,

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.650
but it's not ridiculous.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.470
We've even done
some trips that way.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.590
So it's a great, I
would say for us,

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.220
second car, because we
do take longer trips

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.610
as a family and
that obviously where

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.361
we get an 80-mile range
in the summertime.

00:22:37.361 --> 00:22:39.110
That's the other thing
I wanted to mention

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.170
is as we've headed into
the winter and it's cold,

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.340
both the performance of
the battery goes down

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.300
and you're using
heat which generates

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.260
more draw on the system.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.050
And so we're averaging
around more like 60

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.735
to 65 miles on the charge
in the winter time.

00:22:54.735 --> 00:22:58.590
That's been-- for us in
terms of impact on the house,

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:03.431
in terms of energy usage, it
adds about 250 kilowatt hours

00:23:03.431 --> 00:23:03.930
per month.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.305
You probably know
how much energy

00:23:05.305 --> 00:23:06.960
you're using at your own home.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.822
We've added on average 250
kilowatt hours on top of that.

00:23:09.822 --> 00:23:11.280
Which is interesting
because I also

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.260
know the mileage
that we're getting

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.099
and I have now figured
out that basically

00:23:17.099 --> 00:23:19.140
about 80% of the energy
that we're using to power

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.250
our car is coming from what I'm
doing by plugging in our house.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.915
And we're getting about 20%
out at charging stations

00:23:24.915 --> 00:23:27.030
that are out and around,
none of which we pay for.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.010
So I know that the system
pays for it ultimately

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:33.300
but the charging stations
at work or in communities

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.550
that we're parking at that
are essentially free to us,

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.450
they're all
charge-point systems.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.090
I've yet to be charged for
any one of my charging events.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.280
So I'm getting about 20% of
that basically out of pocket.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.920
So I think the other
thing I would say

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.590
is we, in contrast
to Gina, are not

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.160
able to put solar on our roof.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.035
That would've been a
really nice thing for us

00:23:52.035 --> 00:23:54.950
to do to get the notion that
we would be completely powering

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.940
our car with solar energy.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.260
There are options.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.026
And the one that I
did for a little while

00:24:00.026 --> 00:24:01.650
is the NSTAR Green,
where you basically

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.880
pay a premium on top of
your regular electric bill.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.422
Maybe some of you
are doing that too.

00:24:06.422 --> 00:24:08.130
Basically what you're
doing at that point

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.400
is it's not as if you're
buying green energy directly,

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.560
you're subsidizing or
creating a market for energy

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.232
that is generated in
more renewable ways.

00:24:16.232 --> 00:24:18.440
There's another program that
we're actually using now

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.310
through Mass Energy that is
less expensive than NSTAR

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.450
Green for us.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.300
And so basically,
we're paying $0.04 more

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:28.050
per kilowatt hour but all
of that is going directly

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.059
to pay for wind-generated
energy in this particular case.

00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:32.850
We can actually pay
$0.02 per kilowatt hour

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:37.000
and get renewable sources that
are bio-reactor, hydroelectric

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.410
local and wind, but we
chose a wind all option

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.060
and feel pretty good
about that right now.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.120
So all in all, I would say it's
been a really great experience.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.550
It's a fun community.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:50.280
So Gina pointed
out, we met earlier.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.380
We met again at the
Climate Change March.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.870
But I'm meeting my neighbors
now that are starting

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.659
to drive Leafs and
a BMW i3 showed up.

00:24:58.659 --> 00:24:59.700
And a little funny story.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.890
Actually, I experienced
it this morning

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.080
but I've experienced it at
other times over where I work,

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.788
which is just over
here on Binney Street.

00:25:04.788 --> 00:25:06.740
When I first started
driving this car in June,

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.610
there was one electric
plug-in Prius and always

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.342
a second open spot for charging.

00:25:11.342 --> 00:25:13.550
So whenever I drove to work,
which wasn't that often,

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.115
but when I did, it was like this
great spot on the first level

00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:18.115
of the parking garage and
I could always get it.

00:25:18.115 --> 00:25:20.850
And then right after Christmas
time, I started coming in

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.870
and there was this BMW i3 that
was parked in that second spot

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.370
and it was like, I
can't believe it.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:26.936
Now there's three
cars in this garage

00:25:26.936 --> 00:25:28.310
that are looking
for electricity.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.176
But the funny part
was I met this person

00:25:30.176 --> 00:25:32.050
and they live a block
and a half away from me

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.430
and we had this
great conversation

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:34.930
about our experiences
with the vehicles.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.020
Again, that sort of
early-adopter conversations

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:37.750
that started.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.080
And just today I drove the
car in because I thought

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.899
maybe we could take
some test drives,

00:25:41.899 --> 00:25:43.940
get some butts in seats
if people wanted to do it

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.340
and so we looked for
parking over here

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.256
and there are four
charging stations over here

00:25:47.256 --> 00:25:48.980
at the garage on the west side.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.939
And there were four
different electric vehicles

00:25:50.939 --> 00:25:52.855
that were parked in each
of those spots, which

00:25:52.855 --> 00:25:53.556
is fantastic.

00:25:53.556 --> 00:25:55.430
So I love that charging
stations are starting

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.770
to be taken up even at the same
time as I hate it right now.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.810
I'd love to see us expand
the number charging stations

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.860
locally so we can get
more people to drive in.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.890
So anyway, our experience
has been overall, incredibly

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:05.430
positive.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.638
I really have nothing to say.

00:26:06.638 --> 00:26:09.260
It's absolutely true about
the maintenance side.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.310
There's no checking oil.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.750
There's no-- we get
our tires rotated.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.360
We put 1,000 miles
a month in the car

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.401
which is exactly what
we're doing with our Prius.

00:26:16.401 --> 00:26:17.390
And it's been great.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:19.181
So I think with that,
we'll take questions.

00:26:19.181 --> 00:26:21.265
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yeah,
let's do some Q and A.

00:26:21.265 --> 00:26:22.681
BRIAN CALI: And
I'm sure there are

00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:25.071
other people with experience
that can share insights too.

00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:26.033
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Great.

00:26:26.033 --> 00:26:26.995
KURT: Can I start
for just a second?

00:26:26.995 --> 00:26:27.620
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD:
Yeah, Kurt.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.190
KURT: At Google here
we love metrics.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.898
BRIAN CALI: Yeah.

00:26:29.898 --> 00:26:32.860
KURT: So can you talk a
little bit about actual costs,

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.120
what the federal rebates
are, how that works

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:41.132
and what the actual--
you mentioned it,

00:26:41.132 --> 00:26:42.620
250 kilowatt hours.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.245
How does it work out
in actual dollars?

00:26:44.245 --> 00:26:45.245
BRIAN CALI: Yeah, great.

00:26:45.245 --> 00:26:48.170
I can do that one first which is
for everybody, your bill maybe

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:49.128
a little bit different.

00:26:49.128 --> 00:26:51.600
I'm paying about
$0.13 a kilowatt hour.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.865
So you can do the
math on that one.

00:26:53.865 --> 00:26:58.980
It's $30 or so a month
to get 1,000 miles.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.429
And that's the other
thing I wanted to say,

00:27:01.429 --> 00:27:02.845
so that was replacing
the car that

00:27:02.845 --> 00:27:04.761
was getting 45 miles to
the gallon too, right?

00:27:04.761 --> 00:27:07.100
So for me, I need to
tell you it was not

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.680
a total straight
up cost equation

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.612
about I want to save
money relative to gas.

00:27:10.612 --> 00:27:12.320
It is still true that
you can save money,

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.400
even at gas at $2.50.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.090
For me, it was
more about, again,

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.050
I wanted a car that I
felt good about driving.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.790
I wanted a car that was
taking a step in the direction

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.650
that I think we need to
move in as a country.

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:31.620
And simultaneously, we were able
to, again, make energy choices

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.800
around where we purchased
our electricity from too

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.760
to encourage and create
a marketplace for that.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.590
But all in all,
we're still saving.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.780
And on that calculus,
we save about $30

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:43.470
a month in gas versus
electric straight up.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.340
Even with the premium that
we're paying on our electricity.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.870
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD:
And to add to that,

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:52.920
the average cost of fueling an
electric car in this country,

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.010
and obviously it varies based
on the region of the country,

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.995
is about $1.25,
$1.30 per gallon,

00:27:59.995 --> 00:28:01.990
so the equivalent of that.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.770
So even with today's
low gasoline prices,

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:09.260
that still significantly
cheaper than using gasoline.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.780
You asked about the
federal tax credit.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.570
So that's up to $7,500.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.830
So that's for a full-battery
electric vehicle.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.700
And even some of
the plug-in hybrids

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.030
will get you that
much of a tax credit.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.330
Now of course, it also
depends on your taxes.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.720
Not everybody's going to be
eligible for the full amount

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.540
depending on all sorts
of complicated factors

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.520
about your own
personal tax return.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.475
But I think most
people's experiences

00:28:33.475 --> 00:28:38.120
is that they will get the
full tax credit of $7,500.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.900
And the state rebate
here in Massachusetts,

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.130
and I know that this is
being broadcast elsewhere,

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:47.730
so the state rebates and
credits are on top of that.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.381
So again in Massachusetts,
it's up to $2,500.

00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:52.880
And that's just a
check in the mail.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.580
So it doesn't matter
about your taxes.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.590
That's just a
straight up rebate.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.075
Yeah.

00:28:59.075 --> 00:29:00.950
AUDIENCE: One quick
comment and one question.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.158
I don't know how
many people here

00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:06.230
know about the Google
Drive Now program.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.330
You can go Drive Now.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.560
It's really awesome.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.845
You get the BMW i2.

00:29:11.845 --> 00:29:13.928
It's a great option if
you're going Mountain View,

00:29:13.928 --> 00:29:15.816
pick one up at the airport.

00:29:15.816 --> 00:29:17.232
Actually it's at SkyPark.

00:29:17.232 --> 00:29:19.592
It's a one-way rental.

00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:22.996
So you go to your hotel-- or
actually, you go to campus

00:29:22.996 --> 00:29:24.884
and you can just
take the shuttle

00:29:24.884 --> 00:29:26.094
to wherever you're staying.

00:29:26.094 --> 00:29:30.024
It's like, it's such a
wonderful experience.

00:29:30.024 --> 00:29:30.940
I really recommend it.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.820
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Can
you say the name of it again?

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:33.654
AUDIENCE: Drive Now.

00:29:33.654 --> 00:29:34.986
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Drive Now?

00:29:34.986 --> 00:29:35.920
AUDIENCE: It's by BMW.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.400
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: OK.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:36.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.840
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Great.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.880
AUDIENCE: And the Bay
Area is the pilot city

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.263
for the United States.

00:29:41.263 --> 00:29:44.254
They have a lot of locations
throughout Germany.

00:29:44.254 --> 00:29:46.670
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: And it's
like a rental program where

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.600
you are using electric
vehicles but you don't

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.145
have to pay if you
work for Google,

00:29:50.145 --> 00:29:51.270
is that what you're saying?

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.595
AUDIENCE: You do pay, but
I think Google gives you

00:29:54.595 --> 00:29:58.066
a little-- you get a
discounted rate with Google.

00:29:58.066 --> 00:29:59.440
It's actually very
cost-effective

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.432
even if you're not an
employee with Google.

00:30:03.432 --> 00:30:06.925
So it's a really great program.

00:30:06.925 --> 00:30:09.420
But the question that
I have that nobody

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.913
has ever been able
to answer it for me,

00:30:12.913 --> 00:30:15.281
currently I don't own a vehicle.

00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:16.905
So when we need a
vehicle for something

00:30:16.905 --> 00:30:19.400
we use Zipcar or
something like that.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.891
We try to get hybrids when
we can but not always.

00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:29.330
But given that we use a
vehicle very infrequently

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.655
but that sometimes
you have an emergency,

00:30:32.655 --> 00:30:34.080
you need to get
somewhere quickly.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.300
My question is, if I charge
the vehicle up and just sort of

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:46.855
let it sit, how long does
it take for the battery

00:30:46.855 --> 00:30:48.688
to drain of its charge
when it's not in use?

00:30:51.035 --> 00:30:52.410
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD:
Do you want

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:53.990
to answer that for
your own experience?

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:55.330
BRIAN CALI: I can not answer
that because I've never

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.204
let it sit that long.

00:30:56.204 --> 00:30:58.602
I do remember thinking
about that when we first-- I

00:30:58.602 --> 00:31:00.810
did a little bit of searching
on that that suggested,

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.130
there's obviously
dissipation over time,

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.510
but it wasn't at
an alarming rate.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.760
But I honestly don't remember
what the specifics were.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.070
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yeah,
and in the cold weather,

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.486
that would definitely
be an issue.

00:31:10.486 --> 00:31:14.620
If you're just letting your car
sit in freezing cold weather,

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.240
then the battery
charge is definitely

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.260
going to go down faster.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:23.482
So yeah, if you
expect that you're

00:31:23.482 --> 00:31:24.940
going to have the
kind of situation

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.670
where all of a sudden you're
going to need a vehicle when

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.163
you weren't expecting one,
then this might be a challenge.

00:31:31.163 --> 00:31:33.371
AUDIENCE: So let me answer
that a little bit for you.

00:31:36.935 --> 00:31:38.835
I have a Leaf.

00:31:38.835 --> 00:31:42.753
We've left it for several
weeks and when we got

00:31:42.753 --> 00:31:45.500
back it had the same percentage
charge as when we left.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.549
So the main traction battery
doesn't drop much at all.

00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:51.590
GINA COPLON NEWFIELD: Is
that even in the winter?

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:53.881
AUDIENCE: Even in the winter
the charge stays the same.

00:31:53.881 --> 00:31:56.622
Now if you leave it
outside and it cools down,

00:31:56.622 --> 00:32:02.992
as the battery gets cooler, it
has less energy to give back.

00:32:02.992 --> 00:32:06.370
It has a little bit
less capability.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:07.950
But not extremely so.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.911
It always helps if you
can keep it in a garage.

00:32:10.911 --> 00:32:13.246
It definitely keeps
the battery warmer

00:32:13.246 --> 00:32:15.146
and it just does better overall.

00:32:15.146 --> 00:32:16.520
BRIAN CALI: And
the other feature

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.140
that my wife and I discovered
that we really liked, which is,

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.650
so there's a little app
on Nissan Leaf where

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.358
you can basically
while your car is still

00:32:22.358 --> 00:32:25.297
plugged in in the wintertime,
as you were just mentioning,

00:32:25.297 --> 00:32:27.130
the battery performs
better when it's warmer

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.839
so you basically you can tell
it to start warming up the car.

00:32:29.839 --> 00:32:32.130
It will warm up the battery
and it will warm up the car

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.070
from your house,
so that you're all

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.903
ready to go when you
step out in the morning

00:32:34.903 --> 00:32:36.260
and unplug it and run.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.360
so that's a pretty nice
to come to a warm car.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.210
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yeah.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.085
BRIAN CALI: With a warm
battery, importantly.

00:32:41.085 --> 00:32:42.339
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yeah.

00:32:42.339 --> 00:32:43.880
AUDIENCE: Do you
have a sense of what

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.780
the overall environmental
impact of these cars

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.710
is pertaining to
manufacturing costs?

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:52.210
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:54.499 --> 00:32:56.540
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD:
Yeah, it's a good question.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.956
So for those who
couldn't hear, he

00:32:57.956 --> 00:32:59.770
was asking about the
environmental costs

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:01.350
of manufacturing.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:05.060
The battery is the
biggest component of that

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:10.940
and so the environmental
impact of advanced vehicles,

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.360
where you do have these
sophisticated batteries,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.550
is definitely greater than
with conventional vehicles.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.670
So that is something
important to look into.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:24.940
But again, when we do the math
and compare the full impact

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.970
of conventional cars
to electric cars,

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:33.070
the impact is still lower
for electric vehicles.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.740
One thing I think that's
encouraging about the batteries

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.340
is that for lead-acid batteries,
for conventional vehicles,

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.485
the recycle rate
for those batteries,

00:33:41.485 --> 00:33:44.340
you know once you sell
it for the last time

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:48.120
or turn it in
wherever, is about 98%.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.630
So it's really high for
lead-acid batteries.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.180
We think it's even
higher and will continue

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.320
to be even higher
for electric vehicles

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.010
because these are very
sophisticated batteries

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.180
and there are and
will continue to be

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:05.780
second uses and
third uses for them

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.940
in terms of energy storage.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.070
So it may not work well
enough for operating a vehicle

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:17.417
but companies can
use these batteries.

00:34:17.417 --> 00:34:19.500
AUDIENCE: Is there actually
a market for that now?

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.875
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: There
is a small and growing market

00:34:21.875 --> 00:34:22.845
for that now.

00:34:22.845 --> 00:34:23.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:27.633
And actually, my
second question is

00:34:27.633 --> 00:34:34.319
what would a gasoline price,
the imagined gasoline price

00:34:34.319 --> 00:34:36.615
make these cars
economically compulsive,

00:34:36.615 --> 00:34:40.108
given the absence of tax
credits or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.659
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: You
mean how high would gasoline

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:45.580
have to get?

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:49.660
AUDIENCE: Like would it be
$10.00 a gallon that make this

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.052
a no-brainer
decision for people,

00:34:51.052 --> 00:34:52.780
even if they didn't care
about the environment,

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.330
like the people that
just want to save money?

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:55.496
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Right.

00:34:55.496 --> 00:34:59.090
Well, I wish I can answer
that question in a simple way

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.200
but there are so many
factors involved, right?

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.757
So there's the
federal tax credit,

00:35:02.757 --> 00:35:03.840
there's the state credits.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.940
It sounds like you're saying
even without any of the credits

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.970
there's also whether you're
buying or leasing, right?

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.980
And people can get very
attractive monthly leases.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.560
Some people are
getting under $200

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.100
a month for leasing
cars like the Leaf

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:23.490
but not everyone necessarily
getting the same lease amount.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:25.930
Everyone's paying different
amounts for electricity

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:27.960
depending on what
part of the country

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.600
you live in or
even as Brian said,

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.750
you could choose which
utility program you're using.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.800
So I can't give
you a great answer.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.670
I could make
something up or guess

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.779
but I hesitate to do that.

00:35:41.779 --> 00:35:43.320
BRIAN CALI: Just on
first principles,

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.070
and I think it's a
really good question,

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:48.060
if I think about it from the
math that I talked to you

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.440
about, just on a straight
up basis, with gas at $2.50,

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.232
we're still saving.

00:35:52.232 --> 00:35:54.189
For the amount of
electricity that were paying,

00:35:54.189 --> 00:35:55.660
we're still saving money.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.160
And $1.25 it would be a break
even, somewhere in there

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.830
it would be a break even.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:03.730
So I think it partly depends
too on how much would compel you

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:06.559
to say, if I saved $100
a month, would that

00:36:06.559 --> 00:36:07.475
make me want to do it?

00:36:07.475 --> 00:36:08.439
If I save more or not.

00:36:08.439 --> 00:36:09.480
AUDIENCE: Car costs more.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.520
BRIAN CALI: And, what's that?

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.190
AUDIENCE: The car costs more.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.270
BRIAN CALI: Well, so that's
what I was going to say.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.810
So actually the Leaf,
I'm happy to share this.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.940
We pay roughly $30,000
for our car ignoring

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.300
all the other things
that happened there.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:24.030
In our case, for top-end Leaf,
I wanted the Bose sound system

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:25.510
so we put it in.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.740
And so, I don't know.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.530
For most of the
cars we were looking

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:30.830
at we would pay around that.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:33.371
So maybe we paid a little bit
of a premium but not that much.

00:36:33.371 --> 00:36:35.550
I think the bigger
thing that would, for me

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:38.720
anyway, that would flip
the switch is range a

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.690
is a real issue, right?

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.810
So it can't be our
only car unfortunately

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:43.450
because I get 80 miles on it.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.450
If you start to tell me
that I can get 450 miles

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.720
and I can charge
it pretty quickly,

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.970
and suddenly it's like-- and if
you made that cost competitive,

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.070
it'd be fantastic.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.760
But I think for me,
it's-- what's that?

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.260
AUDIENCE: We won't see something
like that happen very soon.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.350
BRIAN CALI: Well, so do
you want to speak to that?

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:00.433
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yes.

00:37:00.433 --> 00:37:04.450
The Tesla Model S already
goes 200 plus miles

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.450
on a single charge
and the Tesla drivers

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:09.244
have access to
these superchargers

00:37:09.244 --> 00:37:10.660
in many places
around the country.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.420
So that charges
them up pretty fast.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:16.779
Chevy just announced
last week, the Chevy Bolt

00:37:16.779 --> 00:37:19.320
that they're going to be coming
out within a couple of years.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.120
And that's going
to have, we think,

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.690
about a similar range
to Tesla but it's

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.000
going to be much less
expensive, probably somewhere

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.560
around $30,000 even without
tax credits and rebates.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.430
So you know, 200 plus miles.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:33.502
That's still not the 400.

00:37:33.502 --> 00:37:34.710
BRIAN CALI: Well, yeah, yeah.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:35.631
250 would do it.

00:37:35.631 --> 00:37:36.880
I can get to Albany, New York.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.464
There's a pretty lot
of range on that.

00:37:38.464 --> 00:37:40.629
As long as, you've got to
make sure there's chargers

00:37:40.629 --> 00:37:41.530
when you get there.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:42.320
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD:
And Nissan has

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.986
said that they're
going to be coming out

00:37:43.986 --> 00:37:45.862
with a longer-range vehicle.

00:37:45.862 --> 00:37:47.320
So we're definitely
starting to see

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.724
some new exciting announcements.

00:37:49.724 --> 00:37:50.260
Yes.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.218
AUDIENCE: Going back to
the previous discussion

00:37:52.218 --> 00:37:54.722
about the price break point.

00:37:54.722 --> 00:37:55.430
BRIAN CALI: Yeah.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.400
AUDIENCE: You said
$30,000 was the car price.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.929
Did that include the charging
station installation?

00:38:00.929 --> 00:38:01.970
BRIAN CALI: So it didn't.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:02.510
No.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.010
And I paid, so there's lots of
different ways you can do it.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.338
The dealers will
offer you something.

00:38:07.338 --> 00:38:09.780
AUDIENCE: From a couple
years ago when I test drove.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.613
I didn't know if those
had changed or what--

00:38:11.613 --> 00:38:14.940
BRIAN CALI: So I paid $500
on Amazon to buy a charger

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.510
and I paid an
electrician $125 or so

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.100
to come in and install
it into my house.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.760
And so, yeah, if you got it
through Nissan at the time,

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.540
it was like a $2,000 thing
with-- yeah, right, right.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:28.820
So I got it for just around
$500, maybe a little bit over,

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.467
and about $125 for
an electrician.

00:38:30.467 --> 00:38:32.050
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD:
And what I did--

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:34.440
BRIAN CALI: Say they were
on a 240 line in that case.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.356
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD:
Yeah, and for the Nissan

00:38:36.356 --> 00:38:38.810
Leaf or a fully electric
vehicle it makes complete sense

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:40.750
to have what's called
a level two charger.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:41.600
BRIAN CALI: Right.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.974
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: If you
have a plug-in hybrid like I

00:38:43.974 --> 00:38:46.500
do, you can actually just
use a regular 110 outlet.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.450
So we don't have a garage
but we have a driveway.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:52.037
We didn't have an outlet
on the side of our house

00:38:52.037 --> 00:38:54.120
next to the driveway so
we had an electrician come

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.320
for a couple hundred bucks,
install a regular 110 outlet

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.350
and we're good to go.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:02.850
AUDIENCE: So eventually these
batteries have to be replaced.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.725
How much does it cost to
replace the batteries on these?

00:39:05.725 --> 00:39:07.850
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:12.530
So obviously it's going
to change and develop.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.810
And so I think most
warranties for these batteries

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.570
are around eight years.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:21.190
And so for many people,
after eight years

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.460
it'll be time for another car.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.060
I think the vast
majority of people

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:29.740
will not be replacing the
battery for their very car.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.400
But for people who
do, it's definitely

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.120
going to be a significant cost.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.340
I can't tell you
for sure what it's

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.450
going to be eight years
from now because I think

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:40.670
battery costs are going to be
lower in eight years from now

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.220
than there are.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.670
But several thousand dollars.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:47.549
BRIAN CALI: Great question.

00:39:47.549 --> 00:39:48.923
That was our
calculus too though.

00:39:48.923 --> 00:39:49.423
Yeah.

00:39:49.423 --> 00:39:51.956
AUDIENCE: I actually wonder
about the eight-year number.

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:54.080
If you think about the
number of mechanical systems

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.200
that are in the car and
why I have in the past

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.500
replaced vehicles,
and especially, I'm

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.193
considering a Tesla which
has an aluminum body.

00:40:03.193 --> 00:40:05.156
At which point you're
thinking, you know,

00:40:05.156 --> 00:40:07.780
I could see in eight to 10 years
actually replacing the battery

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.224
pack on this vehicle
and keep it going.

00:40:10.224 --> 00:40:11.890
It seems a little
early, so far, to know

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.740
about the longevity
of electric vehicles.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.185
Do you have any
data about longevity

00:40:16.185 --> 00:40:18.789
in EVs versus
internal-combustion engines?

00:40:18.789 --> 00:40:19.830
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: No.

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:20.330
I mean.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:22.190
I think as you
said, it's too early

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.430
to have any good
research on that.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.560
I mean I think we could
get some information

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.690
from the automakers.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:31.220
I don't know how much we
could trust that information

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.700
because they obviously
have an interest in it

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.460
looking one way or another.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.866
So I think it's
too soon to tell.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.644
AUDIENCE: But we do have
some longevity information

00:40:42.644 --> 00:40:43.887
from the hybrids, right?

00:40:43.887 --> 00:40:44.970
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yes.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:46.360
AUDIENCE: For the
[INAUDIBLE] and--

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.443
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yes.

00:40:47.443 --> 00:40:51.680
So Prius has been doing very
well in terms of lasting long

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.990
and most people
will have a Prius,

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:57.710
a regular conventional
Prius, for a lot longer than

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.490
eight years without
replacing a battery.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.531
AUDIENCE: And that's going
the opposite direction

00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:04.220
in terms of complexity and
number of moving parts.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:07.170
That's in spite of that.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:08.655
AUDIENCE: Speaking
of hybrids, we

00:41:08.655 --> 00:41:12.255
had a hybrid, looking at sort
of a hybrid solution for us.

00:41:12.255 --> 00:41:14.171
We want to go with the
[INAUDIBLE] that we can

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:18.585
but what is the likelihood that,
have you heard about converting

00:41:18.585 --> 00:41:20.970
hybrids into the plug-ins?

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:23.210
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: There
are people and companies

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.110
who do that.

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.220
I know of a guy in
New Hampshire who

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:31.060
does that for Priuses
or Prii in particular.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.670
There are kits you
can get, if you

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.700
like to do this sort
of thing yourself.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:41.480
So if you just go to Google and
search for this sort of thing,

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.170
you know, Prius or
conversion kits,

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:45.870
or plug-in electric
conversion kits.

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.730
Or if you want to find a
company that will do it,

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.434
you'll probably find
what you're looking for.

00:41:51.434 --> 00:41:53.471
Yes, in the back.

00:41:53.471 --> 00:41:55.470
AUDIENCE: If we do go
turtle-up, what do you do?

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:59.110
Get it towed or what?

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.340
BRIAN CALI: Yeah, so we're
counting on AAA for us

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.050
if that happens.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:03.527
AUDIENCE: So what does AAA do?

00:42:03.527 --> 00:42:05.860
Can they charge on the spot,
or do they tow it, or what?

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.700
BRIAN CALI: So
rumor has it, AAA is

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:11.785
starting to encourage drivers
to carry a charging pack where

00:42:11.785 --> 00:42:14.390
they'll give you enough
juice to get somewhere.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.985
But we really hope not
to avail ourselves of it

00:42:16.985 --> 00:42:18.360
but I think it's
a good question.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:23.190
Otherwise I think you're
going to get towed somewhere.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.267
So.

00:42:24.267 --> 00:42:25.392
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yeah.

00:42:25.392 --> 00:42:30.322
AUDIENCE: So liquid fuel doesn't
necessarily imply fossil fuel.

00:42:30.322 --> 00:42:33.280
So what's your opinion
on alternative forms

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:38.230
of liquid fuel that
would [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:40.960
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: You mean
like bio-fuels or hydrogen fuel

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.800
cell vehicles as other example?

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.537
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah, I mean,
ethanol is an easy example

00:42:47.537 --> 00:42:49.245
to come up with, but
there are other ways

00:42:49.245 --> 00:42:51.225
of [INAUDIBLE]
manufacturing [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:51.225 --> 00:42:53.159
energy kinds of
chemical processes.

00:42:53.159 --> 00:42:53.700
I don't know.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.195
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yeah.

00:42:54.195 --> 00:42:56.195
AUDIENCE: But I presume
that these things exist.

00:42:56.195 --> 00:43:00.199
So what's your, do
you or Sierra Club

00:43:00.199 --> 00:43:02.115
have an opinion about
alternative liquid fuels

00:43:02.115 --> 00:43:05.332
that regular cars existing
could run on that does not

00:43:05.332 --> 00:43:07.560
have the same biological
impact, sorry,

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.570
ecological impact as crude oil.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.250
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: I'll say
a couple things about ethanol.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.820
Ethanol is a very mixed bag,
as you've probably heard.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.790
In some ways, it
is less polluting.

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:23.220
In other ways, there are
significant environmental

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:23.720
costs.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:29.120
Sometimes the land that
that you have to develop

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.420
and the water that you have to
pollute because of the ethanol

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.500
production is going to have a
very heavy environmental cost.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.590
So I would say overall, the
environmental advocacy world

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:44.500
is not going all gangbusters
promoting ethanol.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.000
Another thing I'll
say about ethanol

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.280
is that a lot of vehicles
are considered flex vehicles.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.530
So you'll see that on a lot
of cars, like Flex Fuel.

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:56.580
The vast majority of these
cars that are flex fuel capable

00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:00.640
aren't actually operating
on ethanol or other kinds

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.470
of alternative fuels.

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:06.270
So it's a little bit,
it's a whole long story,

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.804
but when new fuel economy
standards were negotiated

00:44:09.804 --> 00:44:11.970
several years ago, it was
a little bit of a giveaway

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:14.770
to the car companies to say
that they could get credit

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:18.040
for these cars being cleaner
when in reality, most

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:23.710
of these cars were being fueled
by regular gasoline or diesel.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.420
Hydrogen fuel cell
vehicles, we're

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.080
definitely keeping
them on our radar.

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:33.030
They're not really a viable
option for most people.

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:36.150
In California, they're
starting to become available,

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.589
they're starting to
install charging stations,

00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:41.630
But you've got to get the
hydrogen from somewhere

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:43.850
and for most people,
that's from natural gas.

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:46.970
And so whereas
with electric cars,

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:49.090
yes, right now you're
getting your electricity

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:51.580
from a whole range of sources.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.190
They're getting
cleaner over time

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.600
because over time we're
shifting to more renewable

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.700
sources of power.

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.600
If you're getting
your natural gas from,

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.710
or you're getting your
hydrogen from natural gas,

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.270
that's not exactly
a clean source.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:06.734
You can get it from solar and
there are some examples of that

00:45:06.734 --> 00:45:08.150
and there are some
electric buses.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:11.510
Hydrogen fuel cell buses
that run on hydrogen

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.440
and they get their
hydrogen from solar.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.840
So that's great.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.870
But it's complicated.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:21.700
So I think we're keeping these
kinds of advances on our radar

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.200
screen, but right now we're
most excited about promoting

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.130
plug-in electric vehicles
because they're available

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:31.050
and the technology has
really evolved much faster

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.570
than some of these other ones.

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.049
Yeah.

00:45:34.049 --> 00:45:37.993
AUDIENCE: You mentioned earlier
about having businesses put up

00:45:37.993 --> 00:45:41.444
the money or take the time
to install charging stations

00:45:41.444 --> 00:45:44.895
where their
employees might park.

00:45:44.895 --> 00:45:46.374
What's happening
in Massachusetts

00:45:46.374 --> 00:45:48.811
to try to increase the
number of public stations?

00:45:48.811 --> 00:45:50.811
Are we really relying on
the Googles, the Ikeas,

00:45:50.811 --> 00:45:51.644
or other businesses?

00:45:51.644 --> 00:45:54.360
Or is there some sort of
incentive and progress there?

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.680
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.050
I'll give a couple examples.

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:03.380
So the Massachusetts
Department of Energy Resources,

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.270
I believe that's
the agency that's

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:07.440
overseeing this
particular program,

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.060
they have a program
where they'll give grants

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:14.370
to workplaces to offset the
costs of workplace charging.

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:18.270
So for example, I went to a
huge office park in Wellesley,

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:20.820
Massachusetts a few months
ago where they had just

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.220
installed 16 charging
stations at their offices

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.580
and they got a lot of help
from the state to do that.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:28.560
So it's a win-win.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.550
If it's a win for the company
to be able to provide this

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.000
benefit to their employees.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.220
It's a win for the employees
who can now charge at work.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.880
It's a win for the
state because they

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:42.040
have goals they need
to meet in terms

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.480
of reducing their emissions.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.250
So that's a great program.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:46.122
Google--

00:46:46.122 --> 00:46:47.540
AUDIENCE: Will
fuel companies ever

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.060
be requested to add
overnight parking

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.210
stations at their facilities?

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:54.730
I mean, that seems like
an obvious place, right?

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:57.440
It would be a first
come first serve

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.565
but you'd know that you
could park there overnight.

00:46:59.565 --> 00:47:00.996
Like, you're not going
to get barricaded in.

00:47:00.996 --> 00:47:03.263
You don't have to work
for that business that

00:47:03.263 --> 00:47:04.682
pays for that space.

00:47:04.682 --> 00:47:08.349
But that seems like a
really interesting avenue,

00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:09.890
if people aren't
already pursuing it.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:11.740
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: You
mean a parking garage?

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.614
AUDIENCE: I'm Sunoco.

00:47:12.614 --> 00:47:17.650
I need to say that n percentage
of my local [INAUDIBLE],

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:20.620
wherever I deliver fuel,
I'm responsible for creating

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.465
alternative fueling.

00:47:22.465 --> 00:47:23.590
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yeah.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.048
That's an interesting idea.

00:47:25.048 --> 00:47:28.783
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
fuel companies are getting

00:47:28.783 --> 00:47:31.024
incentives to research
alternative forms.

00:47:31.024 --> 00:47:34.145
It seems like a thing that
would help the consumption grow.

00:47:34.145 --> 00:47:36.660
It would ease the
burden on people

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.118
if they don't want
to, particularly

00:47:38.118 --> 00:47:39.659
if they live in an
apartment building

00:47:39.659 --> 00:47:42.948
where they can't actually ask to
have someone install a charging

00:47:42.948 --> 00:47:43.448
station.

00:47:43.448 --> 00:47:44.573
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yeah.

00:47:44.573 --> 00:47:46.040
That's an interesting idea.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.790
So in terms of public
charging stations,

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:51.390
the state is also giving some
grant money for public charging

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:52.430
stations.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:55.810
But I think at this point,
most of the money for that

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.530
is being spent by businesses
themselves, either

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:00.960
because they want to
incentivize their employees

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.890
or their customers.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:06.326
Companies like Walgreens are
starting to install them.

00:48:06.326 --> 00:48:08.326
BRIAN CALI: I've charged
at Walgreens in Beverly

00:48:08.326 --> 00:48:08.830
several times.

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:09.390
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Have you?

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:10.045
BRIAN CALI: Yeah.

00:48:10.045 --> 00:48:11.470
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: I think
that's actually interesting

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:13.180
because usually when
you charge your car,

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.780
you want to spend
more than 10 minutes.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.600
I don't know if I've ever
spent more than 10 minutes

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.453
at a Walgreens.

00:48:17.453 --> 00:48:18.380
BRIAN CALI: That's
right, that's right.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.170
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: So
I think it's interesting

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.670
that that company in particular
has charging stations.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:25.500
I think it makes more sense
for a company like Ikea

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.450
where you might be
spending an hour or two

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:29.590
and you could get at
significant charge.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:31.080
BRIAN CALI: Yeah.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.900
The Nissan dealers all have
charging stations as well.

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.080
And actually, we've
discovered that they're

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.630
right near my kid's
soccer fields.

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:40.374
Very frequently we'll
drive out to Lancaster,

00:48:40.374 --> 00:48:42.540
for example, there's a main
soccer complex out there

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:44.706
and we were worried about
taking the Leaf because it

00:48:44.706 --> 00:48:47.100
was, one-way it was
40 some odd miles

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.400
and if it was a cold we
were a little bit worried.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.450
And then we realized
there's a Nissan

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:51.800
dealer like right
near the fields.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.299
And so we went over and we would
drive out, plug-in the car,

00:48:54.299 --> 00:48:55.860
go watch the game, drive home.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:56.480
Great thing.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.856
So we've discovered
them in strange places.

00:48:58.856 --> 00:49:01.397
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] reserving
time on the charging stations

00:49:01.397 --> 00:49:05.072
to make sure you have a spot?

00:49:05.072 --> 00:49:07.030
BRIAN CALI: There are
some that are reservable.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.050
There are some that are
first come first serve.

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:11.969
So that's been my
experience overall.

00:49:11.969 --> 00:49:14.260
One of the other things that's
been actually quite nice

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.800
is and the Leaf owner
will resonate with this.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.954
It's a great, actually, do
you want to speak to it?

00:49:18.954 --> 00:49:19.620
Your experience?

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.182
Yeah, go ahead. yeah.

00:49:21.182 --> 00:49:23.405
AUDIENCE: Most of the
ones in Massachusetts

00:49:23.405 --> 00:49:25.530
that are charge point, on
the charge point network,

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:28.700
you can't reserve because
you don't pay for them.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.690
I think the laws
previously were that you

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:33.230
couldn't resell electricity.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:36.432
So no one was allowed to
charge you for charging.

00:49:36.432 --> 00:49:38.390
I think that's changed
because some of the ones

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:41.530
at Walgreens you actually
do pay to charge.

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.776
Generally speaking,
almost all the chargers

00:49:44.776 --> 00:49:47.608
are either at a couple of
very progressive companies,

00:49:47.608 --> 00:49:53.402
there's like a Stop and
Shop out near Framingham

00:49:53.402 --> 00:49:55.628
that has like nine chargers.

00:49:55.628 --> 00:49:58.379
But they have a
whole solar roof too.

00:49:58.379 --> 00:49:59.920
They've really done
a good job there.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.850
But most of the other ones
are in paid parking lots.

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:06.970
Either at the airport, there are
two level one and two level two

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:10.040
chargers at one of the
parking lots next door.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:14.310
There's about 12 cars that vie
for parking there at this time.

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:18.080
So unless you're early,
you don't get to charge.

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.880
Today I was late.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.720
I'm going to have to look for
charging maybe at 5:00 o'clock

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.440
or 6:00 o'clock to get home.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.540
There were two questions
that were asked earlier.

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.380
One was the replacement
cost on the battery.

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:34.440
For the Leaf, they've
announced that it's

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:39.000
$5,500 plus installation.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.842
I wouldn't expect to need
that until at least ten years

00:50:41.842 --> 00:50:44.110
based on the last
two years of driving.

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:47.730
At 20,000 miles, I've
still got well over,

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:52.205
between 90 and 95% capacity
left on the battery.

00:50:52.205 --> 00:50:54.405
And most of the drop
happens the first year

00:50:54.405 --> 00:50:56.117
and then it slower after that.

00:50:56.117 --> 00:51:00.467
So that should give you an idea
on a roughly $30,000 vehicle,

00:51:00.467 --> 00:51:07.010
you're talking about
15%, 15, 20% of the cost

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:09.210
to replace the battery.

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:13.364
There was another question
about if you run out.

00:51:13.364 --> 00:51:15.870
I think the other
manufacturer's also have this

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:18.760
but for Nissan, part of
their Protection Plan

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.930
is towing in case you
run our of charge.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:28.160
You have to work at it
to run out of charge.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.342
And once you get the idea
of where you can go and get

00:51:31.342 --> 00:51:35.040
your routine going, generally
won't have that issue.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.845
And the only people that it's
really hard for targeting

00:51:38.845 --> 00:51:41.960
is apartment dwellers.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.906
If you're at home, you have
a charging station at home.

00:51:44.906 --> 00:51:47.740
That's where you can
depend on it every night.

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:52.068
At work it's nice right now when
you can get one of those spots.

00:51:52.068 --> 00:51:55.026
If there were more
chargers at work here

00:51:55.026 --> 00:52:01.460
and the state plan helped us pay
half of the cost of the $25,000

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.244
to install chargers,
that would be great.

00:52:04.244 --> 00:52:06.310
Right no we're
sharing four chargers

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.460
among a whole lot of
companies around here.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.347
So getting more
installed would be good.

00:52:11.347 --> 00:52:13.180
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD:
Just out of curiosity,

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:17.040
is there anybody who is
interested in pursuing

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.460
the idea of Google
installing some more charging

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.510
stations here in Cambridge?

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:26.180
So if so, let's talk
afterwards because I

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:27.880
can't make any
guarantees obviously

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.950
but I can make some
introductions to folks

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:32.413
who might be able to help
you make that happen.

00:52:32.413 --> 00:52:34.337
KURT: I had two comments.

00:52:34.337 --> 00:52:37.704
One is that we don't
actually own the garage

00:52:37.704 --> 00:52:38.858
because they're all shared.

00:52:38.858 --> 00:52:40.524
So I don't know how
much that would fly.

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:43.700
The other one is that I
was talking to Steve Vinter

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.120
the other day and he says that
there are plans to put chargers

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.970
in this building
in the east garage.

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:53.780
How many, when they're
going in, I can't tell you.

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.981
But there are plans to
put them in this building.

00:52:57.981 --> 00:53:00.480
AUDIENCE: You might have noticed
we're right on the Red Line

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.938
here and we have
quite a few people

00:53:01.938 --> 00:53:03.779
who don't park in
these garages here

00:53:03.779 --> 00:53:06.070
which is good because we're
going to scale up employees

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:08.490
much faster than available
parking is going to scale up.

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:10.820
In fact, it's going to go down.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.932
I personally happen to park
at the end of the Red Line

00:53:13.932 --> 00:53:16.648
and I know the MBTA,
whoever they contracted

00:53:16.648 --> 00:53:18.460
with, there's a handful
of parking there.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.793
But that's something you might
want to put on your radar

00:53:20.793 --> 00:53:24.055
as well is these suburb
terminal parking garages

00:53:24.055 --> 00:53:25.994
at the end of the
Mass Transit lines.

00:53:25.994 --> 00:53:27.160
Those should be big targets.

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:27.586
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yeah.

00:53:27.586 --> 00:53:28.864
AUDIENCE: Big chargers.

00:53:28.864 --> 00:53:29.720
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD:
Great point.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.420
KURT: Are you at Alewife?

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:31.070
That end?

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:31.670
Yeah, me too.

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:34.110
And so actually, so my
experience there is,

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.550
they're just now at capacity.

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:38.000
So again, early in the summer,
could always find a spot.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.200
Now it's starting
to get to the point

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.283
where there's enough cars
on the road where those,

00:53:41.283 --> 00:53:45.342
I think it's six to eight spots,
those fill up in the morning.

00:53:45.342 --> 00:53:46.800
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD:
So I think we

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.080
might have time for one
more question or comment.

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:49.662
Yeah.

00:53:49.662 --> 00:53:51.370
AUDIENCE: So you were
talking about going

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:53.202
like 80 miles and whatnot.

00:53:53.202 --> 00:53:56.460
But how is it in a commute
that you have to sit-in traffic

00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.490
and get in to work, even if
it's only 7 or 10 miles away,

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:02.120
you're still sitting in traffic
for half an hour to an hour?

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.362
How does that weigh
on the battery?

00:54:04.362 --> 00:54:05.570
BRIAN CALI: It's much better.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:06.653
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Yes.

00:54:06.653 --> 00:54:07.980
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:09.480
So today I was late.

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.474
I had to rush in here and I
probably used up about 50%

00:54:14.474 --> 00:54:17.390
of the battery capacity
going 22 miles.

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:20.306
That because I was going
maybe substantially

00:54:20.306 --> 00:54:22.510
faster than the
recommended limit.

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:25.906
if I was, I could--

00:54:25.906 --> 00:54:27.280
AUDIENCE: What
does it really use

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.030
when you're kind
of like idling--

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:30.822
AUDIENCE: But if you're
not [INAUDIBLE]--

00:54:30.822 --> 00:54:33.196
when you're going, the best
speed to go is about 20 miles

00:54:33.196 --> 00:54:34.470
an hour.

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:38.284
If you're in stop and start,
it doesn't use much at all.

00:54:38.284 --> 00:54:40.450
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: If
you are stopped or braking,

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:42.380
so if you're stopped,
you're using nothing.

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:45.020
If you're braking, you're
actually recharging and adding

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.240
more miles to your battery.

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.660
AUDIENCE: I had gone, just
recently in the winter,

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:54.430
I've gone over a hundred
miles on the one charge

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:57.442
just because I was
careful and very slow.

00:54:57.442 --> 00:55:01.680
You know, slow, maybe
five under the limit.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.460
And that included some
time on the turnpike

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:09.890
so you can stretch it out if
you go slow, drive easily.

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:13.014
And that's stop and go.

00:55:13.014 --> 00:55:17.544
You just go at a nice, even
pace and it works really good.

00:55:17.544 --> 00:55:18.710
GINA COPLON-NEWFIELD: Great.

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:20.450
Well, thank you
everybody so much.

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.250
It was really a
pleasure to be here.

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:24.960
Thank you Kurt for
inviting us to come.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.160
And I think we're going
to be available to chat

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.440
over lunch afterwards.

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.290
So thanks for having us.

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:31.540
BRIAN CALI: Thanks for coming.

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.590
[APPLAUSE]
