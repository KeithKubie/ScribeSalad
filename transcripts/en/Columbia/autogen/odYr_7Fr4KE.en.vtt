makes certain individuals more likely to
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.420
makes certain individuals more likely to
develop complicated grief and what are

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
develop complicated grief and what are

the best most targeted therapeutic
strategies for these individuals and so

strategies for these individuals and so
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.110
strategies for these individuals and so
it's questions like this that I think

honored to be a part of this Center I
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.980
honored to be a part of this Center I
did my PhD work studying social bonding

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
did my PhD work studying social bonding
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.620
did my PhD work studying social bonding
in an animal model and I can say that at

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
in an animal model and I can say that at
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.180
in an animal model and I can say that at
this point we have a reasonable

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190
this point we have a reasonable
 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.250
this point we have a reasonable
understanding of the brain mechanisms

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260
understanding of the brain mechanisms
 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.109
understanding of the brain mechanisms
that allow us to form bonds with one

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
that allow us to form bonds with one
 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.380
that allow us to form bonds with one
another whether they be between mates

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390
another whether they be between mates
 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.640
another whether they be between mates
between friends between family members

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650
between friends between family members
 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.640
between friends between family members
but we have essentially no idea what

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650
but we have essentially no idea what
 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.039
but we have essentially no idea what
happens when we sever those bonds what

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049
happens when we sever those bonds what
 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.310
happens when we sever those bonds what
happens within the brain and so it's

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
happens within the brain and so it's
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.869
happens within the brain and so it's

selective bonds with their mating
 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.330
selective bonds with their mating
partner and they'll show a preference to

spend time with that partner they'll
 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.170
spend time with that partner they'll
raise the offspring together and sort of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180
raise the offspring together and sort of
 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.300
raise the offspring together and sort of

lifestyle and this is in direct contrast
 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.030
lifestyle and this is in direct contrast
with the majority of rodents that we

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
with the majority of rodents that we
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.309
with the majority of rodents that we
study in the laboratory so both mice and

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319
study in the laboratory so both mice and
 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.259
study in the laboratory so both mice and
rats the ones that you read about read

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269
rats the ones that you read about read
 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.849

York Times don't form these bonds

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900
York Times don't form these bonds
 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.659
York Times don't form these bonds
between mates they're promiscuous and

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669
between mates they're promiscuous and
 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.580
between mates they're promiscuous and
typically just the mothers raise the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590
typically just the mothers raise the
 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.949
typically just the mothers raise the
offspring and so we know the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959
offspring and so we know the
 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.229
offspring and so we know the
neurobiological basis of this bonding

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239
neurobiological basis of this bonding
 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.270
neurobiological basis of this bonding
behavior involves and now what we hope

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280
behavior involves and now what we hope
 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.939
behavior involves and now what we hope
to do is disrupt these bonds as a way to

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:02.949
to do is disrupt these bonds as a way to
 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.220
to do is disrupt these bonds as a way to
begin to understand what happens in

following the loss of a loved one as you

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959
following the loss of a loved one as you
 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.360
following the loss of a loved one as you
can imagine this wasn't pointed out

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370
can imagine this wasn't pointed out
 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.390
can imagine this wasn't pointed out
earlier but it's difficult oftentimes to

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400
earlier but it's difficult oftentimes to
 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.159
earlier but it's difficult oftentimes to
convince people to be research subjects

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169
convince people to be research subjects
 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.780
convince people to be research subjects
immediately after they've lost a loved

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790
immediately after they've lost a loved
 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.099
immediately after they've lost a loved
one and some people consider it

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109
one and some people consider it
 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.809
one and some people consider it
unethical to ask them at that time in

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819
unethical to ask them at that time in
 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.490
unethical to ask them at that time in
their lives to be part of a research

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500
their lives to be part of a research
 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.699
their lives to be part of a research
study and for this reason to get it the

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709
study and for this reason to get it the
 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.710
study and for this reason to get it the
most proximal mechanisms of what happens

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720
most proximal mechanisms of what happens
 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.059
most proximal mechanisms of what happens
when you lose a loved one I think that

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069
when you lose a loved one I think that
 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.110
when you lose a loved one I think that
prairie voles are going to be an

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120
prairie voles are going to be an
 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.949
prairie voles are going to be an
incredible useful model so for this

incredible useful model so for this
 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.289
incredible useful model so for this
reason with the help of my colleagues I

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299
reason with the help of my colleagues I
 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.849
reason with the help of my colleagues I
really look forward to the studies that

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859
really look forward to the studies that
 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.619
really look forward to the studies that
we'll be doing in the next few years to

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629
we'll be doing in the next few years to
 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.569
we'll be doing in the next few years to
begin to identify translational

begin to identify translational
opportunities to understand the

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069
opportunities to understand the
 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.830
opportunities to understand the
biological mechanisms not only

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840
biological mechanisms not only
 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.439

underlying grief but also complicated

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449
underlying grief but also complicated

grief I think this is a topic that's of
 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.920
grief I think this is a topic that's of
wide interest to many fields not the

wide interest to many fields not the
 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.270
wide interest to many fields not the
least of which are psychiatry and

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280
least of which are psychiatry and
 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.009
least of which are psychiatry and
neuroscience and I think it's also a

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019
neuroscience and I think it's also a
 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.080
neuroscience and I think it's also a
testament to sort of the pioneering
