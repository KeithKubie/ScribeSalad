&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Hi, we're here at Google I/O.
My name is Brad Neuberg. I'm with the Open

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.160
Web Advocacy team. And we've got Charles McCathieNevile
from Opera and David Story...

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.510
&gt;&gt; STORY: Hey.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Also from Opera.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.400
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Also from Opera with a great really

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.360
cool Opera, heavy-metal t-shirt, very nice.
So everyone knows what Opera is. So I wanted

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.600
to jump in, what kind of things are you involved
in right now. What are some new interesting

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.870
things that Opera is working in its desk?
&gt;&gt; STORY: Well, it's, one of the big things

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.440
we have now which we're developing is Opera
Dragonfly which is a Web developer tool. So

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.219
it's similar [INDISTINCT] like Firebird, except
this is architected that it can work on any

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.319
device so you can use it on your mobile phone
and you connect through a proxy to the desktop

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:50.620
computer instead of having to use emulators
and things like that. You can debug directly

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.519
from the phone. So it's something very interesting.
We're doing also Opera widgets is something

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.940
which is getting big take off in the mobile
space with things like phone to phone and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.499
T-mobile, just...
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: So they're no longer Opera

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.900
widgets, like W3C widgets, 'cause two or three
ECO, when every man and their dog was building

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.909
a widget or a gadget or whatever you want
to call them, Opera went to W3C and said,

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.869
"Everyone is doing this. Let's make one version
that everybody can use, so developers don't

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.700
have to code eight times." And that's something
we're doing. We're doing some other stuff.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.149
We're doing--we put out a geo-location builds,
like, the Google contributed an editor and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.049
the spec, Opera has done implementation of
geo-location [INDISTINCT] so we made a build

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.829
that you can do that. We're working on 3D
Canvas being Chronos which is, you know, with

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.939
Mozilla and looking at the O3D and different
ways of doing that. There's a whole heap of

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.840
stuff about access to your platforms.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Right.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.240
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: So being able to use the
camera or being able to send an SMS if you've

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.850
got a phone connection or a network like a
phone card, like, any of that, your laptop,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.549
being able to, you access information like
the address book or your calendar stuff. So

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:13.530
you can do things like have your Web information
and your local information connect to each

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.530
other and synchronize better, just making
it more flexible.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.820
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: What are some, sort of, there's
technologies that have been around. They're

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.040
starting to mature like SVG...
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah, sure.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.730
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: And there are sort of newer technologies
coming down the pipe, like, geo-location,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.730
what are some technologies that you're particularly
excited about that finally, it seemed like,

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.920
they are getting in front of developers, and
what are some of the newer technologies that

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.500
you're also excited about?
&gt;&gt; STORY: I think things are just starting

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.240
to get in front of developers, things like
Canvas is starting to really take off, a lot

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.340
of people are using that, saying which I think
is a bit of a sleeper here, as SVG as you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.900
mentioned is getting very support in browser
except for one obvious browser which doesn't

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.370
support, which I know you're doing work on
trying to rectify that with the plug-in you're

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.780
developing. So I think as we get things like
supported, IE supported, that will start taking

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.980
off and it will become a real platform we
can develop too, like what Flash has been

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.120
for so long.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: You know, just to add in really

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.690
quick, it's, just the JavaScript talk in that
point.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.090
&gt;&gt; STORY: All right, all right. Sure.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Right. So, I mean, I think

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.150
the location, location in particular, a lot
of the device access, it's exciting, you know,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.310
it's going to let developers do cool things.
One of the reasons I actually find exciting

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.730
is the security aspects are incredibly serious,
getting at physical locations is a really

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.980
big deal. And the technology, yeah, we've
had the technology for a long time.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.870
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Right.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: What's bringing it out

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.510
to developers is people saying, "You know,
if we get the security right then we can do

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.810
some cool stuff, it's time to get the security
right." And that's actually going back and

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.120
translating back to the rest of the Web and
saying, you know, if we get security right

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.730
and let people understand what they're doing,
then, we can do more interesting things across

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.480
the whole web.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Yeah.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.930
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: And I think that's actually
a really exciting trend. But, you know, you

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.040
won't see it. That's not a technology that
you pick up. It's a way of using the Web that

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.900
will, you know, just change the paradigm gently
and very radically.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.320
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: I've actually heard this from
members of Internet Explorer team that it's

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.150
not about functionality as much as it's about
security and the user interface surrounding

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.449
security.
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah, sure.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:26.380
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: How do you make a UI that can
go in front of hundreds of millions of people

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.250
that they can understand and it will remain...
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: That they get and that

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.220
they use.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: That they get, yeah.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.640
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: 'Cause what we have today,
you know, we say this if it gets expired.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.740
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Exactly.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Do you want to continue?

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.420
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Okay, okay, okay.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Yes, yes, yes, right.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.110
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Yeah, exactly.
&gt;&gt; STORY: So...

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.490
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: So, yeah, a lot of it is--yeah,
there is some technical stuff about securing

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.800
things, you know, the technical bits are generally
reasonably well understood.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.060
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: The UI, it's really, really

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.680
hard.
&gt;&gt; STORY: I don't think anyone solved that

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.930
yet.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: No. It's, it's, and it's

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.610
an ongoing and changing problem. And, you
know, security in general is. But figuring

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:05.460
out the way people behave is crucial and difficult.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Yeah. So I think, one more question,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.830
can I just have one more question? What do
you see are some significant unsolved problems?

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.220
So lots of attention is happening around...
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Yeah.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.900
&gt;&gt; You talked about. What are some sort of
the unique thing that you think hasn't gotten

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.160
as much focus, it could be a place for future
growth or direction?

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.470
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: So security stuff.
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.100
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Looking at dealing with
text, you know, having live text, building

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.250
text there, there's some building, authoring
software on the web, at the moment it's just

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.650
kind of messy. You can build a packaged native
application, C++ program and download it.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.090
But getting good authoring systems...
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Yeah.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.430
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: So that people can create
content. You know, you look at what people

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.250
do and they type some pseudo mark-ups in blogs,
stuff, it's garbage, right? Let's figure out

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.380
how to make that, you know, a thousand times
better.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.330
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Yeah. And the hack is necessary
to really make it full feature...

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.880
&gt;&gt; STORY: Sure.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.780
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: I mean, you can do it but it's
hard.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.669
&gt;&gt; STORY: Exactly.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: At the moment, the reason

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.050
why we have [INDISTINCT] is partly 'cause...
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.950
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: The technology doesn't
actually give us all of the things we need.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.160
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: That's right, that's right.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.040
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: And building that up, and
the other thing, you know, accessibility is

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.520
always a challenge.
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.870
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: And there's a lot of new
work that, like always, you know, just ignores

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.470
accessibility and leaves it to some other
time.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.360
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: It's a very tricky issue.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: And getting that into front

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.930
and center when you start developing, not
after you've done it and tried to, you know,

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.010
deal with it.
&gt;&gt; STORY: And you've got the formats issue

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.669
as well with things like video, for instance,
there's no standard codec and...

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.660
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: That's right.
&gt;&gt; STORY: There's a lot of fear and uncertainty

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.870
of things like [INDISTINCT] is a submarine
[INDISTINCT]. Then, of course, there's the

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:53.120
fonts issue with their format where Microsoft
has their own E or T and there's true type

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.970
and there's the issues with the foundries
whether we're allowed to use two type fonts.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.590
Getting a cross browser, for everyone to agree
which formats to use is to me a big problem.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.690
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: And quality.
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:07.730
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Quality.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Speed and quality...

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.280
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Is a vehemently unsolved

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.919
problem.
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.080
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: 'Cause we want more.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Yeah.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.580
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah. Always, yeah.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: It's an infinite problem.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.760
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.419
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: So any, any final words, any final
thought?

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:22.389
&gt;&gt; STORY: Well, I would say, if you can download
Opera, give it a try...

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:23.900
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; STORY: Give us some feedback if your website

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.419
works, it doesn't work, give us some feedback.
You can e-mail me dstoryopera.com if you have

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:31.820
any issues.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: What is--so just a close, what

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.680
is some really, really unique feature of Opera
that would really compel users to want to

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.120
check it out?
&gt;&gt; STORY: One of the features that users will

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.880
really love is speed dial. It's a grid on
the front page. When you make a new tab, where

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.820
you put your nine favorite sites and you can
use a short cut like for the first position,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.770
if you type one in the URL field, it will
go to your number site.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.900
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: So this is kind of unique,
unique. Now it's in Chrome and Safari is copying

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.400
it.
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.479
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Opera has always been a leader
in UI innovations.

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:57.330
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.650
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: You came up with the tab as far
as I understand, the browser tab.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.740
&gt;&gt; STORY: On sessions.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Things like that. So right, Opera

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.130
produces UI innovations.
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.460
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; STORY: So we'll probably have [INDISTINCT]

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.250
in the next version of Opera which might be
in two version of Firefox latest. So if you

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.860
want to try the new features...
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Yeah.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.160
&gt;&gt; STORY: Try Opera.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: We will have something

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.960
in the next version of Opera and we're not
allowed to tell you yet.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.250
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Okay, but it's going to be really
cool.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.820
&gt;&gt; STORY: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: It's going to be really cool.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.820
Well, thank you so much.
&gt;&gt; STORY: Thank you.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.030
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; MCCATHIENEVILE: Thank you.
