00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.634
 (bar patrons chatting)

00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:02.835
Hey, do you have wifi here?

00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:05.204
Drrr, obviously we
have fricking wifi here.

00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:08.708
What is this, Bob Dole's
 personal office? (grunts)

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:11.477
Go fricking serve some
drinks, I got this IRL,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.516
 and IRL being you. (grunts)

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:19.552
  My name is Mark, I'm
  pretty the bar's web guru

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.956
 slash IT guy and I just
 swapped in for a new modem.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.126
 I have a very specific
 set of skills.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.263
(grunts)

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:33.833
 Liam Neeson, like, from, like,
 he was also Qui-Gon Jinn.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.035
Anyway, this fricking dong long,

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:37.537
he thought that
we could be using

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.874
an 802.11a, as though he's
never heard of a .11n.

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:44.544
(grunts)

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.146
Hey, hey, please
don't drink the swill.

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.883
Well, listen, I just
 need the code to the wifi.

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:53.486
Quit rushing me.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.488
Honestly, what is
this, Temple Run?

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.225
So, basically, I
took it upon myself

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:03.029
to upgrade the wifi
name to MV2291234589,

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:05.598
and it's easy to remember

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:06.966
'cause it's my initials
followed by my social.

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:09.969
But that's the
beginning of it all, OK?

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.305
Because only a fricking nube

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.876
would leave a wifi
public like this, OK?

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.744
What am I, fricking
Bernie Sanders

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:20.746
giving out free college
to everybody? (grunts)

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.049
Look, I'm waiting on an
 important email from my boss.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:26.219
Then you're gonna want
to know the password

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.021
and so obviously I wanted
a very comprehensive

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:31.924
and sophisticated password,
but this muscle meat boy,

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:33.759
he thinks that we
should have a very

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:37.563
easy to know password,
so I made the password

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:39.132
If Voldemort was
so frickin' smart

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.700
how come he didn't
have a Time Turner,

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.201
also what the frick Mark Veejen

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:43.870
is the smartest
wizard of all time.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.638
All lower case, with
the vowels replaced

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.406
by the peach emoji.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.412
OK, I'm signed on, but
the wifi seems super weak.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.747
Uh, yeah, I'm mining
crypto in the back

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.982
so that checks out.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.685
Barkeep, another flagon of ale.
