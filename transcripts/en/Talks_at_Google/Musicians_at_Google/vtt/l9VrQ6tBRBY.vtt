MALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
Gentlemen, It is my pleasure

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.662
to bring a phenomenal talent,
an amazing talent, and a

00:00:05.662 --> 00:00:07.654
beautiful talent, Margot B.

00:00:07.654 --> 00:04:22.936
[MUSIC -- Margot B, "Cool"]

00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:26.345
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:26.539
[MUSIC --

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.789
MARGOT B, "Complete"]

00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:06.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:06.950
MARGOT B: Thank you guys.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.398
Enjoy the rest of the show.

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:10.865
RYAN: Hello Margot.

00:09:10.865 --> 00:09:11.830
MARGOT B: Hi Ryan.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.400
RYAN: Thanks for being
here tonight.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.580
I'm really excited
to have you.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.450
MARGOT B: Thanks
for having me.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.930
This is fun to be at Google.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.180
RYAN: Yeah, totally.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.060
So just wanted to talk to you
a little bit about your

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.440
background and a little
bit about your music.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.140
And then we'll get started.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.430
So could you tell people about
you that might not know who

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.210
you are, about your music,
your background.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:30.860
MARGOT B: Sure.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.160
I grew up in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.730
I come from a very eclectic
family, my mother who is

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.940
Russian, German and my father,
originally from Jamaica, and

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.040
moved to the United States
when he was 16.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.570
So he has an interesting
story.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.450
And then they met in college
and produced

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.450
me, which is great.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.980
I'm thankful.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.560
And I've lived in New York
for five years, working

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.540
independently as a singer,
songwriter and working as a

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.970
songwriter for other
artists and

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.920
touring with other artists.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.765
I just finished Rent
off Broadway.

00:10:01.765 --> 00:10:03.890
It just closed in September.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.750
And doing other shows
in the meantime but

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:07.740
getting back to my music.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.760
So it's exciting.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.130
RYAN: Cool.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.860
If you could quickly summarize
your experience with Rent, how

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.790
would you say that?

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.140
Or what would you say?

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.340
MARGOT B: Life changing.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.830
It was something that I
will always remember.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:23.870
And I never expected it to be
so hard to say goodbye.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.380
But that family is such
a huge family.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.500
Rent was such an unbelievable
show that totally changed the

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.860
face of musical theater for
Rock and everything and

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.110
changing the way that it's sung
and the way that it just

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.450
looks to everyone.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.870
And as a kid, I grew
up with that show.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.640
So it's kind of weird to be
doing book reports when you

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.570
were younger and then be in the
show and sitting with the

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:52.080
director and the writer's father
and being invited over

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.060
to the family dinners.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.260
And it was life changing.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:55.590
RYAN: Cool.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.985
Yeah, I was lucky enough
to get to see you.

00:10:57.985 --> 00:11:00.460
MARGOT B: Yeah, we had a lot
of fun jumping around and

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.710
swinging from the rafters.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.010
RYAN: Yeah, you did very well.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:04.140
MARGOT B: Thanks.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.610
RYAN: Very good.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.940
So let me ask you a little bit
about Black History Month and

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.980
what it means to you.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.220
MARGOT B: Sure.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.080
RYAN: We're here to celebrate
that tonight.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.790
So just a little bit, maybe,
more about your heritage and

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.970
how you've celebrated
over the years.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.905
I heard you wrote a tribute to
Martin Luther King when you

00:11:18.905 --> 00:11:21.825
were 13 that still is
kind of relevant.

00:11:21.825 --> 00:11:22.080
MARGOT B: I did.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.060
RYAN: So I think it's really
cool that you're here tonight.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.300
MARGOT B: It was really funny,
just to kind of touch on that

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.030
story a little bit.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.060
My mother and I were driving
to Philadelphia

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.220
for a beauty pageant.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.220
Because I really wanted to be a
part of everything that they

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:40.920
were a part of.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.930
Because they were doing a lot
of fund raising and a lot of

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.720
volunteer work.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.670
And I thought that's awesome.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.620
I get to do that all the time?

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.920
That sounds like a great idea.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.260
I want to win this thing.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.610
So I went to Philly
with my mom.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.610
And when we were in the
car, I just got bored.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.450
And I used to write poems and
songs every once in awhile.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.860
But she suggested that
we just write a song.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.200
And she asked me, what's
really important.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.880
And it happened to be
Black History Month.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.090
And I was like, why don't we
write it about Doctor Martin

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.900
Luther King Junior.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.290
And she was like, that sounds
like a great idea.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.830
So we sat down.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.360
Well, obviously she
was driving.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.440
But I sat down and just tried
to brainstorm a little bit.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.360
And she helped me kind of
think and figure out my

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.960
thoughts and process it and kind
of put it into song form.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.950
And now it's played in every
state in the US on his

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.540
birthday, which is
really exciting.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.040
And we did a whole video.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.740
And I incorporated
my high school.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.920
And we got out for the day,
which was really cool as a kid

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.730
to kind of play hooky for a
day in school and shoot my

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:43.670
music video.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.090
And then that played along
with the song.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.990
And that kind of gave me, like,
a little bit of a claim.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.470
But it was all for the
right reasons.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.140
And it was just because
it meant a lot to me.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.720
And coming from such eclectic
background with my ethnicity,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.330
and my family, and religion,
and everything, it was just

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.170
really important to me to put
out that message and know that

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.650
it's still really relevant
though it doesn't seem like

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.690
things are so restricted now.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.180
We've come very far.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:19.140
But I think that we still have
many, many moons to go before

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.100
the face of color is
kind of extinct.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:26.040
But it was really exciting for
me to kind of add to a little

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.860
piece of the puzzle as
best as I could.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.480
RYAN: Yeah, I think
that's incredible.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.190
It's really commendable.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.470
I know when I was playing hooky,
I was shooting monsters

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.150
on video games.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.370
MARGOT B: I might have done
that on the side, maybe.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.980
RYAN: So I think it's really
good to have you because your

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.990
background is so different.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:49.430
And you appreciate Black
History Month.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.070
And also you give back.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.300
And I wanted to talk a little
bit about you've

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.280
volunteered a lot.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.910
And you did a lot for Katrina
in Pittsburgh.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.740
And I just wanted to see what
you've done and what

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.440
you're doing now.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.270
MARGOT B: Yeah, volunteering has
just always been something

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.750
that my heart has drawn to.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.580
We did a Katrina benefit concert
in one of the biggest

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.380
arenas in Pittsburgh, which
granted me a key to the city

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.980
from the mayor of Pittsburgh,
which was really cool.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.620
And I was 15.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.810
So that was really nice.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.020
The Red Cross collaborated
with us.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.270
And my mom and dad and brother
helped me put it together.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.120
And it was really exciting.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.370
We had huge names put it all
together in Pittsburgh.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.220
And we had thousands
of people there.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:32.655
It was huge.

00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:35.470
And we raised a lot of money
for the benefit.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:40.020
Since I was in Rent, I had the
opportunity to collaborate

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.720
with Friends In Deed, which was
what Rent was based off of

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.940
and written because of
the support groups

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.190
dealing with AIDS.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:51.550
And I dealt a lot with their
main headquarters out of Soho.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.140
And it was really--

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.490
it was actually around the same
time that my grandmother

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.050
passed, so it was really near
and dear to my heart.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.910
And now they've opened up their
doors to not only AIDS

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.920
survivors or people that have
lost friends or family and, or

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:11.630
family with the AIDS virus but
to also cancer survivors and

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.110
people that were lost.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.950
So I had the opportunity
to do that.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.230
And I do the AIDS
Walk every year.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.200
And I just started with City
Harvest, which is a great

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.980
organization out of Brooklyn.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.140
It's a bit of a truck.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.450
But it's really worth it.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.860
We recently were there because
of the theater and Broadway

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.390
community as well I was invited,
which was amazing.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.820
I've had a lot of great
experiences.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:42.820
We packed patches of potatoes,
and oranges, and pears.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.550
And then they go out to
families in need.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.400
And we packed over a ton.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.530
So each sack full of pear or
whatever it is feeds a family.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.490
So that was really nice to know
that we fed over a couple

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.010
hundred families within
a couple hours.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.050
And it was fun and exciting.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.560
And I just had the opportunity
to be invited to a Women Who

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.220
Care event hosted
by Loreen Arbus.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.540
And it is based off of the UCP
Foundation, which is the

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.170
United Cerebral Palsy
Foundation.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.520
So I'm excited to get
on board with them.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.150
But all of these organizations
are really important to me.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.670
So I'm just trying
to find new ones.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.410
RYAN: Yeah, you're staying
connected and getting involved

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.980
with the community.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.490
MARGOT B: Yeah, you got
to get involved or

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.770
else nothing changes.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:28.075
RYAN: Cool.

00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:30.150
So let's switch gears a little
bit, talk about music.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.230
What's next for you?

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.300
And then we'll get going.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.490
MARGOT B: Well, I'm pumped to
get back on the music train.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.710
I've been writing a lot and
collaborating with a lot of

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.060
different producers, and
writers, and musicians, and

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.680
just trying to open my mind to
as many possibilities as I

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.710
possibly can.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.590
I've come across a lot of
talented people within my

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.250
short term of a career.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.230
And I just keep opening
more and more doors.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.610
And I don't know how
it's happening.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.820
But I'm really blessed.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.550
So I'm back in the studio
writing and hopefully busting

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.420
out so new stuff.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.410
And you can definitely check
me around the city.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.380
Because I am booking shows
everywhere around

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.470
the city right now.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.900
And I just can't wait to get
back on stage just with my

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.680
group and do my thing.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.900
And I hope people like it.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.310
RYAN: Cool.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.450
Well I'm sure they will.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.130
Margot, if anyone could do
anything, it's Margo.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.800
She puts her mind to something
and it happens.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.160
MARGOT B: Thank you.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.329
That's really nice.

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:27.069
RYAN: So thanks for
being here.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:29.290
We're really looking forward
to having you here.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:29.770
MARGOT B: Thanks.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:30.460
RYAN: And good luck
with everything.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.710
MARGOT B: Thank you.
