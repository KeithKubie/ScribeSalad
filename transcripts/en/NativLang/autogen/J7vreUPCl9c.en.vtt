00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.100
 This is not even a whole word, but can you guess which language this is? 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.580
 Of course you can! 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.350
 All thanks to that very Spanish letter 침. 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.590
 Wait a second. 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.520
 Once this one with a lift on it was not as Spanish. 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.100
 Divide them in two; you will find the story of an ordinary sign that grew into 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.000
 an extraordinaire letter. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.430
 Spain has a national hero. 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.800
 A very old one. 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.780
 About 1000 years old. 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.340
 They call him El Cid. 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.690
 Or "El Thid"? 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.489
 See, Spain is notorious for its play, but here in the western hemisphere 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.100
 and even in Andaluc칤a it is "El Sid". 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.379
 El Cid did good things, as national heroes are supposed to do. 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.089
 He used a legendary weapon. 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.890
 He fought cunningly for various factions, but always kept larger goals in mind. 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.500
 He won the heart of the mob. 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.269
 Oh, and he loved Babieca, his trusted steed. 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.269
 A legend tells us how they met. 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.059
 When he was young, su padrino, his godfather, took him to choose his own horse. 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.860
 He was treated to a parade of beautiful stallions. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.850
 "Go, choose one. 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.570
 The very best you see! " 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.230
 Either way, El Cid peered through all the beautiful moons and caught the eye of the outermost 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.640
 horse of them all. 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.700
 "This one. 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 I want this one." 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.400
 His godfather couldn't believe it. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 "Babieca! 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.000
 Fool! 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.560
 Why have they just chosen? " 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.560
 "Oh, Babieca. 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.710
 Yes, his name will be Babieca. 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.340
 He will become a good horse. " 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.700
 Ah, Spain. 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.480
 You have spent centuries weaving stories such as these about your beloved Cid. 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.610
 The most epic of these epic stories is a poem written in the 12th century: Cantar de Mio 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.830
 Cid, Song of My Cid 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.929
 Of course there is this older Latin history written closer to the events, but the people, they 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.600
 love the epic poem. 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.939
 That poem was in one, rare manuscript. 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.630
 And if you want to read it, you need to know Old Spanish. 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.630
 Not just Spanish? 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.710
 No, Old Spanish. 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.819
 Different words with different meanings, different spelling and pronunciation, different grammar. 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.369
 But before you can also start, you will be blocked by the writings of this writer. 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.190
 The problem is not his writing. 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.840
 He was a great writer, neat and tidy. 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.100
 The problem is that this script is not your script. 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.610
 Yes, it's the Latin alphabet, but even once you've adjusted to the letters, there's something 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.120
 weird. 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.460
 Put your nose close enough to sniff the paper. 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.940
 Actually, the pergamino, parchment. 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.720
 Close enough to see those little curls. 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.220
 An interesting fact about the parchment of time. 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.390
 Writers did not go to the store and got packages for a cent for a page. 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.670
 This book-making thing was a very expensive undertaking. 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.320
 Among other things, old writers came up with different ways to save paper 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.870
 and keep their manuscripts beautiful. 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.110
 A trick was to make the words shorter. 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.480
 With hundreds of years of practicing writing, medieval writers had it 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.500
 a library of symbols. 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.500
 They can be beautiful, but here is a simple one that you often encounter the titulus. 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.200
 What is it for? 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.100
 Look at the letters below. 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.260
 Sometimes they are short words. 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.510
 Scribes abbreviated everything from holy names to everyday pronouns. 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.900
 When they did this, they left a hint so that they knew that an abbreviation was used. 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.970
 It does have a more specific use. 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.320
 Look at the words mand칩 "commanded", and also don "gentleman" and donna "wife" of the Latin 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.040
 dominus and domina. 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.740
 The writer could write them in full or he could remove a consonant and a titulus 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.880
 write on top of the previous letter. 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.830
 And guess which letter was missing? 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.460
 The nasal "n". 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.420
 Writing n 'on top of the previous letter instead of on the line is not something we do 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.490
 CID can accuse. 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.280
 It was an age-long trend, both for Latin nasals, ns and ms. 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.990
 Good luck going through medieval manuscripts without the titulus. 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.550
 N 'above vowels, n' above consonants, everywhere! 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.050
 But these ns were still optional. 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.470
 Take the word for "year", annus, who had two n'en next to each other. 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.720
 That word became the Spanish anno. 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.330
 As a writing scholar you could remove the second n and put a titulus on the other. 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.630
 But you could also remove the first n and put a titulus on the a 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.410
 Or just keep them next to each other. 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.470
 After a while, those other clues were omitted and 침, the former double n 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.970
 all alone in Spain. 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.070
 Apparently the only one. 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.380
 Why did only this one stay? 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.600
 Well, it was common. 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.070
 The other nasal signs were interchangeable with a real n. 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.960
 But Latin double-n got its own statement: "nj", "e침e" 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.650
 This remaining titulus is not as lonely as it appears. 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.870
 Portugal found the same marking system very useful for neighbors. 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.200
 In Modern Portuguese they still use them, not above n, but to mark the nasal o and a. 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.200
 칚 - 칫 -침 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.540
 Oh, and another fact to impress your friends. 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.250
 The name of this, "titulus", became "tilde", which the English borrowed as 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.580
 "lifted". 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.300
 In Spanish, "tilde" does not only mean this thing. 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.870
 It is the name for a special or diacritical sign. 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.080
 Also the accents. 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.080
 But today is not one with a funny piece of fruit on it. 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.490
 Not in Spanish! 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.100
 One more change had to be made: a change of image. 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.310
 The Real Acedemia Espa침ola, Royal Spanish Academy, came together in the early 1700s 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.720
 to organize and oversee Spanish vocabulary. 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.800
 (Time for order in this language!) 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.530
 Their dictionary is the gold standard, but in 1726 the group barely took one 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.660
 first stitch at this dictionary, with their Diccionario the autoridades. 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.240
 You will not find the 침 on a page of one of his 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.610
 6 volumes, but entries starting with 침 are listed separately after n. 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.630
 It is an initiative of the academy that has already been taken completely. 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:53.050
 Today 침 has its own seat in the Spanish alphabet (n칰mero 洧링洧맅!), And it is like that 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.540
 typically Spanish that it has become a symbol of Spanish culture. 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.850
 Here, I have marked my channel for Spain and Latin America! 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.500
 You laugh, but that's how some companies do it. 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.370
 So what were ordinary markings on parchment in El Cid's days, found a way 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.420
 to last longer than the others and became a completely Spanish letter, one that only occasionally 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.100
 seem like a recognizable retrospect of his younger days from relatives from not so distant countries. 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.700
