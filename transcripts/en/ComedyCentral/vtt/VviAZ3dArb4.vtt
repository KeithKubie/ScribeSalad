00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.536
With primaries
across the Northeast today,

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.705
one thing we're seeing more than
ever before this election season

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:08.308
is hordes and hordes of
pumped-up millennial voters!

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:11.011
Which is why New Hampshire--
or "Nampshire" as we call it--

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.480
had to ban ballot selfies
like these.

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:15.816
Uh, officials say
ballot selfies could lead

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.985
to voter fraud and coercion,
but how else

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.419
do you let your ex-boyfriend
Connor know

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:20.821
you're doing just fine
without him,

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.724
and you're living your life
and making America great again?

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.092
-(laughter)
-That's how you do that.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.326
Snapchat thought the same thing,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.928
so they filed an Amicus brief
last week

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.396
defending ballot selfies.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.865
For the record, Snapchat also
never liked Connor,

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.234
-'cause he's a dick.
(Bleep) him. -(laughter)

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:35.569
Snapchat's lawyers said,

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.437
"The ballot selfie
captures the very essence

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.173
"of that political process
as it happens,

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.642
"and thus, dramatizes the power
that one person has

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:42.910
"to influence our government.

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:44.211
Also (bleep) Connor."

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.679
-I added the last part. Um...
-(laughter)

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.715
So, what are you waiting for?
Pull out a dick, snap a pic,

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.450
and then send
the most patriotic selfie

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.886
you ever took
in your entire life!

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.855
And as silly as this may seem,
I know how the power

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.723
of the Internet can be used to
reach people and inspire them.

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:58.058
So, comedians,
what are some other ways

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.562
to inspire millennials
to get out to vote? Sara.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.297
The two choices
by each candidate

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.499
are "Yas, queen,"
and "Bye, Felicia."

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.434
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Yes. Absolutely.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.937
-(applause)
-Anthony.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.006
A free mustache wax
with every vote.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.575
-HARDWICK: Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah. -(laughter)

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:16.944
-You got to keep those
mustaches... -For the kids.

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:19.413
-For the kids. -The kids.
-HARDWICK: Jimmy Carr.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:22.182
-Vice President Kanye.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:23.717
HARDWICK:
Right.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.153
Because then you could have
the Kanye West Wing.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.955
HARDWICK:
Absolutely. Oh, and while

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.990
we're at it, let's make Honey
Boo Boo a Supreme Court justice.

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.425
It doesn't matter
if she's not old enough.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:31.525
Who gives a (bleep) anymore?
Our country's a reality show.
