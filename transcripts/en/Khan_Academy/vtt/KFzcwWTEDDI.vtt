00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.060
In this video,
I'll introduce you

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.730
to a new way of
computing division,

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.552
especially for larger numbers.

00:00:06.552 --> 00:00:08.760
And then we'll think a little
bit about why it works.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.336
So we're going to try to
compute what 96 divided by 4 is.

00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:15.460
And I'm going to write it
a little bit differently.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.746
I'm going to write 96
divided by-- so I'm

00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:22.780
going to write this
strange-looking symbol

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.950
right over here, this
thing that covers the 96.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.319
But you could view this
as 96 divided by 4.

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.610
And I'll show you in a second
why we write it this way.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.772
This is actually a very useful
way of actually computing it.

00:00:35.772 --> 00:00:37.730
So the first thing we'll
do is we'll say, well,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.330
how many times does 4 go into 9?

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.970
Well, we know that 4 times 2 is
equal to 8 and that 4 times 3

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.170
is equal to 12.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.540
So 3 would be too much.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.590
We would go above 9.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.040
So we want to be below 9 but
not have too much left over.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.170
We want the largest
number that gets us

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.060
into 9 without going over 9.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.160
So we'll say it goes two times.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.710
4 goes into 9 two times.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.350
And then we say,
what's 2 times 4?

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.450
Well, 2 times 4 is 8.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.480
4 times 2 is 8.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.180
Or 2 times 4 is 8.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.000
And now, we subtract.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.710
We subtract the 8 from the 9.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.720
And we get 1.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.102
And now we bring down the
next digit, which is the 6.

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:26.060
And then we ask ourselves,
well, how many times

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.910
does 4 go into 16?

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.440
Well, in this case, we know
that 4 goes into 16 exactly

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.330
four times.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.200
4 times 4 is 16.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.000
So we say 4 goes
into 16 four times.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.280
Then we multiply
4 times 4 is 16.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.600
We subtract.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.682
And 16 minus 16, we have
absolutely nothing left over.

00:01:45.682 --> 00:01:46.890
And there we have our answer.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.770
I know it seems kind of
magical at this point.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.144
But in a few
seconds, we're going

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:52.200
to think about why
this actually worked.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.048
We got that 96 divided
by 4 is equal to-- I

00:01:58.048 --> 00:02:06.100
want to do that in a
different color-- 24.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.880
Now, what I want you to do
right now is pause this video

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.180
and think about why
did this actually work.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.140
How did we magically get
the right answer here?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.139
And you can verify this.

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:18.406
Multiply 4 times 24,
and you will get 96.

00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:20.490
Well, I'm assuming
you gave a go at it.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.210
And the important
thing always is

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.660
to keep track of
the place value.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.160
And it really tells
you what's going

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.930
on when we do this process.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.870
When we looked at this
9 right over here,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.080
this 9 is in the tens place.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.525
This is actually
representing 90.

00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:34.499
It represents 9 tens.

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:36.040
So we're saying,
well, how many times

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:44.420
does 4 go into 90 if we're
thinking about multiples of 10?

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.560
Well, it goes 20 times.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.390
4 times 20 is 80.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.710
And so we said, well,
4 times 20 is 80.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.950
But we still have 16 left over.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.910
You do 96 minus 80.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.890
You have 16 left over
to divide 4 into.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.274
And then 4 goes
into 16 four times.

00:03:02.274 --> 00:03:04.190
So really, a lot of this
is just saying, well,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.234
we first figured out that
we could go 20 times.

00:03:06.234 --> 00:03:08.025
And then we said, well,
that doesn't get us

00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:08.880
all the way to 96.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.690
We have to go
another four times.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.362
Hopefully, that helps.
