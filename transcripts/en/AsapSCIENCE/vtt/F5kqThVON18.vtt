00:00:00.431 --> 00:00:05.331
Psychedelic or ‘magic’ mushrooms have
been ingested by humans for over 9000 years.

00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:09.791
Even today, this naturally grown fungus is
commonly used as a recreational drug, causing

00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:13.261
hallucinations, but how exactly does it work?

00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:17.601
The main psychoactive ingredient in shrooms
is call psilocybin. When ingested, the body

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:22.101
breaks it down into the active drug psilocin,
which makes its way to the brain. And here,

00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:27.241
it begins to prevent the reuptake of the neurotransmitter
serotonin, increasing its activity. On top

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:31.860
of this, psilocin actually has a similar chemical
structure to serotonin, meaning it can also

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.681
bind to and stimulate receptors in the brain.
This amplified stimulation causes you to perceive

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:41.671
and experience things without any real stimulus
- also know as hallucination. These can be

00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:46.951
of a varying nature, from visual to auditory
sensations, or mystical and insightful feelings.

00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:51.951
And while the experience can be quite enjoyable,
some users have reported very unpleasant episodes.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:56.611
These feelings generally last between 3-8
hours, but could feel much longer as the drug

00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:58.561
alters your sense of time.

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:02.451
Scientists have also suggested that the brain
may temporarily rearrange itself by inhibiting

00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:07.031
normal brain activity and immediately creating
new biologically stable brain connections.

00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:12.251
This, ultimately, makes it harder to determine
reality from fantasy, and amplifies your intensity

00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:16.231
of thought which makes planning ahead and
self conscious thinking almost impossible.

00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:21.551
We also see activation in the hippocampus
and anterior cingulate cortex which are associated

00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:25.891
with dreaming. *Finally, specific emotional
regions of the brain are chemically activated,

00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:30.581
which can lead to a sense of expanding consciousness.
And because the drug temporarily alters the

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:34.281
paths in your brain, ‘thinking outside of
the box’ becomes extremely natural.

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:39.690
In a famous US study, 36 college educated
participants were given psilocybin and observed

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.260
in a laboratory. 1/3rd of the participants
reported the experience as the single most

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.161
spiritually significant moment in their lives,
with ⅔rds putting it in their top five.

00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:53.481
Two months after taking the drug, 79% of the
participants reported increased well-being

00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:57.961
and satisfaction. Friends and family were
also interviewed and agreed with these claims.

00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:02.961
But it’s not all so positive - 22% of the
clinically tested individuals experienced

00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:07.121
fear and paranoia at certain points during
their trip. And because of the state of their

00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:11.660
brains, these typically manifested as terrifying
and uncontrollable hallucinations. *L

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.220
Though much is still unknown about shrooms,
they’re not considered clinically addictive

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.201
and cause little toxicity to other organ systems.
In fact, a UK study found that they cause

00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:25.030
the least amount of damage - both to the individual
and others - when compared to other recreational

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.321
drugs. Ultimately, scientists believe the
laws need to change around clinical testing

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:33.821
of the drug so advanced research can be executed
to fully understand both the positive and

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:37.020
negative effects that this “magic” fungus
has on our brains.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.580
