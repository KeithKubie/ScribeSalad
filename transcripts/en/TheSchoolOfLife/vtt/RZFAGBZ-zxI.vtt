00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.750
In the background, many of us are terrified
of so much – disgrace, illness, sacking,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.321
our mortality, the suffering and death of
loved ones… When these fears come up, we

00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:20.099
are often encouraged, out of kindness, to
think of the best-case scenarios. It’s a

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:26.480
well-meaning move, but it also – unintentionally
– leaves our fears to fester; they fill

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.070
us with unnamed dread and sometimes loom far
larger than they should. So an opposite move

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.040
– displayed here – involves looking our
anxieties directly in the eye, refusing to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.520
be cowed by them and examining them in exhaustive
detail so as to drain them of their debilitating

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.670
power. Doing so is liable to bring us to an
important realisation: we could cope – even

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.980
if the worst came to the worst… What follows
are some invitations to meditate on scary

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.860
things, not in order to depress us, but to
lend us a buoyant, optimistic sense of our

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.649
resilience and adaptability. If the worst
came to the worst…

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:18.430
…I would learn I had far fewer friends – but
the ones that remained would be the true ones;

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:26.700
the ones who could see past my (ruined) social
status to the genuine me beneath. If the worst

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.090
came to the worst… it would no longer be an option to follow

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.979
the safe, respectable, prestigious path. With
far less left to lose, I would at last be

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.049
granted the opportunity to explore the riskier,
yet more fulfilling occupations I had always

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:56.409
somewhere hankered for but been too socially-anxious
to try. If the worst came to the worst…

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.069
…I would learn to measure my self-worth

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.759
by my own standards rather than the whims
and applause of the crowd. I would grow a

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.060
sense of self independent of the verdicts
of others. If the worst came to the worst…

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.110
…I would look with new admiration and humility

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:21.500
at the unhurried calm, natural stoicism and
resilience of animals. If the worst came to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.780
the worst…I would learn to contemplate my sorrows

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.670
from the vantage point of a distant nebula
and would recognise my life as the petty and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.230
insignificant thing it truly is and always
was. If the worst came to the worst…

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.360
…I would develop appropriate gratitude
for every apparently minor thing – and every

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.690
day that unfolded without further catastrophe
would be recognised as the blessing it truly

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.230
is. If the worst came to the worst …I would understand that life was

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.620
not something that could ever be moulded into
a wholly flawless and error-free entity – but

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.440
is an always imperfect, necessarily wonky
cobbled-together construction, full of marks

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:17.670
and blemishes – which nevertheless possess
their own beauty and dignity. If the worst

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.360
came to the worst
…I would learn to distinguish between what

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.270
is really serious and worth lamenting and
what is only ever a passing nuisance. I would,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.600
in so many situations, be infinitely calmer.
If the worst came to the worst

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.080
…my failure would embolden others to share
stories of their own sadness, confusion and

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.840
humilliation and we would, together, face up to the suffering we so often, currently, unfairly, endure alone.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.720
If the worst came to the worst… I would see that the struggle for fame,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.280
money and success was only ever a doomed attempt
to compensate for an unconditional love that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:18.800
was longed for but denied in childhood. Worldly
craving would give way to melancholy and mourning.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.840
to the worst … I’d cease
to be so scared of looking within – and

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.200
might, perhaps, one day give psychotherapy
a go.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.169
If the worst came to the worst
…I would play the saddest songs that have

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.880
been waiting, in the wings, for me all this
time.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.840
If the worst came to the worst

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:54.480
…truly the worst, then all the rage, grief,
anxiety and fear would be at an end – and

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:04.800
we would, at last, as the prayers so beautifully
put it, be at peace. Our cheerful despair

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.520
badge serves as an elegant reminder of the
art of cheerful despair during hard times.
