00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.560
We have a situation here
where we have a

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.550
four meter cubed container.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.275
Let's say that's a balloon
of some sort.

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:10.072
And instead of having just one
type of molecule of gas in

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:13.130
this container, we have three
molecules of gas.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.660
We have some oxygen molecules,
some hydrogen molecules, and

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.480
some nitrogen molecules.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.260
And what the problem tells
us is, we have 2.1 total

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.040
kilograms of gas.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.690
An of that, by math, 30.48% is
oxygen, 2.86% is hydrogen

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.870
molecules, and 66.67%
is nitrogen.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.670
So what we need to figure,
and it's all at standard

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.450
temperature at least. It's zero
degrees Celsius, which we

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.870
know is 273 Kelvin.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.000
But we need to figure out what
is the total pressure in the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.290
container, or being exerted on
the surface of the container?

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.520
And then, this is a new concept,
we want to figure out

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.830
the partial pressures of
each of these gases.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.080
Essentially, how much are each
of these gases contributing to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.820
the total pressure?

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.280
And you can imagine, if this
is a container and each of

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.970
these are the three types of
gases, some of the pressure is

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.320
going to be from the blue, maybe
oxygen is the blue gas,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.440
from the blue gas bumping
into the walls.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.490
Some of the pressure is going
to be from the hydrogen

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.630
bumping into the walls, maybe
that's this yellow gas, and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.370
some of the pressure is going
to be from the nitrogen

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.880
bumping into the walls.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.130
Let's say that's
the brown gas.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.820
So the partial pressure due to
nitrogen, that's the pressure

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.970
just due to the brown particles
bumping into walls.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.250
Let's see if we can
figure this out.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.687
So the first thing to figuring
the total pressure is, we have

00:01:31.687 --> 00:01:35.920
to figure out the total moles of
molecules we have. And the

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.080
easiest way I can figure out to
figure out the total number

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.510
of moles is to figure
out the moles of

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.150
each of these molecules.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:49.590
So if we have 2.1 kilograms of
gas-- let me write this down--

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.510
If we want to know moles
of nitrogen.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.020
Let me do it in the
nitrogen color.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.270
We know that 66.67% of this, we
could say 2.1 kilograms or

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.730
2100 grams, we know that
that's nitrogen.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.229
So let's do it in grams. Because
when we talk about

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.030
molecular mass it's always in
grams. It doesn't have to be.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.570
But it makes it a lot simpler to
convert between atomic mass

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.630
units and mass in our world.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:28.240
So this is 2/3 of 2100, that's
1400 grams of N2.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.780
Now what's the molar mass of
this nitrogen molecule?

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.460
Well we know that the atomic
mass of nitrogen is 14.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.900
So this molecule has
two nitrogens.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.130
So its atomic mass is 28.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.760
So one of these molecules
will have a mass of

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.610
28 atomic mass units.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.970
Or one mole of N2 would have
a mass of 28 grams.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.470
So one mole is 28 grams. We have
1400 grams-- or we say

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.230
grams per mole, if we want
to keep our units right.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.750
So if we say 1400 total grams
so divided by 28 grams per

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.160
mole we should get the
number of moles.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.592
So 1400 divided by 28
is equal to 50.

00:03:19.592 --> 00:03:21.770
That worked out nicely.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.730
So we have 50 moles of N2.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.980
We could write that
right there.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.750
All right.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.790
Let's do oxygen next.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.150
So we do the same process
over again.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.290
30% is oxygen.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.060
So let's do oxygen
down here, O2.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.700
So we take 30%.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.680
Remember, these percentages
I gave you, these are the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.950
percentages of the total
mass, not the

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.990
percentage of the moles.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.140
So we have to figure out
what the moles are.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:12.970
So 30.48% of 2100 grams
is equal to about 640.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.680
Let's round off.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.390
So this is equal to 640 grams.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.980
And then what is the
mass of one mole of

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.600
the oxygen gas molecule?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.830
The atomic mass of one
oxygen atom is 16.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.590
You can look it up on the
periodic table, although you

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.240
should probably be pretty
familiar with it by now.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.990
So the atomic mass of
this molecule is

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.580
32 atomic mass units.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.830
So one mole of O2 is going to
be 32 grams. We have 640

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.020
grams. So how many
moles do we have?

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.040
640 divided by 32
is equal to 20.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.200
We have 20 moles of oxygen.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.020
Let me write that down.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.840
We have 20 moles.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.020
Now we just have to figure
out the hydrogen.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.690
2.86% of all that is hydrogen.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.520
So let's see, if we do 2100
grams, remember I want to do

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.270
everything in grams, so
I just want to do a

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.810
unit conversion there.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:26.300
2100 grams times 2.86% is
equal to about 60 grams.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:34.710
So hydrogen, this 2% of that
2100 grams is 60 grams. And

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.540
then what's the molar mass
of one hydrogen.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.470
That's H2.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.210
So we know that the hydrogen
atom by itself has a mass of

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.170
1, doesn't have a neutron
in most cases.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.750
So the atomic mass
of this is 2.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.170
Or the molar mass of
this is 2 grams.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:06:00.360
So one mole of H2 is equal to
two grams. We have 60 grams.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.570
So we clearly have 60 divided
by 2, we have 30 moles.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.890
So this is interesting, even
though hydrogen was a super

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.450
small fraction of the total mass
of the gas that we have

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.290
inside of the container, we
actually have more actual

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.460
particles, more actual molecules
of hydrogen than we

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.460
do of oxygen.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.720
That's because each molecule of
hydrogen only has an atomic

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.070
mass of 2 atomic mass units,
while each molecule of oxygen

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.200
has 32 because there's two
oxygen atoms. So already we're

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.310
seeing we actually have more
particles due to hydrogen than

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.440
due to oxygen.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.760
And the particles are what
matter, not the mass, when we

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.740
talk about part pressure
and partial pressure.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.510
So the first thing we can think
about is how many total

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.610
moles of gas, how many
total particles do we

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.130
have bouncing around?

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.630
20 moles of oxygen, 30 moles
of hydrogen, 50 moles of

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.490
nitrogen gas.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.570
Add them up.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.710
We have 100 moles of gas.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.940
So if we want to figure out the
total pressure first, we

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.990
can just apply this 100 moles.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.690
Let me erase this.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.930
I want to keep the
problem statement

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.170
there the whole time.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.480
There you go.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.940
And I can erase some stuff
that you're not

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.470
seeing off the screen.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.180
And now I'm ready.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.410
So we have 100 moles.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.920
So we just do our PV
is equal to nRT.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.760
We're trying to solve for P.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.180
P times 4 meters cubed
is equal to n. n is

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.140
the number of moles.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.000
We have 100 moles.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.810
Is equal to 100 moles times R.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.250
I'll put a blank there for R,
because we have to figure out

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.010
which R we want to use.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.940
Times temperature, remember we
have to do it in Kelvin.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.960
So 0 degrees Celsius
is 273 Kelvin.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.840
And then which R do we use?

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.710
I always like to write
my R's down here.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.210
So we're dealing with meters
cubed, we're not dealing with

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.290
liters, so let's use this one.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.190
8.3145 meters cubed pascals
per mole Kelvin.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.010
The units there, I think I
should keep, these are in

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:25.990
meters cubed pascals divided
by moles Kelvin.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.780
And then our temperature
was 273 Kelvin.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.179
Now let's do a little
dimensional analysis to make

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.530
sure that we're doing
things right.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.740
These meters cancel out
with those meters.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.280
We divide both sides of the
equation by meters.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.280
These moles cancel
with these moles.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.549
The moles of the numerator, the
moles of the denominator.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.330
Kelvin in the numerator, Kelvin
in the denominator.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.140
And all we're left
with is pascals.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.165
Which is good because that
is a unit of pressure.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.320
So if we divide both sides
of this equation by 4.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.470
I'll just divide the 100 by 4.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:06.310
25 times 8.3145 times 273.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.950
And the only unit that we were
left with was pascals.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.570
Which is nice, because that's
a unit of pressure.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:21.670
So, let's do the math, 25 times
8.3145 times 273 is

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:31.640
equal to 56,746 pascals.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.500
And that might seem like
a crazy number.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.240
But the pascal is actually a
very small amount of pressure.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:48.220
It actually turns out that
101,325 pascals is equal to

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.340
one atmosphere.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.380
So if we want to figure out how
many atmospheres this is,

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.630
we could just divide that.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.370
Let me look it up
on this table.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.390
Yes, 101,325.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.690
So if we wanted to, we could
write this in kilopascals.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.160
That's 56.746 kilopascals.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.940
Or if we wanted it in
atmospheres we just take

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:20.670
56,746 divided by 101,325.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:26.210
It equals 0.56 atmospheres.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.570
So that's the total pressure
being exerted

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.160
from all of the gases.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.720
I deleted that picture.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.280
So this is the total pressure.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.270
So our question is, what's
the partial pressure?

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.960
We could use either of these
numbers, they're just in

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.000
different units.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.170
What's the partial pressure of
just the oxygen by itself?

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.490
Well, you look at the moles,
because we don't care about

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.450
the actual mass.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.140
Because we're assuming that
they're ideal gases.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.980
We want to look at the
number of particles.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.050
Because remember, we said
pressure times volume is

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.300
proportional to the number of
particles times temperature.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.660
And they're all at the
same temperature.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.760
So the number of particles
is what matters.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.610
So oxygen represents 20%
of the particles.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.280
20/100.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.710
So, the partial pressure of
oxygen, let me write that as

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.370
pressure due to oxygen,
due to O2.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.020
It's going to be 20% of
the total pressure.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:23.070
20% times, let me write
56.746 kilopascals.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.360
I just took this pressure
measurement.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.930
If I wanted atmospheres,
times 0.56 atmospheres.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.720
So the partial pressure of
oxygen-- well, I already have

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.840
the 0.56 written there.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:45.880
So times 0.2 is equal to
0.112 atmospheres.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.240
It's just 20% of this.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.780
How did I get 20%?

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.420
We have a total of 100 mole
molecules in our balloon.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.320
20 moles of them are oxygen.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.710
So 20% are oxygen.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.800
So 20% of the pressure is going
to be due to oxygen.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.640
So it's this many atmospheres.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.360
If I took 20% times
the 56,000.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:16.620
0.2 times 56, you get roughly
11.2 kilopascals.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.670
I'm just multiplying 20% by
any of these numbers.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.920
And the numbers are going to
change depending on the units.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.930
So you do the same process.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.650
What is the partial pressure
due to nitrogen?

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:32.430
Well even though 2/3 of the mass
is nitrogen, only 50% of

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.360
the actual particles
are nitrogen.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.470
So 50% of the pressures is due
to the nitrogen particles.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.880
Remember, you have to convert
everything to moles.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.530
Because we only care about
the number of particles.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.050
So if you want to know the
partial pressure due to the

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:50.390
nitrogen molecules,
it's 50% of these.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:13:03.400
So it's 28,373 pascals.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.010
That's roughly.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.920
Or if you took half of this,
approximately 28.4

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.520
kilopascals.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:16.590
Or approximately 0.28
atmospheres.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.530
And then finally, if you want
to figure out the partial

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:24.600
pressure due to the hydrogen
atoms. The partial pressure

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.560
due to the hydrogen atoms.
Hydrogen, even though it's a

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.130
very small part of the mass,
it actually represents 30%

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.300
percent of the molecules.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.280
And it's the molecules that
are bumping into things.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.280
We don't care so much
about the mass.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.210
So 30% of the molecules.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.830
And remember, when we talk
about kinetic energy, if

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.900
something with a small mass has
the same kinetic energy,

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.200
it's actually moving faster.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.840
So when we talk about
temperature, that's average

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.800
kinetic energy.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.070
So maybe in this we could
imagine that the hydrogen

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.750
might be moving faster than the
nitrogen or the oxygen.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.020
But we don't have to think about
that too much right now.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.160
But the partial pressure due to
hydrogen is just 30% of any

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:01.810
of these numbers.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:02.320
Pick one.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.570
Let's do it in atmospheres.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:13.520
0.3 times 0.56 is equal
to 0.168 atmospheres.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.170
And so the total pressure
should be equal to the

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.690
pressure of each of the
partial pressures

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:22.730
of each of the gases.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:28.100
Plus the partial pressure of
oxygen, plus the partial

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.640
pressure of hydrogen.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:35.140
And so this one, we figured
out was 0.28 atmospheres.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.730
The oxygen was 0.112
atmospheres.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.250
And this was 0.168.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.610
And if you add these together,
you will see indeed, that they

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.900
add to 0.56 atmospheres.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.770
Which was the total pressure
of our system.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.340
Anyway, this is a very long
and hairy problem.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.130
But the key takeaway is that
every molecule in the system

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.030
contributes to the total
pressure in proportion to the

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.760
number of moles it has as a
percentage of the total number

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.280
of moles in the system.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.800
I hope that didn't confuse
you too much.
