00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:22.220 align:start position:0%
playing time is actually two hours and

playing time is actually two hours and
50<00:40:22.460><c> minutes</c><00:40:22.490><c> and</c><00:40:22.850><c> then</c><00:40:22.970><c> there's</c><00:40:23.180><c> an</c><00:40:23.300><c> interval</c>

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:23.570 align:start position:0%

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
50 minutes and then there's an interval
so<00:40:23.810><c> it</c><00:40:24.320><c> ends</c><00:40:24.560><c> up</c><00:40:24.650><c> being</c><00:40:24.920><c> sort</c><00:40:25.220><c> of</c><00:40:25.310><c> three</c><00:40:25.490><c> hours</c>
