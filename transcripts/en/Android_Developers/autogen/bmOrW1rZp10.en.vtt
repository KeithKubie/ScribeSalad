the idea for hotel tonight started when

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
the idea for hotel tonight started when
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.170
the idea for hotel tonight started when
I was doing the second one I found out I

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
I was doing the second one I found out I
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.930
I was doing the second one I found out I
was like on my mobile phone more than I

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
was like on my mobile phone more than I
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.510
was like on my mobile phone more than I
was on my computer at home and I said

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
was on my computer at home and I said
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100
was on my computer at home and I said
why isn't there a good way to book a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110
why isn't there a good way to book a
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.530
why isn't there a good way to book a
hotel on your smartphone and so I

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
hotel on your smartphone and so I
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.540
hotel on your smartphone and so I
thought about what the mobile use case

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550
thought about what the mobile use case
 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.459
thought about what the mobile use case
is and it's about last minute and it's

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
is and it's about last minute and it's
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.590
is and it's about last minute and it's
about booking in the moment and so we

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600
about booking in the moment and so we
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.360
about booking in the moment and so we
came up with hotel tonight when i

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
came up with hotel tonight when i
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.430
came up with hotel tonight when i
started at hotel tonight in February of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
started at hotel tonight in February of
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709
started at hotel tonight in February of
2012 and I think there were something

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
2012 and I think there were something
 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.869
2012 and I think there were something
like four hundred thousand downloads at

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
like four hundred thousand downloads at
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.430
like four hundred thousand downloads at
that point I think we're at around 1.6

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
that point I think we're at around 1.6
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.990
that point I think we're at around 1.6
million now so we've seen obviously

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
million now so we've seen obviously
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.330
million now so we've seen obviously
explosive growth in the last year we've

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340
explosive growth in the last year we've
 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130
explosive growth in the last year we've
also completely redesigned the app

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
also completely redesigned the app
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.929
also completely redesigned the app
really since we've implemented things

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
really since we've implemented things
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.550
really since we've implemented things
like the action bar and the fragments

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
like the action bar and the fragments
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.230
like the action bar and the fragments
and really adhered to to a lot of the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
and really adhered to to a lot of the
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.730
and really adhered to to a lot of the
Google design guidelines we've seen that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
Google design guidelines we've seen that
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.420
Google design guidelines we've seen that
growth certainly exponentially yeah we'd

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430
growth certainly exponentially yeah we'd
 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.980
growth certainly exponentially yeah we'd
see an exponential growth releases this

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
see an exponential growth releases this
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.210
see an exponential growth releases this
is really adhering to a lot of those

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
is really adhering to a lot of those
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640
is really adhering to a lot of those
good practices so with Android it was

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
good practices so with Android it was
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.260
good practices so with Android it was
just a matter of time until we had the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
just a matter of time until we had the
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.760
just a matter of time until we had the
resources to be able to invest in that

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
resources to be able to invest in that
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.890
resources to be able to invest in that

allows folks to jump to a particular
country and see inventory in that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
country and see inventory in that
 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.780
country and see inventory in that
country and as I mentioned we also use

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
country and as I mentioned we also use
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.819
country and as I mentioned we also use
the drawer pattern here so this is

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
the drawer pattern here so this is
 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.710
the drawer pattern here so this is
something that I actually took from last

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
something that I actually took from last
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.870
something that I actually took from last
year's google i/o this sliding drawer

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
year's google i/o this sliding drawer
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.690
year's google i/o this sliding drawer
pattern is very slick and so we stole

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
pattern is very slick and so we stole
 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.249
pattern is very slick and so we stole
that and we're you can tell that we're

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
that and we're you can tell that we're
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.780
that and we're you can tell that we're
using the action bar paradigm here as

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
using the action bar paradigm here as
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.569
using the action bar paradigm here as
well and let's actually just scroll down

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579

and again we're using fragments here

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
and again we're using fragments here
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.110
and again we're using fragments here
that allow us to very easily modify

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120
