Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. Our topic today is, goodness, goodness, selflessness. So we've done the math. I, the math leaves me a little on the codes. Why did your, why? So you know what, forget the math. Forget it. Let's, yeah, let's go to the people who do the deeds. People who do amazingly brave and heroic things. Yeah, no math required and maybe find out, I don't know what makes them different than the rest of us. Yeah. That question. Lettuce,

Speaker 2:          00:32          Robert Koski to a guy named Walter Rick Koski. I'm the executive director and secretary of the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission. Cool. Well thanks for doing this. Can you just give us a little background on the hero fund? What is the Carnegie Hero Fund? Carnegie Hero Fund is a private operating foundation that was established by Andrew Carnegie in 1904 and what we do is recognize civilian heroism throughout the United States and Canada by giving an award called the Carnegie Medal. And the accompanying the Carnegie Medal is a financial grant. How much? A lot of, currently the amount is $5,000 wow. And how do you guys choose your heroes? We judged the heroic acts against a list of requirements. So then you have to have some kind of definition of hero, which includes some and excludes others. Yes, perfect. Basic definition, which is a civilian one meaning no military who voluntarily to leaves a point of safety to risk his own life or her own life or to an extraordinary degree.

Speaker 2:          01:34          Five to save or to attempt to save the life of another human. Six. How about seven y, can you hear? Can you read that one more time? Okay. I wasn't reading that just came from memory. So like what is it that happens in a person's mind at that pivotal moment when they decide to voluntarily, voluntarily leave a point of safety and risk their life to an extraordinary degree to save the life of another human? That's what we wanted to know. Should we just jump in? Okay. So the first one we have on our list is a Laura Shrek. Okay. That's file number seven three five four six and the award number is 8,005

Speaker 3:          02:09          I am Laura shrike. I'm from Matt Toon, Illinois, and I currently live in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Speaker 2:          02:15          Oh Wow. Laura spoke with our producer Tim Howard. Okay, so we're going back a little bit here.

Speaker 3:          02:19          Yeah, 15 years. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:21          Back in the, uh, mid nineties, 1995 to 21 year old college students

Speaker 3:          02:25          and I was driving through the country and I saw a woman getting mauled by a bull and a pasture.

Speaker 2:          02:34          So she stopped to see what was going on,

Speaker 3:          02:36          jumped out and started yelling at her to see what I could do. The woman was on the ground and the bull was 50 pound Jersey bull tossing her in the air and back on the ground. Wow. She was clearly struggling. And where were you? I was right on the other side of the fence, but the fence was electric.

Speaker 2:          02:58          So here's the moment

Speaker 1:          03:00          that we find fascinating. At this point, Laura can either go forward through thousands of volts of electricity toward an angry bull that will likely mall her too, or she can stay safe.

Speaker 4:          03:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:19          I went ahead and just climbed through the fence and I don't remember ever feeling the electricity. She says by the time she got through crazily enough and neighbor had shown up and threw her a piece of pipe maybe about two feet long or she approached the woman who is still conscious the whole time she's yelling at me, hit the ball in the face as hard as you can and don't stop.

Speaker 1:          03:39          So Miss Shriek went up to the bowl and uh,

Speaker 3:          03:45          repeatedly refers two foot length of tubing. I think it distracted the bull enough where she was able to get out from under him. And as soon as we were outside the fence looking back into the pastorate and the bull was literally right there at the fence, [inaudible] ground a few times and snorted. He was not happy. He was not happy.

Speaker 4:          04:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:10          To our question, when you were there at that fence and you had the choice either stay put or to go through it, what was going through your mind? W was there a calculation?

Speaker 3:          04:21          No, I can't really say that. I mean,

Speaker 1:          04:24          you didn't weigh your options or anything like that?

Speaker 3:          04:26          I did not know. It was just, here's the problem, here's what I need to do. And something needed to happen.

Speaker 4:          04:34          Huh?

Speaker 1:          04:36          So there was no choice moment?

Speaker 3:          04:38          Not that I recall. No. If nobody came to this woman's rescue, she would die. Unfortunately.

Speaker 1:          04:46          This is the usual explanation, says Walter lobular. No explanation. Like I couldn't stand there and not do anything. I would, I was compelled to act.

Speaker 3:          04:55          I didn't really take the time to think about what else could happen.

Speaker 1:          04:59          No, I can't say I ever really thought about my own life at that time. I mean, I think we just jumped ahead because we thought we'd try again. That's the voice of the next Carnegie Hero that Walter told us about.

Speaker 2:          05:08          Yeah. William David Pennell, Ames William Panel. Wow. Who is the 8362nd person to receive the Carnegie Medal?

Speaker 1:          05:16          I'm pretty sure Lynn Levy tracked him down. Bill, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you.

Speaker 2:          05:19          William. David Pennell was 37 years old at the time I faced heroic act.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Was It 1999? Yes. I was, uh, early in the morning. It was like

Speaker 2:          05:28          3:19 AM in a small town near Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Monongahela, Pennsylvania. We was in bed sleeping.

Speaker 1:          05:37          My wife had a lot fash I actually didn't hear it in a dog my one dog was carrying on. So right away I run down there.

Speaker 2:          05:44          Mr Pennell went outside his house. There was a very bad automobile accident, a car crashed head on until utility pole. She was like rippling up the windshield off from under the hood and he responded to the scene wearing only no shoes

Speaker 1:          05:58          or shirt or nothing on their chest and bare foot. So here we are, bill standing in front of this ball of fire. There are three drunk teenagers inside that car though he doesn't know it can either a do nothing

Speaker 2:          06:13          for B. Go in through the driver's door.

Speaker 1:          06:20          Big Fella sloped out the doors. So I reached in and grabbed the hold of them around the chest, pull them from the driver's seat out to the ground main. Their car was just like blazer and my neighbor was there. She was hollering. There's more of them in there. So I run back to the vehicle. We found that the front seat passenger who was trapped in the wreckage and I finally got him loose and pulled him out. Apparently Mr Pennell was aware that a third person was in the car. A third young man. Uh, Mr Pennell entered the car third time. By then there was tires blown. I flames had grown to about three feet above the car's roof. The interior, like the headline are at the car and stuff was dripping like plastic Donald my back. Huh. I mean, I'm in there screaming, you know, somebody give me a hand in here,

Speaker 5:          07:09          but nobody, nobody would help. And uh, I reached in and grabbed the hold of the kid who was in the back by the scruff of the neck and pulled him out. All right, so when you are coming out of your house and you're looking at that car, what was going through your head? Just turn to try to help? I mean, I, I did what any normal person would do. I mean, you know, I just kept saying, this is somebody who's kids. You know what I mean? It's a time my daughter was like 16 and I'm saying to myself, you know, if something, God forbid, whatever happened to her that I would hope someone would be there to help. Do you ever talk to your neighbors and ask them why they didn't come in there? Uh, you know what, that's funny you brought that up because no, I've never, never brought it up. Never brought it up. How come? I don't know. I guess, uh, maybe I probably wouldn't like their answer. I don't know. I don't know why. I've never asked him about what do you think is the difference between you and those other people who just sort of stood by? Uh, I couldn't answer that. I couldn't answer that.

Speaker 2:          08:15          So our bowl girl, she didn't know. This guy didn't really know either. Somebody must be able to tell us something about what they were thinking at that moment that allowed them, that gave them the courage to do what they did. I can't give you a definite answer as to what propels people to do this. No, but we took one more shot with Walter and he told us about a case that of all the cases he's heard, this is the one that puzzles him the most. It's the case of Wesley James Autry, a construction worker from a New York 50 year old man who did jump into the a track that in a subway station to remove a fellow, a young man who had fallen onto the track. The gentleman was a six foot 180 pounds. He was, he was an ERT and yet Mr Autry persisted despite the fact that a train was coming.

Speaker 2:          09:05          There would come a point and let's, at least in my estimation, where you would have to say, I have to get out of here because I'm going to be killed on, I'm not suicidal, but Mr Autry didn't think that way. He and I part in this in this manner. What he did was he lay atop the victim between the rails while the train passed over them in the farthest reaches of my imagination. I can see myself jumping onto a subway track to attempt the rescue. What I can't see myself doing is lying at top, the victim while the train passes over me

Speaker 1:          09:43          making this story even more nuts. When we finally met up with Wesley Autrey on the platform where this incident happened under 35th and Broadway, he explained to us that his daughters

Speaker 6:          09:55          then when they was okay and uh, how old lady daughters at that time, my daughter was four and six and this, this them there should this picture, oh my God, super cute dog. Then one behind me is Shuki and this the baby Sashi.

Speaker 1:          10:12          So when they're standing there and this guy starts convulsing and then eventually falls off the platform onto the tracks, right as a train is coming, his choice is pretty stark. In order to save this complete stranger, he's got to leave his daughters behind potentially without a dad. I'm looking at him

Speaker 7:          10:29          second and going into another seizure or some strange reason a boys out of nowhere is that, don't worry about your own, to worry about your daughters. You can do this. So we jumped yes. Runs to the guy. Is he conscious? No. No. Tries to grab the guy's hand and he start my grabbed his hand will slip apart in a, he slipped. I look up, the train is getting close. I grabbed his hand again. We'll slip apart, just rained the skulls up 50 feet, 20 feet, 10 feet, and then it's right there and all he can do is grab the guy, get him in a bear hug and flatten his body against the guy as much

Speaker 4:          11:04          does he

Speaker 7:          11:10          the first train car? Just greys. My cas train car went right over it when the train came [inaudible] so stop quoting five cars passed over us. I looked him in the eyes. Excuse me, and you seem to have a seizure or something. I don't know you, you don't know me. So I just kept talking to him until he came through and he was like, well, where are we? I'm like, we on a different train. He said, well, who are you? I said, I came down to save your life. So he kept asking me, are we dead or we in heaven? I gave him a slight pinch on his arm. He's like, oh, just I see you. You are very much alive.

Speaker 7:          11:43          Have you, did you ever ask yourself at this point like what am I doing here? He asked it. What am I doing here? What about you, your mind? I can hear the two ladies. We had my daughter standing the man between their legs. I can hear my daughter screaming. So when that training come to a stop, I yelled up from underneath the train. Excuse me, I'm the father. We're okay. I just want to let my daughters know that that I'm okay because I know that they are worried about me. Everybody started clapping. Can I ask you a question? So the point at which you said you heard a voice. Yes. That said, I can do this. I can do this. What's what's what is amazing to me? Is it you left your daughters right here after a guy. You don't know he was a stranger, total stranger.

Speaker 7:          12:27          But you know what? The mission wasn't con completed. I was chose for that. You felt chose like you were teaching. I felt like I would have chosen live for a religious person though I would wonder why me? Well, you know what, uh, maybe 20 years ago I was supposed to be at a certain point and then he explained to us exactly why he had jumped. He was the one guy who could, he said right before his feet left the platform, this one specific moment from his life flashed this thing that happened. You know, I had a gun pool to my temple, but you know, it was a misfire. So you know, a gun was put to your head and missing. So you are almost dead for a second. Those dead, you know. So you think you might've been spirit for a parent? I was spare for reason after that.

Speaker 7:          13:18          Yeah. [inaudible] he says when the gun went click and he didn't die, he always wondered why had God spared him that moment until he was on the platform and he saw the guy fall off. He says, then he knew, this is why I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. That voice when that board said that you're going to be okay. I knew everything was gonna work out you. You know what I think at the end of the day, what's that? I don't think that there's an answer to the question we asked. I don't really, hero question. Why were you a hero? I don't think that any three of these here. I mean the last one had the longest explanation. He had been selected for some purpose, but does he know why he was not a clue. Okay. Number three gives me something. What does he give you?

Speaker 7:          14:10          Okay, so the first two, right? They have no idea. None. So this is just something in them that made them act began. Number three is talking about circumstances like the world prepared him for that moment. Serendipity. So it makes me think, well what if a circumstances are just right? Maybe any of us could do that again, I'll get a middle man. He, he used to say to me all the time, he says, how did you manage to do that up? Or how did you manage to pull him kids out? I don't know if I could've done that. I said, well, you know what? I'll say you wouldn't do this or you wouldn't do that to you're put in that situation. In fact, when we asked Walter, how many nominations do you get a year? Are they hard to find? No, they are not hard at all to find a, we are fortunate to be living in a society

Speaker 2:          14:52          regardless of what you hear elsewhere. We are fortunate to be living in a society where people do look out for others, even strangers. He told us they've even had to up their guidelines to make it harder to win simply because of the vast number for ROIC deeds that happen in day to day life. All
