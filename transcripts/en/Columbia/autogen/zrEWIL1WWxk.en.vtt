idea behind this program is that we're

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780
idea behind this program is that we're
 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.540
idea behind this program is that we're
trying to take on problems that are

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550
trying to take on problems that are
 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.430

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.350
scope
and we're trying to see whether it's

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360
and we're trying to see whether it's
 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.620
and we're trying to see whether it's
possible to do a historical research on

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630
possible to do a historical research on
 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.090
possible to do a historical research on
some of the most pressing problems in

some of the most pressing problems in
 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.880

world politics and think too about how
 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.280

it is history might help us to plan for
 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.020
it is history might help us to plan for
and prepare for these challenges so this

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030
and prepare for these challenges so this
 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.360
and prepare for these challenges so this
is a program that while its historical

the tradition in which I was taught and
Americanist really worked on America as

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680
Americanist really worked on America as
 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.450
Americanist really worked on America as
if it was unconnected from the world and

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460
if it was unconnected from the world and
 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.189
if it was unconnected from the world and
so many the questions at stake in

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199
so many the questions at stake in
 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.649
so many the questions at stake in
thinking about global history

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:32.659
thinking about global history
 

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:36.100
thinking about global history
I mean placing America within a broad

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110
I mean placing America within a broad
 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.950
I mean placing America within a broad
global context in the kinds of

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960
global context in the kinds of
 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.930
global context in the kinds of
transnational exchanges that Professor

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:40.940
transnational exchanges that Professor
 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.820
transnational exchanges that Professor
Connelly just mentioned and that's

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:42.830
Connelly just mentioned and that's
 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.649
Connelly just mentioned and that's
really the theme that I want to take up

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:44.659
really the theme that I want to take up
 

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:47.260
really the theme that I want to take up
today but I have to admit even when I

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:47.270
today but I have to admit even when I
 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.469
today but I have to admit even when I
started my book on cigarette smoking I

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479
started my book on cigarette smoking I
 

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:51.670
started my book on cigarette smoking I
really thought I was gonna write a

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680
really thought I was gonna write a
 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.129
really thought I was gonna write a
history of cigarette smoking in American

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:54.139
history of cigarette smoking in American
 

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:57.750
history of cigarette smoking in American
life and that I would trace a rather

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:57.760
life and that I would trace a rather
 

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.260
life and that I would trace a rather
remarkable story of how cigarette

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:02.270
remarkable story of how cigarette
 

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.170
remarkable story of how cigarette
smoking came to be so popular in the

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.180
smoking came to be so popular in the
 

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.050
smoking came to be so popular in the
United States and then ultimately about

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:08.060
United States and then ultimately about
 

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.620
United States and then ultimately about
its relative decline in the last two or

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:11.630
its relative decline in the last two or
 

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.269
its relative decline in the last two or
three decades and I thought that was a

00:08:13.269 --> 00:08:13.279
three decades and I thought that was a
 

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:16.390
three decades and I thought that was a
great story for the most part smoking

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400
great story for the most part smoking
 

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.240
great story for the most part smoking
doesn't exist as we know it as recently

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.250
doesn't exist as we know it as recently
 

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.820
doesn't exist as we know it as recently
as 1900 there was this phenomenal rise

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:23.830
as 1900 there was this phenomenal rise
 

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.620
as 1900 there was this phenomenal rise
of cigarette smoking during the course

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:25.630
of cigarette smoking during the course
 

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.050
of cigarette smoking during the course
of the 20th century in the United States

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.060
of the 20th century in the United States
 

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.080
of the 20th century in the United States
and then a very good story for public

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.090
and then a very good story for public
 

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.150
and then a very good story for public
health that a behavior that's highly

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:33.160
health that a behavior that's highly
 

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.670
health that a behavior that's highly
addictive that's intensely advertised

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680
addictive that's intensely advertised
 

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.090
addictive that's intensely advertised
and so on actually declines in number

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:39.100
and so on actually declines in number
 

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.909
and so on actually declines in number
over a series of decades that that would

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919
over a series of decades that that would
 

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.490
over a series of decades that that would
be sort of beginning middle of an end

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:44.500
be sort of beginning middle of an end
 

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.470
be sort of beginning middle of an end
and that's really where I started I just

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480
and that's really where I started I just
 

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.850
and that's really where I started I just
thought I would briefly review some of

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:47.860
thought I would briefly review some of
 

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.130
thought I would briefly review some of
the questions that were at stake in this

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:50.140
the questions that were at stake in this
 

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.430
the questions that were at stake in this
this is just a chart that shows the rise

this is just a chart that shows the rise
 

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.250
this is just a chart that shows the rise
of male smoking very intense in the

of male smoking very intense in the
 

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.230

distributing cigarettes to the troops so
there's a profound social and cultural

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:19.450
there's a profound social and cultural
 

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.020
there's a profound social and cultural

tremendous rise in men's smoking and

tremendous rise in men's smoking and
then followed about a 20-year lag in

then followed about a 20-year lag in

women smoking almost getting to the

women smoking almost getting to the
 

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.620
women smoking almost getting to the
rates in which men smoked and this was

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:34.630
rates in which men smoked and this was
 

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.870

really the chart that I began my project

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880
really the chart that I began my project
 

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.720
really the chart that I began my project
with I wanted to explain this and I

public health that that would be my
 

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.090
public health that that would be my
project but it turned out not exactly to

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.100
project but it turned out not exactly to
 

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.950
project but it turned out not exactly to
be the case but what I thought I would

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:52.960
be the case but what I thought I would
 

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.570
be the case but what I thought I would
do is just quickly show you sort of some

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:54.580
do is just quickly show you sort of some
 

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.600
do is just quickly show you sort of some
of the factors that led to that rise in

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:57.610
of the factors that led to that rise in
 

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.220
of the factors that led to that rise in
cigarette smoking and just mention it

00:09:59.220 --> 00:09:59.230
cigarette smoking and just mention it
 

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.830
cigarette smoking and just mention it
because I always had the notion that if

we could understand why cigarette

the mechanisms for undoing that behavior

the mechanisms for undoing that behavior
that there was almost perhaps a form of

that there was almost perhaps a form of
 

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.880
that there was almost perhaps a form of

today around smoking you really had to

don't you see smoking in film because

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:49.550
don't you see smoking in film because
 

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.360
don't you see smoking in film because
more people were smoking but when we get

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:52.370
more people were smoking but when we get
 

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.310
more people were smoking but when we get
into the tobacco documents you see that

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320
into the tobacco documents you see that
 

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.350

to assure that they used cigarettes in
their film so the relationship between

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:04.190
their film so the relationship between
 

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.980
their film so the relationship between
film as a cultural idiom and force and

industrial interests is much more
 

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.850
industrial interests is much more
complex than simply seeing it as a

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:12.860
complex than simply seeing it as a
 

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:17.560
complex than simply seeing it as a
mirror of changing culture so the other

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:17.570
mirror of changing culture so the other
 

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.150

thing that became so apparent during

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160
thing that became so apparent during
 

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160
thing that became so apparent during
this period of the rise of cigarettes is

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:21.170
this period of the rise of cigarettes is
 

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.500
this period of the rise of cigarettes is
that cigarettes turned out to be

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:23.510
that cigarettes turned out to be
 

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.930
that cigarettes turned out to be
extremely dangerous and so one of the

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:25.940
extremely dangerous and so one of the
 

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.460
extremely dangerous and so one of the
things that I have studied is the rise

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:27.470
things that I have studied is the rise
 

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.910
things that I have studied is the rise
of the science of Epidemiology as it was

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920
of the science of Epidemiology as it was
 

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.090
of the science of Epidemiology as it was
reflected in the cigarette some of my

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:34.100
reflected in the cigarette some of my
 

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.350
reflected in the cigarette some of my
friends have said you don't need to be

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360
friends have said you don't need to be
 

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.500
friends have said you don't need to be
an epidemiologist to see the causal

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:38.510
an epidemiologist to see the causal
 

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.710
an epidemiologist to see the causal
relationship here but what I want to

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720
relationship here but what I want to
 

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.870
relationship here but what I want to
suggest is as early as the 1930s and 40s

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880
suggest is as early as the 1930s and 40s
 

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.730
suggest is as early as the 1930s and 40s
when people became very concerned about

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:45.740
when people became very concerned about
 

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.370
when people became very concerned about
cancers and tobacco this relationship

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:48.380
cancers and tobacco this relationship
 

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.050
cancers and tobacco this relationship
would have been much more difficult to

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:50.060
would have been much more difficult to
 

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.890
would have been much more difficult to
unpack and so the very early years of

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:52.900
unpack and so the very early years of
 

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.780
unpack and so the very early years of
epidemiologists looking at this question

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:54.790
epidemiologists looking at this question
 

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.090
epidemiologists looking at this question
looks like this and so one of the things

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:58.100
looks like this and so one of the things
 

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.310
looks like this and so one of the things
we know about tobacco is that the

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320
we know about tobacco is that the
 

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.350
we know about tobacco is that the
knowledge in certain disciplines that

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360
knowledge in certain disciplines that
 

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.590
knowledge in certain disciplines that
were that evolve were crucial to the

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600
were that evolve were crucial to the
 

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.810
were that evolve were crucial to the
determination of evidence-based notions

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:07.820
determination of evidence-based notions
 

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.060
determination of evidence-based notions
of causality and disease which is

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.070
of causality and disease which is
 

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.940
of causality and disease which is
critical to so many material questions

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:12.950
critical to so many material questions
 

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.960
critical to so many material questions
in global health and so I don't have to

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:15.970
in global health and so I don't have to
 

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.480
in global health and so I don't have to
to go into the detail now but the early

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:18.490
to go into the detail now but the early
 

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.520
to go into the detail now but the early
evolution of retrospective and then

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:20.530
evolution of retrospective and then
 

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.850
evolution of retrospective and then
prospective trials to unpack this

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:23.860
prospective trials to unpack this
 

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.490
prospective trials to unpack this
particular question is a crucial element

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:26.500
particular question is a crucial element
 

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.520
particular question is a crucial element
of mid twentieth century science and the

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:29.530
of mid twentieth century science and the
 

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.649
of mid twentieth century science and the
development of Epidemiology as a field

at that level is crucial to thinking
about the skill set that's really needed

reason I show these slides in this
 

00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:09.690
reason I show these slides in this
context is a lot of these issues are

we want to get to the bottom of this
 

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.549
we want to get to the bottom of this
there's a great deal of scientific

there's a great deal of scientific
 

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:39.290
there's a great deal of scientific

and one of the questions that we want to
 

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.380
and one of the questions that we want to
ask I think when we're thinking about

that cigarette smoking causes lung

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260
that cigarette smoking causes lung
 

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.160
that cigarette smoking causes lung
cancer was a label that the industry

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:43.170
cancer was a label that the industry
 

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.770
cancer was a label that the industry
wanted on cigarettes that said cigarette

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780
wanted on cigarettes that said cigarette
 

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.070

smoking may be hazardous to your health

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080
smoking may be hazardous to your health
 

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.169
smoking may be hazardous to your health
now why did the industry want that on

00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179
now why did the industry want that on
 

00:20:51.179 --> 00:20:52.669
now why did the industry want that on
the package it was viewed as a public

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679
the package it was viewed as a public
 

00:20:52.679 --> 00:20:55.010
the package it was viewed as a public
health intervention because then they

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020
health intervention because then they
 

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.680
health intervention because then they
could say cigarettes are labeled you're

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:57.690
could say cigarettes are labeled you're
 

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.070
could say cigarettes are labeled you're
aware that they may be harmful and the

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080
aware that they may be harmful and the
 

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.419
aware that they may be harmful and the
decision is yours

00:21:02.419 --> 00:21:02.429
decision is yours
 

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:04.490
decision is yours
so you cannot hold our companies

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500
so you cannot hold our companies
 

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.010
so you cannot hold our companies
responsible so there's a very ambiguous

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:07.020
responsible so there's a very ambiguous
 

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.620
responsible so there's a very ambiguous
history to labeling in which we think of

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:09.630
history to labeling in which we think of
 

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.810
history to labeling in which we think of
it as a public health intervention but

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820
it as a public health intervention but
 

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.000
it as a public health intervention but
in this instance it very much served the

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.010
in this instance it very much served the
 

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.600
in this instance it very much served the
interests of the tobacco industry and

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:17.610
interests of the tobacco industry and
 

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.700
interests of the tobacco industry and
I'll say a bit more about that a little

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:19.710
I'll say a bit more about that a little
 

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.490
I'll say a bit more about that a little
bit later on so here we have this chart

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500
bit later on so here we have this chart
 

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.070
bit later on so here we have this chart
and I have to say in my American

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080
and I have to say in my American
 

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.160
and I have to say in my American
Exceptionalist orientation I viewed this

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:28.170
Exceptionalist orientation I viewed this
 

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:32.140
Exceptionalist orientation I viewed this
chart with some degree of gratification

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:32.150

that cigarette smoking had grown

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:35.390
that cigarette smoking had grown
 

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.030
that cigarette smoking had grown
tremendously I thought I had some

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:38.040
tremendously I thought I had some
 

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.810
tremendously I thought I had some
explanations for why that was the

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:39.820
explanations for why that was the
 

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.430
explanations for why that was the
that I understood it better as I

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440
that I understood it better as I
 

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.470
that I understood it better as I
conducted my study and I began to

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480
conducted my study and I began to
 

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.270
conducted my study and I began to
understand why cigarette smoking had

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280
understand why cigarette smoking had
 

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.260
understand why cigarette smoking had
declined modestly but significantly

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:48.270
declined modestly but significantly
 

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.630
declined modestly but significantly
given its biologically and socially and

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640
given its biologically and socially and
 

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.790
given its biologically and socially and
culturally addictive qualities and I

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:53.800
culturally addictive qualities and I
 

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.950
culturally addictive qualities and I
thought this is a good story for public

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960
thought this is a good story for public
 

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.200
thought this is a good story for public
health where you identify health risks

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:58.210
health where you identify health risks

even in the face of powerful industrial

even in the face of powerful industrial
 

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.240
even in the face of powerful industrial
interests and yet you create a society

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:03.250
interests and yet you create a society
 

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.550
interests and yet you create a society
that begins to modify it and we went

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:05.560
that begins to modify it and we went
 

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.940
that begins to modify it and we went
from as you see almost 60% of men I

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:08.950
from as you see almost 60% of men I

from as you see almost 60% of men I
recently saw a data point that in

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:10.690
recently saw a data point that in
 

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.680
recently saw a data point that in
medical schools in the mid-1960s nearly

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:13.690
medical schools in the mid-1960s nearly
 

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:16.080
medical schools in the mid-1960s nearly
80% of all medical students were regular

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:16.090
80% of all medical students were regular
 

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.380
80% of all medical students were regular
smokers imagine that today and yet today

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:19.390
smokers imagine that today and yet today
 

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.940
smokers imagine that today and yet today
we see these dramatic declines in

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:20.950
we see these dramatic declines in
 

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.080
we see these dramatic declines in
medical schools you know you would have

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:22.090
medical schools you know you would have
 

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.510
medical schools you know you would have
fewer than 1% of medical students are

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520
fewer than 1% of medical students are
 

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.050
fewer than 1% of medical students are
smokers today so it was a good story but

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:28.060
smokers today so it was a good story but
 

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.030
smokers today so it was a good story but
here's my point in the context of

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:30.040
here's my point in the context of
 

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.250
here's my point in the context of
thinking about global health this good

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:32.260
thinking about global health this good
 

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:37.080
thinking about global health this good
story of American public health and the

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.090
story of American public health and the
 

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.790
story of American public health and the
nature of what we understand about

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:38.800
nature of what we understand about
 

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.730
nature of what we understand about
tobacco has had dramatic implications

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:41.740
tobacco has had dramatic implications
 

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.370
tobacco has had dramatic implications
for global health and so we need to

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:44.380
for global health and so we need to
 

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.930
for global health and so we need to
think about this story in a much more

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:45.940
think about this story in a much more
 

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.240
think about this story in a much more
complicated way because one of the

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:48.250
complicated way because one of the
 

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.340
complicated way because one of the
things I think it will teach us is that

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:50.350
things I think it will teach us is that
 

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.620
things I think it will teach us is that
an intervention that may be successful

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:52.630
an intervention that may be successful
 

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:56.550
an intervention that may be successful
in one nation-state has all kinds of

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:56.560
in one nation-state has all kinds of
 

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.980
in one nation-state has all kinds of
very serious implications for other

nations and for indices of global health
 

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.360
nations and for indices of global health
and that's really where I want to take

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:06.370
and that's really where I want to take
 

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.580
and that's really where I want to take
off today so one of the questions that I

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:08.590
off today so one of the questions that I
 

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.230
off today so one of the questions that I
think we really need to ask when we tell

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240
think we really need to ask when we tell
 

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.210
think we really need to ask when we tell
a story of success in public health is

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:12.220
a story of success in public health is
 

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.630
a story of success in public health is
what were its ramifications in terms of

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640
what were its ramifications in terms of
 

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.660
what were its ramifications in terms of
some of the transnational and relational

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:18.670
some of the transnational and relational
 

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.790
some of the transnational and relational
issues that are really at the core of

issues that are really at the core of
 

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.070
issues that are really at the core of
how to think about global health and one

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080
how to think about global health and one
 

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.480
how to think about global health and one
of the big problems that we have right

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:24.490
of the big problems that we have right
 

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.310
of the big problems that we have right
now is how are we going to define global

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320
now is how are we going to define global
 

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.170
now is how are we going to define global
health is it just everything that

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:28.180
health is it just everything that
 

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.360
health is it just everything that
happens relating to health on the globe

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:30.370
happens relating to health on the globe
 

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.550

or can we be somewhat more specific

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:32.560
or can we be somewhat more specific
 

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.620
or can we be somewhat more specific
about the kinds of human and disease

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:36.630
about the kinds of human and disease

types of public policies and that's at

the heart of what I really wanted is

the heart of what I really wanted is
 

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.300
the heart of what I really wanted is
that's what the companies realized and

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:54.310
that's what the companies realized and
 

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.580
that's what the companies realized and
they realized it early on was that what

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:56.590
they realized it early on was that what
 

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.140
they realized it early on was that what
was happening in the United States and

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:58.150
was happening in the United States and
 

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.890
was happening in the United States and
the growing awareness of tobacco as the

made them think about other markets and
 

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.870
made them think about other markets and
I have to think that that the tobacco

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880
I have to think that that the tobacco
 

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.510
I have to think that that the tobacco

decline in American smoking that they
 

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.720
decline in American smoking that they
anticipated as early as the 1970s and

they began to aggressively think about
 

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.840
they began to aggressively think about

they're dying and if we are going to
 

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:46.230
they're dying and if we are going to
sustain our industry we need new smokers

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240
sustain our industry we need new smokers
 

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.270
sustain our industry we need new smokers
and where will new smokers come from

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:48.280
and where will new smokers come from

now the number of total deaths will go
from four million to 10 million it will

from four million to 10 million it will
 

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:54.870
from four million to 10 million it will
more than double

industry strategy that was really
hatched in the 60s and 70s in terms of

hatched in the 60s and 70s in terms of
 

00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:16.129
hatched in the 60s and 70s in terms of
finding new smokers and aggressively

00:26:16.129 --> 00:26:16.139
finding new smokers and aggressively
 

00:26:16.139 --> 00:26:19.189
finding new smokers and aggressively
promoting smoking in places that had

00:26:19.189 --> 00:26:19.199
promoting smoking in places that had
 

00:26:19.199 --> 00:26:21.769
promoting smoking in places that had
lower levels of literacy and education

they put in one variable and then the
 

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:16.069
they put in one variable and then the
map distorts and what this does is it

I have to say this was surprising to me

00:27:24.379 --> 00:27:24.389
I have to say this was surprising to me

I have to say this was surprising to me
and I've been studying tobacco for a

00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:26.429
and I've been studying tobacco for a
 

00:27:26.429 --> 00:27:28.099
and I've been studying tobacco for a
long time to realize that there's so

00:27:28.099 --> 00:27:28.109
long time to realize that there's so
 

00:27:28.109 --> 00:27:31.399
long time to realize that there's so
much smoking going on in Russia and the

00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:31.409
much smoking going on in Russia and the
 

00:27:31.409 --> 00:27:34.459
much smoking going on in Russia and the
former Soviet Union in India and

00:27:34.459 --> 00:27:34.469
former Soviet Union in India and
 

00:27:34.469 --> 00:27:38.329
former Soviet Union in India and
Southeast Asia and just how how reduced

00:27:38.329 --> 00:27:38.339
Southeast Asia and just how how reduced
 

00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:42.319

and you know I feel in my work I've

00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:48.269
and you know I feel in my work I've
 

00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:50.839

gotten inside the head of the tobacco

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:50.849
gotten inside the head of the tobacco
 

00:27:50.849 --> 00:27:53.089
gotten inside the head of the tobacco
industry and as I say they're very

00:27:53.089 --> 00:27:53.099
industry and as I say they're very
 

00:27:53.099 --> 00:27:54.949

sophisticated they see this map and they

00:27:54.949 --> 00:27:54.959
sophisticated they see this map and they
 

00:27:54.959 --> 00:27:56.659
sophisticated they see this map and they
say what are some of the opportunities

00:27:56.659 --> 00:27:56.669
say what are some of the opportunities
 

00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:59.869
say what are some of the opportunities
on this map and a giant opportunity is

00:27:59.869 --> 00:27:59.879
on this map and a giant opportunity is
 

00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:02.919

so you can in a way develop some periods

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:09.580
so you can in a way develop some periods
 

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.750
so you can in a way develop some periods
of this epidemic but one of the things

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760
of this epidemic but one of the things
 

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.000
of this epidemic but one of the things
this raises for us is is there something

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.010
this raises for us is is there something
 

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.910
this raises for us is is there something
that we could learn from what the

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:16.920
that we could learn from what the
 

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.790

Western European or American history of
 

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.100
Western European or American history of
the epidemic that we could guide back

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:23.110
the epidemic that we could guide back
 

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:26.490
the epidemic that we could guide back
into stage 1 and stage 2 countries so

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:26.500
into stage 1 and stage 2 countries so
 

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.760
into stage 1 and stage 2 countries so
that they would have stronger tools to

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:29.770
that they would have stronger tools to
 

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.970
that they would have stronger tools to
resist this rise of smoking and so these

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:32.980
resist this rise of smoking and so these
 

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.470
resist this rise of smoking and so these
are some of the questions of governance

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480
are some of the questions of governance
 

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.570
are some of the questions of governance
that I think we get into in policy is

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:36.580
that I think we get into in policy is
 

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.660
that I think we get into in policy is
what do we know from our experience in

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:39.670
what do we know from our experience in
 

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.420
what do we know from our experience in
the West that might be utilized

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:42.430
the West that might be utilized
 

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.060
the West that might be utilized
effectively in other places of the world

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:45.070
effectively in other places of the world
 

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.340
effectively in other places of the world
at this time and it's that transfer of

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:47.350
at this time and it's that transfer of
 

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:49.850
at this time and it's that transfer of
knowledge that's a critical aspect of

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:49.860
knowledge that's a critical aspect of
 

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:53.730
knowledge that's a critical aspect of
globalization as well this has

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:53.740
globalization as well this has
 

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.130
globalization as well this has
tremendous implications for the overall

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:56.140
tremendous implications for the overall
 

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.110
tremendous implications for the overall
burden of disease and I don't know how

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.120
burden of disease and I don't know how
 

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.120
burden of disease and I don't know how
much some of you have spent on overall

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:00.130
much some of you have spent on overall
 

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.980
much some of you have spent on overall
concepts of the burden of disease and

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:01.990
concepts of the burden of disease and
 

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.810
concepts of the burden of disease and
how its measured but it's a critical

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:03.820
how its measured but it's a critical
 

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.270
how its measured but it's a critical
element and we've actually made a lot of

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:06.280
element and we've actually made a lot of
 

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.150
element and we've actually made a lot of
progress in coming to more consensual

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:09.160
progress in coming to more consensual
 

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.640

become non communicable diseases and so
 

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.950
become non communicable diseases and so
we're dealing in the West

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:58.840
split from Philip Morris International
and Philip Morris Altria sales even

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:58.850
and Philip Morris Altria sales even
 

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.549
and Philip Morris Altria sales even
though its profits are increasing but

00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559
though its profits are increasing but
 

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:02.560
though its profits are increasing but
sales are essentially flat in the West

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:02.570
sales are essentially flat in the West
 

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.169
sales are essentially flat in the West
but this is the numbers of cigarettes

00:34:05.169 --> 00:34:05.179
but this is the numbers of cigarettes
 

00:34:05.179 --> 00:34:07.600
but this is the numbers of cigarettes
that Philip Morris International is

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:07.610
that Philip Morris International is
 

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.119
that Philip Morris International is
manufacturing and selling now so the

00:34:10.119 --> 00:34:10.129
manufacturing and selling now so the
 

00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:13.000
manufacturing and selling now so the
entire shift of this industry has gone

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.010
entire shift of this industry has gone
 

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.490
entire shift of this industry has gone
from the west to the developing

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:15.500
from the west to the developing
 

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.680

countries in the most dramatic ways in a
 

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:21.789
countries in the most dramatic ways in a
relatively brief period of time so there

00:34:21.789 --> 00:34:21.799
relatively brief period of time so there
 

00:34:21.799 --> 00:34:25.919
relatively brief period of time so there
is a tremendous potential for the a

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:25.929
is a tremendous potential for the a
 

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.690
is a tremendous potential for the a
colossal epidemic of tobacco-related

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:28.700
colossal epidemic of tobacco-related
 

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.369
colossal epidemic of tobacco-related
diseases one things we know about

00:34:30.369 --> 00:34:30.379
diseases one things we know about
 

00:34:30.379 --> 00:34:33.220
diseases one things we know about
tobacco is unlike so many other risky

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:33.230
tobacco is unlike so many other risky
 

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.740
tobacco is unlike so many other risky
harmful substances it causes so many

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:35.750
harmful substances it causes so many
 

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:38.980
harmful substances it causes so many
different diseases and so much more bida

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:38.990
different diseases and so much more bida
 

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:43.460
different diseases and so much more bida
t so it is just a highly toxic

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:43.470
t so it is just a highly toxic
 

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:46.190
t so it is just a highly toxic
that has so many negative health

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200
that has so many negative health
 

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.069
that has so many negative health
outcomes and no no benefit on the other

00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079
outcomes and no no benefit on the other
 

00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:52.399
outcomes and no no benefit on the other
side there are some there are some risks

00:34:52.399 --> 00:34:52.409
side there are some there are some risks
 

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.050
side there are some there are some risks
that at least have some potential

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060
that at least have some potential
 

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.270
that at least have some potential
benefits on the other side this is what

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280
benefits on the other side this is what
 

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.190
benefits on the other side this is what
the global market share of tobacco looks

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200
the global market share of tobacco looks
 

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.829
the global market share of tobacco looks
like now obviously the China tobacco

00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839
like now obviously the China tobacco
 

00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:03.530
like now obviously the China tobacco
monopoly continues to produce a

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540
monopoly continues to produce a
 

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.190
monopoly continues to produce a
tremendous number of cigarettes and sell

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200
tremendous number of cigarettes and sell
 

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.550
tremendous number of cigarettes and sell
them but here you see British American

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560
them but here you see British American
 

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.910
them but here you see British American
Tobacco and Philip Morris are together

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920
Tobacco and Philip Morris are together
 

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.880
Tobacco and Philip Morris are together
much more significant than even the

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:15.890
much more significant than even the
 

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:21.530
much more significant than even the
China National tobacco monopoly what the

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540
China National tobacco monopoly what the
 

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.870
China National tobacco monopoly what the
tobacco companies have been doing in

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880
tobacco companies have been doing in
 

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.829
tobacco companies have been doing in
places like this ad in Nigeria are

00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839
places like this ad in Nigeria are
 

00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:30.319
places like this ad in Nigeria are
finding ways to aggressively promote

00:35:30.319 --> 00:35:30.329
finding ways to aggressively promote
 

00:35:30.329 --> 00:35:34.579
finding ways to aggressively promote
cigarettes in countries that are highly

00:35:34.579 --> 00:35:34.589
cigarettes in countries that are highly
 

00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:37.099
cigarettes in countries that are highly
vulnerable to initial sales and

00:35:37.099 --> 00:35:37.109
vulnerable to initial sales and
 

00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:39.920
vulnerable to initial sales and
initiation of tobacco and you see here

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:39.930
initiation of tobacco and you see here
 

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.510
initiation of tobacco and you see here
one of the things they did at this event

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520
one of the things they did at this event
 

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.220
one of the things they did at this event
is they lit cigarettes and gave them to

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:43.230
is they lit cigarettes and gave them to
 

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:46.730
is they lit cigarettes and gave them to
people coming to the movies one of the

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740
people coming to the movies one of the
 

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:47.690
people coming to the movies one of the

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:33.110
where there had been a local indigenous
 

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:36.380
where there had been a local indigenous
tobacco control movement they said we're

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:36.390

not raising our calf we refuse to do it
 

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.370
not raising our calf we refuse to do it
and so what happens in these kinds of

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380
and so what happens in these kinds of
 

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.340
and so what happens in these kinds of
trade disputes it goes to a court in

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:43.350
trade disputes it goes to a court in
 

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.690
trade disputes it goes to a court in
Geneva where it's adjudicated by the

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:46.700
Geneva where it's adjudicated by the
 

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.040
Geneva where it's adjudicated by the
general agreement on tariffs or trades

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:49.050

or the World Trade Organization and so
the Thai said we have this tariff on

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440
the Thai said we have this tariff on
 

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.770
the Thai said we have this tariff on
Western products because it's a public

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780
Western products because it's a public
 

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.340
Western products because it's a public
health carrot and there's less smoking

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:01.350
health carrot and there's less smoking
 

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:04.430
health carrot and there's less smoking
in Thailand because we restrict trade in

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440
in Thailand because we restrict trade in
 

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.000

American tobacco products and they got
 

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.590
American tobacco products and they got
the World Health Organization to come

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:09.600
the World Health Organization to come
 

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.620
the World Health Organization to come
and testify on their behalf and there's

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:12.630
and testify on their behalf and there's
 

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:16.880
and testify on their behalf and there's
actually a there's a codicil in

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:16.890
actually a there's a codicil in
 

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.890
actually a there's a codicil in
the general agreement on tariffs and

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900
the general agreement on tariffs and
 

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.550
the general agreement on tariffs and
trade known as 20b which says that you

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560
trade known as 20b which says that you
 

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.970
trade known as 20b which says that you
can restrict trade by tariffs for public

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:25.980

health reasons
 

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:31.550
health reasons
so they cited this 20 B rule in their

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560
so they cited this 20 B rule in their
 

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.910
so they cited this 20 B rule in their
presentation before the trade Court in

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920
presentation before the trade Court in
 

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.130
presentation before the trade Court in
Geneva but the American representative

Geneva but the American representative
 

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.710
Geneva but the American representative
said this is straight out a restraint on

American trade they can have Public

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:41.850
American trade they can have Public
 

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.940
American trade they can have Public
Health processes if they want but they

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:43.950
Health processes if they want but they
 

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:45.860
Health processes if they want but they
should appeal equally to American and

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:45.870

Thai produced tobacco products and what

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740
Thai produced tobacco products and what
 

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.520
Thai produced tobacco products and what
did the court decide the court decided

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:52.530

that they must open their trade to

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:54.990
that they must open their trade to
 

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:58.010
that they must open their trade to
American tobacco products and it's very

00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.020
American tobacco products and it's very
 

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.590
American tobacco products and it's very
interesting the 20 B rule has three

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:00.600
interesting the 20 B rule has three
 

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:04.580
interesting the 20 B rule has three
three levels one is that it must be

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:04.590
three levels one is that it must be
 

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:06.320
three levels one is that it must be
necessary for Public Health if you did

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:06.330
necessary for Public Health if you did
 

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:07.910
necessary for Public Health if you did
it so you might satisfy that when you

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920
it so you might satisfy that when you
 

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.530
it so you might satisfy that when you
say it's a public health mechanism and

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540
say it's a public health mechanism and
 

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.880
say it's a public health mechanism and
the World Health Organization got behind

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:10.890
the World Health Organization got behind
 

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:14.060
the World Health Organization got behind
the ties then you have to you have to

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:14.070
the ties then you have to you have to
 

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.980
the ties then you have to you have to
identify that it's the least restrictive

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:15.990
identify that it's the least restrictive
 

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.110
identify that it's the least restrictive
possible measure for accomplishing that

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:18.120
possible measure for accomplishing that
 

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.340
possible measure for accomplishing that
goal harder to demonstrate and then the

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:22.350
goal harder to demonstrate and then the
 

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:24.470
goal harder to demonstrate and then the
third thing is you have to say if you do

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480
third thing is you have to say if you do
 

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.420
third thing is you have to say if you do
have a tariff on tobacco you must be

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:26.430
have a tariff on tobacco you must be
 

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:27.680
have a tariff on tobacco you must be
able to show that it's an effective

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:27.690
able to show that it's an effective
 

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:32.420
able to show that it's an effective
public health policy also very difficult

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:32.430
public health policy also very difficult
 

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.580
public health policy also very difficult
so those three rules are in the interest

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:34.590
so those three rules are in the interest
 

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:38.390
so those three rules are in the interest
of trade over public health but so the

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400
of trade over public health but so the
 

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.220
of trade over public health but so the
ties were actually forced to open their

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:40.230
ties were actually forced to open their
 

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.830
ties were actually forced to open their
markets they were permitted by the

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:42.840
markets they were permitted by the
 

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:46.040
markets they were permitted by the
decision of the trade Court to continue

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:46.050
decision of the trade Court to continue
 

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:48.980
decision of the trade Court to continue
to ban advertising which was in a way a

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:48.990
to ban advertising which was in a way a
 

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:51.590
to ban advertising which was in a way a
victory for public health but this has

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:51.600
victory for public health but this has
 

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.300
victory for public health but this has
been the strategy for the companies to

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:53.310
been the strategy for the companies to
 

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:57.280
been the strategy for the companies to
undermine the ban on tobacco advertising

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:57.290
undermine the ban on tobacco advertising
 

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.660
undermine the ban on tobacco advertising
but this is what this is my key point

00:42:59.660 --> 00:42:59.670
but this is what this is my key point
 

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:01.370
but this is what this is my key point
here is that if we're going to

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:01.380
here is that if we're going to
 

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:04.130
here is that if we're going to
understand health risks in a global

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140
understand health risks in a global
 

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.950
understand health risks in a global
context they must be understood in the

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960
context they must be understood in the
 

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.650
context they must be understood in the
context of our trade agreements and

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660
context of our trade agreements and
 

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.200
context of our trade agreements and
trade issues and I don't know if anybody

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:12.210
trade issues and I don't know if anybody
 

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:15.110
trade issues and I don't know if anybody
here has been studying generic drugs and

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:15.120
here has been studying generic drugs and
 

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.440
here has been studying generic drugs and
HIV but the very same rules that in a

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:18.450
HIV but the very same rules that in a
 

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:21.640
HIV but the very same rules that in a
way have been significant in restricting

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:21.650
way have been significant in restricting
 

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:24.080
way have been significant in restricting
public health interventions for tobacco

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:24.090
public health interventions for tobacco
 

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:27.110
public health interventions for tobacco
have also been utilized to restrict

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:27.120
have also been utilized to restrict
 

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.079
have also been utilized to restrict
access to essential medical

00:43:30.079 --> 00:43:30.089
access to essential medical
 

00:43:30.089 --> 00:43:32.450
access to essential medical
so the relationship of Public Health to

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:32.460
so the relationship of Public Health to
 

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.490
so the relationship of Public Health to
trade in a global context is going to be

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500
trade in a global context is going to be
 

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.220
trade in a global context is going to be
one of the critical areas of

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:36.230
one of the critical areas of
 

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:40.309
one of the critical areas of
investigation as we move forward here's

00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319
investigation as we move forward here's
 

00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:41.780

developed a treaty for public health but
treaties were becoming important in

certain kinds of transnational exchange

certain kinds of transnational exchange
and in which there were perceived to be

by a single nation-state and so there
 

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:54.650
by a single nation-state and so there
was a model of protocols what were

00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:54.660
was a model of protocols what were
 

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.750
was a model of protocols what were
called Framework conventions treaties

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760

around certain kinds of environmental
harms and there was this idea in

simply be ours and so people began to

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:23.370
simply be ours and so people began to
 

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:27.230

think about this notion of global that's

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240
think about this notion of global that's
 

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.360
think about this notion of global that's
different than some others in which what

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:29.370
different than some others in which what
 

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:31.460

are those levels of risk and exchange

are those levels of risk and exchange
that cannot be moderated by a single

so the idea got proposed well what about

so the idea got proposed well what about
 

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:48.790
so the idea got proposed well what about
doing this for tobacco and this tobacco

something in which there are those kinds

Framework conventions is that in the end

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:37.570
Framework conventions is that in the end
 

01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:40.980
Framework conventions is that in the end
it has to be consistent with national

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:40.990
it has to be consistent with national
 

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:45.180

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:45.190
political democratic processes so even
 

01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:47.760
political democratic processes so even
though the protocols can in a sense

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:47.770
though the protocols can in a sense
 

01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:50.040
though the protocols can in a sense
require countries to come up to these

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:50.050
require countries to come up to these
 

01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:52.620
require countries to come up to these
standards it's really a consensual

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:52.630
standards it's really a consensual
 

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:56.400
standards it's really a consensual
standard that then has to be it has to

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:56.410
standard that then has to be it has to
 

01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:59.340
standard that then has to be it has to
be supported through the internal state

01:12:59.340 --> 01:12:59.350
be supported through the internal state
 

01:12:59.350 --> 01:13:02.760
be supported through the internal state
regulatory processes so it's not as if

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:02.770
regulatory processes so it's not as if
 

01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:04.200
regulatory processes so it's not as if
the Framework Convention can decide

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:04.210
the Framework Convention can decide
 

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:05.820
the Framework Convention can decide
everybody's gonna label cigarettes in

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:05.830
everybody's gonna label cigarettes in
 

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:08.280
everybody's gonna label cigarettes in
this way and then that actually puts the

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:08.290
this way and then that actually puts the
 

01:13:08.290 --> 01:13:09.660
this way and then that actually puts the
labels on the cigarettes what the

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:09.670
labels on the cigarettes what the
 

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:11.970
labels on the cigarettes what the
framework does is it sets a standard

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:11.980
framework does is it sets a standard
 

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.660
framework does is it sets a standard
that then the political processes will

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:15.670
that then the political processes will
 

01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:18.930
that then the political processes will
be held accountable to so in a sense

01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:18.940
be held accountable to so in a sense
 

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.400
be held accountable to so in a sense
that's the weakness of the Framework

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:20.410
that's the weakness of the Framework
 

01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:24.240
that's the weakness of the Framework
Convention is that it invents standards

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:24.250
Convention is that it invents standards
 

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.460
Convention is that it invents standards
that will not necessarily be fulfilled

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:26.470
that will not necessarily be fulfilled
 

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:29.699
that will not necessarily be fulfilled
through all parties to the convention

01:13:29.699 --> 01:13:29.709
through all parties to the convention
 

01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:33.540
through all parties to the convention
and I think that's acceptable you know

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:33.550
and I think that's acceptable you know
 

01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:36.509
and I think that's acceptable you know
the question is it seems so ironic for

01:13:36.509 --> 01:13:36.519
the question is it seems so ironic for
 

01:13:36.519 --> 01:13:39.000
the question is it seems so ironic for
the industry to say but who's

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:39.010
the industry to say but who's
 

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:41.549
the industry to say but who's
accountable to tobacco activists because

01:13:41.549 --> 01:13:41.559
accountable to tobacco activists because
 

01:13:41.559 --> 01:13:43.259
accountable to tobacco activists because
we actually understand the

01:13:43.259 --> 01:13:43.269
we actually understand the
 

01:13:43.269 --> 01:13:45.179
we actually understand the
accountability of industrial interests

01:13:45.179 --> 01:13:45.189
accountability of industrial interests
 

01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:48.140
accountability of industrial interests
very well industries are accountable

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:48.150
very well industries are accountable
 

01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:51.779
very well industries are accountable
exclusively to their shareholders so to

01:13:51.779 --> 01:13:51.789
exclusively to their shareholders so to
 

01:13:51.789 --> 01:13:53.250
exclusively to their shareholders so to
say that shareholders have a greater

01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:53.260
say that shareholders have a greater
 

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:56.790
say that shareholders have a greater
stake in public health processes than

01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800
stake in public health processes than
 

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.410
stake in public health processes than
these other forms of formal and informal

01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:00.420
these other forms of formal and informal
 

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:03.689
these other forms of formal and informal
governance mechanisms seems to me to be

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:03.699
governance mechanisms seems to me to be
 

01:14:03.699 --> 01:14:06.509
governance mechanisms seems to me to be
somewhat hypocritical so you know it's

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:06.519
somewhat hypocritical so you know it's
 

01:14:06.519 --> 01:14:07.919
somewhat hypocritical so you know it's
one thing to voice the argument that

01:14:07.919 --> 01:14:07.929
one thing to voice the argument that
 

01:14:07.929 --> 01:14:10.020
one thing to voice the argument that
choice is very important but when you

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:10.030
choice is very important but when you
 

01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:11.939
choice is very important but when you
see the industry doing it as an industry

01:14:11.939 --> 01:14:11.949
see the industry doing it as an industry
 

01:14:11.949 --> 01:14:13.529
see the industry doing it as an industry
that's one thing when you see the

01:14:13.529 --> 01:14:13.539
that's one thing when you see the
 

01:14:13.539 --> 01:14:15.899
that's one thing when you see the
industry supporting those arguments as

01:14:15.899 --> 01:14:15.909
industry supporting those arguments as
 

01:14:15.909 --> 01:14:19.350
industry supporting those arguments as
if they are independent then I think it

01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360
if they are independent then I think it
 

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.149
if they are independent then I think it
really undermines their authority to

01:14:21.149 --> 01:14:21.159
really undermines their authority to
 

01:14:21.159 --> 01:14:24.299
really undermines their authority to
question accountability so I think the

01:14:24.299 --> 01:14:24.309
question accountability so I think the
 

01:14:24.309 --> 01:14:26.189
question accountability so I think the
industry just incredibly sophisticated

01:14:26.189 --> 01:14:26.199
industry just incredibly sophisticated
 

01:14:26.199 --> 01:14:29.790
industry just incredibly sophisticated
and that's the that's the question away

01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800
and that's the that's the question away
 

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.739
and that's the that's the question away
what are the countervailing governance

01:14:31.739 --> 01:14:31.749
what are the countervailing governance
 

01:14:31.749 --> 01:14:34.890
what are the countervailing governance
structures in the face of certain kinds

01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:34.900
structures in the face of certain kinds
 

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.799
structures in the face of certain kinds
of capital interests that can be very

01:14:37.799 --> 01:14:37.809
of capital interests that can be very
 

01:14:37.809 --> 01:14:41.279
of capital interests that can be very
detrimental to the public good okay

01:14:41.279 --> 01:14:41.289
detrimental to the public good okay
 

01:14:41.289 --> 01:14:43.290
detrimental to the public good okay

I wanted to know since the tobacco
 

01:14:47.079 --> 01:14:51.779
I wanted to know since the tobacco
industry has been proved guilty so to

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:51.789
industry has been proved guilty so to
 

01:14:51.789 --> 01:14:55.589
industry has been proved guilty so to

01:14:55.589 --> 01:14:55.599
speak in the u.s. why isn't it a slam
 

01:14:55.599 --> 01:14:59.120

01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:04.830
get a lot of money it's a it's a really
good question and unfortunately even

01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:04.840
good question and unfortunately even
 

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.410
good question and unfortunately even
despite the success of the American

01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:07.420
despite the success of the American

tobacco suits most of the funds that

01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:09.820
tobacco suits most of the funds that
 

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.790
tobacco suits most of the funds that
were collected for example by the state

01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:11.800
were collected for example by the state
 

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.649
were collected for example by the state
attorneys generals in their cases when

01:15:13.649 --> 01:15:13.659
attorneys generals in their cases when
 

01:15:13.659 --> 01:15:17.149

the company settled went to other things
 

01:15:17.159 --> 01:15:19.890
the company settled went to other things
so rather than their some of that money

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:19.900
so rather than their some of that money
 

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:23.040
so rather than their some of that money
being dedicated to tobacco control it

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:23.050
being dedicated to tobacco control it
 

01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:26.069
being dedicated to tobacco control it
went to pay debt in North Carolina paid

01:15:26.069 --> 01:15:26.079

the maintenance of golf courses in some
 

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.620
the maintenance of golf courses in some
states and so it turned out to be

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:34.630
states and so it turned out to be
 

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:36.600
states and so it turned out to be
incredibly unfortunate two hundred and

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:36.610
incredibly unfortunate two hundred and
 

01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:38.609
incredibly unfortunate two hundred and
forty billion dollars collected by the

that now you know merely funds you know

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:45.170
that now you know merely funds you know
 

01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:47.260
that now you know merely funds you know
day-to-day operations in the state and

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:47.270
day-to-day operations in the state and
 

01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:49.120
day-to-day operations in the state and
you see the companies really understood

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:49.130
you see the companies really understood
 

01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:50.350
you see the companies really understood
that and they said we can get rid of

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:50.360
that and they said we can get rid of
 

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.600
that and they said we can get rid of
these suits the monies won't go to

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:52.610
these suits the monies won't go to
 

01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:55.420
these suits the monies won't go to
tobacco control so is again very

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:55.430
tobacco control so is again very
 

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:58.600
tobacco control so is again very
sophisticated but the question is what

01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:58.610
sophisticated but the question is what
 

01:15:58.610 --> 01:16:01.240
sophisticated but the question is what
where does liability fit in a global

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:01.250
where does liability fit in a global
 

01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:03.310
where does liability fit in a global
strategy and there are some countries

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:03.320
strategy and there are some countries
 

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.870
strategy and there are some countries
where it will actually be quite viable

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880
where it will actually be quite viable
 

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.370
where it will actually be quite viable
there's some Latin American countries

01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:06.380
there's some Latin American countries
 

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:09.510
there's some Latin American countries
where there are some very promising

01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520
where there are some very promising
 

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.580
where there are some very promising
litigations against the tobacco industry

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:12.590
litigations against the tobacco industry
 

01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:16.740

judicial structures and in the United

01:16:19.479 --> 01:16:19.489
judicial structures and in the United
 

01:16:19.489 --> 01:16:21.880
judicial structures and in the United
States we've always had a relatively low

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:21.890
States we've always had a relatively low
 

01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:25.810
States we've always had a relatively low
threshold for civil litigation which is

01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:25.820
threshold for civil litigation which is
 

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.580

one of the really great Democratic

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:27.590

aspects of the American court system is

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:29.810
aspects of the American court system is
 

01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:33.430
aspects of the American court system is
that if you had a legitimate complaint

01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440
that if you had a legitimate complaint
 

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.650
that if you had a legitimate complaint
you could bring it against a company at

01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:35.660
you could bring it against a company at
 

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.479
you could bring it against a company at
relatively low cost and get into the

01:16:37.479 --> 01:16:37.489
relatively low cost and get into the
 

01:16:37.489 --> 01:16:39.100
relatively low cost and get into the
courts there are other places like the

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:39.110
courts there are other places like the
 

01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:40.600
courts there are other places like the
United Kingdom where it's almost

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:40.610
United Kingdom where it's almost
 

01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:43.990
United Kingdom where it's almost
impossible to enter the courts on a tort

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000
impossible to enter the courts on a tort
 

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.570
impossible to enter the courts on a tort
so there are these individual structures

01:16:46.570 --> 01:16:46.580
so there are these individual structures
 

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:48.160
so there are these individual structures
and I think when we're doing comparative

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:48.170
and I think when we're doing comparative
 

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:50.470
and I think when we're doing comparative
global work you would really want to

01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480
global work you would really want to
 

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.570
global work you would really want to
understand better you know where are the

01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:52.580
understand better you know where are the
 

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.010
understand better you know where are the
places where there are opportunities for

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:54.020
places where there are opportunities for
 

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:56.890
places where there are opportunities for
tobacco liability litigation to succeed

01:16:56.890 --> 01:16:56.900
tobacco liability litigation to succeed
 

01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.229
tobacco liability litigation to succeed
where is that likely to be secondary

01:16:59.229 --> 01:16:59.239
where is that likely to be secondary
 

01:16:59.239 --> 01:17:02.260
where is that likely to be secondary
what kinds of legal remedies could you

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:02.270
what kinds of legal remedies could you
 

01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:05.410
what kinds of legal remedies could you
pursue in the face of a failure of torts

01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:05.420
pursue in the face of a failure of torts
 

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.390
pursue in the face of a failure of torts
and other things so it's a very good

01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400
and other things so it's a very good
 

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:10.510

question because how can the courts be

01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520
question because how can the courts be
 

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.880
question because how can the courts be

some very creative strategies and we may
 

01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:24.610
some very creative strategies and we may
see some of these strategies move to

this point yes it's a great question and

this point yes it's a great question and
 

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.359
this point yes it's a great question and
you know tobacco is one of those

01:19:27.359 --> 01:19:27.369
you know tobacco is one of those
 

01:19:27.369 --> 01:19:32.129
you know tobacco is one of those
problems that is so dynamic and multiple

01:19:32.129 --> 01:19:32.139

that the only types of policies that

really important and we know that some

know now that for some individuals it is
 

01:19:58.449 --> 01:20:01.919
know now that for some individuals it is
enormous ly difficult to quit so a quit

01:20:01.919 --> 01:20:01.929
enormous ly difficult to quit so a quit
 

01:20:01.929 --> 01:20:06.510
enormous ly difficult to quit so a quit
is not a constant phenomenon and we now

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520
is not a constant phenomenon and we now
 

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:07.680
is not a constant phenomenon and we now
understand that better for example

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:07.690
understand that better for example

we're bid psychiatric condition have
much more difficulty quitting people who

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:14.290
much more difficulty quitting people who
 

01:20:14.290 --> 01:20:16.770
much more difficulty quitting people who
are not in strong social networks have a

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:16.780
are not in strong social networks have a
 

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:19.530
are not in strong social networks have a
much greater difficulty quitting so how

much greater difficulty quitting so how
 

01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:21.209
much greater difficulty quitting so how
could we address those that particular

01:20:21.209 --> 01:20:21.219
could we address those that particular
 

01:20:21.219 --> 01:20:24.000
could we address those that particular

biomechanical and social interventions

01:20:34.979 --> 01:20:34.989
biomechanical and social interventions
 

01:20:34.989 --> 01:20:37.620
biomechanical and social interventions
and we have available for them now but

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:37.630
and we have available for them now but
 

01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:38.700
and we have available for them now but
there have been other issues for example

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:38.710
there have been other issues for example
 

01:20:38.710 --> 01:20:41.459
there have been other issues for example
we haven't third-party funded a lot of

01:20:41.459 --> 01:20:41.469
we haven't third-party funded a lot of
 

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:44.220
we haven't third-party funded a lot of
cessation services we know that some of

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:44.230
cessation services we know that some of
 

01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:45.720
cessation services we know that some of
the medications that are helpful are not

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:45.730
the medications that are helpful are not
 

01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:50.250
the medications that are helpful are not
helpful without therapy or counseling so

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:50.260
helpful without therapy or counseling so
 

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:53.209
helpful without therapy or counseling so
there's a lot that we could do to really

01:20:53.209 --> 01:20:53.219
there's a lot that we could do to really
 

01:20:53.219 --> 01:20:56.100
there's a lot that we could do to really
address these needs I was I was doing a

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:56.110
address these needs I was I was doing a
 

01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:59.010
address these needs I was I was doing a
little research on smoking in mental

01:20:59.010 --> 01:20:59.020
little research on smoking in mental
 

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.530
little research on smoking in mental
health hospitals it's really interesting

01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:01.540
health hospitals it's really interesting
 

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.840
health hospitals it's really interesting
in the 50s and 60s if you behave well

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:03.850
in the 50s and 60s if you behave well
 

01:21:03.850 --> 01:21:05.399
in the 50s and 60s if you behave well
they would give you cigarettes in these

01:21:05.399 --> 01:21:05.409
they would give you cigarettes in these
 

01:21:05.409 --> 01:21:07.229
they would give you cigarettes in these
hospitals so one of the rewards was

01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239
hospitals so one of the rewards was
 

01:21:07.239 --> 01:21:10.020
hospitals so one of the rewards was
actually tobacco and there was a lot of

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:10.030
actually tobacco and there was a lot of
 

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:13.700
actually tobacco and there was a lot of
concern what would happen if if certain

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:13.710
concern what would happen if if certain
 

01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:16.680
concern what would happen if if certain
mental health institutions went smoke

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:16.690
mental health institutions went smoke
 

01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:19.110
mental health institutions went smoke
free and they actually have and I think

01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120
free and they actually have and I think
 

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.030
free and they actually have and I think
it's a great thing because you really

01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040
it's a great thing because you really
 

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.100
it's a great thing because you really
don't want people exposed to you know

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:23.110
don't want people exposed to you know
 

01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:25.110
don't want people exposed to you know
who are suffering to be exposed to

01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120
who are suffering to be exposed to
 

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.629
who are suffering to be exposed to
additional risks and people can quit

01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:27.639
additional risks and people can quit
 

01:21:27.639 --> 01:21:29.010
additional risks and people can quit
under the right conditions with the

01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:29.020
under the right conditions with the
 

01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:31.939
under the right conditions with the
right support and some of that is

01:21:31.939 --> 01:21:31.949
right support and some of that is
 

01:21:31.949 --> 01:21:34.290
right support and some of that is
pharmacologic some of it is social and

01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:34.300
pharmacologic some of it is social and
 

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.390
pharmacologic some of it is social and
cultural so it really means putting

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400
cultural so it really means putting
 

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.060
cultural so it really means putting
those things together and we could do

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:39.070
those things together and we could do
 

01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:40.590
those things together and we could do
much better and we can and a lot of

01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:40.600
much better and we can and a lot of
 

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.600
much better and we can and a lot of
those things will be tremendously

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:42.610
those things will be tremendously
 

01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:44.939
those things will be tremendously
beneficial in the developing world as

01:21:44.939 --> 01:21:44.949
beneficial in the developing world as
 

01:21:44.949 --> 01:21:47.070
beneficial in the developing world as

thinking critically about historical
 

01:22:00.190 --> 01:22:01.620
thinking critically about historical
analogies and I was wondering if you

01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:01.630
analogies and I was wondering if you
 

01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:04.439
analogies and I was wondering if you
could elaborate on how we might think

01:22:04.439 --> 01:22:04.449
could elaborate on how we might think
 

01:22:04.449 --> 01:22:07.470
could elaborate on how we might think
critically about using the tobacco case

01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480
critically about using the tobacco case
 

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.790
critically about using the tobacco case

and applied to fast food as well as the
 

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.370
and applied to fast food as well as the
example you mentioned with PepsiCo and I

01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:14.380
example you mentioned with PepsiCo and I
 

01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:16.020
example you mentioned with PepsiCo and I
was wondering what your thoughts were as

01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:16.030
was wondering what your thoughts were as
 

01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:19.590
was wondering what your thoughts were as
well on the possibility that this might

01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600
well on the possibility that this might
 

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.410
well on the possibility that this might
actually be to some advantage to

01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:22.420
actually be to some advantage to
 

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:25.979

company's going forward in that they can
point to litigation on fast food as

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:29.410
point to litigation on fast food as
 

01:22:29.410 --> 01:22:31.890
point to litigation on fast food as
something that is sort of similar to

01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:31.900
something that is sort of similar to
 

01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:34.590
something that is sort of similar to
what they make their opponents out to be

01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600
what they make their opponents out to be
 

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:38.100
what they make their opponents out to be
as somebody whose response is you know

01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:38.110
as somebody whose response is you know
 

01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:39.810
as somebody whose response is you know
not merited as something that perhaps

01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:39.820
not merited as something that perhaps
 

01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:42.090
not merited as something that perhaps
trivializes the public health threat of

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:42.100
trivializes the public health threat of
 

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:45.360
trivializes the public health threat of
cigarettes yes it's a really good point

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:45.370
cigarettes yes it's a really good point
 

01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:48.240
cigarettes yes it's a really good point
because you know when people sued

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:48.250

McDonald's the industry the tobacco

01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:50.260
McDonald's the industry the tobacco
 

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:51.780
McDonald's the industry the tobacco
industry right away said this is what

01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:51.790
industry right away said this is what
 

01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:53.340

happens when you get into a litigious

01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:53.350
happens when you get into a litigious

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:55.390
society where there's always someone
 

01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:57.270
society where there's always someone
else to blame where no one's really

01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280
else to blame where no one's really

decision making and I get asked that

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:00.610
decision making and I get asked that
 

01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:02.400
decision making and I get asked that
question a lot like well am i saying

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:02.410
question a lot like well am i saying
 

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:03.479
question a lot like well am i saying
that people who smoke have no

01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:03.489
that people who smoke have no
 

01:23:03.489 --> 01:23:04.740
that people who smoke have no
responsibility and they're out of

01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:04.750
responsibility and they're out of
 

01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:07.410
responsibility and they're out of
control and I actually think the goal of

01:23:07.410 --> 01:23:07.420
control and I actually think the goal of
 

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:10.140
control and I actually think the goal of
health in a way is giving people as much

01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:10.150
health in a way is giving people as much
 

01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:15.060
health in a way is giving people as much
autonomy as possible over the control of

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:15.070
autonomy as possible over the control of
 

01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:16.860
autonomy as possible over the control of
their health but that would mean that

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:16.870
their health but that would mean that
 

01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:18.390
their health but that would mean that
you'd have to moderate some of these

01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400
you'd have to moderate some of these
 

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.880
you'd have to moderate some of these
industrial interests so it's a little

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:20.890
industrial interests so it's a little
 

01:23:20.890 --> 01:23:24.060
industrial interests so it's a little
bit of a misconception the best thing is

01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:24.070
bit of a misconception the best thing is
 

01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:26.280
bit of a misconception the best thing is
is if people can quit but what's the

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:26.290
is if people can quit but what's the
 

01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:28.290
is if people can quit but what's the
context in which they can quit it's a

01:23:28.290 --> 01:23:28.300
context in which they can quit it's a
 

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.270
context in which they can quit it's a
regulatory context that's the context in

01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:30.280
regulatory context that's the context in
 

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.280
regulatory context that's the context in
which the risks of the product are very

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:32.290
which the risks of the product are very
 

01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:33.689
which the risks of the product are very
clearly identified and which is

01:23:33.689 --> 01:23:33.699
clearly identified and which is
 

01:23:33.699 --> 01:23:36.540
clearly identified and which is

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:36.550
educational and communications ideas
 

01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:38.700
educational and communications ideas
I've been concerned about the story of

01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:38.710
I've been concerned about the story of
 

01:23:38.710 --> 01:23:41.280
I've been concerned about the story of
tobacco in this way like on the one hand

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:41.290
tobacco in this way like on the one hand
 

01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:42.810
tobacco in this way like on the one hand
I wanted to tell it and I thought if I

01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:42.820
I wanted to tell it and I thought if I
 

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.810
I wanted to tell it and I thought if I
told it clearly people would see these

01:23:45.810 --> 01:23:45.820
told it clearly people would see these
 

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:48.450
told it clearly people would see these
strategies more clearly when they were

01:23:48.450 --> 01:23:48.460
strategies more clearly when they were
 

01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:50.760
strategies more clearly when they were
applied by other industries I think one

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:50.770
applied by other industries I think one
 

01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:51.750
applied by other industries I think one
of the things we're finding right now is

01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760
of the things we're finding right now is
 

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.790
of the things we're finding right now is
a lot of industries are studying very

01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:53.800
a lot of industries are studying very
 

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:56.130
a lot of industries are studying very
closely what the tobacco industry did

01:23:56.130 --> 01:23:56.140
closely what the tobacco industry did
 

01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:58.470
closely what the tobacco industry did
and how they've been so successful and

01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480
and how they've been so successful and
 

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.660
and how they've been so successful and
they're studying in many ways you know

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:00.670

01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:02.070
they're studying in many ways you know
we should be looking for developing

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080
we should be looking for developing
 

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.640
we should be looking for developing
world global markets in places where the

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:05.650
world global markets in places where the
 

01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:07.520
world global markets in places where the
regulatory regimes are becoming more

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:07.530
regulatory regimes are becoming more
 

01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:11.070
regulatory regimes are becoming more
overt and aggressive in terms of sugared

01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:11.080
overt and aggressive in terms of sugared
 

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.830

beverages for example which are not sold

01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840
beverages for example which are not sold
 

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.740
beverages for example which are not sold
in many elementary schools anymore and

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:16.750
in many elementary schools anymore and
 

01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:18.780
in many elementary schools anymore and
it's been shown that they have an impact

01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:18.790
it's been shown that they have an impact
 

01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:23.220
it's been shown that they have an impact
on child and teen obesity we should be

01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:23.230
on child and teen obesity we should be
 

01:24:23.230 --> 01:24:25.380
on child and teen obesity we should be
looking to develop worlds where there

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:25.390
looking to develop worlds where there
 

01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:27.479
looking to develop worlds where there
are less regulatory regimes and we see

01:24:27.479 --> 01:24:27.489
are less regulatory regimes and we see
 

01:24:27.489 --> 01:24:30.300
are less regulatory regimes and we see
the movement of risk globally from more

01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:30.310
the movement of risk globally from more
 

01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:32.130
the movement of risk globally from more
highly regulated to less well regulated

01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:32.140
highly regulated to less well regulated
 

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:34.950
highly regulated to less well regulated
places so that's one thing the arguments

01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960
places so that's one thing the arguments
 

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.209
places so that's one thing the arguments
about choice and

01:24:36.209 --> 01:24:36.219
about choice and
 

01:24:36.219 --> 01:24:38.910
about choice and
freedom of individuals to make those

01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:38.920
freedom of individuals to make those
 

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.819
freedom of individuals to make those
determinations the arguments about

01:24:40.819 --> 01:24:40.829
determinations the arguments about
 

01:24:40.829 --> 01:24:43.020
determinations the arguments about
individual Nations should make those

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:43.030
individual Nations should make those
 

01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:44.729
individual Nations should make those
decisions instead of doing it

01:24:44.729 --> 01:24:44.739
decisions instead of doing it
 

01:24:44.739 --> 01:24:47.129
decisions instead of doing it
consensually across nations these are

01:24:47.129 --> 01:24:47.139
consensually across nations these are
 

01:24:47.139 --> 01:24:48.810
consensually across nations these are
all things that were very clearly

01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:48.820
all things that were very clearly
 

01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.479
all things that were very clearly
articulated in the tobacco industry

01:24:51.479 --> 01:24:51.489
articulated in the tobacco industry
 

01:24:51.489 --> 01:24:53.489

documents which became widely available

01:24:53.489 --> 01:24:53.499
documents which became widely available
 

01:24:53.499 --> 01:24:55.799
documents which became widely available
and unfortunately I wasn't the only one

01:24:55.799 --> 01:24:55.809
and unfortunately I wasn't the only one

using them

01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280
using them
 

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.129
using them
I think the industrial interests of

01:24:59.129 --> 01:24:59.139
I think the industrial interests of
 

01:24:59.139 --> 01:25:01.770
I think the industrial interests of
similar products that have risk have

01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:01.780
similar products that have risk have
 

01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:03.719
similar products that have risk have
been using them also so there's been an

01:25:03.719 --> 01:25:03.729
been using them also so there's been an
 

01:25:03.729 --> 01:25:05.100
been using them also so there's been an
emerging literature on sort of the

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:05.110
emerging literature on sort of the
 

01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:08.669
emerging literature on sort of the
tobacco PlayBook as it gets called and I

01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:08.679
tobacco PlayBook as it gets called and I
 

01:25:08.679 --> 01:25:12.120
tobacco PlayBook as it gets called and I
think many people admire how effectively

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:12.130
think many people admire how effectively
 

01:25:12.130 --> 01:25:15.540
think many people admire how effectively
the tobacco industry responded to what

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:15.550
the tobacco industry responded to what
 

01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:17.879
the tobacco industry responded to what
was perceived in the 50s as a potential

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:17.889
was perceived in the 50s as a potential
 

01:25:17.889 --> 01:25:20.549
was perceived in the 50s as a potential
knockout blow to the industry and how

knockout blow to the industry and how
they were able to sustain themselves and

they were able to sustain themselves and

it is you know I mean I have to I have
 

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.899
it is you know I mean I have to I have
to say it's a remarkable if you know

to say it's a remarkable if you know
 

01:25:39.909 --> 01:25:42.239

terribly sobering story and I think that

01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:42.249
terribly sobering story and I think that
 

01:25:42.249 --> 01:25:43.830
terribly sobering story and I think that
other industries will learn from it so

01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840
other industries will learn from it so
 

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.560
other industries will learn from it so
you know those of us who are advocates

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:46.570
you know those of us who are advocates
 

01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:47.939
you know those of us who are advocates
for public health have to be more

01:25:47.939 --> 01:25:47.949
for public health have to be more
 

01:25:47.949 --> 01:25:51.560
for public health have to be more
aggressive creative we have to rethink

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:51.570
aggressive creative we have to rethink
 

01:25:51.570 --> 01:25:55.259
aggressive creative we have to rethink
policies and and strategies and I think

01:25:55.259 --> 01:25:55.269
policies and and strategies and I think
 

01:25:55.269 --> 01:25:58.319
policies and and strategies and I think
historians among other fields will have

01:25:58.319 --> 01:25:58.329
historians among other fields will have
 

01:25:58.329 --> 01:26:01.049
historians among other fields will have
a lot to say about understanding how

01:26:01.049 --> 01:26:01.059
a lot to say about understanding how
 

01:26:01.059 --> 01:26:04.410
a lot to say about understanding how
these how these structures got to be and

01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:04.420
these how these structures got to be and
 

01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:06.120
these how these structures got to be and
how important they are for the overall

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:06.130
how important they are for the overall
 

01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:09.120
how important they are for the overall
burden of disease so I know that doesn't

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:09.130
burden of disease so I know that doesn't
 

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:10.350
burden of disease so I know that doesn't
completely answer your question but

01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:10.360
completely answer your question but
 

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.219
completely answer your question but
please hey thank you for your speech and

01:26:14.219 --> 01:26:14.229
please hey thank you for your speech and
 

01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:16.410
please hey thank you for your speech and
I'm actually not sure whether you are

01:26:16.410 --> 01:26:16.420
I'm actually not sure whether you are
 

01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.330
I'm actually not sure whether you are
the right person for me to ask this

01:26:18.330 --> 01:26:18.340
the right person for me to ask this
 

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.669
the right person for me to ask this
question but I just wanted to have a try

01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:20.679
question but I just wanted to have a try
 

01:26:20.679 --> 01:26:23.069
question but I just wanted to have a try
I was thinking maybe it would be

01:26:23.069 --> 01:26:23.079
I was thinking maybe it would be
 

01:26:23.079 --> 01:26:26.100
I was thinking maybe it would be
effective policy for Chinese government

01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:26.110
effective policy for Chinese government
 

01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:29.700
effective policy for Chinese government
to tie up

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:29.710
 

01:26:29.710 --> 01:26:33.209
cigarette smoking with deduction in

01:26:33.209 --> 01:26:33.219
cigarette smoking with deduction in
 

01:26:33.219 --> 01:26:37.469
cigarette smoking with deduction in
their medical bills so if they smoke

01:26:37.469 --> 01:26:37.479
their medical bills so if they smoke
 

01:26:37.479 --> 01:26:40.589
their medical bills so if they smoke
they will not get government subsidy on

01:26:40.589 --> 01:26:40.599
they will not get government subsidy on
 

01:26:40.599 --> 01:26:43.529
they will not get government subsidy on
the medical bill so my question is I

01:26:43.529 --> 01:26:43.539
the medical bill so my question is I
 

01:26:43.539 --> 01:26:46.729
the medical bill so my question is I
wanted to know whether the current

01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:46.739
wanted to know whether the current
 

01:26:46.739 --> 01:26:48.620
wanted to know whether the current
medicine would take

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:48.630
medicine would take
 

01:26:48.630 --> 01:26:53.100
medicine would take
technology is a very sensitive to early

01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:53.110
technology is a very sensitive to early
 

01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:57.240
technology is a very sensitive to early
stage smoking because yeah I see those

01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:57.250
stage smoking because yeah I see those
 

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:59.880
stage smoking because yeah I see those
pictures away it's very serious you can

01:26:59.880 --> 01:26:59.890
pictures away it's very serious you can
 

01:26:59.890 --> 01:27:03.060
pictures away it's very serious you can
you can see the lawns okay but I wonder

01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:03.070
you can see the lawns okay but I wonder
 

01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:05.280
you can see the lawns okay but I wonder
whether they can detect the wound needs

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:05.290
whether they can detect the wound needs
 

01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:08.880
whether they can detect the wound needs
about in an earlier stage yes it's

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:08.890
about in an earlier stage yes it's
 

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:11.490
about in an earlier stage yes it's
getting easier and better to detect lung

01:27:11.490 --> 01:27:11.500
getting easier and better to detect lung
 

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.460
getting easier and better to detect lung
cancer for example sooner

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:14.470
cancer for example sooner
 

01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:18.690
cancer for example sooner
there are biochemical assays that can

01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:18.700
there are biochemical assays that can
 

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:21.450
there are biochemical assays that can
show who's smoking and who's not but I

01:27:21.450 --> 01:27:21.460
show who's smoking and who's not but I
 

01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:22.980
show who's smoking and who's not but I
have to say my own perspective has been

01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:22.990
have to say my own perspective has been
 

01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:25.860
have to say my own perspective has been
not to restrict health services for

01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:25.870
not to restrict health services for
 

01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:27.990
not to restrict health services for
smokers and that's been a prominent

01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000
smokers and that's been a prominent
 

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.970
smokers and that's been a prominent
argument in the United States it sort of

01:27:29.970 --> 01:27:29.980
argument in the United States it sort of
 

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:33.210
argument in the United States it sort of
says because it buys into the idea that

01:27:33.210 --> 01:27:33.220
says because it buys into the idea that
 

01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:35.610
says because it buys into the idea that
this was an individual risk and

01:27:35.610 --> 01:27:35.620
this was an individual risk and
 

01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:37.950
this was an individual risk and
therefore the smoker should be

01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:37.960
therefore the smoker should be
 

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:42.000
therefore the smoker should be
responsible for what he or she did in

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:42.010
responsible for what he or she did in
 

01:27:42.010 --> 01:27:44.790
responsible for what he or she did in
terms of smoking and the way I see

01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800
terms of smoking and the way I see
 

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.920
terms of smoking and the way I see
smoking is that it's a behavior that's

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:46.930
smoking is that it's a behavior that's
 

01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:50.250
smoking is that it's a behavior that's
been motivated by the companies and the

01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:50.260
been motivated by the companies and the
 

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:53.670
been motivated by the companies and the
best way of demotivating it is

01:27:53.670 --> 01:27:53.680
best way of demotivating it is
 

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:57.270
best way of demotivating it is
regulating the industry as opposed to

01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280
regulating the industry as opposed to
 

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.180
regulating the industry as opposed to
potentially punishing smokers and the

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:00.190
potentially punishing smokers and the
 

01:28:00.190 --> 01:28:02.490
potentially punishing smokers and the
reason I say that is that some people

01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:02.500
reason I say that is that some people
 

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.170
reason I say that is that some people
and I'm sure this is true in China are

01:28:04.170 --> 01:28:04.180
and I'm sure this is true in China are
 

01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:07.200
and I'm sure this is true in China are
much more vulnerable to become smokers

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:07.210
much more vulnerable to become smokers
 

01:28:07.210 --> 01:28:09.240
much more vulnerable to become smokers

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:44.130
individual smokers when it is an
 

01:35:44.130 --> 01:35:48.230
individual smokers when it is an
addictive problem and the industry is so

01:35:48.230 --> 01:35:48.240
addictive problem and the industry is so
 

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.850
addictive problem and the industry is so
involved with promoting this unhealthy

01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860
involved with promoting this unhealthy
 

01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:52.250
involved with promoting this unhealthy
activity so I'm wondering just if you

01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:52.260
activity so I'm wondering just if you
 

01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:54.170
activity so I'm wondering just if you
could kind of expound upon your I think

01:35:54.170 --> 01:35:54.180
could kind of expound upon your I think
 

01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:56.570
could kind of expound upon your I think
will be used in terms of ways what is

01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580
will be used in terms of ways what is
 

01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:59.750
will be used in terms of ways what is
appropriate and given given the history

01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760
appropriate and given given the history
 

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.420
appropriate and given given the history
of the role of industry yeah I mean I

01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:02.430
of the role of industry yeah I mean I
 

01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:04.220
of the role of industry yeah I mean I
think that there's a progression to

01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:04.230
think that there's a progression to
 

01:36:04.230 --> 01:36:05.840
think that there's a progression to
these things so for example we could

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:05.850
these things so for example we could
 

01:36:05.850 --> 01:36:08.390
these things so for example we could
take outdoor bands as just one example

01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400
take outdoor bands as just one example
 

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.220
take outdoor bands as just one example

bands or bands on Jones Beach or
something like that but I'm not adverse

01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:14.550
something like that but I'm not adverse
 

01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:16.820
something like that but I'm not adverse
to that now and you know I was walking

01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:16.830
to that now and you know I was walking
 

01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:18.500
to that now and you know I was walking
through the Columbia campus you know

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:18.510

what would be the implications of that
 

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:32.720
what would be the implications of that
it's a very interesting kind of thought

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:32.730
it's a very interesting kind of thought
 

01:36:32.730 --> 01:36:34.610

that their their public choice arguments

01:38:20.819 --> 01:38:20.829
that their their public choice arguments
 

01:38:20.829 --> 01:38:22.979
that their their public choice arguments
were very powerful and they said we're

01:38:22.979 --> 01:38:22.989
were very powerful and they said we're
 

01:38:22.989 --> 01:38:25.169
were very powerful and they said we're
really in danger on the side stream

01:38:25.169 --> 01:38:25.179

even if it has an edge of stigma it's
something smokers should understand and

01:38:43.389 --> 01:38:46.260
it's something that you know the public
should have signals about so I'm not

cigarettes or something like that and

01:39:16.649 --> 01:39:16.659
cigarettes or something like that and
 

01:39:16.659 --> 01:39:19.310
cigarettes or something like that and
recent years some things like the

01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320
recent years some things like the
 

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.790
recent years some things like the
electronic cigarettes

01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800
electronic cigarettes
 

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:23.430
electronic cigarettes
have merged as wondering what's your

01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440
have merged as wondering what's your
 

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:25.650
have merged as wondering what's your
opinion on the strength of the existing

01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:25.660
opinion on the strength of the existing
 

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:27.810
opinion on the strength of the existing
framework to prevent I guess the spread

01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:27.820
framework to prevent I guess the spread
 

01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:31.080
framework to prevent I guess the spread
of these products yeah it's a it's a

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:31.090
of these products yeah it's a it's a
 

01:39:31.090 --> 01:39:33.480
of these products yeah it's a it's a
very good and kind of sad question

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:33.490
very good and kind of sad question
 

01:39:33.490 --> 01:39:35.070
very good and kind of sad question
because I think well part of what I'm

01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:35.080
because I think well part of what I'm
 

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.170
because I think well part of what I'm
suggesting is that we've really made

01:39:37.170 --> 01:39:37.180
suggesting is that we've really made
 

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:39.240
suggesting is that we've really made
some substantial public health progress

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:39.250
some substantial public health progress
 

01:39:39.250 --> 01:39:41.880
some substantial public health progress
and we've seen you know in a relatively

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:41.890
and we've seen you know in a relatively
 

01:39:41.890 --> 01:39:45.330
and we've seen you know in a relatively
well educated and affluent societies the

01:39:45.330 --> 01:39:45.340
well educated and affluent societies the
 

01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:47.940
well educated and affluent societies the
ability to significantly reduce smoking

01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:47.950
ability to significantly reduce smoking
 

01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:50.070
ability to significantly reduce smoking
and I see that as the positive side and

01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080
and I see that as the positive side and
 

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.230
and I see that as the positive side and
then I think the negative side is very

01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:52.240
then I think the negative side is very
 

01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:54.930
then I think the negative side is very
significant that the companies have

01:39:54.930 --> 01:39:54.940
significant that the companies have
 

01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:57.630
significant that the companies have
understood that those markets remain

01:39:57.630 --> 01:39:57.640
understood that those markets remain
 

01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:00.120
understood that those markets remain
significant if compromised and that they

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:00.130
significant if compromised and that they
 

01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:02.840
significant if compromised and that they
can move to other more vulnerable

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:02.850
can move to other more vulnerable
 

01:40:02.850 --> 01:40:07.170
can move to other more vulnerable
markets very successfully and it will

01:40:07.170 --> 01:40:07.180
markets very successfully and it will
 

01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:09.360
markets very successfully and it will
involve strategies that we just haven't

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:09.370
involve strategies that we just haven't
 

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:13.290
involve strategies that we just haven't
imagined yet and it it really comes into

01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:13.300
imagined yet and it it really comes into
 

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:15.120
imagined yet and it it really comes into
question you know the character of

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:15.130
question you know the character of
 

01:40:15.130 --> 01:40:18.810
question you know the character of
markets and health and trade and those

01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:18.820
markets and health and trade and those
 

01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:20.940
markets and health and trade and those
are very difficult issues and I was

01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:20.950
are very difficult issues and I was
 

01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:22.440
are very difficult issues and I was
thinking about my talk today and sort of

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:22.450
thinking about my talk today and sort of
 

01:40:22.450 --> 01:40:25.710
thinking about my talk today and sort of
how aggressive it is about industry

01:40:25.710 --> 01:40:25.720
how aggressive it is about industry
 

01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:29.430
how aggressive it is about industry
interests that spread risks but that is

01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440
interests that spread risks but that is
 

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.410
interests that spread risks but that is
going to be the contested territory of

01:40:31.410 --> 01:40:31.420
going to be the contested territory of
 

01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:34.440
going to be the contested territory of
public health and population health in

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:34.450
public health and population health in
 

01:40:34.450 --> 01:40:37.680
public health and population health in
the 21st century it's around generic

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:37.690
the 21st century it's around generic
 

01:40:37.690 --> 01:40:40.530
the 21st century it's around generic
drugs and the pharmaceutical industries

01:40:40.530 --> 01:40:40.540
drugs and the pharmaceutical industries
 

01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:42.840
drugs and the pharmaceutical industries
it's about essential medications it's

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:42.850
it's about essential medications it's
 

01:40:42.850 --> 01:40:45.930
it's about essential medications it's
about risks like sugared beverages or

01:40:45.930 --> 01:40:45.940
about risks like sugared beverages or
 

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:49.320
about risks like sugared beverages or
alcoholic beverages it's about many

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:49.330
alcoholic beverages it's about many
 

01:40:49.330 --> 01:40:51.660
alcoholic beverages it's about many
things and so we're going to need more

01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:51.670
things and so we're going to need more
 

01:40:51.670 --> 01:40:54.000
things and so we're going to need more
robust governance and regulatory

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:54.010
robust governance and regulatory
 

01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.430
robust governance and regulatory
structures if we really want to support

01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:56.440
structures if we really want to support
 

01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:59.430
structures if we really want to support
health through societies and I think

01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440
health through societies and I think
 

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:01.860
health through societies and I think
we're at a relatively there's a lot that

01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:01.870
we're at a relatively there's a lot that
 

01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:04.010
we're at a relatively there's a lot that
we've learned but we're at a relatively

01:41:04.010 --> 01:41:04.020
we've learned but we're at a relatively
 

01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:06.420
we've learned but we're at a relatively
preliminary stage in building those

01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:06.430
preliminary stage in building those
 

01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:09.270
preliminary stage in building those
kinds of structures and that's part of

01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280
kinds of structures and that's part of
 

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.610
kinds of structures and that's part of
