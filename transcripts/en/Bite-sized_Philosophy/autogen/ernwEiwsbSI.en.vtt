little thing that you're unpacking that
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.410
little thing that you're unpacking that
package well the entire power dynamic

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420
package well the entire power dynamic
 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.700

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
world is inside that dispute and you
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.939
world is inside that dispute and you
might find that part of the reason that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949

because her grandmother was beat by her
grandfather and that's playing a role in

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320
grandfather and that's playing a role in
 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.810
grandfather and that's playing a role in
it played a role in determining her

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
it played a role in determining her
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.700
it played a role in determining her
unconscious expectations and that's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
unconscious expectations and that's
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.039
unconscious expectations and that's
pathologizing one of the day to day

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
pathologizing one of the day to day
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.140
pathologizing one of the day to day
rituals in the house and if you're gonna

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150
rituals in the house and if you're gonna
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940
rituals in the house and if you're gonna
unpack that you're gonna have to unpack

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
unpack that you're gonna have to unpack
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.480
unpack that you're gonna have to unpack
all of that into you take a little

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
all of that into you take a little
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.010
all of that into you take a little
monster and you decompose it you find

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
monster and you decompose it you find
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.679
monster and you decompose it you find
out it's a Hydra it's got 50 heads and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689
out it's a Hydra it's got 50 heads and
 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.910
out it's a Hydra it's got 50 heads and
then you have to work through every

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
then you have to work through every
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.830
then you have to work through every
single one of those it's really really

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
single one of those it's really really
 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320
single one of those it's really really
difficult and so it's a container that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
difficult and so it's a container that
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.030
difficult and so it's a container that
contains everything but the thing is if

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040
contains everything but the thing is if
 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.010
contains everything but the thing is if
you unpack it successfully let's say and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
you unpack it successfully let's say and
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.090
you unpack it successfully let's say and
you deal with it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
you deal with it
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.969
you deal with it
you go see eight a consensus then all of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979
you go see eight a consensus then all of
 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.530
you go see eight a consensus then all of
a sudden you get you get peace say

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
a sudden you get you get peace say
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.120
a sudden you get you get peace say
around your mealtimes which is a major

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
around your mealtimes which is a major
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.160
around your mealtimes which is a major
accomplishment man because you have to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
accomplishment man because you have to
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.990
accomplishment man because you have to
eat three times a day and it's the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
eat three times a day and it's the
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.399
eat three times a day and it's the
center of the household and all of that

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
center of the household and all of that
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.109
center of the household and all of that
so but the thing is is that often when

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
so but the thing is is that often when
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.510
so but the thing is is that often when
you're especially in the context of an

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
you're especially in the context of an
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.789
you're especially in the context of an
intimate relationship things will emerge

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
intimate relationship things will emerge
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.950
intimate relationship things will emerge
that produced discontinuities and the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
that produced discontinuities and the
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.270
that produced discontinuities and the
question is what should your attitude

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
question is what should your attitude
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.459
question is what should your attitude
towards that discontinuity be well you

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
towards that discontinuity be well you
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.990
towards that discontinuity be well you
can punish the person for manifesting

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
can punish the person for manifesting
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.539
can punish the person for manifesting
the discontinuity that's the tyrannical

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
the discontinuity that's the tyrannical
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.490
the discontinuity that's the tyrannical
aspect or you can let it take the whole

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500
aspect or you can let it take the whole
 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.709
aspect or you can let it take the whole
thing apart and that will happen I mean

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719
thing apart and that will happen I mean
 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.600
thing apart and that will happen I mean
that's often how relationships end is

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
that's often how relationships end is
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.990
that's often how relationships end is
that a discontinuity emerges and people

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
that a discontinuity emerges and people
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.520
that a discontinuity emerges and people
get into it and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
get into it and
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.920
get into it and
things go sideways so badly that the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
things go sideways so badly that the
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.240
things go sideways so badly that the
whole relationship descends into chaos

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250
whole relationship descends into chaos
 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.870
whole relationship descends into chaos
and people bail out of it and so it so

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880
and people bail out of it and so it so
 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.310
and people bail out of it and so it so
it's no wonder that people want to

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320
it's no wonder that people want to
 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.100
it's no wonder that people want to
ignore it and it's also no wonder that

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
ignore it and it's also no wonder that
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.170
ignore it and it's also no wonder that
they want to tyrannize it it's like quit

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180
they want to tyrannize it it's like quit
 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.020
they want to tyrannize it it's like quit
bothering me with that well possibly but

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030
bothering me with that well possibly but
 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.870
bothering me with that well possibly but
probably not and also if my attitude

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880
probably not and also if my attitude
 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.699
probably not and also if my attitude
towards you is quit bothering me with

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709
towards you is quit bothering me with
 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.100
towards you is quit bothering me with
that your attitude towards me when I

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110
that your attitude towards me when I
 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.690
that your attitude towards me when I
have the same sort of problem in Reverse

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700
have the same sort of problem in Reverse
 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.150
have the same sort of problem in Reverse
is going to be exactly the same and so

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160
is going to be exactly the same and so
 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.630
is going to be exactly the same and so
we're not going to get anywhere with it
