00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.350
All right. Let's take a look at the code

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.550
here. So first we create a pandas data frame

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.880
called hr_year, that reads in the hr_year.csv file. Then

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.420
we just print ggplot where we say that our

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.782
data source is going to be the hr_year data

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.920
frame. And the variables that we want to plot are

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.920
year ID and home runs. Then we add geom

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.510
points, with the color red. Then we add geom

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.850
lines to the color red and then let's add some

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.310
labels so our plot is able to interpret. So we'll title

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.990
it total home runs by year. With the x label year

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.780
and the y label home runs. We just print this and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.690
we'll generate our chart. Now let's see what this produces.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.560
Here's the plot that this generates. We see that we have

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.850
a bunch of points that are red, where we indicate the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.690
number of home runs hit every year. They're connected by red

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.630
lines, which gives us some sense of the rate of

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.270
change. We have years on the X axis. Home runs on

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.640
the Y axis. We have the labels that we put in.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.820
And also the title that we told our plot to show.
