00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
really what we're talking about is the
relationship between information and

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.620
energy and in fact we'll talk about the
relationship between information and

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.889
entropy so just let me stress if you're
thinking of getting all of

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.460
thermodynamics in the next five minutes
it's not going to happen so we're going

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.570
to focus on this one

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.689
one idea which has really fascinated
physicists for, well let's see, since

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.789
'round about 1860 and it comes up time and
time and time again which is the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.580
relationship between heat, and energy,
entropy, and in particular, information.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.240
We're going to think of it in terms of
bits of information because you could

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.090
have a very complex stored you could
have a very as you say fleeting thought

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.480
you could have a snapshot I don't know
you could see an image appear in front

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.629
of you and it's gone the next minute and we
could think about that image in terms of

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.480
the number of bits of information. Now
I'd love to be able to say that our

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.350
knowledge of the brain is such that we
can understand all stored formation

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.010
processes that were nowhere near
understanding just how that happens but

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.239
we can think about it in terms of bits
of information and that's that's really

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.469
where I'm going with this

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.769
I've gotta stress as well that there has
been a couple of videos and it's quite a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.439
lot of discussion online which is
actually one of the reasons we're doing

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.250
this video about you know for example
how much does the internet weigh? And that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.570
was a video that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.130
oh I believe Vsauce did number of years
ago this is a different concept of very

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.490
different concept because what Michael
Vsauce did was it was basically think

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.049
about electrons electrons the massive
electrons charge and how much charge

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.229
electronic charge you need to store bits
of information what we're going to talk

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.320
about is much more fundamental much more
subtle

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.380
what's more conceptually challenging and
therefore i would argue much more fun

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.680
i'm going to start with as it says here
one of the most heavily quoted passages

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.120
in physics and this is from Maxwell and
its back in the eighteen sixties and

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.820
he's talking about something which is
known as the Maxwell's demon is our

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.630
demon will get back to our attention on-- let's lift her veil. "If we can conceive of a

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.860
being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.270
course, such a being, whose  attributes are as essentially finite as our own, would be

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.770
will be able to do what is at present impossible to us." And I'm gonna explain

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.070
what exactly what that means original
version of Maxwell's demon we got

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.150
molecules moving around in a box so
they've got some energy and that energy

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.160
is coming from the just the heat energy
from the environment we have a partition

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:30.580
in the box and so what we're going to do
now is the demon and here's a demon is

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.580
going to follow the trajectories of the
molecules and what she's going to do is

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.330
if she has a fast-growing molecule which
is moving in this direction

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.230
she's going to open the thing open that
the partition opened the gate and let it

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.820
through only the fast ones what we're
doing here is we're dividing up the Fast

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.989
and Slow molecules let's say this one
for example is zipping around so it's

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.250
coming towards that the get she sees
this one zipping man and it's going very

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.940
fast much faster than the average
selected throw this one's moving more

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.570
slowly

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.780
so this one doesn't get through and on
this side okay it's the opposite way

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.400
around so what's happening is that she's
going to let the slow-moving one's true

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.180
so this is quite slow approaching here
this one goes for was the first one she

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.360
keeps on this side so over time what
happens of course is that we end up with

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.440
all the molecules over here these are
all the speed demons that have made a

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.829
throw on this side you end up with a
slow cultures and what's wrong with that

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.299
there's an awful lot wrong with that
because what we've done is we've

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.620
generated our temperature difference
without putting any working because what

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.959
when this we assume and maxwell made the
assumption that when you lift this

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.520
partition this is frictionless you can
just lift this without doing any work so

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.710
it's all entirely smooth and this can
come up without doing any

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.850
and the demon wasn't doing any work what
we've done is we've broken the second

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.670
law of thermodynamics because over here
we sorted the molecules into well... we

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.840
sorted the molecules in both partitions
in terms of their speeds. Second law of

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.720
thermodynamics tells us that really what
that's what wants to happen is you

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.460
randomize.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.650
The even simpler version of this which
is a another type of demon you don't

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.720
even think about the speeds

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.980
what you going to do is approaching this
way you let it through you let it

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.150
through you let it through you let it
through let it through and what you end

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.860
up with is a pressure difference and
major pressure difference and now here's

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.950
another problem because now we have a
pressure difference in principle of

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.730
pressure difference can do work and yet
the way an engine works is we have a

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.420
temperature gradient here we have no
temperature gradient remember this is

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.270
just couple to one big temperature bath
outside

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.740
we've designed a gradient we've managed
to put a gradient in the system without

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.520
effectively doing any work and now we
can get workout we're getting a free

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.770
deal will get no you know we're getting
a free lunch and that is a major problem

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.040
in this Court's so many headaches and
still in some regards causes headaches

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.380
that's a very very good--

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.380
Ah, no, that's a very good
point, but the history of physics and the

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.840
history philosophy is riddled with
Gedanken experiments. You think about

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.690
quantum mechanics you think about
relativity. Those Gedanken and those

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.900
thought experiments are very very
important you can just dismiss this

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.890
until this is never going to happen in
fact you can never have a purely you

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.390
know frictionless any type of frictional
system or there are many issues here in

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.600
terms of setting this up experimental
although it has been setup experimental

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.840
version of it has recently been setup
experimentally but those Gedanken

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.900
experiment are really important because
they drive your thinking and one

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.120
particular when the thing is you gotta
stand back from this angle

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.090
there's a problem here so where where is
the problem and ultimately took a long

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.330
time and a lot of beds and a lot of
controversy

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.950
it's the information that's stored by
the demon that's that's that's the key

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.040
thing

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.920
that means that there's a direct link
between information and as we can see

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.890
we've set up a pressure difference here
or we can set up a temperature gradient

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.130
of this as we saw in terms of the
molecules which means the direct link

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.850
link link between what this demon knows
and what's going on physically and we've

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.140
got to think about what the energy cost
of the information of what this demon

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.580
knows that's the key thing is what's the
energy costs and I'm afraid really it's

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.660
not just the energy costs it's actually
we've got to think about entropy and so

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.320
that's ever really we've tried answering
number times we find sixty symbols

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.040
let's have a really simple explanation
of entropy

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.130
here's a low entropy state all the
molecules and outside of the box that's

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.030
a very low entropy state that's not you
know what's going to happen is if you've

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.300
got some milk on the top of your coffee
about a droplet of cream or whatever or

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.560
milk on the top of your coffee

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.750
it spreads out it diffuses this is a low
entropy state that's not a natural state

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.590
of affairs particularly when you got
thermal energy pouring in

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.480
what's going to happen is that they're
going to randomize that's a high entropy

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.550
state now here's a very interesting
aspect of this if we've got all the

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:22.100
molecules on there and we put a
partition in bingo were very very happy

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.120
because those molecules can knock this
partition that and we can see we can

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.100
extract work if however we've got a high
entropy state and we work our petition

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:36.320
in the middle or valve this is just
going to go by and back and forth and

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.040
it's not going to go anywhere that's a
key difference between a high and a low

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.970
entropy state in terms of the amount of
work we can generate there's a guy

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.290
called saleyard who is really famous
because he came up with nuclear chain

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:53.660
reactions he was fascinated by Maxwell's
demon and like a very good physicist

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.160
like all good physicists do he took he
went down the spherical Cairo route

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.890
Thank let's simplify this what's the
simplest possible thing we can have one

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.090
molecule that's make it even simpler
let's not let it move in three

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.780
dimensions or two dimensions let's just
make it move in one dimension and what's

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.160
very interesting now is that you can
imagine having a piston that's chances

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.140
to a piston right so now what we have is
a piston and we've got this molecule in

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.030
the Box here's is the key thing if we
don't know the position of the molecule

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.020
in the box what's bouncing around what
it'll do is it'll keep jumping off that

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.620
something of that moving that the piston
forward as long as the piston doesn't

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.540
fall over or it could be in this side of
the box and it'll drive it back but if

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:44.330
we have no idea where the position of
the ball is on on average it's going to

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.230
move that one is going to move that way
if and this is this is sea Lords key

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.720
inside if however we bring our demon
back in who's now a slightly stupid or

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.720
demon in fact she doesn't really have to
do anything

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:03.079
other than see what's at work out which
side of the box the particles on the

00:09:03.079 --> 00:09:07.670
molecules on doesn't have to worry about
the velocity of the molecule and indeed

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.899
there was one of them so i think even i
could probably handle one molecule let's

00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:16.639
say they the molecules here at one
instance of time now if the demon knows

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:21.769
that what you can do and she can insert
this piston on either side of the box

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:24.589
that's important you can insert the
piston either side of the box just to

00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:27.829
make the station if the markets over
here and she knows she can insert the

00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:31.069
piston here and here's the key thing
remember this is frictionless there's no

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:35.209
molecules here there's only one molecule
no work no work no work no work no work

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:40.009
comes up here molecule starts bouncing
back and start pushing it back you're

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:44.810
extracting work for you know again you
get a free lunch but it all relies on

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:51.050
the information here and all realize if
we don't know which side of the box the

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.019
molecule is on we're not going to be
able to extract this work reliably

00:09:54.019 --> 00:09:59.360
constructed just on Tuesday see campbell
but the problem is that we don't know

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.600
what sights on it is likely to go that
way as it is to go that with so and

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.300
that's in terms of different direct know
but the important thing is very good .

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.680
pretty but the important thing is to the
balls here the molecules here if we now

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.500
start pushing this piston forward it

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.209
we've got an issue because the the
molecule is is acting against the piston

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:25.310
as well so we're not getting this free
lunch anymore so it's important the key

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:30.290
aspect of this is known which side of
the container the molecule is actually

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.810
on and of course is sixty symbols

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.990
I'm simplified before the comments
section starts filling up

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.500
I'm simplifying this a great deal

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.140
yeah let me go to the chest there's this
clear link between entropy and

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.350
information and knowledge of the system
in fact many now we'll catch any of you

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:56.360
explain entropy in terms of missing
information and it's a whole area of

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.710
entropy which is different from going to
stress that but related to

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:05.030
thermodynamics and thermal processes in
communication and computers and

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.210
information technology and everything
around us is something called Shannon

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:14.390
entropy as well again these incredibly
close links with with information i did

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.380
say that cut the cheese

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.460
so how does that connect with thoughts
very clever guy who called landowner who

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.120
back in the sixties was again thinking
of this problem and he worked out

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.720
precisely the energy associated with one
bit of information from this model from

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.490
this type of model because here we've
got one bit of information which is

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:40.070
which side of the box is the particle on
that's a bit of information is it on the

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.700
left or isn't the right that's that's
our one bit of information and from the

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.080
thermodynamics of this modern you can
connect that bit of information to the

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:54.200
to the the energy and so if we worked
out going to me right one equation in

00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:00.590
the largest one let's put it energy and
we'll say it one bit this is something

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.710
called Boltzmann's constant right
Boltzmann's constant is a pretty small

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:04.340
number

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.630
all you need to worry about is
boltzmann's constant is the conversion

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.200
factor is like it's like having two
different currencies and you're

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.540
converting between this is the
conversion rate and what it does is it

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.890
converts from temperature to energy
units are really really important for

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:25.340
physicists this doesn't have units so
this is going to have units energy

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.930
k translates temperature to energy
that's that's the formula and it's

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:37.040
really straightforward for one bit of
information now if we worked out at in

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.360
terms of what we have at room
temperature say turns out that that is

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:47.570
something like 3 x 10 to the minus 21
jewels

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.440
that's the energy associated with one
bit of information about mars bar for

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.490
lunch if we look in the back here to my
eyesight's get

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.750
anybody mind of the whole time so if we
work in proper units like physicists do

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.470
which are jewels not this calorie
nonsense we find that it's actually

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:11.920
nearly a magnitude it's 960 killer Jews
that's 960 x 10 to the 3 this is we're

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:18.820
going to do the equal sign is three x 10
to the minus 21 jewels the amount of

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:27.279
energy you get from this E(mars bar) is
about one megajoule which is 1 by 10 to

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:33.850
the 6 Jules you can see that there were
an awful lot of those in one of those

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.850
huge huge amount in one of those

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.310
so then we come to the really tricky
question which are physicists is really

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:48.370
not equipped to address which is what is
a thought so for me, as a physicist

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.839
thoughts just information

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:54.040
let's say we're going to assume i don't
know maybe you thinking pictures like I

00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:00.610
do so let's say this picture that you're
currently looking at that's 1920 x 1080

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:06.970
pixels and we're going to assume that
each pixel is 24 bits of information put

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.259
those numbers together multiply them up
and we find out what we get is that for

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:17.470
that would look the energy just saw if i
can get the board to move number of bits

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:26.560
of information is about i'll do a abide
sign 50 by turned to the 650 million now

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:33.639
we know from there that the energy for
one bit is three x 10 to the minus 21 so

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:39.189
what we're going to do the energy of our
thought is going to be 3 by 10 to the

00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:52.149
minus 21 x 50 x 10 to the 6 workout
throw that's 450 x 10 to the minus 15

00:14:52.149 --> 00:14:57.699
which is equal to 1.5 x 10 to the minus
13 and I hope you're screaming at me

00:14:57.699 --> 00:15:01.000
what are the units units or jewels

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.310
so how much of a mars bar is that amount
of energy so we've already told you that

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:11.080
the energy of a mars bar in terms of the
nutritional energy that we read up here

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:18.580
is about a 
megajoule so let's put Energy(mars bar)

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.800
is about one megajoule. this is its
chemical this is the energy you get from

00:15:22.809 --> 00:15:28.779
it if you eated so let's let's look at
what that that's gonna we can work out

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:32.680
what fraction of the mars bar in terms
of the Dead the energy you get from

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.939
eating it is associated with a thought
it turns out well as you can see it's

00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:41.649
going to be a really really small number
if we put the energy of our thought over

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:50.380
the energy of our mars bar that's this
incredibly small number / this rather

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.620
large number

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:58.850
just ended the sixth which is about 1.5
x 10 to the minus 19 so this is just a

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:04.400
ratio so it means that the energy
associated with your thought is about 10

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.320
million million million times smaller
than the energy you get from eating your

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.180
Mars bar. If you were to eat this it
will be roughly-- very, very roughly about

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:20.000
an attaogram. You're not going to be
able to see that that's an invisible

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
quantity of of mars bar

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.610
how much I'm gonna try to get this
domain that's I don't know maybe that's

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.060
that's a few thousand thoughts just for you, Brady
