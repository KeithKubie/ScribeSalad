picked up as hitchhikers as a function
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.480
picked up as hitchhikers as a function
of their breast size so he actually had

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
of their breast size so he actually had
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.990
of their breast size so he actually had
the same woman and they you know

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000
the same woman and they you know
 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.219
the same woman and they you know
artificially manipulated her breast size

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
artificially manipulated her breast size
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.560
artificially manipulated her breast size
and on different days she would stand

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
and on different days she would stand
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.780
and on different days she would stand
there and and of course it turned out

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
there and and of course it turned out
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.340
there and and of course it turned out
that men were much more likely to pick

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
that men were much more likely to pick
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.950
that men were much more likely to pick
up the woman if she had the same woman

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
up the woman if she had the same woman
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.889
up the woman if she had the same woman
if she had bigger breast size so I just

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899
if she had bigger breast size so I just
 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.480
if she had bigger breast size so I just
summarized that study put it up and then

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
summarized that study put it up and then
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.969
