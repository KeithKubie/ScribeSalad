yeah he has also done lots of

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099
yeah he has also done lots of
 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.860
yeah he has also done lots of

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.880
together with the earlier laureate to
Daniel Kahneman he has done a series of

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890
Daniel Kahneman he has done a series of
 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.280
Daniel Kahneman he has done a series of
experiments in all involving several

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290
experiments in all involving several
 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.890
experiments in all involving several
games ultimatum game they take their

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
games ultimatum game they take their
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.930
games ultimatum game they take their
game so cone that showed that people

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
game so cone that showed that people
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.650
game so cone that showed that people
really care about the being fair to

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660
really care about the being fair to
 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:50.390
really care about the being fair to
others what there is well in in wage

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
others what there is well in in wage
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.240
others what there is well in in wage
wages for instance that people are not

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250
wages for instance that people are not
 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.809
wages for instance that people are not
willing to be unfair in wages they don't

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819
willing to be unfair in wages they don't
 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.449

like when a company raises the price of

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459
like when a company raises the price of
 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.050
like when a company raises the price of
a product if demand suddenly rises they

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
a product if demand suddenly rises they
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.759
a product if demand suddenly rises they
think that there is a fair price for a

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769
think that there is a fair price for a
 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.370
think that there is a fair price for a
product and even if the company could

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380
product and even if the company could
 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.490
product and even if the company could
sell the the product at the higher price

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
sell the the product at the higher price
 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.949
sell the the product at the higher price
that I don't think they should so it's

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959
that I don't think they should so it's
 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.740
that I don't think they should so it's
not a fair price that's another area so

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750
not a fair price that's another area so
 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.020
not a fair price that's another area so
you're more fair than economists talk

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030
you're more fair than economists talk
 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.559
you're more fair than economists talk
about us tradition and economic systems

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569
about us tradition and economic systems
 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.780
about us tradition and economic systems
we all only think about our own

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790
we all only think about our own
 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.099
we all only think about our own
self-interest of course you can say that

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109
self-interest of course you can say that
 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.860
self-interest of course you can say that
our being fair being just to you is good

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
our being fair being just to you is good
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.330
our being fair being just to you is good
for me in the long run so some

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
for me in the long run so some
 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.490
for me in the long run so some
economists say that this can be modeled

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500
economists say that this can be modeled
 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.680
economists say that this can be modeled
but failure has shown that there are

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690
but failure has shown that there are
 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.960
but failure has shown that there are
more concerns and it's more it's more

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970
more concerns and it's more it's more
 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.030
more concerns and it's more it's more
general than has been fought before and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040
general than has been fought before and
 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.190
general than has been fought before and
he's provided experimental evidence for

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200
he's provided experimental evidence for
 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.590
he's provided experimental evidence for
that side and his colleague the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600
that side and his colleague the
 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.800
that side and his colleague the
dimensions Daniel Kahneman

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810
dimensions Daniel Kahneman
 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.400
dimensions Daniel Kahneman
it's also a previous price laureth they

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410
it's also a previous price laureth they
 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.710
it's also a previous price laureth they
work together and he also wrote a book

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720
work together and he also wrote a book
 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.250
work together and he also wrote a book
about thinking fast or slow so what does

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260
about thinking fast or slow so what does
 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.120
about thinking fast or slow so what does
Richard Taylor say about that well yeah

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130
Richard Taylor say about that well yeah
 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.120
Richard Taylor say about that well yeah
their relation is it's very interesting

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130
their relation is it's very interesting
 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.880
their relation is it's very interesting
because failure worked with Kahneman in

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890
because failure worked with Kahneman in
 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.790
because failure worked with Kahneman in
the early 1980s and he was inspired by

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800
the early 1980s and he was inspired by
 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.860
the early 1980s and he was inspired by
coloman and first his prospect theory

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870
coloman and first his prospect theory
 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.870
