00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.137
- [David] Hi Eman.

00:00:01.137 --> 00:00:01.970
- [Eman] Hi David.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.197
- [David] So what we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:03.197 --> 00:00:06.185
is talk about the
cultural spread of Islam.

00:00:06.185 --> 00:00:08.221
Where are we and when are we right now?

00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:12.194
- [Eman] So we are around
the early seventh century,

00:00:12.194 --> 00:00:13.027
- [David] Okay

00:00:13.027 --> 00:00:15.272
- [Eman] And here we see
the Byzantine empire,

00:00:15.272 --> 00:00:18.002
which, at the time was still
a continuation of Rome,

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:19.908
so this is like the eastern roman empire,

00:00:19.908 --> 00:00:20.741
- [David] Right.

00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:22.863
- [Eman] and it's an aging
empire and we also have

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:26.778
Sassanid Persia which
started in the third century

00:00:26.778 --> 00:00:28.984
and is still continuing into this period.

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:30.354
- [David] Right, so
we've got on the timeline

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:32.114
it's going beyond our start point here.

00:00:32.114 --> 00:00:35.544
- [Eman] Yep. So these are two very
powerful empires who often

00:00:35.544 --> 00:00:36.860
are in tension with one another.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.885
As you can see they neighbor each other.

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:40.026
And around this time

00:00:40.026 --> 00:00:44.731
they're involved in some
pretty powerful struggles here.

00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:49.146
- [David] Right. So in 628 it
leads to a lot of instability

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:51.063
within Sassanid Persia.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.358
- [Eman] Certainly, and in some
ways as well the Byzantines

00:00:54.358 --> 00:00:56.712
are weakened by how many resources

00:00:56.712 --> 00:00:59.215
they've exhausted in these tensions.

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:02.359
So around this time, a
new religion emerges.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.114
Muhammad is born in
Arabia, and pretty soon

00:01:06.114 --> 00:01:09.419
during his lifetime and
immediately after his lifetime,

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:12.264
the religion of Islam spreads rapidly

00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:15.013
through Islamic conquests,
which Saul talked about

00:01:15.013 --> 00:01:16.293
in an earlier video.

00:01:16.293 --> 00:01:18.161
- [David] I mean, just to
give you an impression,

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.743
Muhammad died in the year 633?

00:01:20.743 --> 00:01:21.576
- [Eman] Yes.

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:24.212
- [David] So by 750, this is what

00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:26.723
the state of the Islamic
world looked like.

00:01:26.723 --> 00:01:29.530
- [Eman] They took over most
of Persia and a large part

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.879
of the Byzantine empire, as we can see

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.196
and then even beyond,
it goes further east,

00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:36.961
further west, all the way over to Spain.

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:39.342
And this happens really really quickly,

00:01:39.342 --> 00:01:42.348
but it's not the case that Islamic culture

00:01:42.348 --> 00:01:46.351
necessarily takes in all of
these areas that quickly.

00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:48.848
So it takes a little bit
longer for that to really

00:01:48.848 --> 00:01:51.691
take hold, and it also takes hold in areas

00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:53.984
far beyond this empire as well.

00:01:53.984 --> 00:01:57.928
So certainly the presence
of Islamic or Muslim rulers

00:01:57.928 --> 00:01:59.567
in these areas certainly did affect

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:01.346
the culture of these places.

00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:04.007
But what's more important
is sort of the ways

00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:06.448
in which Islam slowly integrated

00:02:06.448 --> 00:02:07.573
with some of these cultures.

00:02:07.573 --> 00:02:11.047
And that happened through
trade, through missionaries,

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:14.166
and also through pilgramage
routes that happened,

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.070
emanating out from Mecca.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.562
And these religious ideas weren't static.

00:02:19.562 --> 00:02:21.202
As they moved through different areas

00:02:21.202 --> 00:02:23.723
and as they moved
through different routes,

00:02:23.723 --> 00:02:25.776
they changed and they
started to take the shape

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:29.120
of the local culture and
the local flavor as well.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.649
- [David] So let me pull
up some trade routes.

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.846
These were the active
trade routes of the period.

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:37.571
And you can see this is a
continuation of the silk road.

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:40.219
It goes all the way from Rome to China.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.806
This is Xian, which was
then known as Chang'an.

00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:47.188
This is the imperial capital of at least

00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:49.344
ten different Chinese dynasties.

00:02:49.344 --> 00:02:51.975
There's also a very large mosque here.

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:55.125
- [Eman] So here we have
the great mosque at Xian,

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:57.544
and what's really
interesting about this mosque

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.894
is that it really fuses a lot of

00:02:59.894 --> 00:03:02.369
Islamic and Chinese ideas.

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.873
So for example, it still
sort of has the structure

00:03:05.873 --> 00:03:07.941
of an imperial building, and the way

00:03:07.941 --> 00:03:09.549
that the courtyards are set up.

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.382
- [David] Sure.

00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:11.884
- [Eman] But instead of
following sort of the rules of

00:03:11.884 --> 00:03:15.163
Feng Shui, it is oriented towards Mecca,

00:03:15.163 --> 00:03:19.125
which is the direction in which
Muslims look when they pray.

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:21.902
But it still has a very Chinese character.

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:22.965
- [David] Right.

00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:25.327
- [Eman] And this makes sense
because these trade routes

00:03:25.327 --> 00:03:27.637
basically had to go
through the Islamic empire.

00:03:27.637 --> 00:03:30.722
And so as people traveled, so did ideas.

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:33.457
And those ideas transformed along the way.

00:03:33.457 --> 00:03:36.071
- [David] What's next on
our whistle stop tour, Eman?

00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.508
- [Eman] Let's look at
the mosque in Djenne.

00:03:39.508 --> 00:03:43.553
- [David] Okay. So Djenne
is in what is today, Mali,

00:03:43.553 --> 00:03:46.795
just south of Timbuktu or
Tombuktu as it's called today.

00:03:46.795 --> 00:03:50.389
So it was a great center
of Islamic learning.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.496
And in Djenne is the site
of the world's largest

00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:55.960
mud brick building, the
grand mosque of Djenne.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.648
Let me pull it up.

00:03:57.648 --> 00:04:00.220
It's a really incredible building

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.053
that gets a lot of
elements of Malian culture.

00:04:05.615 --> 00:04:08.227
So this is the grand mosque of Djenne,

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:09.429
this is a mud brick building.

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:11.036
We have an article about
this on Khan Academy

00:04:11.036 --> 00:04:12.669
in the art history section.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.280
What's really cool to me about
the grand mosque of Djenne

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.536
is the way that is
incorporates Malian traditions

00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:20.605
into Islamic tradition.

00:04:20.605 --> 00:04:22.385
So you can see on top of these spires,

00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:24.764
some of these spires are
minarets, from which issue

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.327
the call to prayer.

00:04:26.327 --> 00:04:27.786
You can't see them as detailed,

00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:29.821
but there are little
ostrich eggs on top of

00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:30.979
- [Eman] Ostrich eggs?

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.814
- [David] Yeah, in Mali,
ostrich eggs represent

00:04:33.814 --> 00:04:35.389
purity and fertility.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.119
And so even within the
constraints of building

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:42.518
a religious building,
there's still expressions

00:04:42.518 --> 00:04:43.935
of local culture.

00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:47.306
- [Eman] Yeah, and it's
really interesting how that

00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:49.399
spread through trade, but
it also spread another way,

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.298
which is through pilgramage,
through missionaries,

00:04:52.298 --> 00:04:55.243
through preachers, and that also took on

00:04:55.243 --> 00:04:57.676
the local traditions in interesting ways.

00:04:57.676 --> 00:04:59.702
So let's go to southern,

00:04:59.702 --> 00:05:00.759
to South India.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:01.692
- [David] Okay.

00:05:01.692 --> 00:05:03.296
- [Eman] Near Kerala.

00:05:03.296 --> 00:05:07.684
- [David] So this is the
Cheraman Juma mosque.

00:05:07.684 --> 00:05:08.964
This is supposed to be one

00:05:08.964 --> 00:05:11.720
of the earliest mosques in history.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.870
It's construction dates to about 630.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.671
- [Eman] Yep, 629 to be precise.

00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:16.552
- [David] Thank you.

00:05:16.552 --> 00:05:18.587
- [Eman] This was actually
during the life of the prophet,

00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:20.288
and it's quite far from Mecca,

00:05:20.288 --> 00:05:24.048
so it's really fascinating
how quickly it traveled there.

00:05:24.048 --> 00:05:26.223
But it traveled with a preacher

00:05:26.223 --> 00:05:30.802
and as you can see, this is a
very distinctly Indian mosque.

00:05:30.802 --> 00:05:34.619
Another way that Islam
traveled through preachers

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:36.514
was through Sufis.

00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:38.956
So let's talk about
Sufis for just a minute.

00:05:38.956 --> 00:05:39.789
- [David] Sure.

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.155
- [Eman] Sufis were like a
mystical devotional practice,

00:05:42.155 --> 00:05:43.920
and we see many iterations of Sufism

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.936
in all different sects of Islam.

00:05:45.936 --> 00:05:47.720
But they were particularly successful

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.624
at spreading Islam for a few reasons.

00:05:49.624 --> 00:05:51.606
One of them was that they
adapted the teachings

00:05:51.606 --> 00:05:53.000
to local traditions.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.344
And another reason was
that they built lodges

00:05:56.344 --> 00:05:58.304
and places of worship along the way.

00:05:58.304 --> 00:06:00.127
And these sometimes function
like community centers

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:01.086
and monasteries.

00:06:01.086 --> 00:06:02.687
So let's have a look at a couple of them.

00:06:02.687 --> 00:06:03.520
- [David] Sure.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.330
- [Eman] Let's look at
some North African ones.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.324
- [David] So this is a Ribat in Tunisia.

00:06:09.324 --> 00:06:12.941
- [Eman] Yes, so a Ribat
is kind of like a hostel,

00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:14.900
you have travelers staying there.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.827
Early on in their history,

00:06:16.827 --> 00:06:18.440
there were soldiers that stayed there.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.225
Over time, they sort of took on

00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:22.725
a monastery culture for Sufis.

00:06:24.535 --> 00:06:27.521
We also have something called a Zawiya.

00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:30.143
So here is an example of one.

00:06:30.143 --> 00:06:33.140
And similarly this was
a place of learning,

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.177
it was a place of worship.

00:06:35.177 --> 00:06:37.820
People often lived there for a long time,

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.891
so they sort of have
this monastic tradition

00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:43.584
that created a permanent
presence for Islam

00:06:43.584 --> 00:06:45.113
along these routes.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:48.904
And this was really really
integral in the spread of Islam.

00:06:48.904 --> 00:06:52.025
And it's not just in North
Africa, but even farther east,

00:06:52.025 --> 00:06:54.027
you see different iterations of that.

00:06:54.027 --> 00:06:57.273
So once you get into former
Persian territory and

00:06:57.273 --> 00:07:01.546
in Indian territory you have
something called a Hanka.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.578
So here's an example from Kashmir.

00:07:04.578 --> 00:07:07.332
This is called the Shah Hamdan mosque.

00:07:07.332 --> 00:07:09.060
And it's a fourteenth century mosque.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.162
And this is a commemorative building,

00:07:11.162 --> 00:07:13.298
it commemorates an important Sufi leader.

00:07:13.298 --> 00:07:15.667
But again, you see some
of the local flavor here.

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:18.520
You see that there's some
intricate wood carvings,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.509
which is really,

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:21.585
- [David] Very Kashmir-y

00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:23.089
- [Eman] Very Kashmir-y, certainly.

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:25.505
And similarly this was a place of worship

00:07:25.505 --> 00:07:28.132
but also a place where
people passed through

00:07:28.132 --> 00:07:30.339
and interacted and learned.

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:34.273
So it was a site of spreading
Islamic tradition as well.

00:07:34.273 --> 00:07:35.360
- [David] So that was about,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.989
sorry I should have said, that
was about here in Srinagar.

00:07:37.989 --> 00:07:39.961
- [Eman] Yes, about there.

00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:43.547
- [David] Yeah and so, in this
way Islam was also spread.

00:07:43.547 --> 00:07:45.149
- [Eman] Certainly.

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:47.490
Let's have a look at sort of the bounds

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.962
of the Islamic empire.

00:07:48.962 --> 00:07:49.807
- [David] Sure.

00:07:49.807 --> 00:07:53.736
- [Eman] And where we see
some of these instances

00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:56.964
of new Islamic traditions were no longer

00:07:56.964 --> 00:07:59.114
in the heart of the Islamic empire.

00:07:59.114 --> 00:08:00.010
We're beyond that.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.978
And that's because Islam was

00:08:02.978 --> 00:08:05.619

00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:09.119
really really diverse iterations of Islam.
