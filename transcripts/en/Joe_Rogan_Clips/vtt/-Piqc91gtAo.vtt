00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.630
The Joe Rogan experience.
If you're lucky,

2
00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:06.000
like we were talking about a hundred years.
If you're lucky,

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.320
you get to a hundred years.
I'm 51 I'm halfway there,
right?
If I'm lucky,

4
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:13.410
if everything works out perfect and it probably isn't,
let's be honest,

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.240
beat the shit out of my body.
Right?

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.950
So it's probably not going to make more to make it to be 102 I'll see what's up.

7
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.520
I do because I,
I'm a,
I'm a science nerd.
I'm,
I'm,

8
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.250
I'm fascinated by all these three d printed hearts and all this shit.

9
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:29.310
I want to see what the fuck they can do.
I really think,

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.480
and talking to guys like David Sinclair and all these anti aging specialist,

11
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.250
I think they're on the verge of being able to reverse aging that they're

12
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:40.350
treating aging like it's a disease,

13
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:44.130
like it's a disease at the cellular level instead of accepting it and that like,

14
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:47.310
wow,
you get older,
hey,
you're going to have to accept,

15
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:50.520
you can't do as much by is not going to work as well.
Why?

16
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.440
Maybe that's not the case.

17
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.770
Maybe if they can correct certain things about the human body,

18
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.790
maybe they can correct that.
And I think it's very likely that in the future,

19
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.550
I don't think that's an insurmountable a situation.

20
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:05.760
I think they're gonna be able to correct what happens to your body when it ages,

21
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.240
the deterioration that's caused by the aging process.

22
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.430
Your body produces less hormones,
your body starts to slow down or Alzheimer's,

23
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:15.264
all these different things.

24
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.790
I think they're gonna be able to correct those things.
Wow.

25
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.910
The problem with that is then what?
We're going to live forever.

26
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.600
You gotta be happy living forever.
Like what if when you die,
it's amazing.

27
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.360
What if when you die,
there really is a heaven.
You really,

28
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:34.361
really do go to some spectacular dimension filled with love and peace and

29
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.640
happiness,
and there's no emotions like we think about here.

30
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.300
There's no fear.
There's not none of the things that hold people back.

31
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:49.160
None of the anxiety and the [inaudible] is just consciousness and love and then

32
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:51.020
you're wasting your time.
You're just trying to stay alive,

33
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.540
taking pills to live to be a million

34
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.840
<v 1>boy.
You open up big eggs can of worms.
Right.</v>

35
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.840
I will tell you,
um,
Joe,

36
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.210
without a shadow of a doubt,
none whatsoever.

37
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.580
Death is not the end.
You don't think so?
I know,
I know too.

38
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.060
How do you know,
cause I've been dead,
right?
Yes,
I've been there.
What,

39
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.120
what about that experience cemented in your head?
MMM,

40
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.290
when I was,
like I said,
it was the most peaceful.

41
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.350
Um,
and,
and I,
I don't feel like it was the most peace,

42
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.300
most restful,
most I was,
I woke up laughing.

43
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.520
I was,
yeah.
Yeah.

44
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:49.500
My wife tells me I was overjoyed.
You woke up laugh.
Yeah,

45
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.990
I was over to you remember anything about what happened when you blacked out a

46
00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:59.280
street at the time as an extremely peaceful,

47
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.720
extreme.
I didn't have a worry extremely too.

48
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.870
And I was not a sad at all.
You know,

49
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:10.810
I was overjoyed,
very happy,

50
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.080
very peaceful and it erased any fear that I might have had and I,

51
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.040
and any fear of dying is gone.

52
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.050
I don't feel that at all.
It.
So I made,

53
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.860
maybe that's why I didn't want to live to be a hundred,

54
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.370
cause I mean I wouldn't mind visiting that place again,
man.

55
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:38.320
It was so much peace so much and it wasn't like,
you know,
um,

56
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.110
this is,
you know,
I'm just in the ground.

57
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.450
I'm a and I'm not a plant,
uh,

58
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.070
just dirt,
you know,

59
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.660
I know that I'm in a very comfortable place and,

60
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.360
and you know,
I wouldn't mind visiting again.
I wouldn't mind.

61
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.660
So definitely I hold no fear.
And so when I say that it's,

62
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.400
it's definitely not the end.
You're,
I believe that your soul,
you know,

63
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.930
so people have a different name for consciousness of whatever is definitely

64
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.830
eternal.
And then hers.

65
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.880
How else could you have these feelings or emotions or you know,

66
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.680
they had that,
that sort of comfort,

67
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:25.681
the feeling of comfort and being in the right place if something didn't continue

68
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:30.250
because my life,
my life was gone,
the sm life,
my,
my bodies,
you know,

69
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.320
gone,
it was gone.
Flat line did what if I told my doctor that died?
And he said,

70
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:39.190
no,
actually it's called some kind of Paul's or some shit like that.

71
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:43.260
And I'm saying,
look,
if the pause lasted doc,
I wouldn't be talking to him.

72
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.590
So I call it appalls.
I go,
well,

73
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.690
during that Paul's,
I was dead.
So,
uh,
it's,

74
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.120
it was a wonderful feeling.
Well,

75
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.440
I think with a guy like you that's so physical and you've been so physical your

76
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:03.640
whole life,
the big fears to not be able to take care of yourself or move,

77
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.420
like that's what we're talking about when you talk about being a hundred,

78
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.470
like having someone wipe your ass and take care of you.
Like that's the big fear.

79
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.800
It's not death that it's peaceful,
it's the end.

80
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.600
But the big fear is the deterioration of the physical body to the point where

81
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.960
it's just painful.
Everything's painful and you can't go anywhere.

82
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:27.310
He can't count on yourself.
Yeah.
It's,
uh,

83
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.440
it's very peaceful,
but I definitely don't think it's the end.

84
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.490
I think it's the beginning.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's a,

85
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.260
it's an overwhelming feeling like I had,

86
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.340
I was able to peek over into the other side and that it's definitely assurance

87
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.510
that it's not the end and that there is something else on the other side,

88
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.160
have that assurance is able to pick it,
just peek it.
Well,

89
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.760
<v 0>I think we all have this feeling that we are something other than our body.</v>

90
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.330
Most definitely.
I mean,
I,

91
00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:07.460
I have that feeling like I feel like there's like a little ball of energy in

92
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:12.110
there that moves this thing around.
You're right.
But that's what it feels like.

93
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.540
It always feels like that.
Yeah.
That's what I,

94
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:18.890
I've always rejected the label atheist.
Like people say,
are you religious?

95
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:23.390
I'm like,
I was,
when I was a little kid I had to go to Catholic school and I,

96
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:27.260
you know,
I did all that jazz,
but my parents when I grew up were hippies.

97
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.420
After that,
my mom split up from my dad.

98
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.200
My mom checked up with my stepfather who was a,

99
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.990
he's a hippie and there was no,
no church after that.

100
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.530
But I'm not an atheist.
I'm not,
I don't know.
Like,

101
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:44.531
I don't believe anybody that says they know what life is or what life means or

102
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:49.940
what happens when you die.
I want to hear your opinions.

103
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:52.070
I want to hear your thoughts,
but you don't know.

104
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.070
And anybody that says they know what happens when they die.

105
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.780
I know what happens when I die.
It'll be black and and cold.
And that is the end.

106
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.200
And just like there was nothing before,
there'll be nothing at the end.

107
00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:06.320
And like you don't know that you're just saying that there is no god.

108
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.870
How do you say that?
How do you say that?
Well,
one day,

109
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:13.340
what have you stand in front of God or uh,
in,
in God's presence,

110
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:15.560
in some nonphysical form.
And then you're,

111
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.710
you're weeping and your arrogance and s say stating that there's no higher

112
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:25.460
power.
Like it might be the,
the universe itself might be God.
I mean,

113
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:27.200
we don't know anything.
You,

114
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.320
we are strange little monkey people living on this fucking planet,

115
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.110
making things that alter our environment and moving around,

116
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:39.950
drive and fly and talking to each other,
talking shit.
But at the end of the day,

117
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.480
you're only aware of what you've experienced and when you don't know,

118
00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:45.640
that's like when people have had,
I've,

119
00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:49.010
I've talked to several friends at vet near death experiences.
Um,

120
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.820
a very good friend of mine,
she,

121
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.530
she was in a car accident and she had a very similar thing where she said it was

122
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:57.650
so peaceful.
Yeah.
She said,
you know,
they got,

123
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.980
I think that got rear ended and like really banked up and when it felt like she

124
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:07.460
was going to die,
she felt so peaceful.

125
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.240
<v 1>It's so true.
True.
Yeah.
I think a lot of people that,
uh,</v>

126
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.480
have come that close to dying,
uh,
are,
are,

127
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.420
a lot of them are going to say the same thing,

128
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:22.360
that they have no fear of death anymore.
It's,
it's he raised and,
uh,

129
00:08:22.361 --> 00:08:24.530
you,
you put,
you also have the feeling that you know,

130
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:29.510
that this existence on earth when your physical body is Stephanie,

131
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:30.340
not the end.

132
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.650
<v 0>The way she describes it as exactly the way you do.</v>

133
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.320
She's my manager and you know,
I talk to her all the time.

134
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.880
The way she describes things is essentially exactly how you did that.

135
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.210
It's just so peaceful.
Just felt,
just felt peaceful.

136
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.390
<v 1>Yeah.
But not a,
you know,
like</v>

137
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.960
black people who don't believe in back there.
You're,
by the way,

138
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.310
let me think.
Let me say I'm not either.
Yeah.

139
00:08:56.311 --> 00:09:01.311
I was raised super religious in a super religious home by uh,

140
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.260
uh,
a Pentecostal,
uh,

141
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.440
heaven or hell brimstone and fire and brimstone preacher.

142
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.400
And they do the tongues.
Oh yes.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

143
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:16.350
Shout and uh,
speaking of times,
everything,
everything.
Wow.

144
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.400
Everything was a sin all summer.
Every,
oh,
dancing.

145
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.420
Dancing was listening to rock and roll music.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

146
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.030
Everything was us in.

147
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.980
So I think that's really what drove me away from being a religious person.

148
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:34.740
I'm definitely not,
I always say I'm a man of faith.

149
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.500
I have a tremendous amount of faith,

150
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.760
but faith and religion to two different things.
A lot of people confuse them.

151
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.790
Yeah.
They,
they talk about them as being the same,

152
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:49.100
but they are definitely not a religious man.
Maids and you know,

153
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.710
a set of rules in Mexico,
we're going to be this.

154
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.440
And if you want to be this religion,
then you're gonna have to go by these rules.

155
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.020
Yeah.
And it's,
it's,
it's all man made,

156
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:01.620
but faith is not man me and so I'm a tremendous man of faith,

157
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.080
but not religion.

158
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.310
<v 0>Yeah.
Some would say that like you're a spiritual person.</v>

159
00:10:06.311 --> 00:10:09.280
That's like a thing that gets thrown around today.
Like I'm not religious,

160
00:10:09.281 --> 00:10:12.250
but I'm spiritual.
People say that a lot.
Like what does that mean?

161
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.340
No one really knows.
It's a strange sort of definition,

162
00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:18.160
but I feel what you're saying.
Like there's something more to this.

163
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.930
There's something more to this than just tissue and bone and blood moving on.

164
00:10:22.931 --> 00:10:26.680
This rock that's traveling through the universe.
There's something more,

165
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.150
there's something,
there's something,
there's some,

166
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.670
and maybe it's just something more for us,

167
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.290
but the beauty of friendship and love and family,

168
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.570
like those things are intense,

169
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.010
beautiful emotional experiences that I,
I don't,

170
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.480
I don't know.
They seem to transcend just regular life itself.

171
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.770
They seem to have a,
there was a higher power to them,
a higher beauty to them.

172
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.100
I think that's one of the things that we like when we see people doing something

173
00:10:54.101 --> 00:10:58.690
really great.
We love seeing people accomplish things cause we we love,

174
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.430
we liked seeing people succeed.

175
00:11:00.431 --> 00:11:05.431
We like seeing people like that have doubts and and something almost

176
00:11:06.101 --> 00:11:09.700
insurmountable and incredibly difficult in front of them and then they,

177
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.960
they overcome and it gives us all hope and it gives us all like this
inspiration,

178
00:11:13.961 --> 00:11:16.090
this feeling.
We're connected in some sort of very,

179
00:11:16.091 --> 00:11:19.270
very strange way that I think you could just chalk it up.

180
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.940
Oh that's just camaraderie.
We needed that because of evolution.

181
00:11:21.941 --> 00:11:25.600
That's how we stayed alive.
Like maybe,
maybe,
but maybe there's something else.

182
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.350
Maybe the whatever this consciousness is that's totally not,

183
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.330
no one is ever defined consciousness and there's certain people that think that

184
00:11:32.331 --> 00:11:37.210
it occurs only in the brain and the neurons and the synapses and it might or

185
00:11:37.211 --> 00:11:38.530
that might just be an antenna.

186
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.800
I mean consciousness might very well be you are using your physical tissue to

187
00:11:44.711 --> 00:11:47.200
tune in to whatever this,

188
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:52.090
this thing that we share is this life force that we all seem to share.

189
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.320
And when you,
when this other thing,
it's like looking in someone's eyes,
man.

190
00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.480
Like when you know someone's like there for you and you know you're there for

191
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:05.730
them.
Like that comradery,
that intense comradery,
this,
he's just like that,

192
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.620
that the expression,
the windows to the soul,

193
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:12.070
that the eyes are the windows to the soul.
It really does seem like that.
Right?

194
00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:17.050
Like you see people,
you see them,
you know,
like the Avatar Lady said,
I see you.

195
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.400
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah,
you can.
It's,
I'm</v>

196
00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.260
looking at it didn't even really looking at Saint Mikes.
Alright.

197
00:12:24.261 --> 00:12:29.060
You can tell a lot.
You can tell if they're bullshit.
Yes,

198
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.270
they're full of shit or not man.
Or if they feel weird about something,

199
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.920
maybe they feel like maybe this isn't a smart thing or maybe,
maybe,

200
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.650
maybe I should've done better by you or maybe I fucked you over.
Yeah.

201
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:46.130
You could tell that.
And I,
uh,
I,
I,
I turned the first,

202
00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:47.860
first time I had the,
uh,
uh,

203
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.850
open heart surgery and line three times during that surgery,

204
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.840
I also had an experience.
Um,

205
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.810
that also strengthens my belief.

206
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:04.810
And there being something after the body dies,
I,

207
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.530
or Asian or whatever you want to call it.
Uh,
okay.
Which I see.

208
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:14.420
I was able to see my mother who had passed away the year before.

209
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.920
And uh,
you know,
I say I see my mother,
I see her face.

210
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:23.500
I just heard a voice and I knew it was her and she was,
um,
you know,

211
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.320
pleading to a,
I say guide.

212
00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:29.230
A lot of people may say,
you know what?

213
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.410
Whatever they look up to and I ain't got no problem with that.

214
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.640
I don't think that,
uh,
because people don't believe exactly like,

215
00:13:37.641 --> 00:13:40.130
I believe that they're doom and they're going to hell.

216
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.260
Although that was the way I was raised,
or if you don't believe right,

217
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.750
this all Catholics went up when I quote them,
my dad,

218
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.720
all Catholics for this lost,

219
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.770
they're not gonna make it because they don't believe they believe the wrong

220
00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:56.900
chair.
Ain't that fucked down bleed,
right.
Shifter.

221
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.600
So of course they're not going to make it about Jews.
I'll go there.

222
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.400
They're not going to make it live yet in that you don't believe like this is

223
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.490
fucked up.
Oh,
just lost man.
Fuck off man.

224
00:14:07.491 --> 00:14:12.491
Your cytologists Oh specially your especially lost and that's,

225
00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.770
you know,
but that's,
yeah,
that's how they felt.

226
00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:18.010
That's how I was taught mysteries and I just,
you know,

227
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.200
I don't believe that you got,
you got this.

228
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.120
My Dad was some people,

229
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.700
the problem with that thought that he could walk on water,

230
00:14:25.701 --> 00:14:28.800
he could do no wrong and it's the same guy that,
you know,
steal,

231
00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.730
break my notes and send me through the fucking emergency room,
keep mine.

232
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.220
And my mom was a slave and that was perfectly fine with him.

233
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.720
And also this was the guy who was fucking women in the church.

234
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.000
But you don't believe like,
I believe you're going to hell.

235
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.990
Yeah.
People have a remarkable ability to be hypocrites.
Yeah,
there's soup.

236
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.320
And I seen that so much from super religious people.

237
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.970
They just turned me off from being a religious purse.

238
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.820
Well I think a lot of what it is is control.
People want to control other people.

239
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:07.820
They want to be able to tell people what to do and when to do it.

240
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:12.140
And it gives them some power in their own life by doing so.
Yeah.
Yeah.

241
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:17.000
And Man,
I,
I just,
uh,
you know it,
these stories,
my,

242
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:21.470
uh,
um,
faith and just super,

243
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.590
you know,
people that are in church every Sunday,

244
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.950
every time we went to church three times a week,

245
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.410
three times or eight times every Tuesday,

246
00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:34.160
every Friday and every Sunday in church and churches.
I mean,

247
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:39.110
during the watts riots,
I'm a little kid.
We went to church.
Wow.

248
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.070
Yeah.
The guy that soldiers and national guard on the streets,

249
00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:46.970
they pulled my dad over.
I'm a little kid in the back seat.
Where are you going?

250
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.840
Uh,
I'm going to church and I'm like,
fuck these guys.

251
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.460
There's tanks on the street.

252
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:57.080
This guy has got fucking MCS 16 and asked him and my dad's like,

253
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.560
we're going to church.
And I'm like,
fuck,
could you leave us at home?

254
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.140
Cause my brother Mike,
can we leave?

255
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.010
I want to be at home looking at fucking Heco in Japanese cartoons,
man.

256
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:11.600
I don't fucking be ID.
That got man,
we went to church,
man.

257
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.650
So he was super dedicated,
you know,
to,
you know,

258
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:20.870
part of it was super dedicated to what he believed.
And then,
um,
you know,

259
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:25.910
you go over the sisters Sally's house to give her consultation and I'm looking

260
00:16:26.451 --> 00:16:27.710
in the room,

261
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:32.160
her bedroom doors open and there's my dad with his fucking tee shirt on,

262
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.430
sister Sally's in her slip and shit.

263
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.710
And I guess me and my brother were there to be as a scape goat or,

264
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.880
you know,
he's,
excuse my mom,
you know,
if I take them and you know,

265
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.820
nothing could be going on wrong,
where am I still remember that shit?
Fuck.

266
00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:48.920
What kind of castle tasting is he doing?
