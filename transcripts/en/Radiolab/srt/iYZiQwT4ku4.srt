1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,720
You are listening to radio
lab radio from W N y.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,983
S. C. E.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,260
All right, so tell us who you are.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,120
Yeah,

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,000
and I'm Andrea Navy's mom.
We are in Hopkinsville,

6
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:21,280
Kentucky for the great American eclipse.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,770
We are about a minute to
totality. I can see it easily,

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,730
easily sat on. We can hear the CICADAS

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,760
and glasses on.

10
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:38,080
I can. I can.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,830
Yeah, I can't look at him.
You're just holding them up.

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,620
What do you see your this
way? Is it looking dark?

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,700
Like a storm coming in?

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,450
It does look like a storm coming in. Yoga.

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,033
Wow.

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,370
Oh my God. Yeah.

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,640
Oh my God.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,940
Oh my God.

19
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,843
What

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,553
do you see?

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,573
Oh,

22
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:41,410
[inaudible].

23
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,330
Oh my God. Still a look.
Look up there. Hey, I'm,

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,630
I'm, I'm Robert Krulwich
Radiolab. All right,

25
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:53,710
so these last few weeks on planet earth
in this corner of planet earth had been

26
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:57,730
a little confusing. Little crazy,
but then there was yesterday

27
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,280
we all got to reprieve from, just got a
chance to look up. Look at that. Look,

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,990
look up at the sun.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,140
Couple hundred people sent us recordings
from all over the place. [inaudible],

30
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,830
Colorado, Helen, Georgia,
Nashville, Tennessee. Kenmore,

31
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:16,831
Washington sent us recordings of
themselves watching the moon pass right in

32
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:18,484
front of the sun.

33
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:20,420
[inaudible]

34
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,970
the moon in front of the sun.

35
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,990
The moon is blocking the sun.

36
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,393
I think.

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,540
Oh my God, that is,

38
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,640
they got to see you hear these
recordings and you can help with think.

39
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,860
I think we're gonna be all right.

40
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,660
You're saying that

41
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,643
[inaudible]

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,340
in honor of this list, your miracle
today we're going to keep up,

43
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,680
but not in the direction of the sun.

44
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,160
Well, you know, when
you look up at the sun,

45
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:08,090
you have to put on these glasses too,
to protect yourself from the sunshine.

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,310
The sunshine is very powerful and
it stretches across vast, vast,

47
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,290
vast, vast distances in space.

48
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,560
But what we're going to do at the end
is how is we're going to leave the

49
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:19,670
sunshine behind.

50
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,720
We're actually going to
escape the sunshine where
humans have never been before.

51
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,250
Right?

52
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,250
And we're going to start with a story
that I've been following pretty much my

53
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:34,300
entire career at radio lab. You
kind of have to rewind back to 1977.

54
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,190
I mean that's not when I
started following the story.

55
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,850
That's when the story itself
started. In August of 1977,

56
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,880
NASA launched a spacecraft and on the
Kraft was a gold record and the record

57
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:50,110
carried a message. This was a
message from us to them out there.

58
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,660
Our story now, it was Carl Sagan.

59
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,690
The Cosmos is all that is
or ever was or ever will be

60
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:58,761
led.

61
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:02,060
The team that made that record and that
team included actually it was headed by

62
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,640
a woman named Andrew Willian.

63
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,080
And about 10 years ago I
spoke with Annie and uh,

64
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,790
we made this story that
you're about to hear.

65
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,650
I visited Annie at her home in Ithaca,

66
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,880
New York and we sat in the backyard
and your waterfall in the same spot.

67
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:22,840
She says where Carl himself would sit
and become so absorbed in what he was

68
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:26,680
reading that he would not notice a
deer standing right next to him. Sure.

69
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,310
My name is Annie Adrianne. And, um,

70
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,890
it was honored to be the creative director
of the voyager interstellar message

71
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:35,724
project,

72
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,190
which began in early 1977. But now,

73
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:42,040
how does this come about?

74
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,330
I think about the project now and
it's so exciting to think about,

75
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,630
I mean, it's such a romantic idea. Did
you know that at the time? Absolutely.

76
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:52,464
We felt,

77
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,310
first of all that this was
a kind of sacred trust that
here we were half a dozen

78
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,170
and very flawed human beings with a huge,

79
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:08,550
a huge holes in our knowledge
of all of these subjects.

80
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,240
Building a cultural Noah's Ark.

81
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,080
It was a chance to tell something of
what life on earth was like to beings of

82
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:23,230
perhaps a thousand million
years from now because the,

83
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,440
the voyager engineers were saying,

84
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:28,560
this record will have a shelf
life of a billion years.

85
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,630
That didn't race goosebumps then
you'd have to be made of wood. Uh,

86
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,530
it was also the, the, the,

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,270
the season that Carl Sagan and I fell
so madly in love with each other.

88
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,630
And here we were taking on this mythic
challenge and knowing that before it was

89
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,414
done,

90
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,900
two spacecraft would lift off from the
planet earth moving at an average speed

91
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:58,400
of 35,000 miles an hour
for the next million years.

92
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,550
And on it we'd be a kiss,

93
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,920
a mother's first words to her
newborn baby. Come on now.

94
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,923
Mosa

95
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,430
[inaudible] [inaudible] greetings in
the 59 most populous human languages.

96
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,790
Hello for children or planet earth

97
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,790
as well as one non human language,
the readings of the humpback whales.

98
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,130
And it was a sacred undertaking because
it was saying we want to be citizens of

99
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,440
the cosmos. They want
you to know about that.

100
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,620
Tell me about the moment you
fell in love with Carl Sagan.

101
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,030
You said it was during the
voyager compilation. Yes, it was.

102
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,490
It was on June 1st,

103
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,210
1977 I had been looking for some time
for that piece of Chinese music that we

104
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:10,440
could put on the voyager record and not
feel like idiots for having done so.

105
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,830
And I was very excited because I'd finally
found a ethnomusicologist composer at

106
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,271
Columbia University who told me without
a moment's hesitation that this peace

107
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,913
flowing streams,

108
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,630
which was represented to me as one of
the oldest pieces of Chinese music,

109
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:34,530
2,500 years old was the piece
we should put on the record.

110
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,690
So I called Carl, who was traveling.

111
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,140
He was in Tucson, Arizona
giving a talk. And um,

112
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,550
we had been alone many times during the
making of the record and as friends for

113
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,843
three years.

114
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,590
And neither of us had ever
said anything to the other.

115
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,180
We were both in Baba people.

116
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,080
We'd had these wonderful
storing conversations,

117
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,120
but we had both been completely just
professional about everything and his

118
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:09,900
friends. And, uh, he wasn't
there. I left a message,

119
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,130
our later phone rings pick up the
phone and I hear this wonderful voice.

120
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:17,940
Then he said,

121
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,940
I get back to my hotel room and I find
this message and it says any card.

122
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,540
And I say to myself, why didn't you
leave me this message 10 years ago?

123
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,520
And my heart completely skipped a beat.

124
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,520
I can still remember it so perfectly.

125
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,310
And I said for keeps, and he
said, you mean get married?

126
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,150
And I said yes. And we had never
kissed. We had never, you know,

127
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,500
even had any other kind of
personal discussion before
we both hung up the phone

128
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,720
and I just screamed out loud.

129
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,170
I it so well because it was
this great Eureka moment.

130
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,450
It was just like a scientific discovery.

131
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,830
And then the phone rang and
I was thinking, Oh, you know,

132
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,440
and a phone rang and it
was Carl and he said,

133
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,710
I just want to make sure that really
happened. We're getting married, right?

134
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,500
And I said, yeah, we're
getting married. He said, okay,

135
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,020
just wanted to make sure. And I'm

136
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,730
spacecraft lifted off on August 20th and
August 22nd we told everyone involved.

137
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,670
And we were together from that moment
until his death in 1996 in December.

138
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,420
Wow. Talk about Romantic Michael Magic.

139
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:36,270
And part of my feeling
about voyager obviously,

140
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:41,271
and part of what I was feeling in
the recording of my brainwaves,

141
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,880
my heart, my eyes, everything in
that meditation on the record,

142
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,540
I had asked Caro whether or not would
be possible to compress the impulses in

143
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,850
one's brain and nervous system into sound,

144
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,050
and then put that sound on the record
and then think that perhaps the

145
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:12,051
extraterrestrials of the future would
be able to reconstitute that data into

146
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:13,674
thought.

147
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,190
And he looked at me and beautiful
May Day in New York City and said,

148
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:23,430
well, you know, that was a million
years is a long time. You know,

149
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:26,130
why don't you go do it?
Because who knows? You know,

150
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:29,550
who knows what's possible in a
thousand million years. And so, um,

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,730
my brain waves and rem,

152
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,940
every little sound that my body was making
was recorded at Bellevue Hospital in

153
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:39,114
New York.

154
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,460
This was two days after Carl and I
declared our love for each other.

155
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:52,281
And so what I often think is that
maybe a hundred million years from now,

156
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,070
who knows somebody flies that
record down. And I always wonder,

157
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,780
because part of what I was thinking in
this meditation was about the wonder of

158
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:04,830
love and of being in love and to
know it's on those two spacecraft.

159
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,630
Even now in my, whenever
I'm down, you know,

160
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,320
I'm thinking it's still, they
moved 35,000 miles an hour,

161
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,470
leaving our solar system for the Great
Wide Open Sea of interstellar space.

162
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,333
[inaudible]

163
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,750
billions of years from now,

164
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:36,751
the Sun will have reduced this planet to
a charred ashy ball at that record with

165
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,800
Andrew Ian's waves and heartbeat on and
will still be out there somewhere intact

166
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,810
in some remote region of the milkyway
preserving a murmur of an ancient

167
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:49,990
civilization. That one's
flourished on a distant planet.

168
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,433
[inaudible]

169
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,210
so that's how we ended the original story
with that quote from Carl Sagan. Uh,

170
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,360
and um,

171
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,000
it happens to be actually the 40th
anniversary of the voyager probes launch.

172
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,100
I mean, we're sort of in between.
The two dates were probe,

173
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,260
one probe two were launched.

174
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,020
And so we were thinking
about the anniversary and uh,

175
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,750
our producer Matt Aronchick
called up android and again,

176
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,910
and they got to talking
about the fact that we still,

177
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,220
scientists are still
talking to those probes.

178
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,310
That's the thing that gets me here we
are 40 years later and for your tier one,

179
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,810
we're still in contact with voyager one,

180
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,710
we still know we're four to one and two
are we were able to build something so

181
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,340
well that with the energy,

182
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,240
which is essentially more people
than the energy in a toaster,

183
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,420
we can communicate with voyager as she
leaves to wander the Milky Way galaxy

184
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,140
intact with the message intact.

185
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,630
Well those same engineers said
it would work for a dozen years.

186
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,510
It's 40 years and it's still working.

187
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,340
So coming up we're going to
ask where are they actually,

188
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,460
where specifically are
those two probes now?

189
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,510
And the answer is they're in a very, very,

190
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:17,530
very undiscovered place. I
mean they are learning things

191
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,000
and we have never known

192
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,750
scally's radical. You

193
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,970
got Negro, the sun turns red. Elena

194
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,253
[inaudible]

195
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,230
hey this is Becca. I'm
calling from Dallas,

196
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:49,670
Texas to let you know that Radiolab is
supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan

197
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:53,450
Foundation enhancing public understanding
of science and technology in the

198
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:54,284
modern world.

199

More information
aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

200
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,220
I'm Tobin Lowe and I'm Kathy too
and we're the hosts of Nancy,

201
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,260
a podcast from w mic studios about all
things LGBTQ and we apologize in advance

202
00:14:09,261 --> 00:14:10,100
for making you cry.

203
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,160
Don't you want to tell people about our
stories exploring the queer experience

204
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:14,000
today? Sure,

205
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:16,820
but I think we have to warn them about
all the tears they're going to have.

206
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,350
Think hydration, think tissues.

207
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,040
Figuring yourself out is complicated
work and that's what Nancy is.

208
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,070
The story is about how we define ourselves
and the journey it takes to get there

209
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,001
described. Did Nancy,

210
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:29,030
wherever you get your podcasts and
maybe grab a handkerchief or something.

211
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,740
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich,

212
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,630
Radiolab and now we're going to ask
where are those voyager popes like right

213
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:40,960
now? I

214
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,720
mean, again, this is a story
we've been following forever,

215
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:45,340
and about five years ago,

216
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,420
producer Lynn Levy began to ask
yourself that question, where are they?

217
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,290
Because at that point, news was
starting to bubble up that the,

218
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,330
the divorce or probes were about to tip
toe their way across a truly amazing

219
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,840
threshold. And at that moment it wasn't
completely clear what was happening. So,

220
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,250
so here's what we reported.

221
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:10,460
Then we're going to break in at a certain
point and update things even further.

222
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:14,870
But Lynn began this story. We're
the last one. Liftoff. Okay.

223
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:19,190
So like in the point of the mission
wasn't really to deliver this record,

224
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:23,300
it was to go out and look at all the
planets in the outer solar system.

225
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,890
So starting in 1977 these two
little spaceships, two spacecraft,

226
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:32,030
voyager one and two went racing
away from Earth snapping pictures.

227
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,470
And so every time before your trip
reach another planet, you know,

228
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:38,360
all of the voyager people
would get together,

229
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:43,570
go into the imaging room and see the
pictures come from the outer solar system.

230
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,220
Do you remember seeing them? I remember
as a child saying life magazine,

231
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,980
you know, I was seven when
La Jolla was launched.

232
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:56,510
So this is [inaudible]
professor at Boston University.

233
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,730
As I grown up, she became
part of the voyager team.

234
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,990
All the pictures that you know,

235
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:02,600
as a kid you look at the
books and just say what,

236
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,460
how Knapton look out Jupiter logo.

237
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,470
You know, just to complete
revelations Saturn,

238
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,240
the image of Saturn technique
color like pink and look, reddish,

239
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:17,920
turquoise, color yellow. And
those rings just spectacular.

240
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,790
They could see active volcanoes on
one of the moons of Jupiter. Finally,

241
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,530
that vision of Neptune,

242
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,190
this like blue jewel,

243
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,300
really blue, it's all came from voyager.

244
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,670
We had no idea how they
look like before voyager.

245
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,660
Neptune was the last big cool planet
and it was the last thing they were

246
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:38,770
supposed to photograph.

247
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,570
After that the cameras were going
to be shut off to save energy,

248
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,700
but Kelsey Sagan convinced them to turn
voyager back to earth and take a final

249
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:53,140
picture. So on Valentine's Day, 1990, uh,

250
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,130
one of the ships slowly rotated
so it was facing back to earth

251
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,073
and

252
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,990
it snapped a picture. One last picture.

253
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,140
Describe it so it's mostly empty.

254
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,980
Um, it's, it's pretty dark.

255
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,760
You can see sort of streaks
of light coming from the sun

256
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,010
and then you honestly wouldn't notice
it if it wasn't pointed out to you.

257
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:26,750
But down in one corner, kind
of a suspended in a Sunbeam,

258
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,860
there is a very small dot.
Blue, a pale blue dot.

259
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,080
That was us in Carl sagans
words. Everyone you ever knew,

260
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,050
everyone you ever loved, every superstar.

261
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,760
If we corrupt politician, just
everyone in all of history,

262
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,260
everything is some total

263
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,050
think of the rivers that
blind they have run.

264
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:56,150
So that one indistinguishable group
could have momentary domination over a

265
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:00,150
fraction of that pixel.

266
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,130
It was one of those really
rare images every single day.

267
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:10,131
I hear from people who take that
Pale blue.so deeply to heart and was,

268
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,570
it was a complete reframing after
that that come out of a ton off.

269
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,470
But here's the thing, the
ships kept going, going,

270
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,720
going, going, drifting through
the darkness, going, going,

271
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,950
going. Even though they weren't
taking pictures anymore,

272
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,210
they were using like their other senses,

273
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,480
little instruments that detect
like how many particles are around,

274
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:37,530
what the temperature is.

275
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,400
So they were hurdling through this
empty space really fast measuring,

276
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,930
sending that data back and scientists
like that off where they're listening and

277
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,930
waiting for what was not clear,

278
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,470
but they knew at some point these
capsules would get to the edge,

279
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,210
the edge of what the solar system,
the solar system has an edge.

280
00:18:57,211 --> 00:19:00,450
I thought it was just a big spiral. Has
an edge. It's a, it's like a bubble.

281
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,580
See The sun has a wind

282
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,760
if we start as a wing,

283
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:10,630
but the sun has its own wind that
blows out through the solar system.

284
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,740
It's very fast.

285
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:16,741
It can be between 400 to 800
kilometers per second anyway,

286
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,200
blows out

287
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,700
from the sun past all the planets
and uh, it keeps everything else.

288
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,000
Ouch. Oh, so it's like blowing
up a balloon. Yeah, exactly.

289
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,350
The wind gives it a shape, right?

290
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:30,650
So these little things are cruising
out towards this edge, wherever it is.

291
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,170
Scientists don't quite know
where it is or what it is.

292
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,140
The guys in the control room are like
pegging the ships like, Hey, what's,

293
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,650
what's up? What do you see in the
ships? They're like, nothing. Well,

294
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,250
how about now? Not much. No nothing.

295
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,670
And how long before they
actually see something? 14

296
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,740
oh man, that's like driving through
Kansas but like a million times worse. But

297
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,040
there comes a day I end of 2004 where

298
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,860
they stopped listening for a
little while because the antenna,

299
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,230
NASA only has so many antennas and
they have to use them to listen to

300
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:03,230
everything. So for a little while
the voyager teams like, okay,

301
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:06,410
you guys over there can use the
antennas. We're going to lunch. Yeah,

302
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:08,480
I mean it's not like anything's
happened. Nothing's happening anyway.

303
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:11,870
It's been 14 goddamn years. Ask
yourself out guys. It's cool.

304
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,670
And they come back a few hours
later, start listening again and

305
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,700
it's happened very southern. Everything
is totally changed. All of a sudden,

306
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,410
boom.

307
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,880
The speed of the wind drop from
around three 80 kilometers per second

308
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,753
to a hundred

309
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,560
instantly, like just all in one sentence.

310
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,530
And then everything out
there started to get

311
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,620
messy, very [inaudible],

312
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,550
much more turbulent. And
before particles are also, um,

313
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,090
behaving a very different way.

314
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,850
The fields are very, um, we are

315
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,160
the fields, the magnetic field.
So just like the sun has a wind,

316
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,900
the sun has a magnetic field as well.

317
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,560
The field starts at the sun and then
curves out in this kind of graceful arc

318
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:10,950
through the solar system
in the how the sun rotates,

319
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,010
it's create what people
call [inaudible] cart.

320
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,370
You know how like a skirt will
flair if you spin around real fast.

321
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,190
[inaudible] that's apparently kind
of what this field looks like.

322
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,510
But way out there, it seemed
like the skirt started to fray,

323
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,820
maybe tear a little threads had broken
off and it seemed to be floating around

324
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:34,770
on their own. Not connected to anything.
So what does this all mean? I mean,

325
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:39,360
if the fields are breaking down and the
wind is dying down and you said the wind

326
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:41,820
is what actually creates the
space of the solar system,

327
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,590
does this mean we're out to know?

328
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,340
I kind of thought that was what was
happening. But no, it's not out.

329
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,440
And it's not quite in,

330
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,400
it's in the edge of the
bubble. It's in the air. Yeah.

331
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,790
But it's not like, I'm not like a
little thin edge. It's a, it's a thick,

332
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,150
thick edge. So the edge is and
just a little line that you cross.

333
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,970
It's the place.

334
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,780
Yeah.

335
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,780
And while we listened the two voyager
ships moved through this edge for several

336
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,283
years.

337
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:18,850
Then something very interesting
happen is that the wind on [inaudible]

338
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,743
stopped

339
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,730
like completely stopped. Yeah.
So now we're out. No, no.

340
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,850
I mean this is what people thought.

341
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,960
But the other measurements like
temperature and number of particles,

342
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,930
the magnetic field doesn't tell
us that we are out of the bubble.

343
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,000
Nature surprised us again.

344
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,930
So now we think there's a place at the
edge of our solar system [inaudible] the

345
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:48,370
edge of the edge. That's
utterly still no wind at all.

346
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,210
A pause. People are
Connie stagnation layer.

347
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,560
And there is a big discussion why this
layer exist and how thick it is and by

348
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:02,320
how thick it is, she
means when will it end?

349
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,650
Because once we get past this. So
has anything ever crossed this,

350
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,700
the boundary before? No.

351
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:12,790
This will be the first manmade object
to live any star and a voyager was like

352
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:20,330
right there smelling, touching
that boundary. You know,
you only do those things

353
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,480
first once like your first kiss,

354
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,740
your first taste of alcohol,
your first time driving a car.

355
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,350
The first time you see the ocean,
these things open up a whole new world.

356
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,240
First time out of the solar system. So
when is it going to freaking happen?

357
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,220
It might've happened
while we were talking.

358
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,420
Yeah. We're thinking
from now. Any moment now.

359
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,170
Next couple months or three years from
now, four years from now. It's close.

360
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,200
Every day I opened my Google alert for
voyager and I look and see did it happen

361
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:58,140
today? Because if it happens before the
show goes out, I'm really pissed. Yeah.

362
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,980
Every day it's the first thing you
do in the morning. Oh, alright, good.

363
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,090
Like the third thing

364
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:11,310
[inaudible]

365
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:15,580
okay. So when a pedestrian levy left
that story at that 0.5 years ago,

366
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,010
that seemed like the voyager probes,

367
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,160
we're in this weird liminal space kind
of stuck somewhere in the edge of the

368
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,670
edge of our planetary neighborhood
and that the out moment,

369
00:24:26,671 --> 00:24:30,810
that transition moment could happen
at any time. That's where we left it,

370
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,400
which seemed honestly kind of frustrating.
Like we did the story too soon,

371
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,080
you know, like that
happens every so often.

372
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,320
So we decided to call Marav
Ofer back. She's the scientist,

373
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,230
you are in the story who is
part of the voyage or team.

374
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,220
And we asked her to pick up
the story, like what happened.

375
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,540
Okay. So since then we
will waiting. Right, right.

376
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,640
And the stories is fascinating and a
little complicated too because this was

377
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:59,040
back in 2012 right.

378
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,580
She says shortly after our story was
released, a couple of months later,

379
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,910
so was in August, around August,

380
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:10,080
2012 but six months after our story
particles. This was fascinating.

381
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:13,950
The energetic particles
if I'm the sun, um,

382
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,180
dropped to some people thought, oh no
sun particles, that must mean we're out.

383
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,560
But couple of days later
they came back, Huh.

384
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,920
And then there was the same intensity
as before and then they dropped again.

385
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,440
It's almost failed that somebody had
open a window and they closed the window

386
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,170
and then open the window and
close the window. Oh Wow.

387
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,220
So it's kind of weird errors where
you expect the classic crossing,

388
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,910
it should be sudden, it should be,
oh, you're in or you're out. Yeah.

389
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,460
You don't have this intermediate, I'm
in, I'm out. I mean, I'm out. I know.

390
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,800
So, so this was not the classic textbook
and was very like, what's going on?

391
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,640
And there was very heated
discussions because, you know,

392
00:25:56,641 --> 00:26:00,000
you're waiting to say to the public and
we really crossed the solid system for

393
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:03,840
the first time or not. And we cannot
say that must've been frustrating.

394
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,580
Super Frustrating.

395
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,970
And she says, scientists started arguing,
right? I mean there was a bunch of,

396
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:09,360
uh,

397
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,390
conferences and meetings where they got
together and the scientist essentially

398
00:26:12,391 --> 00:26:16,290
broke into factions. Like you have one
faction. There was like we are out.

399
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,690
Another faction was like no, no, we're in,

400
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,160
and she says at one of those meetings
there was a vote. Are we in or are we out?

401
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,180
And I and I just felt this is
crazy. This is such a major,

402
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,710
my stone. It's like, you know, vote on
it. It has nothing to do with exactly.

403
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,160
It was almost like Christopher
Columbus, right? Did we really arrived.

404
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,640
America's evolved and it was just crazy.

405
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:44,400
But she says they did vote and
the vote was still well inside.

406
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,660
So towards the end of 2012 that's
what they thought. We're still in.

407
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,830
But something changed and and the
something is a sound we were hearing

408
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,180
or more

409
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,860
around the time of these arguments.
The voyager was sending back sound.

410
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,160
The voyager doesn't have a
lot of energy on board, right?

411
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,410
So they have a tape recorder. So
there's a tape recorder. Really? Yes.

412
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,190
I think it's an eight track. What?
Like an eight track eight track. Jan,

413
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:14,990
I think it turns out it's true

414
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,830
there. There are eight tracks on both of
the probes that are capturing ultra low

415
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:24,360
frequency plasma waves, two to three
Kilo Hertz, which you can actually hear.

416
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,570
No, that whoosh, that is just a
background of the power supply.

417
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,890
That's just the sound of the voyager
itself idling basically cruising through

418
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,820
empty space,

419
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,261
but she says,

420
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:39,470
when you listen to the following recording
this what you're about to hear is

421
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:44,530
eight months of time from late 2012 into
2013 eight months collapse into a tiny

422
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:48,680
clip. What you hear
are these little swells

423
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,250
[inaudible]. Here's one.

424
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,960
There's another. You'll have
those ramps. Now the spare,

425
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,850
it gets kind of confusing. The
essentially Murav says those swells.

426
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,460
That's the voyager space
craft colliding with some new

427
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,550
galactic stuff, so you're hearing, okay,

428
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,830
there is a ramp of density as you
go into the interstellar space.

429
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,970
I had thought that those sounds,

430
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:28,170
one of those two sounds is the voyager
bursting out of our solar system,

431
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:29,430
but she told me no,

432
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,373
no.

433
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,820
What it is is the sound of the
voyager already on the other side.

434
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,350
It's the voids. You're basically saying,

435
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,190
I'm in a new space now and after
some analysis in this part,

436
00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:44,690
I cannot explain a NASA
pinpointed the ejection moment,

437
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:49,691
the crossover moment to just be
for the first of those two swells.

438
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,350
So if this is the first swell

439
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,260
[inaudible] just before
that, maybe right there

440
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,850
like right. Yeah. That's when we left.

441
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,003
It's so

442
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:13,990
we finally escaped official exit
date 25th of August of 2012 right?

443
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,940
Sun Is Right.

444
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,130
So now we have a human manufacturer
that has left the sphere of the sun,

445
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,250
you know, that's on the other side

446
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,850
in the other ocean. Yeah. It's
like I'm, I'm, I don't know,

447
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:50,851
it's a bit of swayed too to see all this
incredible data that voyager is giving

448
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:54,220
us and I want more, I would
like another mission there.

449
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,520
It's almost like somebody give you like
a taste look how interesting this day

450
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:03,170
that he's and booked there
living. Speaking of leaving more,

451
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,150
Rob says that we can expect to communicate
with the voyager probes for about

452
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,770
another eight to 10 years,

453
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,910
but then eventually they
will lose power and go dark

454
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:14,730
recording.

455
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,080
What time is it? It's 1133 on one minute.

456
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,820
We're getting close. It's getting so
dark. It's a sliver of a sliver left.

457
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,960
30 seconds.

458
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,360
It's getting dark. It's okay.

459
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,630
Hello. Look, rather than Leiser 29 yeah,

460
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,670
the streetlights I've turned off.

461
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,870
We are about 10 seconds
from totally clear.

462
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,220
Oh my God. Look at that. Look,

463
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,890
look up at the sun. Oh,

464
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,400
[inaudible]. Oh my God.

465
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,010
It's incredible. I've tried

466
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,410
black.in the middle of the sky with
white halos coming from Mexico.

467
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,890
Oh my goodness.

468
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,803
Star bags.

469
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,733
The stars.

470
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,030
[inaudible] who's Venus?
There's a plane and then there's

471
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,820
[inaudible]. It's still pretty. It's still

472
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,730
[inaudible].

473
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,980

sent in the recordings.
