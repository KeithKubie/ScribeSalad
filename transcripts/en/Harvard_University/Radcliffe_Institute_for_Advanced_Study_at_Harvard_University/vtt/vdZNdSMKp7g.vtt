[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.520
- Thank you so much for
that wonderful introduction.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.223
And also thank you all
so much for coming.

00:00:10.223 --> 00:00:12.140
I think I can echo
practically everybody who's

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.450
given a presentation
among the fellows

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.090
that this has been one the most
fabulous sabbatical experiences

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.660
possible, in every way
possible, from staff

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.740
to every fellow that I've had
a chance to interact with.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.640
I've learned a
tremendous amount,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.360
coming in contact with you all.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.630
But you will see that I
am an unfinished work.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.030
You will see that this
project is evolving.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.490
It is evolving as the
days are ticking by.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.620
And I mean, in two
senses of course--

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.370
politically the world is
changing in a constant way.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.380
And in addition to
that, we literally

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.270
are finding new evidence
and new work, new ways

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.290
to try to construct an argument
about international borders

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.725
as the days are unfolding.

00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:58.100
And we just started playing
with some new data last week.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.620
And I'm going to have the
nerve to show it to you today.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.260
So that kind of makes it fun.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.410
That makes it, to me, sort
of an interesting experience

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.800
to run something by
you, if you don't mind.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.450
So that's going
to-- this talk is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.670
going to have that flavor
of running something

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.400
by you for the next 45 minutes.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.170
And what I started
this project, I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.747
started collecting this
data about five years ago.

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:23.330
You'll see it's a
very data intensive,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.935
and there's no sort
easy obvious way

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:26.810
to collect information
on the sorts of things

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.000
that I want to collect
information on.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.500
I started collecting
the information

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.730
about five years ago.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.700
And when I started
this, honestly, I

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.860
could not see what was coming.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.740
I really did not
think that something

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.210
like a shutdown of the
United States government

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.240
would depend on what
kind of architecture

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.940
we would or would not
put on our border.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.250
I could not imagine,
for example,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.740
that Brexit would somehow hinge
on the presence of the state

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.122
at the Irish border.

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:01.580
Wow, I'd never-- that's not
something I would have thought.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.330
I never would have
thought, for example,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.120
that you would
see a country that

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.930
was once says developed
as Venezuela had been,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.960
that it would sort of force
people up to the border

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.770
and then refuse humanitarian
aid right at the edge

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.520
of its political authority
to assert control.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.910
So all of those things,
to me, are just--

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.600
how did the world all of a
sudden get so territorial?

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.920
And so this is kind
of what is motivating

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.810
this project as a whole.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.800
And in some ways, this is
a sharp turn in my work.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.240
And I'll tell you how.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.580
International political
economy, the way I studied it,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.210
I was very interested in
things like market integration

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.910
and constructing
a global economy.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.040
When I studied
international institutions,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.590
I focused on things like
international cooperation

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.020
and things that states
did across borders

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.120
that created joint gains.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.920
When I studied
international law,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.860
and in particular
international human rights law,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.000
it was all about consistency
of the law across space,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.760
and most especially it was
about the universal aspects

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.320
of human rights.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.382
So what are all of
these things missing?

00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:14.310
Space.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.610
There's nothing spatial
about anything I just said.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.290
And so this is sort of
like the lens I had on.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.350
I think it was sort of
this liberal world order

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.750
sort of a lens.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.720
And then, shock of shocks,
we find the world sort

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.760
of chopping into
increasingly sort

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.360
of spatialized nation-states
that are reinforcing

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.070
their borders in many ways.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.370
And this is what I really
want to try to explore today.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.160
The project that I'm going to
present today, like I said,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.880
it is evolving.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.970
It's a work in progress.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.240
It's got two pieces to it.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.880
One concentrates on structures.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.010
That's what I'm going
to concentrate on today.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.530
There are going to be whiffs
of the other part of what

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.770
I'm doing-- it
concentrates on sentiments.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.530
Sentiments looks
at how attitudes

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.770
have changed about borders.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.430
When was it in time and
in space that people

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.890
started thinking about
international borders

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.030
as places--

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.220
not so much places of
opportunity and places

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.940
of trade and places of
connection and places

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.880
where we could create
cross-border multicultural

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.950
experiences.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.700
When did they start
thinking about borders

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.410
as dangerous places?

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.880
Places of risk?

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.860
Places of high crime?

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.220
Places in which the
other was something

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.680
to be feared instead of
something to be sort of reached

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.950
out to and contacted?

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.870
So we're-- part of this
project is going to be looking

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.830
at a broad range of
texts, public opinion,

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.140
it's going to have an
experimental component to it

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.760
as well.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.290
That is in the planning stages.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.948
That was way too early
to inflict on you today.

00:04:51.948 --> 00:04:53.490
But I just want you
to know that that

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.620
is where this is going as well.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.070
So structures are a big
part of what I'm doing--

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.720
today that's the focus.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.150
But sentiments, and sort
of linking up how fears,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.730
how perceptions, sort of link
up with these structures,

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.690
is really where this project
is going to be headed.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.630
So it is true, I think,
it's fair to say,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.020
that political space has
mattered for most of history.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.670
So I think that approximately
three generations of people

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.710
learned to order the
world by reference

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.340
to a physical political
division-- the Iron Curtain.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.920
And as it fell, and looked like
it was being muted over time,

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.230
many people began
to imagine somehow

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.400
that the world that we live
in is becoming increasingly

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.700
borderless.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.700
And what happened I think
in the heart of Europe

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.650
was practically a metaphor
for the world as a whole.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.330
And we imagined that there's
almost nothing stopping us

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.780
from reaching out across
countries to anybody,

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.870
especially anybody in
this room in particular.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.010
Almost feels like there
is nothing preventing you

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.280
from reaching a colleague,
from reaching a family member,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.260
from reaching someone
else in another country.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.250
We live in this ultra-connected
kind of world here

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.568
that sort of shows up in these
pairs of Facebook friends.

00:06:13.568 --> 00:06:15.360
The other place that
shows up as in the way

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.680
that we talk about the world.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.200
A whiff of sentiment
again, if you

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.220
want to think of it that way.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.800
So one way to
think about this is

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.920
that we were living in an
era that certainly seeped

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.780
into global discourse as well.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.000
And just to take a
quick look at this,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.040
you can look at Ngrams, which is
the website that has basically

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.920
made available, with
an easy to access

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.360
tool, of all the books
in English over time.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.510
And you can put in your terms
with a comma between them,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.810
and you can sort
of find how dense

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.150
in the world's
English publications

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.090
found in libraries
that language is.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.107
Well, this gives you the
word borderless over time.

00:06:58.107 --> 00:06:59.440
I might have used globalization.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.320
It looks almost just like this.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.920
But borderless-- this is the
word borderless over time.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.780
And so you can see that there's
this sharp, sharp upturn

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.070
starting around 1990.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.100
I would say 1990
to the year 2000

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.860
is this kind of heyday of
thinking about the world

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.900
as globalizing,
thinking about the world

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.750
as being a borderless place,
and thinking about the world

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.170
is being increasingly
hyperconnected.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.020
And very few people, I
think, at least people

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:33.480
that I came in contact
with, very few intellectuals

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.480
were very familiar with a
different set of circumstances

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.420
being constructed by political
forces on the ground.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.790
When the Berlin
Wall fell in 1989,

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:50.880
16 countries had walls on
their international borders.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.030
But if you were to fast
forward and look at today,

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.610
a third of the world's
countries have completed

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.090
or are building barriers on
their international borders

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.960
with their neighbors.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.870
And of the 51
fortified boundaries

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.370
that were built up
between countries

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.370
since the end of World
War II, about half

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:16.040
were constructed between the
years 2000 and the years 2014.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.690
Those are existing data.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.560
My group has been trying
to document since that time

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.340
the creation of new fences,
the creation of new walls,

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:31.490
new barriers, and we cannot
keep up with the number of plans

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.640
that governments around the
world have for fortifying

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.740
their borders,
building new walls.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.042
Which is to say,
we are not alone.

00:08:40.042 --> 00:08:41.750
The United States is
not the only country

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.200
in the world that is
having this obsession

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.392
with its international borders.

00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:49.100
If we were to turn
back to that discourse

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.380
again and look for a moment
about the words being used,

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.470
we would see that
border discourse

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.950
has been changing over time.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:01.770
So this is that, again, the word
borderless found in the Ngrams.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.540
And if we were to add
another look for a word,

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.628
look for the word
border security.

00:09:09.628 --> 00:09:10.670
That's what you see here.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.140
The red line here.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.570
So it starts out way
below border list.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.370
But you can see it taking off
very sharply in the year 2000

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.440
especially after the year 2005.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.260
This only takes us up to, I
think 2009 in this picture.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.788
It would continue to
accelerate over time.

00:09:29.788 --> 00:09:32.080
And it is not just in sort
of in the intellectual world

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.540
somehow that this
sort of concern

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.840
with international
borders has turned almost

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.832
into an obsession.

00:09:38.832 --> 00:09:41.290
If we were to go almost at the
opposite end of the spectrum

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.370
and look at the way states talk
about international borders,

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.920
if we were to go to
perhaps what we can think

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.380
of as the sort of central
organ of international security

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.020
in the world, the United
Nations Security Council,

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.280
we would find something
interesting as well.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.730
What I did was I looked at every
resolution and every decision

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.390
of the United Nations
Security Council over the--

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.775
since about the
year 2000, and found

00:10:06.775 --> 00:10:07.900
something very interesting.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.950
Looking for the word border.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.270
And this is what you see over
time, from the word 2000--

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.170
from the year 2000
to the year 2014,

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.030
we see something really
quite interesting here.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.750
First of all, the obvious thing
is the increase in citations

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.010
overall.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.420
So borders are becoming a really
important and central idea

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.753
for international security.

00:10:29.753 --> 00:10:31.420
But there's something
else going on here

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.640
as well that's really
quite interesting.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.760
That is the context of thinking
about borders is shifting.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.010
So we would expect the
Security Council to be thinking

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.500
about security, of course.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.035
But the way they think about
borders is starting to change.

00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:46.660
Whereas there are
some of these earlier

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.070
debates in the 2000s concentrate
on drawing a legitimate line,

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.730
coming to negotiated
conclusions about where

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.230
the international
border is or should be,

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.840
the context is changing.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.430
Not just to settle your
borders legitimately,

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.380
but to control your borders.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.360
To create border security.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.270
To put control
measures into place.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.420
So I think that is another
sort of telling aspect,

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.570
this sort of shift
to being concerned

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.870
about international borders.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.880
Now, why should we care
about international borders?

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.380
I mean, aren't these
spaces that are

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.980
kind of empty of people and
kind of kind of out there

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.110
with the tumbling
tumbleweeds, sort of thing?

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.420
Like you see a journalist,
a windswept journalist

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.760
on the border, telling you
how there's no emergency.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.460
And of course, it's usually
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.890
It turns out no,
that's not quite right.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.140
Borders are places,
are very important

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.600
forms of geospatial governance.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.360
And this is because
people live there.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.450
And I mean a lot of people
live in border areas.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.768
In fact, I looked at a
band of 100 kilometers

00:11:55.768 --> 00:11:57.810
from an international
border all around the world

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.470
and found that 25% of
the world's population

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.890
lives within a land border.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.140
Not even counting the coasts--

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.400
we know a lot of people
live on the coasts.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.030
Unfortunately, about 50%
of all violent incidents

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.450
and civil wars and
interstate conflict

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:22.050
also occur in the
same 100 km band.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.890
Of course, borders are hubs of
international movement as well.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.100
So some $6 trillion dollars
in international exports

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.100
go overland.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.050
It is a small part of the total.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.390
It's a 10% of the
total global trade,

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.990
but that is not a small
amount of movement overland

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.970
across international borders.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.390
And 25 million refugees,
many, many of which

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.060
have had at least
part of their movement

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.670
from one country to
another traveled overland.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.850
And so I think that
international borders

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.300
are focal institutions
of authoritative control

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.950
by the state.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:04.200
They serve to
demarcate us from them.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.560
Really importantly, they don't
try to block out the other,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.720
they try to filter the other.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.140
So they are efforts to
filter the movement of people

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.960
and goods, and in
some sense this

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.730
is how sort of
the Weberian state

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.660
keeps its exclusive
control over territory--

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:27.960
by creating signs and signals
and structures of its authority

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.520
at international borders.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.270
So we're used to be thinking
about how states are governed--

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.350
are they democratic?

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.930
Are they autocratic?

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.610
Are they inclusive or exclusive?

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.300
Sort of thinking
about internal groups.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.050
But I think we should
be think about where

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.260
they govern as well.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.410
Where they govern
matters as well.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.760
Why?

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.810
Because what a state
does on its borders

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:54.010
sends a signal to
a domestic audience

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.310
that they take as a
perception of their safety

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.650
and their security, or not.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.050
So it impinges on
the extent to which

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.760
they understand themselves
as secure from the outside.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.370
Internationally, to
govern in this space

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.480
is also to send a signal
outward in a very important way.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.960
To signal cooperation,
sharing, or to signal

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.970
hostility and suspicion.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:25.075
So where is as important as
how, in some very basic sense.

00:14:25.075 --> 00:14:27.550
Let me just give
you one example.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.450
Where governance happens
has strong consequences.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.260
It matters whether refugees are
allowed to enter and to make

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.930
claims or are
repelled at the border

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.840
and not allowed to
make those claims.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.870
So it's very much where
things happen spatially

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.070
that matter a good deal.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.510
So I'm trying to work on this
concept of thinking about,

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.220
how can we capture that?

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.490
How can we capture this idea,
of sort of how much commitment

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.200
a state has to make
in the border--

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.140
its physical border,
its political border,

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.640
international border--

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.880
a place where it
demonstrates its authority?

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.320
And I'm experimenting, trying
to develop a concept of border

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.240
orientation.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.670
What does-- why orientation?

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.220
First of all, we had a heck
of a time, a devil of a time,

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.610
trying to think of what
the right word is for this.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.638
But we've come up with this
idea of border orientation.

00:15:23.638 --> 00:15:25.680
And what we mean by this--
well first of all what

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.600
the word orientation
itself means,

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.000
it's the relative
physical position

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.340
or direction of something.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.300
So in political science, we
think of using the term policy

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.520
orientation, and
that signals to us

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.650
some kind of a spectrum from
liberal to conservative.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.180
In the business
literature, there's

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.530
a big literature on
entrepreneurial orientation.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.080
And this is a literature
that sort of thinks

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.780
of a spectrum of risk
acceptance or risk

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.800
aversion on the part
of business entities.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.130
In psychology, there's
also references of course

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.080
to a character orientation--

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.330
introversion, extroversion,
and any number

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.210
of scales that we could
think of to measure

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:12.680
the character of a person's
psychological makeup.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.280
We defined border
orientation as the extent

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:22.700
to which the state is committed
to the public and authoritative

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:28.790
display of control over
territory and entry and exit

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.230
at its national borders.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.230
So really when are we
kind of thinking of that,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.102
we're talking
about a commitment.

00:16:35.102 --> 00:16:37.310
So we're not talking about
sort of fleeting attention

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.740
to the border here or there.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.140
It's a state kind
of a characteristic.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.260
That is, these are policies that
are implemented by the state.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.660
Vigilantes wouldn't
count, necessarily

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.950
in this kind of a concept.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.380
It's a display of control.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.240
So there are a lot
of ways a state might

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.630
control its borders.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.000
If it's not a display of
control, we're not counting it.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.369
So there are other
ways to control

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:09.200
your borders-- land mines
might be one, for example.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.359
Less visible detectors
might be another.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.760
There's no doubt
those are control.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.075
But those are not the
kind of public displays

00:17:16.075 --> 00:17:17.450
that we're trying
to get at here.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.980
They don't create the same
visual sense of enclosure

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.520
that we are-- and safety that
we are trying to get at here.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.110
And then, and finally, this
idea of control, really

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.450
a better word I should
be using is filter.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.210
Because what I'm really
very interested in here is,

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.230
the state can control the
terms of entry and exit.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.700
They're not just interested
in blocking everybody out.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.710
Very few states are
interested in that.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:46.040
Instead they want to
say who, on what terms,

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.390
what, what goods on what
terms, rather than trying

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.220
to block out the
world in its entirety.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.640
Now this idea of
border orientation,

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.070
it cannot be directly observed.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.290
We have to be--
think of ways that we

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.800
might be able to uncover
or say something about

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.540
or collect evidence
that's suggestive

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.360
of this idea of
border orientation.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.630
And so the
observational strategy

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.300
that I have been sort of working
on here with a large group

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.880
of people is to
think about looking

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.710
at border infrastructure.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.450
Why infrastructure?

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.540
Visible.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.250
So this is something,
this is an image

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.760
that's meaningful
politically and socially.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.620
And it also does
represent a commitment.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.800
You don't put a wall or a fence
down usually and tear it up

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.510
in a week.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.880
It is something that sort
of means to stay there.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.910
It has a certain
stickiness to it.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.970
And the other sort
of reason that I

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.470
think is really important, that
sometimes we sort of forget,

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:50.240
too, is the extent to which
infrastructure creates what has

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.640
been called logistical power--

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.940
the ability to shape
the physical environment

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.730
to achieve state
or social purposes.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:03.390
Shaping the environment here is
really very important as well.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.570
So-- and this is something
that liberal theory would just

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.820
miss completely.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.660
When we talk about sort
shaping people's behavior,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.670
we usually think of law.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.180
We usually think of incentives.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.950
But we don't so much
think of this kind

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.930
of concrete nature of
the kinds of structures

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.030
that we're thinking about here.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:30.620
I'm thinking about organizing
my study of these border areas

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.740
in kind of waves, if you
want to think of it that way.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.150
The border is a line.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.513
We can think of that line.

00:19:36.513 --> 00:19:38.180
But we can think of
the function of sort

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.090
of defending against someone
coming in the first-- defending

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.120
or deterring, that is preventing
entry in the first place.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.040
We can think about the function
of filtering through structures

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.660
that are meant to make sure
that you are legitimate.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.410
And then we can also
think of a little bit

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.050
of ex ante structure as well--

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.630
I'm sorry, ex post
structure as well.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.060
So some people get
in, some goods get in,

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.890
that we don't approve of.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.720
We can be thinking
of a zone right

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.600
after the border that is meant
to see if we can catch up

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.020
with the illicit activities
that have made it through.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:18.480
So I'm thinking of ex ante
defense, entry, and ex post

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.815
enforcement around the border.

00:20:20.815 --> 00:20:22.440
So let's start with
the first of those.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.800
That would be the border walls.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.330
That's kind of what I began
the discussion with here.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.510
Border walls have some
functionality of course,

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:35.070
and they have a lot
of symbolism for sure.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.360
We would not be--

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.370
we would not be even
talking about some

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.380
of the political and
public policy issues

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.750
we are even discussing
today were it

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:47.610
not for the fact that
walls carry such strong

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:51.780
psychological and symbolic
meaning for people.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:56.580
Border walls are quintessential
symbols of separation.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.610
They void permission-seeking.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.470
You can't stand
in front of a wall

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.450
and make your case for entry.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.070
Can't do that.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.990
They forbid legal trade.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.050
Almost by definition, you
cannot trade legally where

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.125
there's a wall on a border.

00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:13.710
You have to go to
a port of entry,

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.170
which I'll talk about a
little bit in just a minute.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.900
They may have psychological
and attitudinal consequences,

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.210
which will be a part of my
research eventually as well.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.290
So we're going to be folding
in a little bit of the look

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.390
at some experimental
evidence here,

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.800
where our respondents
are queued with knowledge

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:37.295
that a foreign government is
building a wall on their side.

00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:38.670
We've already sort
of tested this

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.087
in the case of
India and Pakistan.

00:21:40.087 --> 00:21:41.280
It's pretty interesting.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.920
When you sort of
ask Indians how they

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.230
think their relationship
with Pakistan is evolving,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.000
they'll give you an answer.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.710
And then you say, well, Pakistan
is reinforcing its border

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.600
barriers with India.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:59.060
Now how do you think relations
are going with Pakistan?

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.710
Significantly worse.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.420
Significantly worse.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.150
So that's just been a little
trial balloon that we floated,

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.850
but that is exactly
the kind of meaning

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.710
that I'm giving to
this kind of notion

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.700
of bearing this kind of
psychological impact.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.360
Does it affect perceptions
of official relations?

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.060
Does that affect the idea
of interpersonal trust?

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.040
Similarity and difference.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.960
Well, so that's what
the plan is to do

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.790
when we think of border walls.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:28.970
But just for now I can tell
you that for sure the number

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.360
of border walls and
fences in existence

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.928
has gone up very dramatically.

00:22:33.928 --> 00:22:34.970
This is around the world.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.530
These are border pairs.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.180
So this is very rough data.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.980
This is just country A
and country B, yes or no,

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.790
they have a border, it's
the number of those.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:45.740
A border wall or fence,
and it's the number

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.910
of those around the world.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.493
We're working pretty
hard to see if we

00:22:48.493 --> 00:22:52.010
do a lot better than that to
say country A and country B

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.300
have one of those.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.860
Instead, what we're
trying to do is

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:59.450
to be very precise
about the geolocation

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:00.680
of these structures.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:05.300
Be very precise about when
they were put into place.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.990
Because then you can start
thinking about crime diversion,

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.800
local disruption, and
even symbolic effects that

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.820
start to crop up in the
localized discourse as well.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.410
So the more we can
fight and get more

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.540
precise about the
locations, the more we

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.930
can do the kind of
microresearch that would end up

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.000
to be quite a bit--

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.520
quite a bit more interesting
than just saying there

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.070
was a wall between two states.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:32.090
So that's one thing.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:35.640
That's a pretty strong sort
of indicator, if you will,

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.808
of a state's border orientation.

00:23:37.808 --> 00:23:38.600
But that's not all.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.430
Let's go in kind
of one level now.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.900
That would be for defense,
maybe deterrence, possibly.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.030
But now let's go to the
places where states are trying

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.040
to filter at their borders.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.190
And these would be
border crossings.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.900
Border crossings,
let me tell you,

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.980
are places that exhibit
highly conflictual impulses.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.090
These are places where
roads are connectors.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.910
And yet the-- a border is
crossing them like this.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.450
So on the one hand, we
have kind of this impulse

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.220
to want to connect
with a neighbor.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.650
That is why we have a
road in the first place.

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:17.580
That's evidence of a motive to
expand, to move, to connect.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.850
These are also, of course,
conduits for externalities,

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:23.000
if you want to think of the
movement of illegal goods

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.660
or illegal human activities
of various kinds.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.970
And then they meet
the borders, which

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.920
are the institutions
of state control, where

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.500
difference of
authority is enforced,

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.683
where extraction takes place.

00:24:35.683 --> 00:24:37.100
So you might have
to pay something

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.050
when you cross the border.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:43.020
And where protection from
the other is on display.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.910
So we have these kind of
contradictory confluence going

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:47.900
on here.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.780
So border crossings are
state's highest priority

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.580
to show their
competence, if you want

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.360
to think about it that way.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.590
They sort of-- they
represent-- basically

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:01.160
think of roads globally are
a network of connection,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.100
think of the state and it's
border being the gatekeeper.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.140
And a gatekeeper
functions very important,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.800
the essential locus of
control in any network

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.420
is the role as gatekeeper.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.340
So states give this very,
very, very high priority.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.140
So now how do you find the
world's border crossings?

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.370
You superimpose a map
of the political world,

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:26.330
international borders,
over a global map

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.490
of international-- of roads.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:33.440
And wherever you
see an intersection,

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.650
you presumably have
a border crossing.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:37.730
So that's what we did.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.723
We superimposed two maps
here, just like this.

00:25:40.723 --> 00:25:42.140
These are the gates
of the world--

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.390
the red balls, if you want
to think about it that way,

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.650
are the gates of the world.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:47.870
These are two-- this is the
product of two satellite

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.580
images overlapping each other.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.230
Each red ball is a crossing.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.120
It's an opportunity
for official actors

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.640
to play national gatekeeper.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.160
And so this sort
of gives us a sense

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.012
of where we should be
looking for border crossings.

00:26:01.012 --> 00:26:01.970
But a couple of things.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.270
It's difficult. It's very
difficult. Roads evolve.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.180
More are built, dirt
paths become highways.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.250
This is not, for
now, a time series.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:15.620
So this is what we
could see as of 1995.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.980
So these mostly are
still all in place.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.648
But there are many
more, probably.

00:26:20.648 --> 00:26:22.190
In fact I will give
you two problems.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.760
Not only are more roads built,
but technology evolves in ways

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.740
that we can see more roads.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:33.130
So now we've got a data set that
basically produces some 9,000

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.380
border crossings in the world.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.200
This one produced about 1,200.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.560
So we've got a lot of work
to do, let me tell you.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.850
And it's real tricky
sometimes to sort out

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.230
the false positives.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.060
Places-- this is
very interesting

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:52.190
actually-- places where the
road comes up to the border

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.850
and the computer thinks
it's going to cross.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.850
That's what the images say,
but no, it's a sharp right turn

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.160
and it goes along the border.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.340
Now, what is that?

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.930
What do you think that is?

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.960
That is a patrol road.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.480
That is state presence in a
very interesting way, which

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.100
I don't have anything on today.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:15.020
But many ideas for figuring out
where those things are as well.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.330
That's a mobile presence
along the border, when

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.610
you see a sharp turn like that.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.530
So this is what
we have right now.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:25.040
And what we can do is we can
throw undergraduate effort

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.080
at this.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:32.900
We can look at every one of
these crossings, and we can--

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.310
well, this produces exact--

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.840
almost exact latitude
and longitude.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.020
So we can go in with that
latitude and longitude,

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.702
and we can say what is
going on at those borders?

00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:42.410
What is going on?

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.940
What structures do we see?

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.190
We're coding for
official buildings,

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.380
and we can judge that
by both their proximity

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.190
and their symmetry.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:51.750
Those are the two major
things we're looking for.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.680
We're coding whether we see
barriers across the road,

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.110
and we're coding for whether
we a capacity to inspect.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.610
And you can tell
that a lot of times

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.270
by the structure of the lanes.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.670
They swing out, they pull--

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.920
pull cars or trucks to the side.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.320
And the better developed
that system, the more

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:14.810
dedicated that state
is to filtering.

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.240
So then what we end up
with are two extremes--

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.520
I'm just showing you
two extremes right here.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.600
These are so easy.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.940
These two are
super easy to code,

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.700
because it's just so obvious
that the Burkina Faso

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.160
border does not
have anything there

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.210
and it is quite the opposite
on the US-Mexican border here

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:36.370
with a very, very high
filtering capacity.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.850
The in-between
cases are so hard.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.650
Let me just say,
they are very hard.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.560
You know, "is that a building?"

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.960
sometimes we use the
street view and we

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.215
go in and try to look
at it horizontally, too.

00:28:48.215 --> 00:28:48.800
Ah, It's.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.570
A gas station, it's not--

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:51.980
it's something else.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.620
But it's not what we
thought it was sometimes.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.920
So when we can we try to
check horizontally as well.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.050
Well, with this
kind of an approach,

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.180
you can develop basically
this little kind

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:06.360
of a border presence
scale, if you want

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.050
to think about it that way.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:11.880
And when you take this
scale, from green meaning go,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.370
nobody's going to
stop you probably,

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.920
and on the other end
very, very high structure,

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.460
all kinds of capacity to
stop you if they want to,

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.520
you can then look at the
whole world this way.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.070
Replace those homogeneous
balls with a very

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.430
heterogeneous
collection of border

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.515
crossing data from
around the world.

00:29:31.515 --> 00:29:33.390
So there are some things
are going to hit you

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.710
between the eye on this.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.420
Some things are absolutely going
to hit you between the eye.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.040
US is one of the best fortified
countries in the world

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.358
on its borders already.

00:29:50.358 --> 00:29:51.900
Now this is not
walls here, mind you.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.680
This is not walls.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.720
This is just the border
crossings I was talking about.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.762
What else is interesting?

00:29:55.762 --> 00:29:56.760
Look at that.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.980
We see Schengen
right here, don't we?

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:03.150
That's basically Schengen-- this
is the outer edge of Schengen.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:06.765
And this has a more
authoritarian history.

00:30:06.765 --> 00:30:08.640
It's got a little bit
of a different history.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.900
And what else are we seeing here
that's very, very interesting?

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.200
Africa does not have
the kinds of structures

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.140
that we see in the wealthier
parts of the world.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.010
There's exceptions.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.310
South Africa does.

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.050
It is the wealthiest
country in Africa.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.510
Clearly there is a
relationship with wealth.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:32.300
So this is not all
just pure will.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.480
This is will and
capacity in some mix.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.250
So that's very important
to keep in mind.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.440
Just one other little
thing I want to say too

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:49.070
is a structure like that, a
pattern like that, altitude.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.040
Despite the fact that we
know, and we've actually

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.150
recorded some of these.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:56.060
There's actually one or two in
here that are probably wrong.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.800
But despite the--
a lot of this is

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.040
because these are high
altitude locations here.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.650
So you don't need
to sort of put up

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.130
filters where there's no
demand to enter, basically,

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.383
or very little demand to enter.

00:31:09.383 --> 00:31:10.800
So that sort of
gives you an idea.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.960
Now these are averages
for each side.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.170
So that red ball is like the
average of US and Canada.

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:20.050
So let me just break that
up for you a little bit

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.750
and give you a sense of when we
look a little closer at the US,

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:25.480
we can see some
interesting patterns here.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.050
The US tends to have a higher
presence than its neighbors.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.310
it tends to build
up quite a bit more.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:35.710
And in general, the Mexican
border is a little bit more

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:38.727
built up than the
Canadian border.

00:31:38.727 --> 00:31:40.310
So this sort of gives
you just a sense

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:45.380
that there is heterogeneity in
the United States, of course,

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:45.890
as well.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.420
Not every place is all built up.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.580
In fact, see this little
spot right down here?

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.100
That's Big Bend National Park.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.600
There is a border
crossing there.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.610
It didn't show up in my data.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.290
The reason is our methodology.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.060
There is no road.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.290
There's no road.

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:03.040
Instead there's this.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.490
That's me going across.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:05.630
That's legal, by the way.

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.580
It is legal to do that.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:12.770
And there is just a sort
of a little rowing facility

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.390
to go across the
border right there.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:18.560
When you come back, you do
not meet a border crossing

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.180
person, only a park ranger.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.552
But you have to call
El Paso and tell them

00:32:22.552 --> 00:32:23.510
what you've been doing.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.410
So you are required to check,
in some sense, when you reenter.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.050
But this is-- this doesn't
even show up in our data,

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:33.740
to just sort of give you
that sense of heterogeneity

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.000
of these kinds of structures.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.833
Let me show you something
else really quick.

00:32:36.833 --> 00:32:37.913
This is South Africa.

00:32:37.913 --> 00:32:39.830
South Africa, as I pointed
out, the wealthiest

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:41.960
country in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.540
And we can see the same
kind of relationship here.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.320
We see more structure on
the South African side

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.380
vis-a-vis its less
wealthy neighbors.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.800
So that is a pretty clear
relationship as well.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.790
In fact, the clearest
relationship I have in my data

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:02.630
is that two sides tend
to do the same thing.

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:06.220
So as far as social
science relationships go,

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.650
this is very strong.

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.920
What we have here is
country one and their score,

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.830
and we have here country
two and their score.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:18.940
If they did exactly what their
neighbor did on their side

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:22.280
every time, you would be
along that 45 degree angle,

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.200
basically.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.730
So we can see some outliers.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:28.390
So we can see, for
example, where's--

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:31.840
South Africa up there does
more than its neighbors do,

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.380
for example.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.110
And the US got a
little hidden in here.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.380
United States is
right there, sort of

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.260
indicating it's not that
much different from what

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.210
our neighbors do, actually.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.560
So there are some--

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.280
it's always fun to explore
these outliers, I think.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.530
That is one of the fun things.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.570
But I think the big
question is why?

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.063
Why did they mirror each other?

00:33:53.063 --> 00:33:55.730
The first thing I think of as an
international relations scholar

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:57.583
is competition.

00:33:57.583 --> 00:33:59.000
They're competing
with each other,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.860
basically, one
side does something

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.340
and the other side
does something.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.020
It's sort of a, kind of a
competition of some kind.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.750
And I think there may be a
sort of cultural reasons also,

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.605
to sort of--

00:34:11.605 --> 00:34:12.980
cultural is not
the right reason,

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.409
but some symbolic reasons
to mirror the other as well.

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:19.590
If they can do it, we
can do it kind of thing.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.451
So that's a very, very
strong relationship.

00:34:21.451 --> 00:34:23.659
But there was one other sort
of-- oh, the other thing

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:26.239
that we should just be
thinking about is homophily.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:29.630
We get clustering of wealthy
democracies together,

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.820
they tend to do the same things.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.715
Like within Schengen. We get a
clustering of poorer countries

00:34:34.715 --> 00:34:36.590
together, and they tend
to do the same thing.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.960
So some of that is just
homophily, basically.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.900
There's one other
hypothesis though.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.275
And it is one I
did not think of.

00:34:42.275 --> 00:34:44.692
It's one that actually a student
of mine made me think of.

00:34:44.692 --> 00:34:47.000
Angie, who's-- Angie,
there you are, right there.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.949
Is to think about cooperation
around the borders.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:54.290
So maybe it has to
do with cooperation.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:56.610
So one of the fun things
about this project--

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.910
did you get to go places?

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:01.580
When you give a talk in Oslo,
you jump on to an airplane

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.740
and you go on up to Kirkenes.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.210
Kirkenes is the northernmost
point of Norway.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:13.340
It is the only foreign border
crossing that Norway has,

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.290
because all other borders
of Norway are Schengen.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.130
And it is a border with Russia.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:23.350
And this-- you might have
heard this in 2015, 2016--

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:29.750
15-- 5,000 people, Syrians,
North Africans, and Iraqis,

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:32.270
got on bicycles and
crossed the border there

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:36.200
in the winter of 2015, 2016.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.670
It's illegal to cross by foot.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.620
You have to cross on wheels.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.870
So they got-- they
got onto bicycles

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:43.640
and wheeled themselves across.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.990
So this is an interesting place.

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:47.450
That's more people
crossing in two months

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.940
than the town of Kirkenes has.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:54.020
So this was a fairly major
kind of event for Norway.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:58.430
And so we're talking here
with [? Goran ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:03.080
and he's telling us all about
his new fence, first of all,

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.322
that they built after this
episode with the crossing.

00:36:07.322 --> 00:36:09.530
There's a little-- his fence
on that goes 200 meters.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:10.905
So you can walk
around both ends.

00:36:10.905 --> 00:36:12.697
You can walk around
one end and swim around

00:36:12.697 --> 00:36:13.910
the other end if you want to.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.680
But the interesting
thing I thought

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.380
was very interesting,
I said this

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:26.530
is the Norwegian side right
here, there's the Russian side.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.990
Notice how similar
those buildings are?

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:32.995
The architecture is
very similar there.

00:36:32.995 --> 00:36:34.870
And I said to him, I
said to him why is that?

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:37.140
I said, why is it so similar?

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.250
And he said, we paid for it.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.340
Why?

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.810
we asked him.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:49.220
And the answer was that
when we have an emergency,

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.860
we need to know
who's there, what

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.440
room they're in,
where to find them,

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.140
how to establish
that communication.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.510
So you know this is all a
matter of border management

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.900
and cooperation.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.770
It's not that they're
competing with somehow

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.060
the Russians in this space.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.540
It was a need to cooperate,
as he liked to say.

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.990
Russia has 14 borders,
and has had a war

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.300
with 13 of those neighbors.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.600
And they-- Norway wants
to keep it that way.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.360
So this is what's behind--

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.950
maybe, maybe, what's
behind the mimicry.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:23.760
A lot more work to do.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.730
But it does suggest an
interesting hypothesis.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:29.120
Now what's behind the
border crossing mimicry

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.070
I think is one
interesting question.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:34.970
But one thing is for sure is
that when we collect a time

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:39.950
series of these spaces, we can
see some interesting build-up

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:40.610
over time.

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:42.230
Now, this keeps
the roads constant.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.280
These are not the only--

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.740
these are the same set
of roads, but now we're

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.500
looking back in time, which
is a very tricky thing

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.880
to do because the
images get very

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.850
poor over time going backwards.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:54.950
So one thing to be-- to
think about, first of all,

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:59.150
is one obvious problem
is that stuff only

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:01.250
accumulates on the border.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:04.290
You put a building up and
you don't take it down.

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:06.300
Not necessarily.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.180
With a commitment to
liberalize, you can.

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.100
And that is what
Schengen has done.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.332
So border stuff
can be taken down.

00:38:13.332 --> 00:38:14.790
It can also
deteriorate, of course,

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:16.770
and be allowed to lapse.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.750
So it is not obvious
that just because--

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.810
I mean, every once in a while
we would see just sort of places

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.370
where you would see a--

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:25.448
what is this, a--

00:38:25.448 --> 00:38:27.240
the footprint of where
a building had been,

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.480
but it had collapsed, or nobody
was using it, or what have you.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.740
So for the most part,
borders of the world

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:38.820
are going more and more
towards in the direction

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.360
of being built up,
filtering structures,

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.090
and internal Schengen borders
are going the opposite way.

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:48.630
Which is to say that it's
possible that this measure can

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.920
go back down as well.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.380
Now, the last thing
I want to do is

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:56.670
to think about that last
layer, the policing presence.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:57.660
The policing presence.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:02.460
Now some-- some unwanted
goods, some unwanted people,

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.470
are going to be
able, they're not

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:09.050
going to be deterred
by a fence or a wall.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.090
They maybe sneaked
through, as we

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.490
know from listening to
the American debate.

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:16.040
90% all illegal drugs
in the United States

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.230
come through the border
crossings, not over--

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:21.140
in other spaces.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.960
So this means that
there's a good possibility

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.460
that there are a lot of--

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.390
there needs to be a
little ex ante check--

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.200
sorry, ex post check--

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.590
on the state's
authority and control.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.050
So state official presence
might not be at the border.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:37.880
It might be in a zone.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.610
And so this prompt
means to look at police.

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:43.970
Police have a role in
controlling entry and exit

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:45.860
by enforcing the
law for people who

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.960
then get into the jurisdiction.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.560
So police structures
vary differently--

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.930
the police are structured very
differently across countries.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:58.100
So like in the US you
have counties and cities--

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.762
sheriffs and local police.

00:39:59.762 --> 00:40:01.220
In Norway you just
don't have that.

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.095
They all go through--

00:40:02.095 --> 00:40:05.400
they're all assigned
places through Oslo.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.650
[? Things ?] are very central.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:11.090
And so there's a lot of sort
of variation around the world

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:13.100
in policing structures.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.880
But I think that we can say that
policing institutions at least

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.338
are a source of the
state's monopolization

00:40:19.338 --> 00:40:20.630
of the legitimate use of force.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:25.010
It is still an official
actor in some capacity.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:28.520
So especially since
9/11, ordinary police

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.698
have become
increasingly involved

00:40:30.698 --> 00:40:32.240
with the enforcement
of, for example,

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.020
state immigration laws, even in
states like the United States,

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.520
where these kind
of responsibilities

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.740
have traditionally not been
part of their job at all.

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.650
So where are the world's police?

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.690
Where are the world's police?

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:47.910
Who knows, really, right?

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:50.440
Who really knows?

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.920
But that's a possibility.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.250
This is a picture of police
stations of the world as

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.620
reported in open street maps.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.560
And so this sort of gives
you a sense of where--

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.660
this is a wiki now,
it's crowdsourced,

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:09.060
with all of the problems
that introduces into data.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.500
But it's a little bit
of a starting point.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.740
And it seems to
me that there are

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.980
two kinds of potential
biases in this data.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.710
Places where people can't go is
the biggest one, because then

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.152
they can't report stuff.

00:41:22.152 --> 00:41:23.610
So repressive
countries, it's going

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:25.577
to be underreported, probably.

00:41:25.577 --> 00:41:27.160
You know the other
place where they're

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.700
going to be underreported?

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:35.560
Try to take a photo
near a US border.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.950
They're also likely to be
underreported in border zones,

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:43.300
because you're not allowed the
freedom, often, to take photos,

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.363
to document, to ask questions.

00:41:46.363 --> 00:41:48.280
You're not allowed the
freedom in border zones

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.822
that you are often
allowed elsewhere.

00:41:49.822 --> 00:41:52.420
So I think there are two,
at least two kinds of bias

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.200
in this data.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.700
So the first of
these can be handled

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:58.400
if we sort of work with a
model of country fixed effects.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.250
The second one of
these in some ways

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:04.360
works against the hypothesis
of observing police

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.210
at the border, because it
would be harder for people

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:10.520
to report that in a lot of
these more sensitive areas.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.550
So one very interesting
thing we simply did--

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:18.370
well one thing that I did first
when we were trying to develop

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.743
ideas in this area was part of
that border trip that I took

00:42:21.743 --> 00:42:23.410
all the way from
Brownsville to El Paso,

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.027
crossing the border 11 times--

00:42:25.027 --> 00:42:26.860
one thing we did that
was really interesting

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.290
was we actually did
contact the police.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:34.600
In this case we spent
10 hours in a patrol car

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:40.090
with the Val Verde County
Sheriff, Jose Francisco,

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:44.380
or Joe Frank, as he liked to
be called as well, Martinez.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:48.610
And we spent a good 10
hours in his patrol car.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.820
And one thing I realized is
that police in border zones

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.860
are definitely dual
use technology.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.950
They are definitely to
deter from the outside

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:01.760
as well as to enforce
the law internally.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.960
They are clearly,
clearly oriented

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.030
towards border concerns.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.190
And I imagine that this
is likely in many parts

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:11.570
of the world as well.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.520
They know the lay of the land.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.830
They know the nature of the
technology on the ground.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.260
So he would show us
where the sensors are.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.503
He would show us
where the cameras are.

00:43:20.503 --> 00:43:21.920
He would show us
where people tend

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.870
to come around and through.

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:27.380
And one thing he did
is he would-- he had--

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.380
I don't have a picture, but he
had a big pair of binoculars.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.170
And he could look back.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.710
He would just look
this guy back.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.930
He didn't threaten
him, but he was there.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:41.060
He was a presence.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.640
When he would use
his binoculars,

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.140
this guy's just
fishing, that's all.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.515
And that's what
the Sheriff said.

00:43:45.515 --> 00:43:46.313
He's just fishing.

00:43:46.313 --> 00:43:48.230
He's just fishing, that's
all the guy's doing.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:51.380
He's trying to give
food to his family.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.790
And-- but when he put his
binoculars up, you could see

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:56.600
there was kind of a moving back.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.760
The guy would go back
to the Mexican side,

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.055
and there's an understanding.

00:44:00.055 --> 00:44:01.430
There is-- let me
just say, there

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:08.158
is a role for police presence
along the borders as well.

00:44:08.158 --> 00:44:10.700
His main message when we went
around this region of the world

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:14.090
was, we have our crime problems,
but it's not a war zone

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:15.020
out here.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.070
Perhaps one reason is that
law enforcement officers

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:23.750
live on almost every
street in his city.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:28.250
And he was pretty clear
that law enforcement

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:33.650
had a role in border
security as well.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:37.940
So just to kind of run-- that's
probably the case worldwide.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.325
But there's a lot of work to do.

00:44:39.325 --> 00:44:40.700
But one thing that
is quite clear

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.350
is the worldwide
police stations are

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.750
more likely to be
reported within 50

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.612
kilometers of the border
than more interior.

00:44:47.612 --> 00:44:49.820
And this is despite the fact
that probably we already

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.960
have a bias in the data.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.830
And this is controlling for
the [? log of ?] population,

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:56.330
because of course you're going
to have police stations where

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:57.680
there's population.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.930
And it is controlling
for average lights

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.300
at night, which sort of
gives a sense of the state

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.730
capacity to provide
public goods.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.620
So even with that, there's
a suggestive evidence

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:13.130
that there's a tendency
to put more presence on--

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:14.690
state presence on the border.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:19.040
Now, let me just say that we're
not really so much interested

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.580
in how much, how many
police are in the borders.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.660
What we're really
interested in is

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.120
what each state's
border orientation

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.110
is to law enforcement.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.620
So this is what we're-- this
is what our strategy is here.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.120
It's to rasterize
the world like this--

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.890
rasterize, put it in these
little kind of squares,

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:42.710
and then to try to
figure out the density,

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:48.290
the relative density, of
police stations per 10,000K

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:52.040
in the exterior zones compared
to the green interior.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.150
That's kind of the quantity
of interest, really.

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:57.800
It is the more
interesting thing to us.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.658
Where are they positioned?

00:46:00.658 --> 00:46:02.450
And we found something
pretty interesting--

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:05.465
that is correlated strongly--

00:46:05.465 --> 00:46:08.930
ish, for social science--

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:11.390
with your border crossing
presence as well.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.970
So there's a relationship there
with those sorts of things

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:14.900
going on.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.660
Both of those are
weakly correlated

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.190
with walls and fences.

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.170
Weakly correlated.

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.660
They all kind of are moving
in the same direction.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:27.380
And so these are components
to this underlying idea that

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.230
there's something latent
called border orientation,

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:33.730
that these three things
maybe are decent indicators

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:36.980
of, because after all, we cannot
observe border orientation.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.440
That's something sort of
more inherent in a state.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:43.760
When we take these three
pieces of information, types

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.527
of information, and then
we develop a latent model,

00:46:46.527 --> 00:46:48.860
we can sort of be thinking
about, again, sort of the way

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:52.220
the world looks in terms
of border orientation.

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.580
Again, red-- strong
presence at the border.

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.530
Green-- less so.

00:46:57.530 --> 00:47:00.240
And we have very close
to the same project--

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.188
this is at the--

00:47:01.188 --> 00:47:03.230
we can aggregate it at
many different levels too.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.990
This is at the level of
border crossings again.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.630
But we can aggregate
it up now to the level

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.867
of bilateral borders
with another state,

00:47:11.867 --> 00:47:13.700
because you might have
a particular attitude

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:16.640
towards a particular
neighbor, for example.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.380
And in fact, we can
aggregate further

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.260
and say that states
maybe have something

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:25.160
that we might call a
border orientation as well,

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.730
the propensity to see
the borders as a place

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:31.070
to exert authority.

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:35.540
Red-- a lot of strong
projection to the outer edges

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.910
of a state's
authority, and green--

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:40.760
much, much less so.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:43.580
There's variance over time.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.670
There's variance by region.

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:50.030
So we can compare
these over time.

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:51.530
We can see that
parts of the world--

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:53.240
North America has the
most, as you could

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.300
see from the other pictures.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.640
But we're seeing the
time series in Africa

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.490
and the Middle East
are very, very much

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:07.070
upward in terms of strengthening
international borders.

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:08.750
So what explains this?

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:10.520
This is where the
project needs to go.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.440
This is where the payoff may be.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.810
Try to figure out what
explains this kind of a border

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:16.010
orientation?

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:19.220
I think very clearly the
neighbor's orientation does.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:22.310
We should be thinking about
cooperation, possibly conflict,

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:25.060
but maybe cooperation
in these spaces.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.010
Wealth-- this is a
prerogative of the wealthy.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:29.600
There is no doubt about that.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.460
When we control for
a country's wealth,

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:35.450
though, what else matters
is the relative wealth

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:36.260
of your neighbor.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:40.190
So it's not just absolute, it
is differential wealth as well

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:41.710
that matters.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.970
The neighbor's wealth
is very important.

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:48.970
And very importantly, and I've
said this on the CNN post,

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:52.860
walls are something,
and a strong edge

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:56.052
is something that the
autocratic states tend to do.

00:48:56.052 --> 00:48:57.510
So sort of think
about what sort of

00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:00.940
generates-- what generates
a demand, if you will,

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.880
for a hard edge?

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.703
Civil society often likes
to move back and forth

00:49:05.703 --> 00:49:07.620
and have this freedom
and more liberal states,

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.240
more democratic
states, have been

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.990
reluctant to have very
severe forms of checking

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.890
at the border.

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:17.320
Markets, free markets,
free movement,

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.730
civil society strength.

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:21.610
But the autocracies have taken
the opposite kind of attack,

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.050
basically.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.030
And so there-- one
thing I think is

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:27.790
that we should be thinking
of these border structures

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:31.030
as idealized forms
of governance.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:35.650
This is not the way a democracy
does rules, or this is the way

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:37.540
and autocracy does
rules, for example.

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.310
We should be thinking
about what it

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.470
has to do with
strategies of governance.

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:44.590
International institutions,
regional institutions,

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:47.110
matter to a very
great extent as well.

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:48.707
Very clear in the
Schengen results.

00:49:48.707 --> 00:49:51.040
And then finally, I want to
say something about culture.

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.380
I have said almost
nothing about it.

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.840
We're finding results
already that the states that

00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:02.080
have the highest degree
of a border orientation

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.890
tend to be more
homogeneous states.

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:07.180
Interesting.

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.460
Why would that be?

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.075
The sense that we need
to protect who we are.

00:50:11.075 --> 00:50:12.700
Is it the sense that
we are homogeneous

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.560
and we would like
to keep it that way?

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.900
I've not established
causality at anything here.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.215
So I don't know the
direction of causality,

00:50:19.215 --> 00:50:21.820
but it'd be very interesting
to know something like that,

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.240
wouldn't it?

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.950
But to excavate, if you will,
the relationship between

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:30.790
localized homogeneity-- think
maybe of Hungary, for example--

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:34.107
and the desire to exclude and
continue to exclude the other.

00:50:34.107 --> 00:50:36.190
And then the other thing
that we've been noticed--

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:38.500
we've noticed
culturally, is difference

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.640
in dominant religion.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.820
So if your neighbor--

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:47.380
if the difference between
percent Muslim in each country

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:51.740
is very great, there tends
to be a much harder border

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.580
orientation between
the two countries.

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.800
It's the same with
Christians, by the way.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.830
So the bigger that
difference in the percent

00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:01.800
Christians as well,
strong difference.

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.610
And it helps to explain,
if you will, the strength

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:07.440
of the border orientation.

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:10.100
So finally, I just want to
say something really quickly,

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.350
and that is that this
is way too much work

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:15.440
to continue to do, have
so many eyeballs on so

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.900
many sort of pieces
of architecture

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.330
that we need to think
of creative ways

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:23.060
to think about
international borders.

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:26.490
How do you explain
something like this?

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:28.920
This is Tijuana, over here,
and this is San Diego.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.610
Well, you might explain
it by that border fence.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.160
That distinction being drawn
between these two places.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.710
You cannot go from
one to the other.

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:38.090
There is a dam created there.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.310
But there are a lot of other
interesting differences

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:43.460
that don't seem to
depend on a fence.

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.120
This is Haiti and the
Dominican Republic.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.860
What's going on?

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:54.310
This is Bolivia and
Brazil, thank you, yes.

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:56.090
This is Bolivia and Brazil.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:57.110
What's going on there?

00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:59.090
Is there truly a
fence all along there?

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:01.025
That's the international
border there.

00:52:01.025 --> 00:52:03.650
There's some kind of difference
in land use and property rights

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:05.720
going on here, for sure.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.970
And don't even get me started
on this one, of course.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:12.830
The Korean peninsula-- we know
that has to do with structure.

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:14.720
But instead of having
a go around documenting

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.540
with our eyeballs,
the next step forward

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:21.410
is to be thinking about
computer vision techniques that

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:24.290
will be able kind of scoot
along the international borders,

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:27.320
and say difference, difference,
difference, no difference,

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.100
nothing going on.

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:32.600
Maybe we can infer the strength
of international borders

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.603
despite that we don't always
see a structure in place.

00:52:35.603 --> 00:52:37.770
That's a very-- that's a
strong possibility as well.

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:40.730
So what might we learn,
and then I conclude.

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:43.640
Well first of all,
border orientation

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.170
has a strong cultural component.

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.628
And this is going to be one of
the more interesting pieces.

00:52:47.628 --> 00:52:50.510
Maybe parts of this is obvious
in some sense, other parts

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:52.790
a little bit less so.

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:56.930
Borders, perhaps as we can
get that time series evidence

00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:00.400
over time, maybe we can
discover that borders

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.920
are thickenings as anxieties
about globalization

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.180
begin to intensify.

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:08.850
What is it that people
are so worried about?

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:10.520
And then finally,
and this is where

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.160
I think the real payoff
to the project is,

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.845
that thicker borders
may have consequences.

00:53:16.845 --> 00:53:18.470
And we need to start
to think about how

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:19.910
we would document these.

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.280
They might have bilateral
relationship consequences

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.170
between neighboring states.

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:27.170
They might have some kind
of impact on security.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:28.880
And very importantly,
they might have

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.620
some kind of impact
on human welfare

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:33.620
that we ought to be able
to document as well.

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.590
It seems to me that there may
be very clear human rights

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:38.990
violations in border
spaces that are

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:41.360
highly fortified by the state.

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.340
It seems to me that
the kind of divisions

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.700
we saw on the Korean peninsula
with that extreme distinction,

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:50.930
we might be able to
geolocate deaths of children

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:54.020
under five years old and infer
the thickness of the border

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:57.200
by not being able to move
to another jurisdiction

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.570
for differential
forms of health care.

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:01.940
So all of these
things might end up

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:07.040
being very important things that
we might be able to someday say

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.170
something systematic
about, if we

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:12.200
can get the right kind
of evidence in place.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.480
So thank you all very
much for listening,

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.320
and I look forward
to your questions.
