Because of your contributions to our Women In Film charity event,

you've unlocked an Honest Trailer written by the AI who wrote that fake Harry Potter chapter.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.220
It's like an Honest Trailer made out of every other Honest Trailer.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.280
Warning: It's gonna be weird.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.000
From the technology studio which created classics like the Irresponsible Englishman

and The Brave Little Lawyer

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.620
and the key grips who worked on small movies about all the strange Hollywood choices of legendary director Mike Potions

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.180

"Hi."

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.640
Where everyone is always quoting House.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.440
*"Everybody lies" said by various characters*

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.240
But only one Jonathan dares to ask, who made that call?

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.060
"Who is it?"

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.980
"Who is this?"

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.500
Because lightsaber negotiations have guns now.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.640

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.660
An Oscar worthy performance by the Brooklyn Bridge

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.540
Amy Puppet's original soundtrack that's so cute, there's definitely lots of magic campy dance holograms.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.200
And a climax so epic, you will stop worrying about the helicopters descending on your home

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.680
"You see that helicopter? I think it's been following me all morning."

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.920
Of course the real reason everyone is seeing this movie,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.620
the Yoda vs. Dennis the Menace fight sequence!

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.160
Which will have you saying, 'All of our fragile egos are gonna have sex!'

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.480
"Hey everybody, we're all gonna get laid!"

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.500
*cheering*

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.720
But maybe you will not enjoy this horrible film about the problems of every lame movie.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.620
"You're wasting your life making s***!"

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.860

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.340

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.540
This awesome car chase will be in the movie.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.700
And so will this scene where 2 characters sit and read a magazine!

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.640
