the moment longer in the Horn of Africa

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.460
the line between fishing and piracy has

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.440
long been blurred

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.420
the first pirates were actually

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.219
fishermen turned vigilante

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.679

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.159
believed were fishing illegally in

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:54.620

during her room off the somali coast

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.899
where those pirates attack that vessel

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.940
when they realized that they could make

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.530
huge profits by holding these boats to

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.140
ransom piracy became big business and

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.560
Somalia became a no-go zone for

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.570
Americans and other Westerners we have

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.100
seen a dramatic increase in piracy in

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:26.440
this area and it is a matter of real

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:31.210
concern as a maritime investigator

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.860

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.100
years I've been doing hostage

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.979
negotiations and ransom drops so if the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.630
murder video is connected to piracy it

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:46.420
