1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,580
What's your opinion on
calisthenics versus weights?

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,330
Again, for me, both, I
like them both. You know,

3
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:14,470
with calisthenics you get
that endurance strength,

4
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:17,200
you get some flexibility
and some mobility out of it.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,510
They're pretty natural movements, right?

6
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:22,120
They're pretty natural movements or
things that you're doing with your human

7
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:24,280
body. So they're going to be more natural.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,070
Weights obviously make you
stronger, more explosive.

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,970
At a certain point they also
can be more injury inducing.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:36,880
Sure.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,880
And at another point they're
also less injury inducing.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,920
So there's a certain point where if you
have an injury in your shoulder and you

13
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:52,360
normally would do handstand pushups,
which means you're lifting up 230 pounds,

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,700
well with weight training you could
lift up 40 pounds if you want to.

15
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,870
Right? So, so there's,

16
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,930
it goes both ways where
sometimes calisthenics might
be the more injury inducing

17
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,870
thing and sometimes weight training
might be the more injury inducing things.

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,520
That's why you got to balance the two
of them, you know? And for instance,

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,601
when I,

20
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:18,601
if I like I hurt my ankle a couple months
ago and I could not put any weight on

21
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:22,630
the squat bar. So I was just
doing, you know, pistils and,

22
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,940
and you know, air squats,
jumps and box jumps. You know,

23
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:30,820
I was using things that didn't have
any way cause I could do all that.

24
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:35,560
But the minute I put weight on my back,
you know, anything above body weight,

25
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,010
it started to hurt. And so I just
needed to let that thing heal.

26
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:43,090
And I used the calisthenics to
get me there. And then the same,

27
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:45,160
exact opposite. I had a,

28
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,330
my shoulder was tweaked six months
ago and I was having a hard time doing

29
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:52,780
handstand pushups cause it was just the
wrong angle. And so I was just using,

30
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,063
just using,

31
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,430
I was doing press with a lighter weight
than my body weight in order to keep the

32
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:59,560
blood moving in court
in order to keep the,

33
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,690
in order to keep the system moving. Cause
that's what I think you've got to do.

34
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,680
So I think you gotta be, you gotta
find a balance of both, which means,

35
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,890
which means I'm not great
at either one of them.

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,220
I'm not going to win in any
weightlifting competitions.

37
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:19,120
And I'm not going to win in a
gymnastics competition either. And

38
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,510
there are some guys, especially now,

39
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:26,980
I mean there's some guys that are
getting in sick shape. Um, you know,

40
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,260
you watch the guys in the
crossfit games right now,

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,900
they're savages and they're doing both
the calisthenics and the weight lifting.

42
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,400
And actually I was reading something
about it the other day and it's becoming

43
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:42,970
more weightlifting focused,
you know, whether it's Olympic,

44
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:46,780
what is crossing the crossfit, I shouldn't
say it's getting that more focused,

45
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:51,040
but if you wanna win the crossfit games,

46
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,260
you got to be able to
lift some heavyweights.

47
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,730
You got to be able to dead lift a lot,
snatch a lot, clean and jerk a lot.

48
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,500
And if you can dead lift a lot, clean
and jerk a lot and snatch a lot,

49
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,220
you're going to be able to do end, at
least you practice the other movements,

50
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,770
the muscle up, the pullups
you're going to have,

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,800
you're going to be much more apt to be
able to do those things then the other

52
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:17,860
way around. So yeah, I mean, it's,

53
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,100
for somebody that can do a body weight
snatch is more likely to be able to do 50

54
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,490
pull ups in a row than somebody that's
able to do 50 pull ups in a row.

55
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,820
And that's their focus in life is able
to automatically do a bodyweight snatch.

56
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:38,800
I mean, that's just the reality of
it. That's what I think right now. Um,

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,400
but the bottom line is on those,
I use both of them. I find,

58
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:47,401
I like to try and find that balance and
I think I use both of them according to

59
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,050
what my body prescribes me.
