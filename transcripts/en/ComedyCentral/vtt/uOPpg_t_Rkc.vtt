00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.439
First up,<i> Nightly Show</i>
 contributor Mike Yard.

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:07.774

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.243
And<i> Nightly Show</i> contributor
Jordan Carlos.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.111
-(cheering and applause)
-Hello. Yes.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:15.114
And he's performing through June
at Joe's Pub at the Public

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:18.317
in New York City, very funny
French comedian Gad Elmaleh.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.652

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:22.455 line:0%

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:29.529
Um, so as I mentioned earlier,
um, Iowa caucus is tonight.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.664
-Yes. -Exciting. -So I think
that probably as we're here,

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:34.667
I'm sure the results are-are in.
What was that?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.469
-It's exciting times.
-It's exciting. -Yeah.

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:39.072
-Can you feel it? -We're gonna
find out. We're gonna find out.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.741
-Ooh. -Entertaining. Yeah.
Entertaining. -Yeah, I know.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.744
I do want to talk about one
of the issues of the election.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:47.947
Uh, how people keep saying anger
is driving this election.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.615
So let's accept that
as a premise.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.617
What are people so angry about?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.619
-What are people so angry about
in this? -Mm-hmm.

00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:56.289
Uh, I-I think Americans love
to be outraged anyway.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.825 line:0%
I mean, they're outraged...
Right?

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:02.028 line:0%
That the McRib only comes once
a year, you know? That's...

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.230
-that's... -I thought...
I thought French people

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.899
-would be like this. -Yeah? The
French... the French hate this

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:08.367
-as well? -Complaining and...
-French people are

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.369
-always outraged though.
Sacre bleu. -Yeah. Yeah.

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:13.206
-Come on. That's-that's why
-(mocking laugh)

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.540
-I'm not surprised, right?
-Mmm. -Yeah.

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:16.709
-That's just normal to me.
-Absolutely.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:19.712
I mean, I-I think also what it
is is some... you know...

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.048
whatever you want to call it,
the silent majority is losing

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.550
certain ground, culturally
speaking, in the culture war.

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:28.688
I mean, in essence, they've
been, like, manspreading, right,

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.158
for a long time and putting
their balls here and there

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.093
-and...
-I don't know.

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:37.230
The silent majority
is manspreading?

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.899
I'm just trying to break it down
so everybody can understand,

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.301
you know what I'm saying? I
could stay up here, you know...

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:44.137
-I like that analogy.
-Thank you. Thank you. I just...

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.139
I just tucked my legs in,
by the way.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.674
-You just stopped manspreading?
-The silent majority's balls

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:51.811
-are spreading out over... -Yes.
Well, no, they have spread

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:54.480
-far and wide over a lot of...
a lot of people, -Okay.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.682
in their eyes and stuff.
And it's like, "Hey, enough."

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:59.152
-You know? Um... -Where
do you think that anger's from?

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:02.088 line:0%
I think if people are angry now,
wait till they see

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.957 line:0%
Trump-Trump presidency.
They'll be angry as (bleep).

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.560 line:0%
-(audience reacting)
-See? They mad already. -Wow.

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:09.962 line:0%
-He didn't even win yet and
they're mad. -It's becoming...

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:11.631
I think
that might produce sadness.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.566
-I don't know if it'll produce
anger. -People are gonna be

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.903
-like, "What?!" -How-how
does it feel like to the rest

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:19.772
of the world? D-Do... When-when
you hear Americans are angry,

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:22.175
does it seem like we're
just petulant children or...

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.577 line:0%
No, no, no, no. I have to say,
when I... I got here,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.846 line:0%
-and it was the beginning
of the campaign, right? -Mm-hmm.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.915 line:0%
And you know what, one day,
I was watching television

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.850 line:0%
and it was on mute
and I saw the debate.

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:33.052
And I swear, I thought
it was a game show.

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.021
(laughter)

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.594
-And, you know, there's guys
-It does kind of feel like that.

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:43.329
-behind the podiums
-Right.

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:47.066
and, you know, just one minute
for the answer. Like, just...

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.268
And that's too short.
It's, uh...

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:51.470
You know what I...
Okay, you know what I would do

00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:53.806
if I was a candidate and
they would give me one minute

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.676
to say something important
to a big country like America?

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.279
I would take this minute and
offer it to another candidate

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:02.949
and tell him, "This is for you.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:07.820
Use it to think, really think
about what you just said."

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:10.256
(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)
-WOMAN: Yeah!

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:14.460
You know, it's interesting,
but it-it...

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:16.562
ELMALEH: Because it's going too
fast even on Twitter. -Yes.

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:18.431
-I know. -Even on Twitter, we
have more characters than that.

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:20.800
-WILMORE: Yeah.
-YARD: Yeah. -CARLOS: Yeah.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.468
It's so interesting, Gad,
is that

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:25.671
what started the whole thrust
of the campaign

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:27.974
was just the small thing
that Trump said,

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:29.542
-when he trashed Megyn Kelly...
-Mm-hmm.

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:31.377
and, like, Rosie O'Donnell
in one sentence,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.945
-race was over at that point.
-Yeah. -YARD: Right.

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:35.581
The trashing of women
launched him into first place

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:37.250
-from the beginning.
-YARD: Wow. -CARLOS: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:39.252
-Yes. Yeah. -From the beginning
where he called Rosie O'Donnell

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.620
"a disgusting pig,"

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.321
and pretty much
threw Megyn Kelly under the bus.

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:44.223
-Yeah. -That shows you anger
right there.

00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:45.958
-Yeah.
-Why would you get mad...?

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:49.262 line:0%
Why would you support a guy
who trashes women like that?

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:52.164 line:0%
People got to be losing their
mind in this country right now.

00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:53.399
WILMORE:
But what do you think...?

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:54.767
-(applause and cheering)
-Yeah, all right, tell me.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.003
So what do you think
is fueling it?

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:59.939
Do you think it's jobs?
Do you think it's, uh, taxes?

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:02.141
I mean, when Clinton ran in '92,
he said... he said,

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:04.343
-"It's the economy, stupid."
-CARLOS: Right. -YARD: Mm.

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:05.945
I mean, is Trump saying
"It's the Muslim, stupid"?

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:07.513
I mean, what is his thing?
Is it...?

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:09.515
Trump is saying it's everybody
else except white people

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:11.350
-in America is stupid.
That's what he... -CARLOS: Yeah.

00:04:11.383 --> 00:04:12.652
That's what he sounds
like he's saying.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.120
'Cause I said it before.

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:18.024
Trump came out, and his campaign
basically assaulted everybody

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.725
-that wasn't Trump
or like Trump. -(laughter)

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:21.727
-"It's the Mexicans! It's the
Chinese!" -WILMORE: Mm-hmm.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.062
"It's the...
it's Middle Easterners

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:24.597
that are coming here
and ruining it."

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.365
Ain't got nothing
to do with the people

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:27.933
that have been running
the country forever.

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:30.803
-Yeah. Yeah. -I feel bad. I just
got here. I... you know...

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:32.271
(applause and cheering)

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:33.539
YARD: Ain't got nothing to do
with that. -I...

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:34.940
WILMORE:
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:37.076 line:0%
I feel bad because I just
arrived, you know, in America.

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:38.411 line:0%
YARD &amp; WILMORE:
Mm-hmm.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.346 line:0%
And so, I don't know
what to think, really.

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.681 line:0%
But it's very interesting
and funny

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:43.649 line:0%
because I've always think
America is great.

00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:44.884
-Mm-hmm.
-That's why I came here.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.752
And I come here,
and I hear this guy.

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:49.121
-He said he's gonna make it
great again. -WILMORE: Mm-hmm.

00:04:49.154 --> 00:04:50.589
-CARLOS: Right.
-So...

00:04:50.622 --> 00:04:52.224
-I'm confused, so...
-(laughter)

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:55.027
-You know, I get that. I get
that. -ELMALEH: No, no, I mean,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.362
-if it's not great...
-YARD: Yeah.

00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:58.164
-...I want my money back!
-YARD: Exactly!

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:00.299
-ELMALEH: Because...
-Exactly. -(applause)

00:05:00.332 --> 00:05:03.202
What about the the energy
that's around Bernie Sanders?

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:06.038
Do you think that's angry
energy? Is it restless energy?

00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:07.573
-What is it? -CARLOS:
I think it's dissatisfaction.

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:08.874
-People feel...
-YARD: Yes.

00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:10.476 line:0%
-It's crazy. -WILMORE:
It's not anger? Mm-hmm.

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.044 line:0%
It's not anger.
It's anger with...

00:05:12.077 --> 00:05:14.180 line:0%
In some ways,
it is anger with Obama

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:16.816 line:0%
-that he hasn't gone far enough
to the left. -WILMORE: Mm-hmm.

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.417
He hasn't been
progressive enough

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.920
for some people's tastes.
You know what I mean?

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.922
Like, Guantanamo's still there.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:25.391
And, uh... and people thought

00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:27.226
that was gonna be closed
within the first 100 days.

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:28.427
-WILMORE: Right.
-You know?

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.695
I mean, just for example.
Just for example.

00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:31.664
YARD: Yeah, I think with Bernie,
people are just sick

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:33.632
and tired of watching
the top two percent

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:35.401
-keep getting more richer
and richer. -Yeah.

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:37.036
I'm angry about that.
I can't speak for other people.

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.304
-(applause and cheering)
-WILMORE: Well, there is anger.

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:40.506
But I am very angry about that.
I am very angry.

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.508
I think there is an anger
about the divide in the economy.

00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:45.144
YARD: Yeah, definitely.
I'm sick of that.

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:46.712
The people at the bottom
keep getting further

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:47.913
and further on the bottom.

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:49.148
YARD:
Not even on the bottom.

00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:50.483
Like, people in the middle.
Look, I...

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:51.851
WILMORE: Well, the middle
is disappearing.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:54.053
I got to watch these people
show off their new yachts

00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:55.688
and all this stuff on TV.

00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:57.189
-ELMALEH: I show you my yacht?
-In the meantime,

00:05:57.222 --> 00:05:59.158
I'm sitting on the train.
You know what I'm saying?

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:02.094
I'm sitting... I'm on TV, and
I got to ride the train to work.

00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:03.329
-WILMORE: Right.
-CARLOS: Right.

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:04.630
Next...
You know what I'm saying?

00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:05.931
-So, I mean, right...?
-(applause and cheering)

00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:07.133
Right, right.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:08.401
Larry, when I got this job,

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.636
I thought
those days was over, brah!

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:11.937
-What's going on?
-CARLOS: It's true.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.873
WILMORE: Right. Let me
ask you this question.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.408
Which candidate...?
There's a lot of...

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:16.842
I think there's fear out there,
too.

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:19.645
Which candidate do you think
scares America the most?

00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:21.113
-YARD: I have a tie.
-CARLOS: It's a tie.

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:23.115
-My tie is Ted Cruz

WILMORE:
All right.

00:06:27.352 --> 00:06:29.121
What's scarier
