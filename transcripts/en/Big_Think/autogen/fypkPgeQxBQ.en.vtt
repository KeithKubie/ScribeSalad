one argument that we make is that we

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179
one argument that we make is that we
 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.660
one argument that we make is that we
could all benefit a little bit from

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670
could all benefit a little bit from
 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.960
could all benefit a little bit from
thinking more like children okay now you

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970
thinking more like children okay now you
 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.180
thinking more like children okay now you
could say well we're bi I look first of

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
could say well we're bi I look first of

all everybody's biased in a lot of ways

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
all everybody's biased in a lot of ways
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.160
all everybody's biased in a lot of ways
and we have our set of biases too it may

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170
and we have our set of biases too it may
 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.400
and we have our set of biases too it may
be that we embrace the idea in this book

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
be that we embrace the idea in this book
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.140
be that we embrace the idea in this book
of thinking like children cuz we're kind

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
of thinking like children cuz we're kind
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.019
of thinking like children cuz we're kind
of you know childlike we have kind of

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029
of you know childlike we have kind of
 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.550
of you know childlike we have kind of
obvious observations sometimes or

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560
obvious observations sometimes or
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.200
obvious observations sometimes or
observations that strike people as

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
observations that strike people as
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.230
observations that strike people as
obvious we um we ask a lot of questions

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
obvious we um we ask a lot of questions
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.470
obvious we um we ask a lot of questions
that are not considered you know the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
that are not considered you know the
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.700
that are not considered you know the
kind of questions that people ask in

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710
kind of questions that people ask in
 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.520
kind of questions that people ask in
good company or smart company but one of

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
good company or smart company but one of
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.100
good company or smart company but one of
the most powerful pieces of thinking

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110
the most powerful pieces of thinking
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.290
the most powerful pieces of thinking
like a child that we argue is thinking

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
like a child that we argue is thinking
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.560
like a child that we argue is thinking
small so I realize that this runs

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
small so I realize that this runs
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.350
small so I realize that this runs
exactly counter to the philosophy of the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360
exactly counter to the philosophy of the
 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.209
exactly counter to the philosophy of the
arena in which I'm pier appearing which

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
arena in which I'm pier appearing which
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.959
arena in which I'm pier appearing which
is thinking big big thing but our

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
is thinking big big thing but our
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.459
is thinking big big thing but our
argument is this big problems are by

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
argument is this big problems are by
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.529
argument is this big problems are by
their nature really hard to solve for a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
their nature really hard to solve for a
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270
their nature really hard to solve for a
variety of reasons one is they're large

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
variety of reasons one is they're large
 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.830
variety of reasons one is they're large
and therefore they include a lot of

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
and therefore they include a lot of
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.390
and therefore they include a lot of
people and therefore they include a lot

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
people and therefore they include a lot
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.580
people and therefore they include a lot
of crossed and often mangled and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
of crossed and often mangled and
 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.980
of crossed and often mangled and
perverse incentives but also a big

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
perverse incentives but also a big
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.240
perverse incentives but also a big
problem when you think about a big

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
problem when you think about a big
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.679
problem when you think about a big
problem like the education where

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
problem like the education where
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.679
problem like the education where
education reform you're dealing with an

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
education reform you're dealing with an
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.780
education reform you're dealing with an
institution or a set of institutions

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
institution or a set of institutions
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.039
institution or a set of institutions
that have gotten to where they've gotten

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049
that have gotten to where they've gotten
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.760
that have gotten to where they've gotten
through this many many years of

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770
through this many many years of
 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.350
through this many many years of
calcification and also accidents of

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
calcification and also accidents of
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.719
calcification and also accidents of
history what I mean by that is things

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
history what I mean by that is things
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.340
history what I mean by that is things
have gotten to the way they've gotten

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
have gotten to the way they've gotten
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.170
have gotten to the way they've gotten
because of a lot of things that a few

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
because of a lot of things that a few
 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.999
because of a lot of things that a few
people did many many years ago and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
people did many many years ago and
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.850
people did many many years ago and
traditions were carried on and now to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
traditions were carried on and now to
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.149
traditions were carried on and now to
suddenly change that would mean changing

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
suddenly change that would mean changing
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.760
suddenly change that would mean changing
the entire stream of the way that this

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
the entire stream of the way that this
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830
the entire stream of the way that this
institution is functioned for many years

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
institution is functioned for many years
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.270
institution is functioned for many years
therefore attacking any big problem is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
therefore attacking any big problem is
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.240
therefore attacking any big problem is
bound to be really hard and the danger

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
bound to be really hard and the danger
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.899
bound to be really hard and the danger
is you spend a lot of resources time

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909
is you spend a lot of resources time
 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.870
is you spend a lot of resources time
money manpower optimism which is perhaps

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
money manpower optimism which is perhaps
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.510
money manpower optimism which is perhaps
one of our most precious resources

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520
one of our most precious resources
 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.770
one of our most precious resources
attacking a problem that you can't make

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
attacking a problem that you can't make
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.870
attacking a problem that you can't make
any headway on so I mean you know the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
any headway on so I mean you know the
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.619
any headway on so I mean you know the
history is littered with brilliant

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
history is littered with brilliant
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.140
history is littered with brilliant
people who have attacked large problems

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
people who have attacked large problems
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.830
people who have attacked large problems
in the past

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
in the past
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.890
in the past
half century or century among them

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900
half century or century among them
 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.750
half century or century among them
famine among them poverty and most

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
famine among them poverty and most
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.300
famine among them poverty and most
recently I think education reform a

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310
recently I think education reform a
 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.550
recently I think education reform a
healthy diet and so on so these are all

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
healthy diet and so on so these are all
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.010
healthy diet and so on so these are all
really big problems so our argument is

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020
really big problems so our argument is
 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.199
really big problems so our argument is
you know what there's a lot of people

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209
you know what there's a lot of people
 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.870
you know what there's a lot of people
out there thinking big maybe some of

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880
out there thinking big maybe some of
 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.940
out there thinking big maybe some of
them will be successful probably not so

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950
them will be successful probably not so
 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.070
them will be successful probably not so
many honestly it's very very hard our

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080
many honestly it's very very hard our
 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.870
many honestly it's very very hard our
argument is you know what let the people

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880
argument is you know what let the people
 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.430
argument is you know what let the people
who are going to try to think big solve

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440
who are going to try to think big solve
 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.120
who are going to try to think big solve
big problems

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130
big problems
 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.380
big problems
let them go there's enough people doing

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
let them go there's enough people doing
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.850
let them go there's enough people doing
that why don't you just try to think

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860
that why don't you just try to think
 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.410
that why don't you just try to think
small why don't you try to find one

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420
small why don't you try to find one
 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.750
small why don't you try to find one
piece of the problem that you can

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
piece of the problem that you can
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.670
piece of the problem that you can
identify and peel it off and try to

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680
identify and peel it off and try to
 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.440
identify and peel it off and try to
solve that problem or answer that

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450
solve that problem or answer that
 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.960
solve that problem or answer that
question so a lot of reasons why it's

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970
question so a lot of reasons why it's
 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.390
question so a lot of reasons why it's
better to do that it's easier to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400
better to do that it's easier to
 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.460
better to do that it's easier to
satisfactorily answer a small question

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470
satisfactorily answer a small question
 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.650
satisfactorily answer a small question
or solve a big problem because you can

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660
or solve a big problem because you can
 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.840
or solve a big problem because you can
get the data you can understand the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850
get the data you can understand the
 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.130
get the data you can understand the
incentives it's just inherently much

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140
incentives it's just inherently much
 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.670
incentives it's just inherently much
less complicated if you can come up with

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680
less complicated if you can come up with
 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.290
less complicated if you can come up with
a solution to a small problem there's a

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300
a solution to a small problem there's a
 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.460
a solution to a small problem there's a
much better chance you'll actually be

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470
much better chance you'll actually be
 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.380
much better chance you'll actually be
able to get it done a lot of people feel

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390
able to get it done a lot of people feel
 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.180
able to get it done a lot of people feel
like come up with the answers to big

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190
like come up with the answers to big
 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.550
like come up with the answers to big
problems but then you need to get all

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560
problems but then you need to get all
 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.220
problems but then you need to get all
the political and capital will to do it

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230
the political and capital will to do it
 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.770
the political and capital will to do it
and that can be much harder than

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780
and that can be much harder than
 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.590
and that can be much harder than
actually solving the problem so if you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600
actually solving the problem so if you
 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.319
actually solving the problem so if you
can peel off a small piece of a problem

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329
can peel off a small piece of a problem
 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.420
can peel off a small piece of a problem
and then someone else peels off another

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430
and then someone else peels off another
 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.100
and then someone else peels off another
small piece and you add them up you're

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110
small piece and you add them up you're
 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.720
small piece and you add them up you're
constantly you know working toward a

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730
constantly you know working toward a
 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.069
constantly you know working toward a
better place so I'll give you an example

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079
better place so I'll give you an example
 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.009
better place so I'll give you an example
if you think about let's say education

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019
