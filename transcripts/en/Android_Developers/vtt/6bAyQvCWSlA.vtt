SCOTT LEVINE: Univision now
has a direct-to-consumer

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.270
subscription
offering, and the goal

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.340
was to give access
to our audience

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.770
wherever they are,
whenever they want it.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.230
When we really wanted
to innovate and push

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.420
the boundaries on our
subscription service,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.030
we launched in-app
subscriptions for Google Play,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.440
and we saw a pop immediately
of about three to four

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.980
times the conversion rate by
working with the Google team.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.080

ELIE HABIB: When
we started Anghami,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.390
we said we want to have a music
service which is convenient,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.852
and all the music available.

00:00:37.852 --> 00:00:39.310
In the Middle East,
it was a region

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.070
which was totally forgotten.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.760
There was no really
good alternative.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.420
So you have to pirate or pirate.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.170
I mean, there was nothing else.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.680
And if we actually
could succeed,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.360
we'd be pirating the pirates.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.730
For us, Google Play is the core.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.780
We have over 81% of our
users today on Android.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.080
Our growth strategy
goes around engaging

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.134
Android users to use the app
more so they can subscribe.

00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:06.800
AHCENE AMROUZ: I think
that Google Play,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.210
the main [INAUDIBLE] helped
the increase of subscription

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.370
conversion rates on [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.560
And we think that the main
explanation is the better user

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.500
experience.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.760
Android has become
the main source

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.690
for downloads for a [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.230
Also, we see on
subscription conversion

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.405
an increase of 6% on Android
compared to other platforms.

00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:28.530
KONRADIN BREYER: Freeletics
started with the vision

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.850
to make everyone the greatest
version of themselves.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.390
And the way we do this is we're
trying to motivate and guide

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.040
them in a variety
of apps to reach

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.859
their physical and mental goals.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.150
The reason why subscriptions
make a lot of sense for us

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.080
is not only from an
economic point of view,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.207
but also because we want to
develop people in the long run.

00:01:44.207 --> 00:01:46.290
We want to have a repeated
impact upon their life.

SCOTT LEVINE: Working
with Google Play

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.160
and figuring out how to launch
a successful subscription

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.730
product, it's been great.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.790
And that kind of
partnership is really

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.405
what we saw that
led to the success.
