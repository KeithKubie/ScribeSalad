00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
There's a lot of  misinformation out there about what it means to be a transgender

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.500
but recently,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.440
Scientists have begun to look more closely

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.560
into the Neurology, Physiology, and Psychology

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.120
behind it.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.440
So today, we're gonna break down what Science does knows

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.660
in a respectful and educational way.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.660
Hey guys! I'm Gigi Gorgeous

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.660
And today, I'm here with ASAPScience

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.660
to break down 'The Science of Being a Transgender'

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.120
Before we get to deep into it,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.120
we have to look at your genetic sex.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.120
Or the chromosomes you have.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.120
These were determined right after fertilization.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.120
When the sperm cell from your father

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.080
which carries an 'X' or a 'Y' chromosome

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.000
fuse with the egg from your mother, which carries an 'X' chromosome.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.360
But until 6 or 7 weeks after fertilization,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.700
both 'XY' and 'XX' embryos

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.100
have identical gonads.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.900
Around 7 weeks

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.900
the male sex organs start to develop

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.900
because of  a gene on 'Y' chromosome

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.240
called 'SRY'

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
It causes cells to become more specialized

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
and these cells creates 'Testosterone'

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
which in turns trigger the development

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020
of the structure like the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.960
penis and scrotum.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.840
While other cells block female development

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.840
by the degenerating the female ducts

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.840
However, in female development

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.920
because there is no 'Y' chromosome with the 'SRY' gene.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.140
These ducts stay intact and become the uterus

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.040
cervix, upper vagina, and the oviduct

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.660
with the help of Estrogen, and chemicals secreted by

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.080
the early kidney.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.280
But it's not always that simple.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.520
There are some times even when RARE COMBINATIONS

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.300
like 'XXY', 'XXX' 'XXYY' etc.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.440
And even people with

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.920
'XX" Chromosomes that develop male genitals and characteristics

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.580
Due to a piece of the 'Y' chromosome breaking off,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.940
and switching places to an 'X' chromosome.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.120
But SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION in a brain,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.760
actually happens much later than Gonadal Differentiation.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And yes, although controversial

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Male and Female brains have

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
structural and functional diffrences

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.160
between each other.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.080
Studies have found that

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.560
males generally have a larger cerebrum

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.340
cerebellum.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.480
and hippo campus.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.040
While females have

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.480
higher density left frontal lobe,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600
and larger volumes in the right frontal lobe.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.600
So what exactly do we see

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.580
when we look in the brain

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.860
of a transgender person?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.320
Several studies have shown that

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.060
transgender brains are both

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.980
structural and functionally more

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.380
similar to their experienced gender identity

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.960
than their biological sex.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.160
One study found that transwomen who

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.960
despite being assigned male at birth

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.320
had a smaller female size structure in the hypothalamus.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.960
MRI scans also show the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.960
brain structures of trans people

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.960
to be more similar in thickness into their

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.960
experienced gender and not their sex.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.600
Finally the pheromone Androstadienone causes

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.520
different hypothalamic responses in male &amp; female brains

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.620
And when the individuals  with 'Gender Dysphoria' were exposed to it,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.680
the hypothalamic response match their Perceived gender rather than their sex.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.180
These studies help to highlight masculinisations

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.360
or feminisations of the Gonads

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.360
is not always the same as the brain

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.360
and that there's a difference between

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.120
your sex or your anatomy

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.360
and your gender or how you perceived your own body.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.940
There also seems to be

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.360
a genetic component to transgender identity.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.700
Looking at family histories,

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.240
gender identity in congruence seems to run in the family,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.360
meaning they maybe inherited

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.360
The 'CYP17' gene which controls

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.360
the body's level of sex hormones

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.360
has a changed allele that is expressed

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.520
frequently in trans man.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.320
Although more research could be done,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.320
scientists are currently at looking at over

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.320
3 Million DNA Markers for transgender identity

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.420
to investigate any genetic link for being trans.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.820
Even though scientific studies

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.920
validate the experience of transgender people

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.820
there's still suffering from more

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.640
depression and anxiety than the general public.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.820
The risk of suicide

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.820
is more prominent in transgender people

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.280
who have been rejected by their family

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.820
discriminated in their workplace,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.380
or in health care.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.100
Sucide risks seems to

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.480
decreased after gender transitioning.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.480
Suggesting that gender dysphoria can cause

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.480
an extreme amount of emotional pain

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.480
even to the point of suicide.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.480
If you, a family member, or a friend is

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.480
suffering from gender dysphoria ,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.180
there are few links in the description

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.460
for more information.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.360

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.640
validating transgender experiences with science

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.780
which is brings closer to equality.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.940
