00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.320
When I’m watching a movie you can pretty
much do whatever you want to the hero and

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.080
I don’t mind, but if their dog dies I cry
like a little baby with “no-tears” shampoo

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.610
in their little baby eyes.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.280
Why is that?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.270
Hi everyone, Julian here for DNews from YouTube
Space LA.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.400
We love our pets.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.870
And I don’t just mean crazy cat ladies who
eschew traditional human relationships for

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.000
feline companionship.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.890
According to a 2011 Harris poll, 90% of pet
dog or cat owning Americans consider their

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.250
furry cohabitors part of the family.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.780
Moviemakers exploit our empathy for animals
all the time; if we’re supposed to like

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.230
a character we just met, give him a loyal
dog and boom!

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.350
Instant good guy.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.550
And yes, I realize supervillains have white
fluffy cats on their laps when they swivel

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.969
their armchairs around, but c’mon, cats
are like the physical embodiment of evil.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.039
Full disclosure: I’m a dog person.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.850
But I guess evil things need love too and
so here we are, with cats and dogs as valuable

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.070
members of the family.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.569
They might even be the favorite member of
the family, because the American Animal Hospital

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:03.579
Association surveyed married female dog owners...
that is, dog owners who were female and married,

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.770
not owners of married female dogs, ugh, English.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.270
Anyway, 40% of the women surveyed said they
got more emotional support from their pet

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.920
than their husbands or children, which…
is terrible.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.159
C’mon people, call your mother.

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.240
So why do we care about animals?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.520
Or, I suppose I should narrow that down, why
do we care about certain animals.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.759
After all most of us still eat bacon or chicken,
but cringe at the thought of eating Mr. Whiskers.

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.560
It’s probably because animals like our house
pets are cute.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.119
They have big eyes, they can be kind of clumsy
and dumb, and they’re innocent.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.280
In that way they’re an awful lot like babies,
and we think of babies as cute because otherwise

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.810
it would be really easy to abandon a screaming,
pooping chubby bald mini-person in the woods

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.810
somewhere.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.530
We feel attached to cute babies even if they’re
not ours.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.399
A 2009 University of Muenster study asked
women who had never given birth to look at

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.420
pictures of babies inside an fMRI machine.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.299
The women were in the machine, not the babies.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.600
Argh, English!

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.600
The pictures activated parts of their brains
associated with reward, and the cuter the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.679
baby, the more that region lit up.

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.930
Men had similar reactions, but not as strong.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.260
Some of the same chemicals that make people
go all melty for babies are present when we

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.260
deal with pets.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.220
A recent study found that oxytocin, the hormone
that facilitates bonding, went up 300% in

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.440
dog owners who gazed into their pet’s eyes.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.670
So it’s possible animals are hacking into
our love of cuteness and by extension our

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.910
instinct to protect the helpless and innocent.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.110
But the difference is we see puppies and dogs
as almost equally innocent, but it’s not

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.110
the same at all with baby humans and adults.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.300
To illustrate this, 240 students at northeastern
university were given 4 different versions

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.080
of a fake news story where assailants either
severely injured a toddler, a puppy, a dog,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.190
or an adult.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.310
They were surveyed on their emotional reactions,
and the puppy elicited a stronger reaction

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.560
than the dog by only a narrow margin.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.900
The adult human got the least amount of sympathy
by far, and the toddler got the biggest response.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.630
The good news is that people, when it really
matters, will opt to save a human life over

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.630
a dog.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.630
Probably.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.420
Georgia Regents University psychologists asked
573 people what they would do if a bus was

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.020
hurtling towards a person and a dog and they
could save only one.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.950
If the dog was their personal pet and the
person was an unknown tourist, the tourist

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.770
would be a messy red hood ornament 40% of
the time.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.250
If the choice was between a strange tourist
and a strange dog though, the tourist’s

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.250
odds were much better.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.890
They’d be unwilling bus passengers only
14% of the time.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.800
Interestingly, women were almost twice as
likely to save the dog, which fits in line

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.940
with the cuteness hypothesis from earlier.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.530
So I guess if you’re going to get hit by
a bus, try to do it near a man?

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.120
So we like our pets more than adults but we
don’t like them as much as our babies.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.900
For that actual chemical explanation, Crystal
explains what’s happening in your brain

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.370
meats down here.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.370
POP QUIZ HOT SHOT!

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.640
There’s a dog and a tourist in a hawaiian
shirt and sandals with socks in the street.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.060
A bus is speeding towards them at 50 miles
per hour and it can’t slow down.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.810
What do you do?

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.860
WHAT DO YOU DO?

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.560
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
