Bayne: One thing
you need to think about

00:00:01.868 --> 00:00:03.601
is if you want
your web application

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:05.000
to behave
like a normal website,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.968
then you need to worry
about what the back button does.

00:00:06.968 --> 00:00:08.901
And GWT provides
a history class

00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:11.033
that allows you
to integrate with the back--

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.601
with the sort of
browser history.

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.100
But you need to think
about how that influences

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.701
the structure
of your application.

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:18.400
Because it's easy
to write something

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.067
that works
like a desktop application,

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:21.434
but then the back button
doesn't actually do

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:22.901
what you would expect.

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:24.968
And so if you want things
to sort of meet

00:00:24.968 --> 00:00:27.000
a user's expectations
in that regard,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.801
you need to kind of
structure your applications

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:31.167
so that it has
a sort of history itself.
