00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.790
Turns out if your Mom was really stressed,
CONGRATULATIONS NOW YOU'RE STRESSED TOO!

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.650
THANKS, O-MAMA.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.180
Back in 1998, an ice storm hit North America,
if you live anywhere near the Canadian border,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.770
you probably remember it -- I do.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.770
It was CRAZY.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.540
Everything was covered in ice from Michigan
to Maine and Ontario to Nova Scotia.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.560
The weight of all that ice caused massive
damage to infrastructure in both countries

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.230
and power outages dragged on for weeks after.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.220
Not to be caught in the rain, researchers
at McGill in Canada found pregnant mothers

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.370
who were without power, and followed them,
and their offspring, for thirteen YEARS.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.770
Turns out, the North American Ice Storm of
1998 affected the kids’ DNA!

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.750
It used to be thought that if I physically
stressed my body, it wouldn't affect my kids

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.750
at all.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.399
If *I* was in a famine, my kids couldn't be
affected by that!

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.170
And then… it turns out… that's not true
at all.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.990
In the 1990s the field of epigenetics came
onto the scene and we discovered what happens

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.190
to our PARENTS will affect US, and what happens
to US affects our KIDS and so on down the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.190
line forever.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.130
This study, published in PlosONE, found the
children of those mothers had quote, "distinctive

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.150
patterns in DNA methylation."

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.030
DNA methylation is the on-off switch for how
the DNA gives its instructions.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.010
Whether to to produce a bone or a red blood
cell for example would have different methylation.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.619
Alterations of that process change how the
same DNA will be read by your body.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.430
In this case, a correlation appeared to exist
between the length of time without power and

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.280
subjective level of suffering of these mothers,
with the methylation of their children's DNA!

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.830
36 of the children tested, showed the same
pattern of methylation on their T-cells.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.760
These cells are part of the immune system,
so chances are, these kids will have some

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.420
kind of immnuo-differentiation from their
parents…

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.750
If you're wondering what that will mean, you're
right there with me and the other scientists.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.910
They don't know yet.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.540
It's not like they can compare the kids pre
and post DNA methylation!

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.680
They were born that way!

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.910
But this is the first time ever, in humans,
that science has been able to show that a

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.870
single maternal stressor was able to affect
the DNA of their offspring.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.060
Now that we know this happens in humans, we
can go back into history and see what we can

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.200
learn from these epigenetic changes.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.260
Using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents
and Children in England -- a study of 14,000

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.450
pregnant women, their husbands and children
-- found men who smoked during PUBERTY (way

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.170
before they sired a kid) birthed sons who
were fatter than average, even from those

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.730
who started smoking later.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.780
Daughters were fine, but for some reason,
the methylation affected the boys.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.069
A famine-feast cycle in 19th-century Sweden
altered the DNA of kids born as late as 1905.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.890
Grandfathers who were over-nourished just
before puberty, had grandchildren who were

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.000
at risk of early death.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.660
What about the Great Depression here in the
States?

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.750
How did my grandmother living through that
affect ME?!

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.849
The 9/11 attacks too!

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.570
What about going into space?

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:21.780
How will that affect future humans and THEIR
epigenetics?
