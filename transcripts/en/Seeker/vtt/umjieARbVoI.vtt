Could waiting to have kids be the key to a
long life? Ask me again in 60 years.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.460
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and it's no
secret that we live in an age where women

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.250
are trying to have it all. We have jobs, we
have hobbies - but where do children come

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.450
in? My parents always ask me. Well it turns
out waiting to have kids - may not be such

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.719
a bad things after all.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.710
A new study from the Boston University School
of Medicine has found that women who wait

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.890
to have children later in life - may actually
live longer than women who don't.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.189
This study was published in this month's issue
of Menopause, and is based on data collected

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.050
from the Long Life Family Study - which is
an ongoing study of 551 different families

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.230
with members who've lived exceptionally long
lives.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.570
They looked at 462 women from those families,
and determined how long they lived to be,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.780
as well as the age at which they had their
last child. Turns out - women who gave birth

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.880
to their last child after the age of 33, were
twice as likely to live to age 95 or older,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.870
than women who had their last child by age
29.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.240
Previous studies on this topic have found
similar results, including one that showed

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.380
that women who give birth to a child after
age 40 are 4 times more likely to live to

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.820
100 years old.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.869
Scientists warn that while this doesn't mean
women should wait to have children just to

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.840
improve their chances of living longer - it
does highlight the important relationship

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.450
between aging and fertility. Being able to
have children at an older age, indicates that

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.869
a woman's reproductive system is aging slowly
- so it makes sense that the rest of her body

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:21.780
would as well.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.710
With that in mind, it's also believed that
women may be the driving force behind our

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.189
ever-increasing longevity. If a woman has
the right combination of genetic variants,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.819
that can slow down the aging process and decrease
the risk for age-related genes - then her

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.719
chances of passing those genes down to her
children, will also increase. Leading to offspring

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.579
with longer life expectancies than the rest
of the population.

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.749
Given that over 85% of the people who live
to be 100, are women - this study sheds even

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:52.450
more light on how awesome and amazing our
gender really is. No editorializing whatsoever.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.499
And while we're on the topic of awesome ladies,
let me remind you of one of my favorite women

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.609
in recent history, Tina Fey. Her book Bossypants
is all about being a working mother in Hollywood.
