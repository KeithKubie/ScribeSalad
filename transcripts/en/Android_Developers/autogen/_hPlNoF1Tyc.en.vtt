example if we go and we look into the
 

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:06.680
example if we go and we look into the
4000 Hertz we see that the threshold is

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:06.690
4000 Hertz we see that the threshold is
 

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.660
4000 Hertz we see that the threshold is
lower in there then means that we need

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:08.670
lower in there then means that we need
 

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.240
lower in there then means that we need
less energy we need a lot let the sounds

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:11.250
less energy we need a lot let the sounds
 

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.880
less energy we need a lot let the sounds
can be fainter they can be softer and we

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:13.890
can be fainter they can be softer and we
 

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.829
can be fainter they can be softer and we
will hear them where you have a sound

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839

microphones all of these curves are
really important to know what people

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:42.390
really important to know what people
 

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.570
really important to know what people
will actually hear and what they are

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580
will actually hear and what they are
 

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.060
will actually hear and what they are
sensitive to but this course can shift

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:49.070
sensitive to but this course can shift
 

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.460
sensitive to but this course can shift
so we can have healing threshold shifts

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:52.470
so we can have healing threshold shifts
 

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.310
so we can have healing threshold shifts
due to so many circumstances let's say

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320
due to so many circumstances let's say
 

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.710
due to so many circumstances let's say
the noise in the environment a minute

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720
the noise in the environment a minute
 

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.870
the noise in the environment a minute
ago we have the AC blasting here and

00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880
ago we have the AC blasting here and
 

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.300
ago we have the AC blasting here and
that was a threshold shift we needed to

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:02.310
that was a threshold shift we needed to
 

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.160
that was a threshold shift we needed to
have sounds that were weighed louder

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.170
have sounds that were weighed louder
 

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.310
have sounds that were weighed louder
over that ratio to be able to listen to

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320
over that ratio to be able to listen to
 

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.140
over that ratio to be able to listen to
hear the sounds when they see it turn

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:09.150
hear the sounds when they see it turn
 

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.050
hear the sounds when they see it turn
off a minute ago as well we can speak

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.060
off a minute ago as well we can speak
 

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.210
off a minute ago as well we can speak
softer and we can we hear that our

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.220
softer and we can we hear that our
 

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.270
softer and we can we hear that our
threshold shifted down at the moment so

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:17.280
threshold shifted down at the moment so
 

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.120
threshold shifted down at the moment so
a threshold shift is a region that will

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:20.130
a threshold shift is a region that will
 

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.880
a threshold shift is a region that will
need more energy for you to be able to

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.870
not all over the spectrum and the
previous one we can have shifts there

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880
previous one we can have shifts there
 

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.390

going to allow you to hear things very
well around 500 Hertz these shifts could

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320
well around 500 Hertz these shifts could
 

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.830
well around 500 Hertz these shifts could
be permanent or all your lives are going

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:51.840
be permanent or all your lives are going
 

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.660
be permanent or all your lives are going
to have that shift or could be temporary

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:53.670
to have that shift or could be temporary
 

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.820
to have that shift or could be temporary
as Brian mentioned could be a temporary

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:55.830
as Brian mentioned could be a temporary
 

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.430
as Brian mentioned could be a temporary
situational disability that means that

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440
situational disability that means that
 

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.950
situational disability that means that
for that period of time for you are not

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:00.960
for that period of time for you are not
 

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.720
for that period of time for you are not
going to be able to hear things around

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:02.730
going to be able to hear things around
 

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.120
going to be able to hear things around
those frequencies because either your

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:05.130
those frequencies because either your
 

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.890
those frequencies because either your
headphones are not working well you are

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:06.900
headphones are not working well you are
 

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.690
headphones are not working well you are
enough noise the environment your ears

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:08.700
enough noise the environment your ears
 

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.680
enough noise the environment your ears
are not working well at that moment

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:11.690
are not working well at that moment
 

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.150
are not working well at that moment
sounds that are below that threshold

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160
sounds that are below that threshold
 

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.420
sounds that are below that threshold
that shifted threshold you are not going

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:17.430
that shifted threshold you are not going
 

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.040
that shifted threshold you are not going
to be able to hear that and that's the

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.050
to be able to hear that and that's the
 

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.930
to be able to hear that and that's the
important takeaway from this if he's

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940
important takeaway from this if he's
 

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.380
important takeaway from this if he's
below the threshold you cannot hear so

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:24.390
below the threshold you cannot hear so
 

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.150
below the threshold you cannot hear so
what happens when we have a sound of

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160
what happens when we have a sound of
 

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.620
what happens when we have a sound of
interest let's say that you are

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:27.630
interest let's say that you are
 

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.510
interest let's say that you are
listening to music or someone is

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:29.520
listening to music or someone is
 

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.790
listening to music or someone is
speaking or some sound that interests

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800
speaking or some sound that interests
 

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.040
speaking or some sound that interests
you so in depth in the plot I just put a

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.050
you so in depth in the plot I just put a
 

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.020
you so in depth in the plot I just put a
blob that's a green blob in there and

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.030
blob that's a green blob in there and
 

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.420
blob that's a green blob in there and
it's a broadband sound has a lot of

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:38.430
it's a broadband sound has a lot of
 

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.280
it's a broadband sound has a lot of
frequencies and it has energy all over

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:40.290
frequencies and it has energy all over
 

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.860
frequencies and it has energy all over
the place but if you notice again around

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:42.870
the place but if you notice again around
 

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.470
the place but if you notice again around
500 Hertz a lot of the energy that is

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480
500 Hertz a lot of the energy that is
 

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.990
500 Hertz a lot of the energy that is
below the threshold the shifted tray so

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000
below the threshold the shifted tray so
 

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.600
below the threshold the shifted tray so
the blue one is going to be lost when

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:50.610
the blue one is going to be lost when
 

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.640
the blue one is going to be lost when
you have a sound of interest that is

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:52.650
you have a sound of interest that is
 

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.130
you have a sound of interest that is
below the treasure the shifted ratio a

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140
below the treasure the shifted ratio a
 

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.040
below the treasure the shifted ratio a
is it's going to be difficult to be

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.050
is it's going to be difficult to be
 

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.740
is it's going to be difficult to be
heard or the intially dental ability is

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:00.750
heard or the intially dental ability is
 

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.900
heard or the intially dental ability is
really bad you cannot understand the

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:02.910
really bad you cannot understand the
 

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.450
really bad you cannot understand the
sound so this is the question that

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:05.460
sound so this is the question that
 

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.130
sound so this is the question that
everybody is asking how can sound

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:07.140
everybody is asking how can sound
 

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.830
everybody is asking how can sound
amplifier help us right now so I'm glad

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:09.840
amplifier help us right now so I'm glad
 

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.430
amplifier help us right now so I'm glad
that you asked

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440
that you asked
 

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.000
that you asked
sound employer is going to take the

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.010
sound employer is going to take the
 

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.400
sound employer is going to take the
sounds and is going to actually boost

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:16.410
sounds and is going to actually boost
 

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.050
sounds and is going to actually boost
them word you need them the most

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060
them word you need them the most
 

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.420
them word you need them the most
if we look again in the in the range

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:20.430
if we look again in the in the range
 

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.550
if we look again in the in the range
from 500 Hertz to 1 kilohertz

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560
from 500 Hertz to 1 kilohertz
 

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.590
from 500 Hertz to 1 kilohertz
we took the sounds and in this new

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600
we took the sounds and in this new
 

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.990
we took the sounds and in this new
process sound we took the sounds that

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000
process sound we took the sounds that
 

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.970
process sound we took the sounds that
were really soft that they didn't have

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980
were really soft that they didn't have
 

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.280
were really soft that they didn't have
that much energy and we boosted them all

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:31.290
that much energy and we boosted them all
 

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.830
that much energy and we boosted them all
the way over the chip the treasure so

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:33.840
the way over the chip the treasure so
 

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.800
the way over the chip the treasure so
now we can hear those but very important

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:36.810
now we can hear those but very important
 

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.600
now we can hear those but very important
we took the sounds that were already

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:38.610
we took the sounds that were already
 

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.840
we took the sounds that were already
loud and we moved them up but not too

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:41.850
loud and we moved them up but not too
 

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.210
loud and we moved them up but not too
much up so the loud sounds got louder

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220
much up so the loud sounds got louder
 

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.710
much up so the loud sounds got louder
but not too loud so if you see this the

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720
but not too loud so if you see this the
 

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.050
but not too loud so if you see this the
process that happened it was not uniform

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.060
process that happened it was not uniform
 

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.780
process that happened it was not uniform
all over the spectrum it was shifting

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:53.790
all over the spectrum it was shifting
 

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.150
all over the spectrum it was shifting
and trying to accommodate them over our

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160
and trying to accommodate them over our
 

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.610

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799
change the multi one parameter the
 

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:25.129
change the multi one parameter the

in the channel two and I want to change

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:27.210
in the channel two and I want to change
 

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.049
in the channel two and I want to change
this we are giving you an API to do all

00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:30.059
this we are giving you an API to do all
 

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:32.060
this we are giving you an API to do all
of those things one thing that I want

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.070
of those things one thing that I want
 

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.129
of those things one thing that I want
you to notice is the limiters the

00:20:34.129 --> 00:20:34.139
you to notice is the limiters the
 

00:20:34.139 --> 00:20:36.860
you to notice is the limiters the
limiters are linked limiters I'm going

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:36.870
limiters are linked limiters I'm going
 

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.149
limiters are linked limiters I'm going
to talk more about that but it's

00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159
to talk more about that but it's
 

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:39.649
to talk more about that but it's
important when you are talking about

00:20:39.649 --> 00:20:39.659
important when you are talking about
 

00:20:39.659 --> 00:20:42.350
important when you are talking about
buta channel to be able to change all

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360
buta channel to be able to change all
 

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.159
buta channel to be able to change all
the limiters kind of at once if you need

00:20:45.159 --> 00:20:45.169
the limiters kind of at once if you need
 

00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:49.159

so now finally code yes we promise code

00:20:49.159 --> 00:20:49.169
so now finally code yes we promise code
 

00:20:49.169 --> 00:20:51.560
so now finally code yes we promise code
we have some code so this is an instance

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:51.570
we have some code so this is an instance
 

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.269
we have some code so this is an instance
instance here is an example of the

00:20:53.269 --> 00:20:53.279
instance here is an example of the
 

00:20:53.279 --> 00:20:56.060
instance here is an example of the
dynamics processing effect for this we

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:56.070
dynamics processing effect for this we
 

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.529
dynamics processing effect for this we
decide because we have so many

00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:57.539
decide because we have so many
 

00:20:57.539 --> 00:20:59.060
decide because we have so many
parameters and so many things that can

00:20:59.060 --> 00:20:59.070
parameters and so many things that can
 

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.430
parameters and so many things that can
be configured to have a conflict builder

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440
be configured to have a conflict builder
 

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.340
be configured to have a conflict builder
so you create a config builder and then

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:04.350
so you create a config builder and then
 

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.990
so you create a config builder and then
we are actually going to instantiate the

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000
we are actually going to instantiate the
 

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.090
we are actually going to instantiate the
effect first with a config builder in

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.100
effect first with a config builder in
 

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.470
effect first with a config builder in
this example we we can have some

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480
this example we we can have some
 

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.629
this example we we can have some
parameters like the variant the number

00:21:14.629 --> 00:21:14.639
parameters like the variant the number
 

00:21:14.639 --> 00:21:15.919
parameters like the variant the number
of channels I have to talk more about

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:15.929
of channels I have to talk more about
 

00:21:15.929 --> 00:21:18.740
of channels I have to talk more about
this dozen a second then we can enable

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:18.750
this dozen a second then we can enable
 

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.990
this dozen a second then we can enable
or disable each one of the stages in

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000
or disable each one of the stages in
 

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.610
or disable each one of the stages in
this example we have all the stages

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.620
this example we have all the stages
 

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.769
this example we have all the stages
enabled yes we want to use pre queue

00:21:24.769 --> 00:21:24.779
enabled yes we want to use pre queue
 

00:21:24.779 --> 00:21:26.930
enabled yes we want to use pre queue

compressor ten bands and the post-acute
 

00:21:39.929 --> 00:21:43.129
compressor ten bands and the post-acute
13 bands the only limitation is like the

00:21:43.129 --> 00:21:43.139
13 bands the only limitation is like the
 

00:21:43.139 --> 00:21:44.899
13 bands the only limitation is like the
stage type needs to have the same number

00:21:44.899 --> 00:21:44.909
stage type needs to have the same number
 

00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:46.789
stage type needs to have the same number
of bands but then you can choose any

00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799
of bands but then you can choose any
 

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:47.930

duration that you you can set in the

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080
duration that you you can set in the
 

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.769
duration that you you can set in the
config builder then in the last line we

00:22:00.769 --> 00:22:00.779
config builder then in the last line we
 

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:03.230
config builder then in the last line we
are actually creating a configuration we

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240
are actually creating a configuration we
 

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.879
are actually creating a configuration we
are saying build and we have a

00:22:04.879 --> 00:22:04.889
are saying build and we have a
 

00:22:04.889 --> 00:22:10.909
are saying build and we have a
configuration object then I I don't want

00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919
configuration object then I I don't want
 

00:22:10.919 --> 00:22:12.440
configuration object then I I don't want
to use the configuration directly

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:12.450
to use the configuration directly
 

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.899
to use the configuration directly

level from the API viewpoint and you can

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.170
level from the API viewpoint and you can
 

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.810
level from the API viewpoint and you can
go and change the parameters on the EQ

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:11.820
go and change the parameters on the EQ
 

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.510
go and change the parameters on the EQ
or change the parameters in each one of

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520
or change the parameters in each one of

deeper so we can go from we can go from

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:18.810
deeper so we can go from we can go from
 

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:22.940
deeper so we can go from we can go from
band to a the EQ from channel and then

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:22.950
band to a the EQ from channel and then
 

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.500
band to a the EQ from channel and then
the collection of channels so we have

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:24.510
the collection of channels so we have
 

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.660
the collection of channels so we have
access to all the granularity that we

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:26.670
access to all the granularity that we
 

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:28.880
access to all the granularity that we
want there the same thing for the

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:28.890
want there the same thing for the
 

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.710

multiband compressor we can access the

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720
multiband compressor we can access the
 

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.150
multiband compressor we can access the
multiband compression inside of the

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:32.160
multiband compression inside of the
 

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.480
multiband compression inside of the
channel and then access the parameters

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:35.490
channel and then access the parameters
 

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.370
channel and then access the parameters
that we have in each one of the bands

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380
that we have in each one of the bands
 

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.100
that we have in each one of the bands
and lastly the limiter we don't have

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:40.110
and lastly the limiter we don't have
 

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.780
and lastly the limiter we don't have
bands in the limiter only parameters

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:41.790

there and we can access that so now I'm

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940
there and we can access that so now I'm
 

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.060
there and we can access that so now I'm
going to dive a little bit more on each

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.070
going to dive a little bit more on each
 

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.060
going to dive a little bit more on each

this is easy to show what the multiband
 

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.870
this is easy to show what the multiband
compressor does as Brian mentioned and

multiband compressor is going to look

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:27.890
multiband compressor is going to look
 

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.100
multiband compressor is going to look
like they after that is the loud sound

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:30.110
like they after that is the loud sound
 

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.900
like they after that is the loud sound
is a little bit softer the medium one

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:31.910
is a little bit softer the medium one
 

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.539
is a little bit softer the medium one
stays medium and the salt one goes very

00:26:34.539 --> 00:26:34.549
stays medium and the salt one goes very
 

00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:37.539
stays medium and the salt one goes very
low the way that a multiband compressor

00:26:37.539 --> 00:26:37.549
low the way that a multiband compressor
 

00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:40.330
low the way that a multiband compressor
works or the parameters work a bear with

me for a second for this graphic is we

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:43.250
me for a second for this graphic is we
 

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.030
me for a second for this graphic is we
have the input how what is the level of

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:46.040
have the input how what is the level of
 

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.039
have the input how what is the level of
the of the signal in the in the

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:48.049
the of the signal in the in the
 

00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:50.919
the of the signal in the in the
horizontal axis and the numbers are from

00:26:50.919 --> 00:26:50.929
horizontal axis and the numbers are from
 

00:26:50.929 --> 00:26:54.580
horizontal axis and the numbers are from
minus 100 to 10 they lower the number

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:54.590
minus 100 to 10 they lower the number
 

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.450
minus 100 to 10 they lower the number
like minus 50 is way softer than minus

00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:58.460
like minus 50 is way softer than minus
 

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.340
like minus 50 is way softer than minus
10 for example some I understand will be

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.789
10 for example some I understand will be
louder a louder sound and when the

00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799
louder a louder sound and when the
 

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:05.919
louder a louder sound and when the
compressor what is doing is is analyzing

00:27:05.919 --> 00:27:05.929
compressor what is doing is is analyzing
 

00:27:05.929 --> 00:27:09.850
compressor what is doing is is analyzing
the input and if the input is above the

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:09.860
the input and if the input is above the
 

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.289
the input and if the input is above the
threshold we have a threshold parameter

00:27:11.289 --> 00:27:11.299
threshold we have a threshold parameter
 

00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:13.390
threshold we have a threshold parameter
is going to decide to say you know

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:13.400
is going to decide to say you know

is going to decide to say you know
that's too loud I'm going to bring you

00:27:14.919 --> 00:27:14.929
that's too loud I'm going to bring you
 

00:27:14.929 --> 00:27:17.500
that's too loud I'm going to bring you
down but if it happens to be below the

treasure is not touch so for example in
 

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:23.350
treasure is not touch so for example in
this graphic if we choose minus 40 the

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360
this graphic if we choose minus 40 the
 

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.020
this graphic if we choose minus 40 the
input was minus 40 level they all will

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:26.030
input was minus 40 level they all will
 

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.630
input was minus 40 level they all will
be exactly - sorry we are below the

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640
be exactly - sorry we are below the
 

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.340
be exactly - sorry we are below the
threshold we are not going to modify

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:30.350
threshold we are not going to modify
 

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:33.039
threshold we are not going to modify
that signal but the threshold here is

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:33.049
that signal but the threshold here is
 

00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:36.310
that signal but the threshold here is
around 25 minus 25 so if I choose a

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320
around 25 minus 25 so if I choose a
 

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.450
around 25 minus 25 so if I choose a
value of minus 20 the actual output will

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:40.460
value of minus 20 the actual output will
 

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.780
value of minus 20 the actual output will
be a around sorry let's say let's choose

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:43.790
be a around sorry let's say let's choose
 

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.680
be a around sorry let's say let's choose
an input of minus 10 sorry that's better

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:46.690
an input of minus 10 sorry that's better
 

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.080
an input of minus 10 sorry that's better
minus 10 as an input would map to a

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:50.090
minus 10 as an input would map to a
 

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.600
minus 10 as an input would map to a
minus 20 to the output then we that the

minus 20 to the output then we that the
 

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.120
minus 20 to the output then we that the
sound became softer just because it was

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:55.130
sound became softer just because it was
 

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.789
sound became softer just because it was

parameters we are able to do what we
 

00:28:07.429 --> 00:28:09.010

have been promising that we are able to
 

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.830
have been promising that we are able to
take sounds and make them sell out but

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840
take sounds and make them sell out but
 

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.080
take sounds and make them sell out but
take loud sounds and make them softer

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.090
take loud sounds and make them softer
 

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:15.760
take loud sounds and make them softer
and that's what a multiband compressor

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:15.770
and that's what a multiband compressor
 

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.460
and that's what a multiband compressor
is doing and is doing these in different

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.980
is doing and is doing these in different
bands we can take regions of frequency

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:20.990
bands we can take regions of frequency
 

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.760
bands we can take regions of frequency
from 0 to 1000 Hertz and they and be

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:24.770

most complex ones you can get these
 

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.440
most complex ones you can get these
settings and getters so we can get the

settings and getters so we can get the
 

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.260

this why do you have a pregame a
 

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.010
this why do you have a pregame a

exactly the same but we did that for one
 

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:12.100

reason we talked to a lot of developers

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:12.110
reason we talked to a lot of developers
 

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:13.900

multiple bands and what this is doing is
 

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.180
multiple bands and what this is doing is
pretty much the same is taking a sound

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:58.190
pretty much the same is taking a sound

don't want that loud sound to come out
 

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.900
don't want that loud sound to come out

different group so you can keep your a

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:24.170
different group so you can keep your a
 

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.920
different group so you can keep your a
spatial image intact and that was

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:26.930
spatial image intact and that was
 

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.930

at that moment so we could hear things a

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:14.450
at that moment so we could hear things a
 

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:18.190
at that moment so we could hear things a
little bit better a we learn about the

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200
little bit better a we learn about the
 

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.780
little bit better a we learn about the
hearing threshold and the hearing

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:19.790
hearing threshold and the hearing
 

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.750
hearing threshold and the hearing
threshold shifts and how they power the

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760
threshold shifts and how they power the
 

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.440
