00:00:00.045 --> 00:00:03.145
 Mars has always been a second virtual home for humans, 

00:00:03.145 --> 00:00:08.440
 But with the start of a plan to send people and colonize the Red Planet as early as next decade 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.740
 Do you have what it takes to get to and live on Mars? 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.980
 The first challenge you get is during the launch phase 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.060
 High levels of acceleration may destroy the body 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.740
 At about 9g most people lose consciousness because of anemia in the brain 

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:23.155
 As a result, human missions were limited to 3g 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.600
 Or three times the force of gravity on earth 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.800
 Which astronauts are trained to deal with 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.140
 So if you can survive in the first few minutes without a missile system failure or stress reduction problems 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.680
 Your focus is to protect yourself from the sun's rays 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.360
 Leave the atmosphere and protect us 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.000
 Increase your risk of cancer and destroy your central nervous system 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.760
 You definitely want to go when the Earth is in alignment with Mars 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.580
 Which occurs every two years 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.140
 You will usually spend 150 days on your way to the trip 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.075
 You may also wish to consider removing the bitterness and excess of a long extended journey 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.145
 Because it can protect those members from explosion due to pressure changes. 

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.860
 Gmsk now adapts to the smaller gravity 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.260
 You will now feel the side effects of weight loss 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.080
 The fluids of your body will turn up all over the body, 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.140
 Causing you headaches and temporary blindness 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.080
 You can also expect a slow digestive system because your body adjusts itself 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.140
 Because of the limited space, she may wear the same clothes for a long time 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.640
 Even astronauts on the ISS dressed in their underwear for up to a week 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.800
 This explains why astronauts are more susceptible to urinary tract infection 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.055
 A study by NASA showed that pioneers lose an estimated amount 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.720
 With more than 1% of bone mineral density per month 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.980
 If you want to work about two hours a day 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.520
 As astronauts do aboard the International Space Station, you will have a better chance to face this 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.300
 Sex may also help, but it may consist a bit tricky 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.760
 According to Newton's Third Law, each movement of the couple will confront the other 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.900
 Q2SUIT: A space suit designed for two people which in turn can be compressed like a sleeping bag 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.960
 It is forbidden to push one of the other two away 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.060
 Once you land on Mars, you will begin to notice the differences between 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.640
 Your new home and planet 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.560
 Mars is farther from the sun, so the temperature ranges from -140 ° to 30 ° 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.680
 But that does not mean you can walk outside on warmer days 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.240
 The Earth's atmosphere is 100 times more intense than Mars 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.720
 So you'll stay protected from the sun's rays 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.400
 This means that you may have to get used to living in an underground habitat 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.680
 When you leave your home, you may wear sweating clothes 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.360
 To protect your blood from boiling 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.160
 Otherwise, your members will be free of atmospheric pressure 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.140
 The food will be dry, ice-cold and packed with nutritional requirements that taste good though 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.520
 You will have a thin fabric, so your botanist can grow fresh fruits, vegetables and vegetables 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.880
 You'll get to see vegetables grow naturally outside 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.000
 Or that people or animals are moving around you 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.760
 Using NASA's Mars simulation research, it is likely to live in a habitat 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.780
 Of small size, 900 square feet flat with a bunch of other sage 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.800
 You may need to stand together with people, or it may be difficult to find people to mate with 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.920
 And the development of a colony 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.220
 Genetic diversity is an important part of maintaining large healthy collections 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.160
 The lack of enough people for mating often leads to breeding or internal reproduction 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.300
 Studies have shown that it results in the loss of more than 80% of the diversity of the gene 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.100
 Causing your small community risk of extinction through disease 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.714
 An old study suggested that the new colony may need about 150 people 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.100
 To maintain the stability of genetic diversity, but more recent studies suggested that the figure 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.400
 Between 10,000 and 40,000 people we need 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.820
 If this is true, you may have to wait a few months for more sage to arrive 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.680
 Before they mate 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.140
 Even with all these risks, you will have to pass 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.900
 Test the space agency for pioneers before going 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.360
 Which will be mentally and physically strict, but if you are accepted 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.160
 Do you want to go? 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.760
