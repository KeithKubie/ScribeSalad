00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.260
First off, as you may have noticed, your tongue
is coated with saliva (shocker, I know), which

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.600
is about 99.5 percent water.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.680
In order for the tongue to not freeze when
sufficiently cold, the body sends blood rushing

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.810
to the tongue to heat it up.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.460
However, metal, in nearly all of its forms,
is a great conductor of heat, meaning that

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.000
heat relatively freely transfers through it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.590
If something conducts heat well, (most of
the time) you can feel it - literally, which

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.120
is why something like a metal wrench kept
at 25 degrees Fahrenheit (-3C) feels much

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.030
colder to your skin than air at the same temperature.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.750
Of the common metals, copper and aluminum
are best at this.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.680
Some of the most expensive cookware is made
out of copper due to its characteristic as

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.080
a thermal conductor.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.780
As for aluminum, there is a reason tin - or
aluminum - foil is a common household item

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.510
and is often used in ovens.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.830
(And if you're curious see our video: Why
is Aluminum Foil Shiny on One Side But Not

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.030
the Other?)

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.549
While iron conducts heat at about a third
of the rate as aluminum, it still does it

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:17.680
quite well.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.170
Stainless steel conducts heat at about a fifth
of the rate as iron but is also often used

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.250
as kitchenware, as it's still relatively great
at conducting heat.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.370
On the other hand, wood, plastic, and rubber
are not good heat conductors, with wood being

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.450
150 times less conductive than stainless steel.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.470
That is why when you stir a boiling pot with
a wooden spoon, you can hardly feel the heat

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.470
in the handle.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.240
With a solid steel, aluminum, iron, or copper
spoon, if you continued stirring like you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.310
would with the wood spoon, you would quickly
find yourself with a nice burn for your efforts.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.530
So, what really happens when you put your
warm tongue on a cold flagpole?

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.940
When the tongue makes contact with the pole,
the heat is rapidly transferred, cooling the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.060
tongue and forcing the body to send warmth
in the form of blood and heat energy.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.979
The problem is that, today, most metal flag
poles are made up of aluminum or steel (an

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.780
iron alloy with carbon), making them fine
heat conductors.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.620
The pole absorbs the heat quite readily, literally
sucking the warmth from your tongue faster

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.370
than your body can supply it.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.820
The saliva on your tongue then freezes (provided
it is below freezing), with the resulting

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.650
ice latching onto the flagpole and your very
porous tongue.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.220
You are stuck.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.190
Materials that are less ideal conductors of
heat won't provide this same rapid effect,

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.040
nor even in many cases are they capable of
cooling the surface of your tongue faster

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.950
than your body can heat it to keep it above
freezing.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.700
In some cases, the material might even have
an insulating effect.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.630
The more important question is, if found in
this situation, how do you get unstuck?

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.640
First off, do not pull or tug.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.700
If it is really cold and really stuck, there
is a risk that a piece of tongue will come

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.810
right off, causing much pain and blood.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.650
Thankfully, there is a simple solution- pour
warm water over where the tongue meets the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.989
pole, warming your tongue, the pole, and melting
the ice.

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.270
Of course, this is difficult to do without
help when you're stuck to a pole.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.390
If by yourself, try breathing hot breathes
onto the area.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.239
The moisture and warm air should dislodge
the tongue.

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.030
One could also try using warm hands and fingers
to melt the ice.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.140
If none of these things work, call the local
fire station.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.569
If you find it difficult to communicate your
problem with your tongue stuck, today many

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.180
emergency call centers accept texts.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.959
Bonus Fact:
• Some of the best solid heat conductors

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.840
are actually diamonds.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.790
Diamonds can be up to five times better thermal
conductors than copper.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.660
The strength of its covalent bonds creates
this characteristic, along with the strength

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.000
in general of a diamond (long considered one
of the most unbreakable items in the world,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.590
though in truth they are often easily crushed
to dust with a simple blow from a hammer).

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.690
• Licking an icicle can also cause a stuck
tongue.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.030
While not as a good of a heat conductor as
aluminum or iron, it is about ten times better

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.680
than rubber at this.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.660
As a rule, just stopping licking icy things
outdoors.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.959
Seriously.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:38.139
What’s wrong with you?
