00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.209
 
so today our episode is going to be a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219
so today our episode is going to be a
 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.130
so today our episode is going to be a
little a little bit of both design and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
little a little bit of both design and
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.030
little a little bit of both design and
development

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
development
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.010
development
not too much development you won't see

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
not too much development you won't see
 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.470
not too much development you won't see
any code you'll see maybe like a few

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
any code you'll see maybe like a few
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.709
any code you'll see maybe like a few
little pointers to things in there but

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
little pointers to things in there but
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.600
little pointers to things in there but
but it'll be mostly you know kind of for

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
but it'll be mostly you know kind of for
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.950
but it'll be mostly you know kind of for
designers but developers should effing

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
designers but developers should effing
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.930
designers but developers should effing
pay attention so today's episode is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
pay attention so today's episode is

titled iterative improvements and what

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
titled iterative improvements and what
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.439
titled iterative improvements and what
that means is we're gonna take a look at

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449
that means is we're gonna take a look at
 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.520
that means is we're gonna take a look at
a very bare-bones starting point app and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
a very bare-bones starting point app and
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.869
a very bare-bones starting point app and
this is not a real app it's just a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
this is not a real app it's just a
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.240
this is not a real app it's just a
hypothetical app and we'll see how over

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250
hypothetical app and we'll see how over
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.969
hypothetical app and we'll see how over
the course of a few kind of key steps we

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
the course of a few kind of key steps we
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.250
the course of a few kind of key steps we
can get it from a point of which it's

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
can get it from a point of which it's
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.050
can get it from a point of which it's
kind of you know nothing to be talked

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
kind of you know nothing to be talked
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.420
kind of you know nothing to be talked
about kind of a really ugly ish app

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
about kind of a really ugly ish app
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.230
about kind of a really ugly ish app
doesn't really you know create a great

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
doesn't really you know create a great
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.700
doesn't really you know create a great

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
reading experience to something that's
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.310
reading experience to something that's
that's a little better than that before

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
that's a little better than that before
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.390
that's a little better than that before
we get started you guys have any any

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
we get started you guys have any any
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.109
we get started you guys have any any
comments on on I guess actually before

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
comments on on I guess actually before
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.359
comments on on I guess actually before
that the type of app we're going to talk

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
that the type of app we're going to talk
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.520
that the type of app we're going to talk
about is is a basic like article reader

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
about is is a basic like article reader
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469
about is is a basic like article reader
not really an RSS reader like google

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
not really an RSS reader like google
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.210
not really an RSS reader like google
reader but basically something that has

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
reader but basically something that has
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.700
reader but basically something that has
a list of articles and the article

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
a list of articles and the article
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.399
a list of articles and the article
details should we just get started you

let's do it since we have tons of slides

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
let's do it since we have tons of slides
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.100
let's do it since we have tons of slides
so let's look at the bare bones app so

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
so let's look at the bare bones app so
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.139
so let's look at the bare bones app so
this is the starting point I'm sure many

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
this is the starting point I'm sure many
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.719
this is the starting point I'm sure many
of you have seen apps kind of like this

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
of you have seen apps kind of like this
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.569
of you have seen apps kind of like this
in the Play Store you know there there

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
in the Play Store you know there there
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.639
in the Play Store you know there there
are lots of issues at play here you know

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
are lots of issues at play here you know
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.560
are lots of issues at play here you know
a few first you know it's it's kind of

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570
a few first you know it's it's kind of
 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.050
a few first you know it's it's kind of
hard to tell the different articles and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
hard to tell the different articles and
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.139
hard to tell the different articles and
on the left apart there's no action bar

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
on the left apart there's no action bar
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.429
on the left apart there's no action bar
this is using the the pre Android 4.0

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
this is using the the pre Android 4.0
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.979
this is using the the pre Android 4.0
Android 3.0 title bar that's got the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989
Android 3.0 title bar that's got the
 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.229
Android 3.0 title bar that's got the
legacy menu button here all sorts of

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
legacy menu button here all sorts of
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.830
legacy menu button here all sorts of
things wrong

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
things wrong
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.350
things wrong
this and obviously you know there's lots

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
this and obviously you know there's lots
 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.009
this and obviously you know there's lots
of you know wrong spacing metrics we'll

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019
of you know wrong spacing metrics we'll
 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.750
of you know wrong spacing metrics we'll
talk about all the details in a bit but

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
talk about all the details in a bit but
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.070
talk about all the details in a bit but
this is kind of our starting point so

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080
this is kind of our starting point so
 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.420
this is kind of our starting point so
like I said we're gonna jump through a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430
like I said we're gonna jump through a
 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.949
like I said we're gonna jump through a
couple of different steps and along the

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959
couple of different steps and along the
 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.930
couple of different steps and along the
way we'll talk about what what is

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940
way we'll talk about what what is
 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.000
way we'll talk about what what is
involved in each step and how to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010
involved in each step and how to
 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.390
involved in each step and how to
actually do it so the first step is to

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
actually do it so the first step is to
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.420
actually do it so the first step is to
change to the holo theme and add an

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
change to the holo theme and add an
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.479
change to the holo theme and add an
action bar to your app so you could see

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489
action bar to your app so you could see
 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.100
action bar to your app so you could see
here that you know the the holo theme

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110
here that you know the the holo theme
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.420
here that you know the the holo theme
actually the holo theme automatically

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430
actually the holo theme automatically
 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.100
actually the holo theme automatically
gives you an action bar by default but

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110
gives you an action bar by default but
 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.479
gives you an action bar by default but
you have the action bar at the top and

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489
you have the action bar at the top and
 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.910
you have the action bar at the top and
what that gives you is that gives you a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920
what that gives you is that gives you a
 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.770
what that gives you is that gives you a
sense of place and to where you are in

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
sense of place and to where you are in
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.509
sense of place and to where you are in
the app and which app you're in so you

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519
the app and which app you're in so you
 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.120
the app and which app you're in so you
see the little icon here as well as some

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130
see the little icon here as well as some
 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.250
see the little icon here as well as some
some basic actions that are immediately

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
some basic actions that are immediately
 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.720
some basic actions that are immediately
available on the screen so things like

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
available on the screen so things like
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.979
available on the screen so things like
refresh if you want to be able to

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989
refresh if you want to be able to
 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.860
refresh if you want to be able to
refresh the list of articles as well as

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870
refresh the list of articles as well as
 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.470
refresh the list of articles as well as
an overflow giving you access to things

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480
an overflow giving you access to things
 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.970
an overflow giving you access to things
that usually you'd see and there's a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980
that usually you'd see and there's a
 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.270
that usually you'd see and there's a
legacy menu button awesome yeah and just

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280
legacy menu button awesome yeah and just
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.580
legacy menu button awesome yeah and just
from a developer standpoint you know

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590
from a developer standpoint you know
 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.350
from a developer standpoint you know
it's really a matter of enabling a

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360
it's really a matter of enabling a
 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.270
it's really a matter of enabling a
target SDK version for your application

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280
target SDK version for your application
 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.729
target SDK version for your application
in your manifest I think 11 or above

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739
in your manifest I think 11 or above
 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.410
in your manifest I think 11 or above
that obviously we recommend targeting

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420
that obviously we recommend targeting
 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.059
that obviously we recommend targeting
the latest platform version where you

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069
the latest platform version where you
 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.280
the latest platform version where you
where you can so in this case we just

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290
where you can so in this case we just
 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.509
where you can so in this case we just
put down here a little note that says

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519
put down here a little note that says
 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.940
put down here a little note that says
target SDK version of 17 and in addition

you know that there's a theme that you

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780
you know that there's a theme that you
 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.710
you know that there's a theme that you
can set for for holo so in this case

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720
can set for for holo so in this case
 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.140
can set for for holo so in this case
it's themed at holo light dark action

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150
it's themed at holo light dark action
 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.550
it's themed at holo light dark action

and once one reasonable thing to pick

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690
and once one reasonable thing to pick
 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.819
and once one reasonable thing to pick
out here is if you take a look at the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829
out here is if you take a look at the
 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.080
out here is if you take a look at the
background color in here you see it's

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090
background color in here you see it's
 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.610
background color in here you see it's
change from pretty much pure white to a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620
change from pretty much pure white to a
 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.740
change from pretty much pure white to a
slightly off-white which is part of the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750
slightly off-white which is part of the
 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.620
slightly off-white which is part of the
holo palette really and there's really

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630
holo palette really and there's really
 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.970
holo palette really and there's really
good reasons that we've selected these

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980
good reasons that we've selected these
 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.409
good reasons that we've selected these
kind of base colors for the for the base

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419
kind of base colors for the for the base
 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:58.699
kind of base colors for the for the base
things which you inherit from because

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709
things which you inherit from because
 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.229
things which you inherit from because
like whites on mobile can be like a

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239
like whites on mobile can be like a
 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.270
like whites on mobile can be like a
searingly bright color which you want to

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
searingly bright color which you want to
 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.520
searingly bright color which you want to
use sparingly and it's not very great

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530
use sparingly and it's not very great
 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.080
use sparingly and it's not very great
for kind of a background color so and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090
for kind of a background color so and
 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.849
for kind of a background color so and
you know it's a subtle change but it

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859
you know it's a subtle change but it
 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.530
you know it's a subtle change but it
instantly makes the app easier to read

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540
instantly makes the app easier to read
 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.349
instantly makes the app easier to read
it for sure and we've kept that

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359
it for sure and we've kept that
 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.000
it for sure and we've kept that
throughout so you'll see you know kind

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010
throughout so you'll see you know kind
 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.349
throughout so you'll see you know kind
of the evolution of this design with

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359
of the evolution of this design with
 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.940
of the evolution of this design with
with more branding elements and things

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950
with more branding elements and things
 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.500
with more branding elements and things
of that and we've kept that default

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510
of that and we've kept that default
 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.440
of that and we've kept that default
color

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450
color
 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.759
color
so let's move on what's the next step we

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769
so let's move on what's the next step we
 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.290
so let's move on what's the next step we
have an action bar we have you know the

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300
have an action bar we have you know the
 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.060
have an action bar we have you know the
holo theme that gives you a little bit

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070
holo theme that gives you a little bit
 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.590
holo theme that gives you a little bit
you know that improves the the visual

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600
you know that improves the the visual
 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.910
you know that improves the the visual
design a little bit but you know what's

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920
design a little bit but you know what's
 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.070
design a little bit but you know what's
the next step so the next step is to

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080
the next step so the next step is to
 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.170
the next step so the next step is to
customize the action bar and give your

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180
customize the action bar and give your
 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.360
customize the action bar and give your
app a little you know kind of touch of

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370
app a little you know kind of touch of
 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.700
app a little you know kind of touch of
branding so you'll see here that we've

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710
branding so you'll see here that we've
 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.030
branding so you'll see here that we've
chosen a an orange color palette and you

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040
chosen a an orange color palette and you
 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.530
chosen a an orange color palette and you
know again this is really up to you if

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540
know again this is really up to you if
 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.730
know again this is really up to you if
you have an existing service and

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740
you have an existing service and
 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.310
you have an existing service and
existing you know color scheme for your

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320
existing you know color scheme for your
 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.650
existing you know color scheme for your
brand you know introduce it this is the

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660
brand you know introduce it this is the
 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.780
brand you know introduce it this is the
best place I'd say in your app to

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790
best place I'd say in your app to
 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.790
best place I'd say in your app to
introduce branding is the action bar

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800
introduce branding is the action bar
 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.409
introduce branding is the action bar
since its kind of you know a key

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419
since its kind of you know a key
 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.909
since its kind of you know a key
structural element you know at the same

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919
structural element you know at the same
 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.800
structural element you know at the same
time it's a key kind of area to

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810
time it's a key kind of area to
 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.770
time it's a key kind of area to
differentiate and then the little icon

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780
differentiate and then the little icon
 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.659
differentiate and then the little icon
we chose here this is actually not a

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669
we chose here this is actually not a
 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.909
we chose here this is actually not a
standard launcher icon this is a custom

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919
standard launcher icon this is a custom
 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.700
standard launcher icon this is a custom
icon for the action bar and so remember

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710
icon for the action bar and so remember
 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.170
icon for the action bar and so remember
that you don't necessarily have to have

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180
that you don't necessarily have to have
 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.320
that you don't necessarily have to have
your exact pixel for pixel launcher icon

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330
your exact pixel for pixel launcher icon
 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.090
your exact pixel for pixel launcher icon
in the action bar you can customize it

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100
in the action bar you can customize it
 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.280
in the action bar you can customize it
so that it looks good in the in the kind

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290
so that it looks good in the in the kind
 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.530
so that it looks good in the in the kind
of context of the action bar and so the

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540
of context of the action bar and so the
 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.820
of context of the action bar and so the
launcher icon for this app would

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830
launcher icon for this app would
 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.620
launcher icon for this app would
probably be you know like an orange

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630
probably be you know like an orange
 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.020
probably be you know like an orange
circle with a white Y but we decided

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030
circle with a white Y but we decided
 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.730
circle with a white Y but we decided
that this kind of inverted color scheme

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740
that this kind of inverted color scheme
 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.710
that this kind of inverted color scheme
would look good here and you'll also

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720
would look good here and you'll also
 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.030
would look good here and you'll also
notice that we've introduced some of

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040
notice that we've introduced some of
 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.969
notice that we've introduced some of
those same branding elements well I

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979
those same branding elements well I
 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.500
those same branding elements well I
guess some of the same color scheme

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510
guess some of the same color scheme
 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.390
guess some of the same color scheme
elements throughout the content so for

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400
elements throughout the content so for
 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.120
elements throughout the content so for
example the by the way I should I should

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130
example the by the way I should I should
 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.430
example the by the way I should I should
preface that all the content here is is

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440
preface that all the content here is is
 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.680
preface that all the content here is is
meet specific it's a bunch of bacon and

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690
meet specific it's a bunch of bacon and
 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.680
meet specific it's a bunch of bacon and
chicken and steaks this is just kind of

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690
chicken and steaks this is just kind of
 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.360
chicken and steaks this is just kind of
example content so it's pretty Seiken

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370
example content so it's pretty Seiken
 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.860
example content so it's pretty Seiken
friendly color scheme actually you have

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870
friendly color scheme actually you have
 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.830
friendly color scheme actually you have
very very bacon oriented reading

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840
very very bacon oriented reading
 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.219
very very bacon oriented reading
experiences so what is it 7:30 a.m. over

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229
experiences so what is it 7:30 a.m. over
 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.360
experiences so what is it 7:30 a.m. over
there Nick yeah so you know links and

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370
there Nick yeah so you know links and
 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.909
there Nick yeah so you know links and
and other things throughout are accented

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919
and other things throughout are accented
 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.210
and other things throughout are accented
with this orange so that's that's the

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220
with this orange so that's that's the
 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.800
with this orange so that's that's the
next step and then yeah and then I guess

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810
next step and then yeah and then I guess
 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.630
next step and then yeah and then I guess
from a developer standpoint I think

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640
from a developer standpoint I think
 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.730
from a developer standpoint I think
actually Nick you had some blog posts up

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740
actually Nick you had some blog posts up
 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.620
actually Nick you had some blog posts up
on the developer vlog that outlined some

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630
on the developer vlog that outlined some
 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.110
on the developer vlog that outlined some
ways to theme the action bar but there's

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120
ways to theme the action bar but there's
 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.880
ways to theme the action bar but there's
also a great tool called the action bar

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890
also a great tool called the action bar
 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.530
also a great tool called the action bar
style generator if you're just Google

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540
style generator if you're just Google
 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.880
style generator if you're just Google
for it you'll find that which sort of

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890
for it you'll find that which sort of
 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.500
for it you'll find that which sort of
generates all those things for you so

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510
generates all those things for you so
 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.150
generates all those things for you so
you have to worry about all the all the

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160
you have to worry about all the all the
 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.950
you have to worry about all the all the
different types of elements and

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960
different types of elements and
 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.880
different types of elements and
attributes that you need to style

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890
attributes that you need to style
 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.880
attributes that you need to style
thanks very much yes all right moving on

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890
thanks very much yes all right moving on
 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.800
thanks very much yes all right moving on
so the next step and this is one of the

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810
so the next step and this is one of the
 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.780
so the next step and this is one of the
key most important steps this is I think

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790
key most important steps this is I think
 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.120
key most important steps this is I think
one of the key ways in which you know

less polished apps is the margins and
 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.830
less polished apps is the margins and
the spacing the way they treat white

contrast and readability readability is
the concept of not necessarily

spaces is one of the key ways to do that
 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.450
spaces is one of the key ways to do that
so you'll notice that you know from that

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460
so you'll notice that you know from that

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:33.880
48dp rhythm from the design site so
 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.790
48dp rhythm from the design site so
that's really what all of this is based

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800
that's really what all of this is based
 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.820
that's really what all of this is based
off yeah and we'll show some red lines

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:38.830
off yeah and we'll show some red lines
 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.920
off yeah and we'll show some red lines
at the end that show some of the

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.930
at the end that show some of the
 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.530
at the end that show some of the

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:42.540
spacings that we use on tablets as well
 

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.970
spacings that we use on tablets as well
and this is again one of the key ways in

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:44.980
and this is again one of the key ways in
 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.370
and this is again one of the key ways in
which you differentiate phone or handset

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:47.380
which you differentiate phone or handset
 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.010
which you differentiate phone or handset
from tablet to make sure that that again

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.020
from tablet to make sure that that again
 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.990
from tablet to make sure that that again
that readability that that comfort and

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000
that readability that that comfort and
 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.290
that readability that that comfort and
reading is still there so let's move on

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300
reading is still there so let's move on
 

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.070
reading is still there so let's move on
unless Nick yet Ania no greeting room I

00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080
unless Nick yet Ania no greeting room I
 

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.390
unless Nick yet Ania no greeting room I
think it's so much easier to stand now

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400
think it's so much easier to stand now
 

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.690
think it's so much easier to stand now
yeah so the next step the next step is

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:03.700
yeah so the next step the next step is
 

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.090
yeah so the next step the next step is
another important way in which you can

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:06.100
another important way in which you can
 

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.820
another important way in which you can
introduce consistency and a strong

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:08.830
introduce consistency and a strong
 

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.860
introduce consistency and a strong
rhythm in your app is the way you treat

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:10.870
rhythm in your app is the way you treat
 

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.870
rhythm in your app is the way you treat
photo thumbnails so you'll notice that

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:12.880
photo thumbnails so you'll notice that
 

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.300
photo thumbnails so you'll notice that
in the previous version these photos

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:15.310
in the previous version these photos
 

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.910
in the previous version these photos
were kind of you know all jaggedy or

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:17.920
were kind of you know all jaggedy or
 

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.370
were kind of you know all jaggedy or
lopsided they didn't have a strong

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:20.380
lopsided they didn't have a strong
 

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.050
lopsided they didn't have a strong
rhythm because they had different aspect

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:22.060
rhythm because they had different aspect
 

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.480
rhythm because they had different aspect
ratios so one of the ways in which you

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:24.490
ratios so one of the ways in which you
 

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.660
ratios so one of the ways in which you
can you know I guess alleviate this is

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:27.670
can you know I guess alleviate this is
 

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.020
can you know I guess alleviate this is
to introduce a different type of scaling

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.030
to introduce a different type of scaling
 

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.910
to introduce a different type of scaling
and Adam could talk about that but

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:32.920
and Adam could talk about that but
 

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.320
and Adam could talk about that but
basically you'll notice here that all

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:34.330
basically you'll notice here that all
 

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.540
basically you'll notice here that all
the photos line up their full bleed edge

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:36.550
the photos line up their full bleed edge
 

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.829
the photos line up their full bleed edge
to

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839
to
 

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:39.839
to
and they introduced kind of a strong

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:39.849
and they introduced kind of a strong
 

00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:43.680
and they introduced kind of a strong
single line single line in your design

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:43.690
single line single line in your design
 

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.570
single line single line in your design
so it's very easy for the eye to

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:45.580
so it's very easy for the eye to
 

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.000
so it's very easy for the eye to
separate the text from the image and

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.010
separate the text from the image and
 

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.250
separate the text from the image and
from four to separate the images from

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:50.260
from four to separate the images from
 

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.420
from four to separate the images from
each other since there's kind of that

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:51.430
each other since there's kind of that
 

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.820
each other since there's kind of that
light separator there yeah and then from

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:53.830
light separator there yeah and then from
 

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.650
light separator there yeah and then from
the developer side there's an attribute

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:55.660
the developer side there's an attribute
 

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.360
the developer side there's an attribute
scale type which you can set to sent a

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:57.370
scale type which you can set to sent a
 

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.829
scale type which you can set to sent a
crop where the framework will actually

00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:58.839
crop where the framework will actually
 

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.380
crop where the framework will actually
do this for you of course you know if

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:01.390
do this for you of course you know if
 

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.940
do this for you of course you know if
you're if you if you're pulling that

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:02.950
you're if you if you're pulling that
 

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.620
you're if you if you're pulling that
image from from a server side or

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:04.630
image from from a server side or
 

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:05.940
image from from a server side or
something like that you could have the

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:05.950
something like that you could have the
 

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.350
something like that you could have the
images come down at the right size

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360
images come down at the right size
 

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.210
images come down at the right size
already but in many cases that's not

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:09.220
already but in many cases that's not
 

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.530
already but in many cases that's not
possible so this is actually a really

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:10.540
possible so this is actually a really
 

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.090
possible so this is actually a really
good way to make sure that they're all

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.100
good way to make sure that they're all
 

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.360
good way to make sure that they're all
lined up and of the same size I really

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:15.370
lined up and of the same size I really
 

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.950
lined up and of the same size I really
like this it just it really brings the

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:16.960
like this it just it really brings the
 

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.960
like this it just it really brings the
images out a little bit more and as you

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:18.970
images out a little bit more and as you
 

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.370
images out a little bit more and as you
say the lines really make a huge

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:20.380
say the lines really make a huge
 

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.600
say the lines really make a huge
difference there on the left before

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:24.610
difference there on the left before
 

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.860
difference there on the left before
version where you have been kind of

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:25.870
version where you have been kind of
 

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.260
version where you have been kind of
uneven readiness I suppose like a jagged

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:28.270
uneven readiness I suppose like a jagged
 

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.550
uneven readiness I suppose like a jagged
tooth pattern it looks like you kind of

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560
tooth pattern it looks like you kind of
 

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.840
tooth pattern it looks like you kind of
have these goofy teeth it just isn't

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:30.850
have these goofy teeth it just isn't
 

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.920
have these goofy teeth it just isn't
right gonna scan yeah what you want to

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:34.930
right gonna scan yeah what you want to
 

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.269
right gonna scan yeah what you want to
avoid is you know if you look at your

00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:36.279
avoid is you know if you look at your
 

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:38.820
avoid is you know if you look at your
design or your UI from you know like a

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:38.830
design or your UI from you know like a
 

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.070
design or your UI from you know like a
few feet away you don't want to see like

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:41.080
few feet away you don't want to see like
 

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.780
few feet away you don't want to see like
a New York City skyline right you want

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:42.790
a New York City skyline right you want
 

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.030
a New York City skyline right you want
to see consistent grids you want to see

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040
to see consistent grids you want to see
 

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.250
to see consistent grids you want to see
rectangular grids and in some cases you

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:47.260
rectangular grids and in some cases you
 

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.810
rectangular grids and in some cases you
know for really complex interesting you

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:48.820
know for really complex interesting you
 

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.310
know for really complex interesting you
eyes you you probably want to you know

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320
eyes you you probably want to you know
 

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.900
eyes you you probably want to you know
go just a little deeper than that you

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:51.910
go just a little deeper than that you
 

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.949
go just a little deeper than that you
want to do some more interesting things

00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959
want to do some more interesting things
 

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:55.170
want to do some more interesting things
but at the very most basic level if

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:55.180
but at the very most basic level if
 

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.460
but at the very most basic level if
you're simply presenting you know

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:56.470
you're simply presenting you know
 

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.470
you're simply presenting you know
collection of information you want to

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480
collection of information you want to
 

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.960
collection of information you want to
you know make make sure that you're

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:00.970
you know make make sure that you're
 

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.600
you know make make sure that you're
establishing a grid now and establishing

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:03.610
establishing a grid now and establishing
 

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.280
establishing a grid now and establishing
you know single line so that it's very

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:05.290
you know single line so that it's very
 

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.199
you know single line so that it's very
easy for the eye to kind of follow the

00:10:07.199 --> 00:10:07.209
easy for the eye to kind of follow the
 

00:10:07.209 --> 00:10:10.800
easy for the eye to kind of follow the
flow of information okay moving on I

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:10.810
flow of information okay moving on I
 

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.480
flow of information okay moving on I
think the next step is one of the

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:12.490
think the next step is one of the
 

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.980
think the next step is one of the
biggest and this is something that we

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:13.990
biggest and this is something that we
 

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.930
biggest and this is something that we
haven't we've touched on I guess a

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:15.940
haven't we've touched on I guess a
 

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.510
haven't we've touched on I guess a
million times in the show but typography

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:18.520
million times in the show but typography
 

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.040
million times in the show but typography
I think you know what you'll see is the

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.050
I think you know what you'll see is the
 

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.079
I think you know what you'll see is the
difference that just a few attributes

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:22.089
difference that just a few attributes
 

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:25.829
difference that just a few attributes
can make in the in the I guess the

00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839
can make in the in the I guess the
 

00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:28.680
can make in the in the I guess the
overall just visual aesthetic but also

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:28.690
overall just visual aesthetic but also
 

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.660
overall just visual aesthetic but also
just the ease and consuming information

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:30.670
just the ease and consuming information
 

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.970
just the ease and consuming information
so let's go to the next section on

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:32.980
so let's go to the next section on
 

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.820
so let's go to the next section on
typography so you'll notice that here

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:35.830
typography so you'll notice that here
 

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.280
typography so you'll notice that here
and this is this is more like micro

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:38.290
and this is this is more like micro
 

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.230
and this is this is more like micro
typography where we've looked at the

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240
typography where we've looked at the
 

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.060
typography where we've looked at the
treatment of text at the individual

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.070
treatment of text at the individual
 

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.030
treatment of text at the individual
character level I guess it's a

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040
character level I guess it's a
 

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.680
character level I guess it's a
combination of macro and micro macro

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:46.690
combination of macro and micro macro
 

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:47.319
combination of macro and micro macro
being

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:47.329
being
 

00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:49.150
being
you know the typography that's that's

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.160
you know the typography that's that's
 

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.609
you know the typography that's that's
kind of creating the the general figures

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:51.619
kind of creating the the general figures
 

00:10:51.619 --> 00:10:54.160
kind of creating the the general figures
of text the general blocks of text in

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:54.170
of text the general blocks of text in
 

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.289
of text the general blocks of text in
this case we've looked at the micro

00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:56.299
this case we've looked at the micro
 

00:10:56.299 --> 00:10:59.109
this case we've looked at the micro
aspect of that so if we look in here to

00:10:59.109 --> 00:10:59.119
aspect of that so if we look in here to
 

00:10:59.119 --> 00:11:01.569
aspect of that so if we look in here to
the detail or to the list screen you'll

00:11:01.569 --> 00:11:01.579
the detail or to the list screen you'll
 

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:04.600
the detail or to the list screen you'll
notice that each of the articles the in

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:04.610
notice that each of the articles the in
 

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.280
notice that each of the articles the in
each of the articles the title stands

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.290
each of the articles the title stands
 

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.090
each of the articles the title stands
out a little more

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:07.100
out a little more
 

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.720
out a little more
it's a Roboto bold condensed and the

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:10.730
it's a Roboto bold condensed and the
 

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.939
it's a Roboto bold condensed and the
subtitle the 18 minutes ago by the

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:12.949
subtitle the 18 minutes ago by the
 

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:16.660
subtitle the 18 minutes ago by the
author that was kind of made more muted

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:16.670
author that was kind of made more muted
 

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.009
author that was kind of made more muted
since that's kind of less important

00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:18.019
since that's kind of less important
 

00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:20.889
since that's kind of less important
information once your eye settles on a

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:20.899
information once your eye settles on a
 

00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:23.410
information once your eye settles on a
title that you want to read about maybe

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:23.420
title that you want to read about maybe
 

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.939
title that you want to read about maybe
at that point you then want to read

00:11:24.939 --> 00:11:24.949
at that point you then want to read
 

00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:26.229
at that point you then want to read
about the subtitle or you want to find

00:11:26.229 --> 00:11:26.239
about the subtitle or you want to find
 

00:11:26.239 --> 00:11:28.150
about the subtitle or you want to find
that who wrote that and so once your eye

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160
that who wrote that and so once your eye
 

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.949
that who wrote that and so once your eye
settles on the title then you can kind

00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959
settles on the title then you can kind
 

00:11:29.959 --> 00:11:32.019
settles on the title then you can kind
of make the small visual step to look at

00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:32.029
of make the small visual step to look at
 

00:11:32.029 --> 00:11:33.309
of make the small visual step to look at
who wrote it and when it was published

00:11:33.309 --> 00:11:33.319
who wrote it and when it was published
 

00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:35.410
who wrote it and when it was published
but this kind of really cleanly

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:35.420
but this kind of really cleanly
 

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.609
but this kind of really cleanly
separates each individual title from the

00:11:39.609 --> 00:11:39.619
separates each individual title from the
 

00:11:39.619 --> 00:11:42.639
separates each individual title from the
subtitle as well and then on on the

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:42.649
subtitle as well and then on on the
 

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:45.069
subtitle as well and then on on the
detail screen here we've done we've used

00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:45.079
detail screen here we've done we've used
 

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:46.749
detail screen here we've done we've used
a similar treatment for the title here

00:11:46.749 --> 00:11:46.759
a similar treatment for the title here
 

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:49.439
a similar treatment for the title here
we've again used Roboto bold condensed

00:11:49.439 --> 00:11:49.449
we've again used Roboto bold condensed
 

00:11:49.449 --> 00:11:53.710
we've again used Roboto bold condensed
condensed bold but then for the text

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720
condensed bold but then for the text
 

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.859
condensed bold but then for the text
itself we've actually used a custom font

00:11:56.859 --> 00:11:56.869
itself we've actually used a custom font
 

00:11:56.869 --> 00:11:59.889
itself we've actually used a custom font
it's called rosario but this is is

00:11:59.889 --> 00:11:59.899
it's called rosario but this is is
 

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:01.269
it's called rosario but this is is
generally you know not necessary to use

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279
generally you know not necessary to use
 

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.619
generally you know not necessary to use
a custom font you can use one of the

00:12:02.619 --> 00:12:02.629
a custom font you can use one of the
 

00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:05.049
a custom font you can use one of the
Roboto variants for body text but we

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:05.059
Roboto variants for body text but we
 

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:07.090
Roboto variants for body text but we
found that in this case it may be

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:07.100
found that in this case it may be
 

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.039
found that in this case it may be
possible to kind of introduce this this

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:09.049
possible to kind of introduce this this
 

00:12:09.049 --> 00:12:11.919
possible to kind of introduce this this
custom font in in a light way not using

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:11.929
custom font in in a light way not using
 

00:12:11.929 --> 00:12:14.559
custom font in in a light way not using
it overly throughout the UI not making

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:14.569
it overly throughout the UI not making
 

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:16.869
it overly throughout the UI not making
every single UI element this custom font

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:16.879
every single UI element this custom font
 

00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:18.699
every single UI element this custom font
but in this case it may improve

00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:18.709
but in this case it may improve
 

00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:22.389
but in this case it may improve
legibility so any any thoughts on

00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399
legibility so any any thoughts on
 

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:27.239
legibility so any any thoughts on
typography guys spacing as well oh oh

00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:27.249
typography guys spacing as well oh oh
 

00:12:27.249 --> 00:12:31.210
typography guys spacing as well oh oh
sure so another important aspect that

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:31.220
sure so another important aspect that
 

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.619
sure so another important aspect that
you should look at when when changing

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:32.629
you should look at when when changing
 

00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:35.319
you should look at when when changing
fonts especially is the line spacing

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:35.329
fonts especially is the line spacing
 

00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:38.559
fonts especially is the line spacing
this is kind of in typography terms it's

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:38.569
this is kind of in typography terms it's
 

00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:41.199
this is kind of in typography terms it's
the letting is basically the space

00:12:41.199 --> 00:12:41.209
the letting is basically the space
 

00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:43.809
the letting is basically the space
between each line and this effects again

00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:43.819
between each line and this effects again
 

00:12:43.819 --> 00:12:46.119
between each line and this effects again
that readability aspect how easy is it

00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:46.129
that readability aspect how easy is it
 

00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:48.759
that readability aspect how easy is it
for the eye to move from one line to the

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:48.769
for the eye to move from one line to the
 

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:50.710
for the eye to move from one line to the
next as you get to the end of one line

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720
next as you get to the end of one line
 

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.389
next as you get to the end of one line
jumping over to the next one and

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399
jumping over to the next one and
 

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:54.609
jumping over to the next one and
starting that so all these things the

00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:54.619
starting that so all these things the
 

00:12:54.619 --> 00:12:56.799
starting that so all these things the
the spacing around the text the line

00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:56.809
the spacing around the text the line
 

00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:58.629
the spacing around the text the line
spacing between each line that's all

00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639
spacing between each line that's all
 

00:12:58.639 --> 00:12:59.990
spacing between each line that's all
very important too

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000
very important too
 

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.790
very important too
the readability and so here we've used I

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800
the readability and so here we've used I
 

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.879
the readability and so here we've used I
think a multiplier of 1.2 but generally

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:04.889
think a multiplier of 1.2 but generally
 

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:05.960
think a multiplier of 1.2 but generally
if you feel that your text is a little

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:05.970
if you feel that your text is a little
 

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:06.769
if you feel that your text is a little
too cramped

00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779
too cramped
 

00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:10.009
too cramped
don't don't underestimate the power of

00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019
don't don't underestimate the power of
 

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:12.139
don't don't underestimate the power of
introducing like a 1.1 or 1.2 line

00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:12.149
introducing like a 1.1 or 1.2 line
 

00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:15.259
introducing like a 1.1 or 1.2 line
spacing yeah and and from the

00:13:15.259 --> 00:13:15.269
spacing yeah and and from the
 

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:16.819
spacing yeah and and from the
development side there's two attributes

00:13:16.819 --> 00:13:16.829
development side there's two attributes
 

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.019
development side there's two attributes
generally you want to look at here it's

00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:18.029
generally you want to look at here it's
 

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:19.970
generally you want to look at here it's
Android font family and Android line

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:19.980
Android font family and Android line
 

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.610
Android font family and Android line
spacing multiplier so those sort of

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.620
spacing multiplier so those sort of
 

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.710
spacing multiplier so those sort of
together allow you to achieve an effect

together allow you to achieve an effect
 

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.069
together allow you to achieve an effect
like this and I should mention that for

00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079
like this and I should mention that for
 

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:30.050
like this and I should mention that for
the four custom fonts and again use them

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060
the four custom fonts and again use them
 

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.809
the four custom fonts and again use them
very sparingly in in key areas where it

00:13:32.809 --> 00:13:32.819
very sparingly in in key areas where it
 

00:13:32.819 --> 00:13:34.759
very sparingly in in key areas where it
may improve the experience for for

00:13:34.759 --> 00:13:34.769
may improve the experience for for
 

00:13:34.769 --> 00:13:38.449
may improve the experience for for
reading large blocks of text in in for

00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:38.459
reading large blocks of text in in for
 

00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:39.949
reading large blocks of text in in for
custom typefaces you may want to look at

00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959
custom typefaces you may want to look at
 

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:42.619
custom typefaces you may want to look at
Google web fonts Rosario for example is

00:13:42.619 --> 00:13:42.629
Google web fonts Rosario for example is
 

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:43.939
Google web fonts Rosario for example is
oil is available from Google web fonts

00:13:43.939 --> 00:13:43.949
oil is available from Google web fonts
 

00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:46.160
oil is available from Google web fonts
and it hints really really well on

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.170
and it hints really really well on
 

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.559
and it hints really really well on
mobile so that's another key important

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:48.569
mobile so that's another key important
 

00:13:48.569 --> 00:13:50.420
mobile so that's another key important
thing is you make sure to not just pick

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:50.430
thing is you make sure to not just pick
 

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.590
thing is you make sure to not just pick
a font based on what it looks like on

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600
a font based on what it looks like on
 

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.389
a font based on what it looks like on
the web you would actually try it out on

00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399
the web you would actually try it out on
 

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.679
the web you would actually try it out on
a few devices and make sure that it

00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:54.689
a few devices and make sure that it
 

00:13:54.689 --> 00:13:57.079
a few devices and make sure that it
looks really crisp because some fonts

00:13:57.079 --> 00:13:57.089
looks really crisp because some fonts
 

00:13:57.089 --> 00:13:59.860
looks really crisp because some fonts
some TTF files don't actually have

00:13:59.860 --> 00:13:59.870
some TTF files don't actually have
 

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.170
some TTF files don't actually have
really good hinting instructions and so

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180
really good hinting instructions and so
 

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.980
really good hinting instructions and so
when they're taken down to smaller sizes

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:05.990
when they're taken down to smaller sizes
 

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.240
when they're taken down to smaller sizes
they're not going to look very good

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:08.250
they're not going to look very good
 

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.100
they're not going to look very good
they're just going to have be off and

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:10.110
they're just going to have be off and
 

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.259
they're just going to have be off and
not very well aligned so that's

00:14:12.259 --> 00:14:12.269
not very well aligned so that's
 

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:13.340
not very well aligned so that's
something that it's definitely important

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:13.350
something that it's definitely important
 

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.139
something that it's definitely important
to try and not just on on the web but on

00:14:15.139 --> 00:14:15.149
to try and not just on on the web but on
 

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:19.879
to try and not just on on the web but on
mobile as well shall we move on let's

00:14:19.879 --> 00:14:19.889
mobile as well shall we move on let's
 

00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:21.650
mobile as well shall we move on let's
just want to say I think the use of

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660
just want to say I think the use of
 

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.360
just want to say I think the use of
different font weights is very good way

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:23.370
different font weights is very good way
 

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.679
different font weights is very good way

just stands out the structure of the

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:39.689
just stands out the structure of the

content and what you want to read first
 

00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:42.679
content and what you want to read first
and it's so much easier to scan the page

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:42.689
and it's so much easier to scan the page
 

00:14:42.689 --> 00:14:46.100
and it's so much easier to scan the page
now yeah this console the visual

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:46.110
now yeah this console the visual
 

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.809
now yeah this console the visual
hierarchy is very important you want to

00:14:47.809 --> 00:14:47.819
hierarchy is very important you want to
 

00:14:47.819 --> 00:14:50.509
hierarchy is very important you want to
make sure to highlight to establish a

00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519
make sure to highlight to establish a
 

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:52.610
make sure to highlight to establish a
visual hierarchy in terms of what is the

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620
visual hierarchy in terms of what is the
 

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.470
visual hierarchy in terms of what is the
top level item and then what are its sub

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480
top level item and then what are its sub
 

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.240
top level item and then what are its sub
items in this case you know the top

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:56.250
items in this case you know the top
 

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.040
items in this case you know the top
level item is the title right the title

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.050
level item is the title right the title
 

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.470
level item is the title right the title
of the article is basically you know the

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480
of the article is basically you know the
 

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.629
of the article is basically you know the
the name that you would put in the tree

00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639
the name that you would put in the tree
 

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.820
the name that you would put in the tree
for the article

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:04.830
for the article
 

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.090
for the article
that would be its title so the subtitle

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.100
that would be its title so the subtitle
 

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.130
that would be its title so the subtitle
as well as as but as its body content is

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:10.140
as well as as but as its body content is
 

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.740
as well as as but as its body content is
kind of a child of that so that should

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:12.750
kind of a child of that so that should
 

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.930
kind of a child of that so that should
kind of be lower individual hierarchy so

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940
kind of be lower individual hierarchy so
 

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.550
kind of be lower individual hierarchy so
it should stand that a little less again

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560
it should stand that a little less again
 

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.620
it should stand that a little less again
once your eye hits the title then it

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:18.630
once your eye hits the title then it
 

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.630
once your eye hits the title then it
could move on to to the sub items in

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:20.640
could move on to to the sub items in
 

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.600
could move on to to the sub items in
that tree you know go ahead and read

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:23.610
that tree you know go ahead and read
 

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:29.980
that tree you know go ahead and read
details about that alright moving on so

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:29.990
details about that alright moving on so
 

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.880
details about that alright moving on so
alternatively we actually created an

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:31.890
alternatively we actually created an
 

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.230
alternatively we actually created an
alternative presentation this is

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240
alternative presentation this is
 

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.030
alternative presentation this is
something that that doesn't work in

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040
something that that doesn't work in
 

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.200
something that that doesn't work in
every case and I think in this case

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.210
every case and I think in this case
 

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.990
every case and I think in this case
actually doesn't work super well but

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000
actually doesn't work super well but
 

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.310
actually doesn't work super well but
alternatively you could combine photos

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320
alternatively you could combine photos
 

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.350
alternatively you could combine photos
and in text and this is something that a

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360
and in text and this is something that a
 

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.440
and in text and this is something that a
couple of popular apps do now but what

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:45.450
couple of popular apps do now but what
 

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.360
couple of popular apps do now but what
you could do is combine photos and text

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:47.370
you could do is combine photos and text
 

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.910
you could do is combine photos and text
just make sure that again your your text

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920
just make sure that again your your text
 

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.040
just make sure that again your your text
lines up so here you'll notice that the

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.050
lines up so here you'll notice that the
 

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.650
lines up so here you'll notice that the
text still lines up with where the title

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:54.660
text still lines up with where the title
 

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.720
text still lines up with where the title
still lines up with the subtitle and it

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:56.730
still lines up with the subtitle and it
 

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.970
still lines up with the subtitle and it
lines up with the body as well so that's

00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:58.980
lines up with the body as well so that's
 

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.230
lines up with the body as well so that's
that's again very important to establish

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240
that's again very important to establish
 

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.670
that's again very important to establish
those clear lines for alignment so if

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680
those clear lines for alignment so if
 

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.170
those clear lines for alignment so if
you use a visual treatment behind a text

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180
you use a visual treatment behind a text
 

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.790
you use a visual treatment behind a text
to give it some contrast because you

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800
to give it some contrast because you
 

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.450
to give it some contrast because you
kind of right yeah so there's um there's

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:11.460
kind of right yeah so there's um there's
 

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.920
kind of right yeah so there's um there's
a little bit here in the sense of like

a little bit here in the sense of like
 

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.840
a little bit here in the sense of like

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:48.140
because of that background protection
 

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.840
because of that background protection
okay so since we're running low on well

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:50.850
okay so since we're running low on well
 

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.520
okay so since we're running low on well
I guess sort of low on time let's kind

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:52.530
I guess sort of low on time let's kind
 

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.560
I guess sort of low on time let's kind
of start flying through some of these so

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:54.570
of start flying through some of these so
 

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.710
of start flying through some of these so
we also added a viewpager to make sure

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720
we also added a viewpager to make sure
 

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.510
we also added a viewpager to make sure
that you can swipe between the detail

00:16:59.510 --> 00:16:59.520
that you can swipe between the detail
 

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.400
that you can swipe between the detail
screens this is fairly straightforward

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:01.410
screens this is fairly straightforward
 

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.050
screens this is fairly straightforward
using the view pager from the support

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.060
using the view pager from the support
 

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.660
using the view pager from the support
library it's white keys well documented

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:05.670
library it's white keys well documented
 

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.840
library it's white keys well documented
on the design side mm-hmm

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:07.850
on the design side mm-hmm
 

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.210
on the design side mm-hmm
and you should where possible introduce

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:10.220
and you should where possible introduce
 

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.590
and you should where possible introduce
this into your detailed view so you can

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600
this into your detailed view so you can
 

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.220
this into your detailed view so you can
very quickly sweat between items so

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:15.230
very quickly sweat between items so
 

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.910
very quickly sweat between items so
let's jump into tablet this is let's

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:18.920
let's jump into tablet this is let's
 

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.950
let's jump into tablet this is let's
let's look at like a flashback to our

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:20.960
let's look at like a flashback to our
 

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.260
let's look at like a flashback to our
step 0 if we were to run that step 0

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:23.270
step 0 if we were to run that step 0
 

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.330
step 0 if we were to run that step 0
like starting point on a tablet this is

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:25.340
like starting point on a tablet this is
 

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.590
like starting point on a tablet this is
what it would look like so you'd have

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600
what it would look like so you'd have
 

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.600
what it would look like so you'd have
two separate screens that that just

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:28.610
two separate screens that that just
 

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.430
two separate screens that that just
makes horrible use of space you have all

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:30.440
makes horrible use of space you have all
 

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.010
makes horrible use of space you have all
these large regions of white space here

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:33.020
these large regions of white space here
 

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.860
these large regions of white space here
at the bottom you also have very large

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:35.870
at the bottom you also have very large
 

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.470
at the bottom you also have very large
line lengths we'll talk about that which

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480
line lengths we'll talk about that which
 

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.110
line lengths we'll talk about that which
makes reading really a pain so as you're

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120
makes reading really a pain so as you're
 

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.630
makes reading really a pain so as you're
reading like the first line here here

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640
reading like the first line here here
 

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.760
reading like the first line here here
here here here then it's time to go on

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:45.770
here here here then it's time to go on
 

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.990
here here here then it's time to go on
to the next line your eyes trying to

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000
to the next line your eyes trying to
 

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.460
to the next line your eyes trying to
move to the next line but it's very hard

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:48.470
move to the next line but it's very hard
 

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.990
move to the next line but it's very hard
for it to find the next line because

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000
for it to find the next line because
 

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.450
for it to find the next line because
it's just not like this this text that's

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:52.460
it's just not like this this text that's
 

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.910
it's just not like this this text that's
too long of a measure so we'll we'll

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:54.920
too long of a measure so we'll we'll
 

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.560
too long of a measure so we'll we'll
talk about that how to improve them and

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:56.570
talk about that how to improve them and
 

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.110
talk about that how to improve them and
of course the image is a tiny right in

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120
of course the image is a tiny right in
 

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.630
of course the image is a tiny right in
this particular view so you know in a

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640
this particular view so you know in a
 

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.980
this particular view so you know in a
tablet that's not making very good use

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:02.990
tablet that's not making very good use
 

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.550
tablet that's not making very good use
of the space

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:03.560
of the space
 

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.260
of the space
yeah pretty terrible overall if this is

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:05.270
yeah pretty terrible overall if this is
 

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.030
yeah pretty terrible overall if this is
your tablet experience this is pretty

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:07.040
your tablet experience this is pretty
 

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:13.090
your tablet experience this is pretty
bad if you fix it so let's say we were

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:13.100
bad if you fix it so let's say we were
 

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.940
bad if you fix it so let's say we were
to you know fast forward and just use

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:15.950
to you know fast forward and just use
 

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.070
to you know fast forward and just use
you know use all those tricks of spacing

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080
you know use all those tricks of spacing
 

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.420
you know use all those tricks of spacing
and everything and see what that would

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:19.430
and everything and see what that would
 

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.770
and everything and see what that would
look like in the tablet you know it's

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:20.780
look like in the tablet you know it's
 

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.840
look like in the tablet you know it's
much better it's still not great right

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:22.850
much better it's still not great right
 

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.280
much better it's still not great right
because you still have those long lines

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:24.290
because you still have those long lines
 

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.010
because you still have those long lines
you still have that image that we're now

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.020
you still have that image that we're now
 

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.380
you still have that image that we're now
the aspect ratio is completely different

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:29.390
the aspect ratio is completely different
 

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.720
the aspect ratio is completely different
from the source material so you only see

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:31.730
from the source material so you only see
 

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.030
from the source material so you only see
the very middle strip of the image which

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:34.040
the very middle strip of the image which
 

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.350
the very middle strip of the image which
is fine it doesn't look too bad in this

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360
is fine it doesn't look too bad in this
 

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.420
is fine it doesn't look too bad in this
case yeah that's still a strictly bacon

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:37.430
case yeah that's still a strictly bacon
 

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.380
case yeah that's still a strictly bacon
you can't go wrong with that we could do

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:41.390
you can't go wrong with that we could do
 

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.760
you can't go wrong with that we could do
better than this right so the next step

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:42.770
better than this right so the next step
 

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.520
better than this right so the next step
is to create a two-pane UI so in this

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:45.530
is to create a two-pane UI so in this
 

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.440
is to create a two-pane UI so in this
case what we've done here is we've

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:47.450
case what we've done here is we've
 

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.590
case what we've done here is we've
simply combined the master and detail

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600
simply combined the master and detail
 

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.110
simply combined the master and detail
into a single two-pane UI and this is

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120
into a single two-pane UI and this is
 

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.310
into a single two-pane UI and this is
you know fairly straightforward we have

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320
you know fairly straightforward we have
 

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.100
you know fairly straightforward we have
a you can actually do file new in

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.110
a you can actually do file new in
 

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.690
a you can actually do file new in
eclipse you can do file new master

00:18:58.690 --> 00:18:58.700
eclipse you can do file new master
 

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.280
eclipse you can do file new master
detail flow to get you the basics for

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:00.290
detail flow to get you the basics for
 

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:03.700
detail flow to get you the basics for
this but there's also some articles you

this but there's also some articles you
 

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.650
this but there's also some articles you
could read yeah developer.android.com

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:05.660
could read yeah developer.android.com

fairly straightforward to do it these
 

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.360
fairly straightforward to do it these
days there's a lot of pre-written code

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:13.370
days there's a lot of pre-written code
 

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.850
days there's a lot of pre-written code
for you it's it is a fairly complex code

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:15.860
for you it's it is a fairly complex code
 

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.030
for you it's it is a fairly complex code
if you

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:17.040
if you
 

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.620

the beginner but it's kind of like file

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:18.630
the beginner but it's kind of like file
 

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.450

new and you're done and you can read

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460
new and you're done and you can read
 

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.650
new and you're done and you can read
about the details you in this training

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660
about the details you in this training
 

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.970
about the details you in this training
articles so moving on how would we then

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980
articles so moving on how would we then
 

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.570
articles so moving on how would we then
improve this so what we can do is now

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580
improve this so what we can do is now
 

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.390
improve this so what we can do is now
start tweaking the again the margins and

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400
start tweaking the again the margins and
 

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.510
start tweaking the again the margins and
the spacing the different dimensions on

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520
the spacing the different dimensions on
 

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.700
the spacing the different dimensions on
tablets so that you know when you when

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:37.710
tablets so that you know when you when
 

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.710
tablets so that you know when you when
you open up the same detail view on a

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720
you open up the same detail view on a
 

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.900
you open up the same detail view on a
tablet you'll actually get you know

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:41.910
tablet you'll actually get you know
 

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.840
tablet you'll actually get you know
larger text for example you get more

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:44.850
larger text for example you get more
 

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.820
larger text for example you get more
spacing around the sides to again better

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:46.830
spacing around the sides to again better
 

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.800
spacing around the sides to again better
separate the figure from the ground

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:48.810
separate the figure from the ground
 

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.510
separate the figure from the ground
better separate the text from its

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520
better separate the text from its
 

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.510
better separate the text from its
background you can bump up font sizes

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520
background you can bump up font sizes
 

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.970
background you can bump up font sizes
you can bump bump up line spacing again

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980
you can bump bump up line spacing again
 

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.160
you can bump bump up line spacing again
lots of things you can do here to make

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:58.170
lots of things you can do here to make
 

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.530
lots of things you can do here to make
it better and it's really easy from the

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:00.540
it better and it's really easy from the
 

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.460
it better and it's really easy from the
development side as well

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:01.470
development side as well
 

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.250
development side as well
yeah I mean hopefully when we're talking

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260
yeah I mean hopefully when we're talking
 

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.380
yeah I mean hopefully when we're talking
about the phone side you extracted all

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:06.390
about the phone side you extracted all
 

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.690
about the phone side you extracted all
of the different dimensions padding

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700
of the different dimensions padding
 

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.210
of the different dimensions padding
spacing into a separate XML file and

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220
spacing into a separate XML file and
 

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.820
spacing into a separate XML file and
then you can choose sort of when you

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:13.830
then you can choose sort of when you
 

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.290
then you can choose sort of when you
want to bump those up again at which

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:15.300
want to bump those up again at which
 

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.090
want to bump those up again at which
which screen size will bump them up so

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100
which screen size will bump them up so
 

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.790
which screen size will bump them up so
in this example then the bump here to

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:18.800
in this example then the bump here to
 

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.730
in this example then the bump here to
small Swit 600 DP and at 720p for seven

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740
small Swit 600 DP and at 720p for seven
 

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.310
small Swit 600 DP and at 720p for seven
and 10-inch tablets respectively but of

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320
and 10-inch tablets respectively but of
 

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.600
and 10-inch tablets respectively but of
course it's up to you when you want to

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:26.610
course it's up to you when you want to
 

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.100
course it's up to you when you want to
tweak those sizes this is just sort of

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.110
tweak those sizes this is just sort of
 

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.330
tweak those sizes this is just sort of
the standard what we would recommend

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.340
the standard what we would recommend
 

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.080
the standard what we would recommend
yeah but for looking at different sizes

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.090
yeah but for looking at different sizes
 

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.100
yeah but for looking at different sizes
and you can provide multiple switch

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:34.110
and you can provide multiple switch
 

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.480
and you can provide multiple switch
points right so you can have a different

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:35.490
points right so you can have a different
 

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:40.310
points right so you can have a different
metrics on a you know five inch 17 yeah

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320
metrics on a you know five inch 17 yeah
 

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.900
metrics on a you know five inch 17 yeah
for sure and actually one one that we

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:41.910
for sure and actually one one that we
 

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.450
for sure and actually one one that we
don't often talk about is small devices

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460
don't often talk about is small devices
 

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.950
don't often talk about is small devices
so devices that have really small

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960
so devices that have really small
 

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.660
so devices that have really small
screens you may want to you know tweak

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:47.670
screens you may want to you know tweak
 

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.340
screens you may want to you know tweak
things even further there maybe even

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:49.350
things even further there maybe even
 

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.800
things even further there maybe even
start compressing information into like

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:51.810
start compressing information into like
 

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.650
start compressing information into like
separate navigable sections if your if

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660
separate navigable sections if your if
 

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.080
separate navigable sections if your if
your user base is on small devices then

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.090
your user base is on small devices then
 

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.010
your user base is on small devices then
again that's something that you want to

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.020
again that's something that you want to
 

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.020
again that's something that you want to
do using something like SW 300 or 200 DP

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.030
do using something like SW 300 or 200 DP
 

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:07.610
do using something like SW 300 or 200 DP
or values - small for example all right

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620
or values - small for example all right
 

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.930
or values - small for example all right
so let's let's actually look at some of

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940
so let's let's actually look at some of
 

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.600
so let's let's actually look at some of
the metrics here take a quick sidebar so

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:11.610
the metrics here take a quick sidebar so
 

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.460
the metrics here take a quick sidebar so
you'll notice that and again this still

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:13.470
you'll notice that and again this still
 

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.470
you'll notice that and again this still
uses the 48dp rhythm in the sense that

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480
uses the 48dp rhythm in the sense that
 

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.450
uses the 48dp rhythm in the sense that
you know things are generally multiples

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460
you know things are generally multiples
 

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.440
you know things are generally multiples
of 48 or 16 and for smaller sizes we use

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:21.450
of 48 or 16 and for smaller sizes we use
 

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.850
of 48 or 16 and for smaller sizes we use
a 32 16 24

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:23.860
a 32 16 24
 

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.190
a 32 16 24
eight things like that powers of powers

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.200
eight things like that powers of powers
 

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.190
eight things like that powers of powers
of two and things divisible by four

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200
of two and things divisible by four
 

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.740
of two and things divisible by four
roughly so here's your some of the quick

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:31.750
roughly so here's your some of the quick
 

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.160
roughly so here's your some of the quick
examples you know generous margins

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.170
examples you know generous margins
 

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.799
examples you know generous margins
around the content here I mean a TDP if

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:37.809
around the content here I mean a TDP if
 

00:21:37.809 --> 00:21:39.330
around the content here I mean a TDP if
you're not using something as large as

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:39.340
you're not using something as large as
 

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.730
you're not using something as large as
like 80 or 64 DP for margins and a

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:41.740
like 80 or 64 DP for margins and a
 

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.919
like 80 or 64 DP for margins and a
tablet then you probably should be since

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:43.929
tablet then you probably should be since
 

00:21:43.929 --> 00:21:45.840
tablet then you probably should be since
you know you really want a lot of space

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:45.850
you know you really want a lot of space
 

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.669
you know you really want a lot of space
so that you can really the I can

00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679
so that you can really the I can
 

00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:50.250
so that you can really the I can
comfortably read the content and then

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:50.260
comfortably read the content and then
 

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.410
comfortably read the content and then
the font size here is fairly large 48

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:52.420
the font size here is fairly large 48
 

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:58.620
the font size here is fairly large 48
ESPYs okay let's also look at that same

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:58.630
ESPYs okay let's also look at that same
 

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.380
ESPYs okay let's also look at that same
alternative so again with the photo

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:01.390
alternative so again with the photo
 

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.510
alternative so again with the photo
behind the text it's even more evident

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520
behind the text it's even more evident
 

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.970
behind the text it's even more evident
here that there's a background gradient

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980
here that there's a background gradient
 

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.380
here that there's a background gradient
but again the key point here is that

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:07.390
but again the key point here is that
 

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.240
but again the key point here is that
you'll notice that the alignment is

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:09.250
you'll notice that the alignment is
 

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.640
you'll notice that the alignment is
still there the text still aligns so

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:11.650
still there the text still aligns so
 

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.400
still there the text still aligns so
that the eye can very quickly read we've

you're if you're using a webview for
 

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:36.739
you're if you're using a webview for
presenting content then you're

00:23:36.739 --> 00:23:36.749
presenting content then you're
 

00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:37.999
presenting content then you're
automatically going to get this but if

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:38.009
automatically going to get this but if
 

00:23:38.009 --> 00:23:39.919
automatically going to get this but if
you're not if using a text view by

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:39.929
you're not if using a text view by
 

00:23:39.929 --> 00:23:41.989
you're not if using a text view by
default your text will not be selectable

00:23:41.989 --> 00:23:41.999
default your text will not be selectable
 

00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:45.259
default your text will not be selectable
so if you long press on the body content

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:45.269
so if you long press on the body content
 

00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:46.430
so if you long press on the body content
nothing will happen

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440
nothing will happen
 

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.340
nothing will happen
so there's a really neat little trick

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:49.350
so there's a really neat little trick
 

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.720
so there's a really neat little trick
that you can do you can set a single

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:50.730
that you can do you can set a single
 

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.029
that you can do you can set a single
attribute on your text view and this is

00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039
attribute on your text view and this is
 

00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:54.799
attribute on your text view and this is
more for developers of course that makes

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:54.809
more for developers of course that makes
 

00:23:54.809 --> 00:23:57.200
more for developers of course that makes
that tech selectable and from there you

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.210
that tech selectable and from there you
 

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.850
that tech selectable and from there you
can obviously customize you can say you

00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860
can obviously customize you can say you
 

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.710
can obviously customize you can say you
know allow people to share this text or

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720
know allow people to share this text or
 

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.239
know allow people to share this text or
copy it and so on I'm surprised

00:24:02.239 --> 00:24:02.249
copy it and so on I'm surprised
 

00:24:02.249 --> 00:24:04.879
copy it and so on I'm surprised
surprised that attribute is called text

00:24:04.879 --> 00:24:04.889
surprised that attribute is called text
 

00:24:04.889 --> 00:24:08.960
surprised that attribute is called text
is selectable is very simple all right

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:08.970
is selectable is very simple all right
 

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.899
is selectable is very simple all right
let's keep moving on okay so I think

00:24:11.899 --> 00:24:11.909
let's keep moving on okay so I think
 

00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:15.739
let's keep moving on okay so I think
this is the last step here this is what

00:24:15.739 --> 00:24:15.749
this is the last step here this is what
 

00:24:15.749 --> 00:24:17.269
this is the last step here this is what
it looks like so you guys remember from

00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279
it looks like so you guys remember from
 

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:19.669
it looks like so you guys remember from
the very beginning you know the very

00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679
the very beginning you know the very
 

00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:21.950
the very beginning you know the very
very beginning starting point was yeah

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960
very beginning starting point was yeah
 

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.359
very beginning starting point was yeah
it was just all over the place

mock-ups I think overall it took us you

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.110
mock-ups I think overall it took us you
 

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.960

with very little work I'd say you can
 

00:24:56.249 --> 00:24:58.430
with very little work I'd say you can
get to this point so you should

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440
get to this point so you should
 

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.519
get to this point so you should
definitely eat to it alright with that

the opportunity of using widgets and you
 

00:25:35.259 --> 00:25:36.810
the opportunity of using widgets and you
with your application and I think they

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:36.820
with your application and I think they
 

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.070
with your application and I think they
really summed up the opportunity here

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080
really summed up the opportunity here
 

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.259

template I'll briefly just mention that

00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:06.609
template I'll briefly just mention that
 

00:26:06.609 --> 00:26:09.029
template I'll briefly just mention that
you know it's very important to map out

00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039
you know it's very important to map out
 

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:10.379
you know it's very important to map out
the different interactions in your app

00:26:10.379 --> 00:26:10.389
the different interactions in your app
 

00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:12.269
the different interactions in your app
not just the visuals you know so like

00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279
not just the visuals you know so like
 

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:13.799
not just the visuals you know so like
when you touch this what happens when

00:26:13.799 --> 00:26:13.809
when you touch this what happens when
 

00:26:13.809 --> 00:26:15.899
when you touch this what happens when
you when you pinch here or a double

you when you pinch here or a double
touch here or swipe here what happens

00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:18.369
touch here or swipe here what happens
 

00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:22.169
touch here or swipe here what happens
and so this is a great starter template

00:26:22.169 --> 00:26:22.179
and so this is a great starter template
 

00:26:22.179 --> 00:26:24.479
and so this is a great starter template
for basically giving you the the

00:26:24.479 --> 00:26:24.489

using these little red arrows so if

00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:30.369
using these little red arrows so if
 

00:26:30.369 --> 00:26:31.320
using these little red arrows so if
you're if you're starting from scratch

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:33.220
you may want to just start from this
 

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.220
you may want to just start from this
point if you're mapping out the

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:35.230
point if you're mapping out the
 

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.379
point if you're mapping out the
interactions within your app it kind of

00:26:37.379 --> 00:26:37.389
interactions within your app it kind of
 

00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:39.720
interactions within your app it kind of
