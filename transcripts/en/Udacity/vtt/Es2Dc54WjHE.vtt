00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.810
So far we have looked at simple mathematical operations of trying to

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.220
do point processes across images or looking at neighborhoods of images or

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.870
neighborhoods of pixels to be able to do simple mathematics on it.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.720
Now let's try to create a formal mathematical representation of it.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.670
For that purpose,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.540
I'm going to introduce the concept of cross-correlation leading up to

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.620
the concept of convolution.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.090
These will provide us with simple mathematical formulations and

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.930
mathematical tools that will allow us to do things like smoothing images,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.550
kind of doing blurring on images, and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.060
also reducing noise and finding different types of information from images.
