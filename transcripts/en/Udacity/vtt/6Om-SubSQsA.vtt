00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, here we have an angle, and we have an opposite side and a hypotenuse.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Opposite and hypotenuse--well, that's the sine relationship.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In fact, I can write that sin α is equal to V0y over 50.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's the opposite over the hypotenuse.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Solving this means that V0y is equal to 50 times the sin α, which is 53 degrees.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If I type this into a calculator or a search engine, I get 39.9 or rounding 40 m/s.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I can do some similar trigonometry using the cosine to find that V0x is 30 m/s.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now, look what we've done.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We've broken one very difficult problem into two very solvable problems. Very cool.
