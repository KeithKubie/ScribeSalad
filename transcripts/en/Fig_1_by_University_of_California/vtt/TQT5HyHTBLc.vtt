00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.140
In mexico, gold the the Mesoamerican
culture was extremely valuable.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.820
Particularly the Aztecs believed that
gold was actually sweat of the Sun

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.400
and they can actually pick
up the pieces of the sweat of the Sun

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.310
it had of course a strong spiritual
value because the God of Sun was a very

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.030
important component of the culture

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.220
what's interesting is of course that the
gold was not created in the Sun

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.840
it has this beautiful properties that you
know it's shiny

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.670
is yellow and it's natural to assign it
to an origin in the Sun but

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.620
today one of the biggest mysteries is
you know where gold come from and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.289
in fact not only gold but a large fraction of
their very precious elements such as  titanium

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:39.129
silver

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.420
we still haven't figured out where they
come that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.720
 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.630
what type of explosive phenomenon can
make these heavy elements which require

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.490
probably the most extreme conditions in
the universe, the highest densities

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.090
and the highest temperatures to make
these elements and in fact the stars that I'm

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.370
more interested in are those sort of

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.050
rock stars which basically are extremely
luminous but they just have very short

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.010
lifetimes

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.150
and when they die they produce this
very very heavy neutron star

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.210
or black holes. And in fact if I take
a cup

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.620
of neutron star matter it weighs as
much as mount everest

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.820
the story of the formation of heavy
elements

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.280
is intimately linked to neutrons stars.  So one, a very massive star

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.430
more massive than 20 times the mass of
our Sun

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.990
collapses.  In the core basically the
remanant that becomes

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.300
the neutron star. Its extremely hot and very high densities.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.750
So one model is that basically
these elements can be produced in supernova

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.560
explosions.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.360
The model of neutron star production has 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.690
basically encountered lots of problems
in terms of whether or not it can

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.560
actually make

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.340
the necessary conditions

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.410
I've been working on an alternative model
that has significant gained popularity

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.500
in the past five years which is actually
a little more extreme. 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.420
So the ingredients are

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.400
two neutron stars and in fact fifty
percent of stars actually live in pairs

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.140
and they're orbiting around each other

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.459
now because these objects are so dense
they actually the space and time

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.160
and when they touch each other that
generates billion of degree heat

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.360
very high density and they eject mass
and we believe

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.160
in that ejection they produce about
Jupiter mass of pure gold that is

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.170
ejected

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.470
into the external medium and we believe
that in fact that may be the main

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.220
channel

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.320
to produce gold and other heavy elements.
