00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.480
So the question is, why does this not

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.620
work? Why does multiplying empty list times n buckets

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.310
not produce what we need for the empty hash

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.280
table? And the possible answers are, because it's too

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.720
easy, and we like doing things the hard way.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.560
Because each element in the output refers to the

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.790
same empty list, or because the store operator means

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.800
something different for lists than it does for strings.
