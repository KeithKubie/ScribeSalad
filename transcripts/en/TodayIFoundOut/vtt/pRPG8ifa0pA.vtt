00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:07.210
Why Olympians Bite Their Medals SaveChanges
applied

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.809
According to four time Olympic medalist Summer
Sanders, mainly because the photographers

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.210
incessantly ask them to until they do it,
usually at the end of the podium photo shoot

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.210
sessions.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.000
The tradition probably stems from the age
old practice of testing whether something

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.210
was really solid gold or not by biting it.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.840
Gold is a very soft metal, at least softer
than tooth enamel, and if it’s fairly pure,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.620
you should be able to leave some teeth marks
in it by biting it.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.879
The practice of biting precious metals also
allowed people to see if perhaps the gold

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.320
object was really just gold plated, with something
like lead at the center.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.619
If so, the gold plating could be scraped off
with your teeth and, given the often bitten

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:51.370
gold coins weren’t that thick, the plating
tended to be fairly thin, so you didn’t

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.119
have to bite too hard to discover whether
it was relatively pure gold or not.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:01.550
Obviously Olympic gold medals today are not
made of solid gold (not since 1912, though

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.799
they do have 24k gold plating).

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.581
Rather, the gold medals are made mostly of
sterling silver.

00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:07.581
But were you to actually bite down on the
gold plated silver Olympic medal, you should

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:08.581
be able to make a dent as silver is also softer
than tooth enamel, but harder than gold.

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:12.390
Using Mohs mineral hardness scale, we see
that tooth enamel is rated at a 5, while gold

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.590
is rated at around 2.5 and silver at a 2.7-ish.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.400
Tooth enamel is also higher on the scale than
copper, which the “bronze” Olympic medals

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.920
are mostly made of, so it’s possible to
make teeth marks on those too.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.210
Mohs hardness scale is a relative hardness
scale created by German geologist Friedrich

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.940
Mohs in 1812, rating things based on scratching
one material against another, the one that

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.420
makes a mark on the other is rated as harder.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.390
If both scratch each other, they are considered
to be the same hardness.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.600
For reference, glass is rated at 5.5 and tooth
enamel is actually slightly higher than steel

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.090
or platinum (at 4-4.5).

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.880
(Note: just because something is only slightly
higher on this particularly scale than something

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.070
else doesn’t necessarily mean it’s only
slightly harder.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.330
For instance, diamonds are rated at a 10,
while corundum is rated at 9, but diamonds

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.050
are 4 times as hard as corundum.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.140
Further, corundum is twice as hard as topaz,
which is rated at an 8.)

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.069
Despite the fact that none of the athletes
are actually trying to make marks on their

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.970
medals or checking for authenticity, the tradition
with Olympians has endured and photographers

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.510
simply won’t let it die as it makes a more
interesting, “playful” shot over an Olympic

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:35.620
medalist simply holding their medal up next
to their faces or 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.730
the like.
