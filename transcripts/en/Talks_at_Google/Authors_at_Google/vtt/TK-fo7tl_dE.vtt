00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.690
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: I'm Michelle Baller and
I have the iconic Dr. Ruth with me here today,

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.129
who needs a little something-something out
of her briefcase.

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.549
We'll just leave it at that.

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:10.549
[laughter]

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:11.960
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Only one second.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.740
When you ask me a good question, you have
to say, "A friend of mine has a question."

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.740
You don't have to say "I."

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.740
[laughter]

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.800
The good questions get a keychain--sex for
dummies.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.800
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Yeah.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.800
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: All right.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.060
Here is one for Derek.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.210
He doesn't have to ask me.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.360
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: All right.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.719
So, Dr. Ruth.

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.770
You're no stranger to Google by now.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.170
You've been spotted on scooters.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.360
Has anybody here seen her on a scooter?

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.360
Very nice.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.360
Excellent.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.360
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: I'd do it again.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360
[laughter]

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.660
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: She's been on this very
stage.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.700
And of course, if you haven't been there yet,
make sure you visit Dr. Ruth on YouTube.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.690
She's got amazing, amazing videos on there,
some of our favorite celebrities being questioned

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.190
by Dr. Ruth, talking about sex.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.060
So, we really wanna talk about your book,
"Sexually Speaking: What Every Woman Needs

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.480
to Know About Sexual Health."

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.650
But Dr. Ruth has a really fascinating story.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.090
And this is actually your 35th book to be
published.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.780
So, I know you write, you lecture, you work
one-on-one, and of course, you have a very

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.700
long TV and radio legacy, which we all know
about.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.230
So, tell us really quickly.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.430
What do you love most about what you do?

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.460
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Good question.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.530
First of all, I don't write because I'm not
computer literate, but don't tell anybody.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.810
Now it's on Google.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.810
Don't tell anybody.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.960
I talk.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.040
And since I talk pretty well, I have Pierre
Lehu, whose name is on the book, for 30 years,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.480
the same minister of communications.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.480
I talk.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.680
He puts it on the computer.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.220
And for this particular book, which I'll say
something else a little later, I did it with

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.900
a gynecologist, important for you women here,
and also for men because that's a book about

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.540
sexual health that I would not have done without
MD, without a medical doctor.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.690
We'll talk about that later.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.700
What do I like best?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.290
I'll tell you what I like best.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.420
I like the combination.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.840
I like that I taught now six years at Yale.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.030
I taught now six years at Princeton.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.750
And cross your fingers, all of you.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.670
Say a prayer because I'm right now talking
to Columbia University Teachers College.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.430
I probably will get it to teach a course in
the fall.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.430
You don't know that yet.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.430
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: No.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.430
I'll make a little call so you get it.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.430
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: All right.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.990
Teacher's College about the family.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.170
So, what I like is, that's why I call myself
a psycho-sexual therapist and not just a sex

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.300
therapist.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:49.580
I keep the psychology of relationships, of
the psychology of psychological health, all

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.440
involved in that talking about the things
that we are going to talk about in terms of

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.750
sex.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.920
So for me, to have a big, I'm four foot seven
but a big toe of mine in the academic world

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.880
and being able to have somebody that I can
talk and we get one book after the other,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.680
I think that combination, and my private practice,
where I learn a great deal.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.030
I think for me, the importance is really that
combination.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:30.830
It's not research, per se, but I do base what
I'm talking about on scientifically validated

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.200
data that all of you will hear about.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.489
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Yes.

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.970
We love data here.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.690
So, tell us a little about your story.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.459
Like, I could tell your bio, but it's absolutely
fascinating and I think really informs who

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.910
you are as a person.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.560
So, could you give everyone a snapshot?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.490
I'm not sure everybody knows your whole history
like, "PS, Dr. Ruth Was a Sniper."

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.980
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: I have to tell you something.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.550
I'll talk about that very in a short paragraph.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.099
But I have to tell you why I'm smiling.

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:14.410
As I'm talking to you Google people here,
I just got into my hot, little hands a documentary

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.129
done by the BBC, the British Broadcasting
and now I'm going to blush.

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:20.759
That's why I wore a dress.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.749
I wore a blouse with a little red, so you
won't see that I blush.

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:25.749
[laughter]

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:35.160
But I have to tell you, the documentary is
12, "Extraordinary Women," and I already watched

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.430
it now three times.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.639
And the British did a fabulous job.

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.979
They really did in essence, and they had footage
in terms of World War II, I'll tell you something

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.669
in a moment, that I have never seen.

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.809
They have footage in there of Hitler that
I've never seen because the British went into

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:59.770
World War II so much earlier than the Americans,
so they have a lot of footage.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.759
They did a beautiful job.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:07.639
That one is going to be shown at a benefit
for the Museum of Jewish Heritage, not far

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.379
from here, on Battery Park, where I'm a trustee.

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.229
So, you will get invitations.

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.970
And I can't show it on television yet, because
they first have to see that they can sell

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:22.970
it.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.289
You Google people know what that means.

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.490
But I can show it for non-profit places.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.900
That's number one.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:40.680
So, when I said to you before what has happened
to me, it's like, most interesting, even to

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.370
me because as we speak, I'm now 83.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:52.719
As we speak, on June 30th, there is a theater
play and I just heard the first part of it

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:58.960
until the intermission that Debra Jo Rupp--all
of you must know from the television program--

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.240
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: "That 70s Show."

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.529
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: "That 70s Show."

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.430
I did not know about her.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.430
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: She played the mom, right?

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.430
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: But don't tell her.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.409
Right now, I know how she plays and I know
how she talks and talking about my history,

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:12.409
the funniest thing.

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:13.900
So, that would be play called, "Dr. Ruth:
All the Way."

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.900
[laughter]

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.400
And first I said, "Hold it.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.130
You can't call it 'All the Way.'"

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.259
And then I said--.

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.369
I knew that you young people would laugh.

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:27.819
So I said, "It's OK."

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:28.819
[laughter]

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:31.080
So, that's happening this June.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.139
So, now I'll tell you why I'm smiling.

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.849
I was born in 1928 in Frankfurt, in Germany.

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:45.990
I lived the first ten and a half years with
a wonderful family, parents.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.529
I was an only child.

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:52.560
My grandmother, my father's mother lived with
us.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.740
She had nothing else to do but take care of
me.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.569
And I went to a very good school.

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:02.280
And I had a wonderful, wonderful early childhood.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:09.460
Then, in 1939, as all of you know, the start
of World War II.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:15.289
I was chosen, and I will never know why, to
be on a Kinder Transport.

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:25.999
That means a group of children who were sent
out of Nazi Germany, Jewish children, to safety.

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:29.719
And I will never know how come I was on the
list to Switzerland.

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:33.210
My parents did not make it out.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.250
Neither did my mother's parents, any other
relatives.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.169
My grandmother, who lived with us, was already
a widow.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:46.029
So, I lived six years in a children's home
that became an orphanage.

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:49.770
From there, I went to then Palestine.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.509
I believe, and I still am ardent Zionist.

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:54.509
Even so, I live here.

00:07:54.509 --> 00:08:00.039
But I believe that every people in the world
need a country of their own.

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:02.099
And I go to Israel every single year.

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:03.099
I do documentaries.

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:05.740
I'll tell you about that in a moment.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.209
And I went to be on a kibbutz.

00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:16.409
A kibbutz is a collective farm, and working
the earth.

00:08:16.409 --> 00:08:18.879
I picked olives for one year.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:21.990
I thought that I need to learn something.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.229
By that time, I was 17 and a half.

00:08:24.229 --> 00:08:28.210
I wanted to study medicine, but I didn't have
a high school diploma.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.370
I knew I had no money, no parents.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.669
So, I said, "OK.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.419
I'll be a kindergarten teacher.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:35.419
I'm short.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.190
I can sit on those little chairs."

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.190
[laughter]

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:43.160
And I was a very good kindergarten teacher
at a collective kindergarten.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.160
One more sentence.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.530
I married a fellow.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.300
I'm still good friends with him.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.350
He lives in Israel.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.570
I mean, I'm not married.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.520
But he was studying medicine in Paris.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520
That's how I got to Paris.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.260
I went to the Sorbonne.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.940
I studied Psychology.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.310
He went back to Israel.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.000
I forgot to tell you about the sniper.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.450
That's what you want to hear.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.450
[laughter]

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:16.810
It wasn't an act of heroism, but all of us
did belong to some group in 1947-48, when

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:23.940
Israel became a country and when there was
a war.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.900
For some strange reason, I became a sniper.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:33.100
If you look at your telephone over there,
sir.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.980
And, I think, if anybody doesn't ask me a
good question, I can still put five bullets

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.880
in a red circle.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880
[laughter]

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.490
And I knew how to throw hand grenades.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:46.490
I was fortunate.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:47.780
I never killed anybody.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.331
I was badly wounded in 1948, in June, on my
20th birthday.

00:09:52.331 --> 00:09:58.920
A cannonball exploded in the girl's residence,
where I lived.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.110
Some girls were killed and I was badly wounded
on both legs.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.240
But that's not why I'm short.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.680
I would've been short anyway.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.680
[laughter]

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.570
So, I then was fortunate being in Paris, going
to the Sorbonne.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.860
And on my way back to Israel in 1956, I said,
"I have to see the United States.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:23.410
I will never have money to get out of Israel
to visit here.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.630
There was an uncle in San Francisco.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.130
I need to see if he's as short as me."

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.360
And I came to the United States on a tourist
Visa.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.990
I then worked at the French Embassy, Embassy
Visa.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.610
I made one dollar an hour.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.350
And look what happened.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.740
I got my Master's here at the new school.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.950
I got a doctorate at a Teacher's College at
Columbia.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.310
And look what happened.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:49.380
OK.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.580
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Amazing.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.650
[clapping]

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:59.960
So, I'm just gonna have to ask this because
if I don't, I know somebody will.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.780
What is the number one question that you get
on sexual health?

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.760
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: OK.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:11.830
You see, the interesting part, let me tell
you what has changed, especially for you young

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:12.830
people.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.630
There are some things that have changed.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:23.540
For example, there are less unintended pregnancies
in this country these days because of people

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.540
like me.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.540
I'm not the only one.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.820
I started to work for Planned Parenthood,
New York City, doing research and became a

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.050
Director of Research.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.840
I thought these people are crazy.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.190
I thought, "All they talk about is sex.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.540
They don't talk about literature.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.980
They don't talk about the weather.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.410
They don't talk about anything else but sex."

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:50.670
Forty-eight hours later, I decided, "That's
a fabulous topic."

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.890
[laughter]

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:59.790
So, I tell some of the things that have changed
from those years at my doctoral dissertation

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.440
on that research study at Planned Parenthood.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.580
So, what has changed?

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.530
Less unintended pregnancies because we talk
more about it.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:17.230
What has changed, particularly for you women
here, there are less women in this great country

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.910
of ours who haven't heard the message.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.780
I'm not the only one.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.180
Many others talk about it.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.070
But I talk about it all the time.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:32.530
Who haven't heard the message that the woman
has to take the responsibility for her sexual

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.350
satisfaction.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:42.840
Even the best lover, even one trained by me,
can't bring a woman to orgasm if she doesn't

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.030
tell him what she needs.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:51.080
So, there are across the country less women
who haven't heard that message.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:57.940
There are still lots of issues how to say
it, how to say it tactfully so that he doesn't

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.540
lose his erection during love-making.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.800
All of this we can teach.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:09.230
Most the question that I'm really asked most
often is about boredom.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:16.370
So, if I have one thing to say in terms of
long-term relationships, I'm old-fashioned,

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.830
I'm a square.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.310
I want people to have long-term relationships.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:29.370
And the question that I'm being asked most
of the time is the question about how to make

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.040
love-making in the bedroom less boring.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.480
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: So, how do you answer that?

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.560
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: So, I'll tell you how I answer
first of all.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.880
Everybody has to keep their worries outside
the bedroom.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.230
They have to, even when the stock market goes
down--.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.290
Very often men lose their erections.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.830
And I don't know about Google people, but
I know about stock market people.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:57.770
So, to make sure to put all of your worries
in a package.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.550
Leave it outside the bedroom door.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:05.120
And I promise you, nobody else would pick
up your worries.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:18.130
Also, if people are stressed out, that's the
new buzzword here, to make sure to take maybe

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.300
a little break before love-making.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.370
Sleep 20 minutes.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.740
Or, do something--.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.110
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Take a nap first?

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.110
[laughter]

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.110
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Yes.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.110
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: I thought you did that
after.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.920
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Because that's what the French--.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.970
But you have to get up again.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.820
You can't stay sleeping.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.200
So, I learned that from the French.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.500
The French women do that.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.580
They take a little nap.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.580
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Yeah.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.580
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Really?

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.580
So, they--.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.580
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: They're, they're--.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.860
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Not only are they all skinny,
they also like, are fully powered up for sex

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.920
all the time.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.300
French women.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.300
[laughter]

00:14:53.300 --> 00:15:01.720
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: So, on a serious note, to make
a priority of that sexual life, not to put

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:08.460
it on a back burner, like next week or the
week after or in four weeks.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.960
To use fantasies.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:16.470
There was call not too long ago from Brazil,
as, as, what's his name?

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.040
He didn't come from Uruguay.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.640
He came from Brazil.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:25.380
And somebody said she has difficulty, a woman,
she has difficulty concentrating.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:32.240
I said, "Keep your mouth shut, but in your
fantasy, make believe that the entire Brazilian

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.100
soccer people are in bed with you.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.620
But keep your mouth shut."

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.620
[laughter]

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.180
So, if I give one more good advice, use fantasies.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.640
But don't ever tell him, "My last lover had
a bigger penis."

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:54.211
And don't ever tell her that you really like
women with tremendous breasts if she does

00:15:54.211 --> 00:15:55.690
not have that.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.100
But use fantasies, but keep your mouth shut.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.960
There are people who would like to hear each
other's fantasies.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.160
I have no problem with that.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.510
If that couple knows that's what they really
would like, use it.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:17.470
But really, many people should use fantasies,
keep their mouths shut, just get into the

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:18.470
fantasies.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.970
And there are books, not written by me, there
are other books.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.350
"My Secret Garden," "Nancy Friday."

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:33.110
There are all kinds of books, "Men in Love,"
that talk about bring fantasies to the reader.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.970
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: OK.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:40.980
So, if you had to distill this into like,
one tip that we all walked out of here with

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.090
to make our sex lives better, what would it
be?

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:47.529
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: The first tip I would tell you
people, bravo to you.

00:16:47.529 --> 00:16:53.200
Here you're taking your lunch time and you
are sitting here listening and learning about

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.200
sex.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.460
Now, I have to tell you something funny about
tips.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:02.740
So, here I'm doing this book and I like that
they can have it for ten dollars.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.000
I like that very much.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.350
In the store, it's 20.

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.919
So, I, myself, thought, "Oh, I can't.

00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:09.919
I can't.

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:16.059
OK, that with Dr. Amos Grunebaum, good friend
of mine, Chief at Cornell Medical Center,

00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:19.119
gynecologist and obstetrician."

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:26.529
What he put on Page 61, when I read that because
he did some of the stories from his office.

00:17:26.529 --> 00:17:32.309
I give the flavor of the sexuality at occasion
and all the things, but he gives some so on.

00:17:32.309 --> 00:17:36.830
On Page 61, and even I thought, "Oh, my gosh.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.700
I'm not going to talk to Google people about
that."

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.900
But I have to do it.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:48.360
There is something here that I thought I would
never in my entire life put in a book of mine.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:53.629
And it's his top ten tips from Dr. Amos on
shaving the pubic area.

00:17:53.629 --> 00:17:54.629
[laughter]

00:17:54.629 --> 00:18:04.639
So, when you say to me, "What is new?" in
the Jewish tradition, it says "a lesson taught

00:18:04.639 --> 00:18:07.649
with humor is a lesson retained."

00:18:07.649 --> 00:18:09.480
I could never tell you a joke.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:16.590
But I can hear questions about somebody on
radio asking me, I did ten years of the radio

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.380
doing "Sexually Speaking" somebody said his
girlfriend like to toss onion rings on his

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.380
erect penis.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.769
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Oh, my God.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:24.769
[laughter]

00:18:24.769 --> 00:18:26.710
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: I giggled.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:33.140
And I did exactly what you are doing because
a good sex therapist has to visualize what

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:40.789
people do in their kitchen floor, living room
couch, bedroom.

00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:41.789
[laughter]

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:49.340
So, I did not think in 2012 I would pluck
a book, I'm even going on Howard Stern, I

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:55.929
was just on the Doctor's program and I flew
to California to tape the Doctor's program

00:18:55.929 --> 00:18:57.720
for Valentine's Day.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.740
I didn't think that I would have, on Page
61, ten tips of shaving.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:11.200
When I started in this area of sexual education,
sex education, sexuality education, I don't

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.130
think anybody talked about shaving down there.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.120
Now, here there's ten tips of it.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:24.490
So, things are changing and somebody who is
in this area of sexuality education has to

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:30.559
be aware of what the changes are and has to
adapt to that.

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:34.059
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: What do you think we should
all watch out for in the bedroom that might

00:19:34.059 --> 00:19:35.929
affect people's overall relationships?

00:19:35.929 --> 00:19:39.830
Like, are there any tell-tale things that
happen in the bedroom that's like, you're

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:40.830
headed for trouble?

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.830
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: No.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:48.269
I tell you what one has to be careful, which
I told you already, is about boredom.

00:19:48.269 --> 00:19:49.860
It's about being too tired.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.580
You young people work very hard.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.240
You have to make time for love-making.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:01.559
There is just no other advice that I can give
but to say you can't be too tired.

00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:06.009
You can be too tired on a Monday, but you
can't be too tired the whole week.

00:20:06.009 --> 00:20:13.960
I could never sit here and tell you how often
to engage in any sexual activity.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.850
Each person and each couple is different.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:24.490
What I can say is those people who don't have
a partner right now, I don't want you, especially

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:30.809
you here at Google people, I don't want you
to just pick up somebody for tonight.

00:20:30.809 --> 00:20:31.809
[laughter]

00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:37.899
I am old-fashioned and a square and I'm repeating
that I believe in relationships.

00:20:37.899 --> 00:20:43.649
But I do believe that the time has come in
2012 that a woman can ask a man, "Would you

00:20:43.649 --> 00:20:45.789
like to go to a movie?"

00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:50.429
But she can't fall to pieces if he says, "No,
I have to wash my hair tonight."

00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:51.580
[laughter]

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.870
Because that's what they heard all of the
years.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:21:01.730
In the Victorian time, when a woman wanted
a man to pay attention to her, she dropped

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.159
a handkerchief.

00:21:03.159 --> 00:21:07.250
Sometimes, the wrong man picked up the handkerchief.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.409
Sometimes, and that was very sad, the handkerchief
remained on the floor.

00:21:11.409 --> 00:21:18.529
But at least she took the initiative and the
courage to drop the handkerchief.

00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:21.230
I have a collection of turtles.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.230
Don't give me any more.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.850
I have a whole collection.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:29.999
Not live turtles: little pink turtles, little
toy turtles, because it gives a message.

00:21:29.999 --> 00:21:34.929
A turtle, if it stays in one place, it's very
safe.

00:21:34.929 --> 00:21:37.690
Nothing can happen to that turtle.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:43.320
If that turtle wants to move, it has to stick
its neck out.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.559
It has to take a risk.

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:52.470
It could get hurt, but it does not move unless
it sticks its neck out.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:59.519
That's a little bit what's happening in terms
of relationships, in terms of finding partners,

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:02.730
and in terms even of new positions.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.950
And my example with me is Page 61 in the book.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:13.179
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: So, you have a doctorate
in the interdisciplinary study of the family.

00:22:13.179 --> 00:22:17.400
And the documentaries that you've done are
a lot around how families manage in different

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.400
environments.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.279
So, how do you think the current environment
is affecting the way that we instill strong

00:22:23.279 --> 00:22:26.879
sexual values in our children, or lack thereof?

00:22:26.879 --> 00:22:33.700
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: So, first of all, from the little
history that I told you, you know that I was

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.299
an orphan at the age of ten and a half.

00:22:36.299 --> 00:22:40.929
So for me, family is crucial, very important.

00:22:40.929 --> 00:22:44.100
I don't care if it's two men, two women.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.249
I don't care--.

00:22:45.249 --> 00:22:48.970
I do care that's it's not a commune.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:54.249
I'm not for Esalen or any of these quote free
love.

00:22:54.249 --> 00:22:56.200
It doesn't work in the long run.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:03.210
It doesn't even work when somebody says, "But
my partner wants to introduce a third person."

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:08.860
I say do it in your mind because it never
works, because there is then more attachment,

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.299
then there is jealousy.

00:23:10.299 --> 00:23:11.299
It just doesn't.

00:23:11.299 --> 00:23:13.220
In our culture, it just doesn't work.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:19.749
So, for me, family is very important because
I did not have that.

00:23:19.749 --> 00:23:21.860
I thought I was ugly and short.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.860
Nobody would marry me.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.360
Thank God I was married three times.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.360
[laughter]

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:32.049
But the last one, the last marriage was the
real marriage, almost 40 years.

00:23:32.049 --> 00:23:34.629
My husband passed away a few years ago.

00:23:34.629 --> 00:23:42.509
But you see that the whole emphasis of why
I believe that in our culture, most people

00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:49.020
do want to have a significant other, a sociological
term, one person in their lives.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.860
Let me tell you something.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:57.859
I never permitted my late husband, Fred, to
come to any of my talks because he would sit

00:23:57.859 --> 00:23:58.859
back there.

00:23:58.859 --> 00:24:04.759
When I'm now going to ask for questions and
you can say "a friend of mine has a question."

00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:06.500
You don't have to say "I."

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.389
So, Fred would raise his hand.

00:24:08.389 --> 00:24:09.960
I would have to recognize him.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.789
I couldn't just ignore him.

00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:14.860
He would tell all of you "Don't listen to
her.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.870
It's all talk."

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:17.870
[laughter]

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.630
And I make one exception.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.309
Fred loved Diane Sawyer.

00:24:22.309 --> 00:24:28.619
One time, Diane Sawyer came with "60 Minutes"
to my apartment in Washington Heights, where

00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:30.389
I still live.

00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:31.389
The cameras are rolling.

00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:35.629
I didn't have the heart to say to Fred, "You
can't be home."

00:24:35.629 --> 00:24:37.649
He really liked Diane Sawyer.

00:24:37.649 --> 00:24:38.649
[laughter]

00:24:38.649 --> 00:24:43.720
The cameras are rolling and Diane Sawyer says,
"First question.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.809
Mr. Westheimer, how is your sex life?"

00:24:46.809 --> 00:24:52.580
To which Fred said, and I have it on tape,
"The shoemaker's children don't have shoes."

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.779
[laughter]

00:24:53.779 --> 00:24:54.989
[clapping]

00:24:54.989 --> 00:25:00.999
So, you see why I--.

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:08.320
Now, in terms of sexuality education, that's
what you asked me, I do believe in our culture.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.880
Not talking about other cultures.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.210
We do that another time.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.970
In our culture, first of all, I changed my
mind.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:22.109
I used to say to parents never to look into
the diaries of their children.

00:25:22.109 --> 00:25:23.109
It's private.

00:25:23.109 --> 00:25:30.859
I changed my mind because young people, pre-teens,
don't realize that what they put--important

00:25:30.859 --> 00:25:36.899
for you people, what they put on the air,
they don't realize cannot be retrieved.

00:25:36.899 --> 00:25:41.999
If it's a picture of a naked friend, or if
it's some gossip, they think they could retrieve

00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:42.999
it.

00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:43.999
So, I did change my mind.

00:25:43.999 --> 00:25:49.409
I wrote a book Teachers College Press about
the danger parents have to know what their

00:25:49.409 --> 00:25:53.090
children watch on the internet.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:59.669
I also believe that parents of pre-teens,
I'm not talking about little ones now, should

00:25:59.669 --> 00:26:07.619
not walk around naked at home because the
young boy can get an erection by seeing his

00:26:07.619 --> 00:26:09.519
mother naked.

00:26:09.519 --> 00:26:17.109
The girl can see, when she sees her father,
the father can have an erection by seeing

00:26:17.109 --> 00:26:21.779
his growing youngster naked.

00:26:21.779 --> 00:26:27.610
And I say we have to watch out for that because
everybody is going to get scared.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.169
They're going to think something is not normal.

00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:37.899
And I'm saying make sure you prevent that,
but make sure that you are an askable parent

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:43.799
so that your children have to know that when
they have a question, it doesn't matter if

00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:46.980
it's the mother or the father--that they can
ask you.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:52.200
Those children who don't ask the questions,
and many don't, bring a book home.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.429
Put it on the coffee table.

00:26:53.429 --> 00:26:56.309
Say, "I want to be an askable parent.

00:26:56.309 --> 00:27:00.350
If you have any questions how babies are born--."

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.279
It's not difficult to teach how babies are
born.

00:27:02.279 --> 00:27:05.629
"It's a special place in the uterus."

00:27:05.629 --> 00:27:10.859
Not to say "stomach," because if a girl has
a stomachache, she thinks she's pregnant.

00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:15.609
But to say how a baby is born, then the question
comes.

00:27:15.609 --> 00:27:17.140
"How does it get in there?"

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:23.320
You have to take a deep breath and you have
to say, "When a mother and a father love each

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.989
other and when they make love, there's a sperm
that goes into the vagina."

00:27:28.989 --> 00:27:35.169
And you have to say, "It feels good," because
some children hear moaning and groaning.

00:27:35.169 --> 00:27:36.169
And they think--

00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:37.239
[Dr. Ruth coughs]

00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:39.759
the mother gets hurt.

00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:42.879
You have to say they love each other and they
feel good.

00:27:42.879 --> 00:27:46.559
So, the sexuality education has to start very
young.

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:49.320
When they ask, you have to be an askable parent.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.360
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: That's very helpful.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.360
Can you come to my house next week?

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.360
[laughter]

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.649
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: I saw her children.

00:27:54.649 --> 00:27:56.440
You still have time.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.499
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: So, I know that we're gonna
open it up for questions.

00:28:00.499 --> 00:28:06.090
But before I do, I know that in your 83rd
year, you are rewiring, not retiring.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.539
Tell everybody some of the really exciting
and fun things that you're working on.

00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:12.809
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: So, Sherry Lansing--.

00:28:12.809 --> 00:28:18.830
It's a term that I did not coin, but you have
to give credit to people who coin terms.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:25.669
Sherry Lansing from Hollywood coined a term,
not to retire, but to rewire.

00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:27.869
And I believe in that.

00:28:27.869 --> 00:28:31.419
And a Rabbi friend of mine told it even to
the Pope.

00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:32.419
[laughter]

00:28:32.419 --> 00:28:35.470
So, I don't know if he said that it came from
a Jewish mouth.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.809
I don't know.

00:28:36.809 --> 00:28:37.870
[laughter]

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:44.830
But so, I'm very fortunate because I do really
believe--.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:50.419
I believe when people are not gainfully employed,
they should volunteer.

00:28:50.419 --> 00:28:57.389
I do believe that somebody like myself, if
I can still go and give lectures, and if I

00:28:57.389 --> 00:29:04.720
can now go and do, which I did already once
before, some commercials, and the newest thing

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:11.570
I told you about, the play which hopefully,
after Great Barrington, the subscriptions

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.139
were sold out already.

00:29:14.139 --> 00:29:15.429
That's amazing.

00:29:15.429 --> 00:29:20.470
And if it's successful, it'll come to Off
Broadway.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:21.470
It's not a Broadway.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:26.190
But it's really a little bit about the story
of my life and it's exciting.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:33.359
The other thing, brand new, some book Pierre,
with whom I've worked for 30 years, came up

00:29:33.359 --> 00:29:34.359
with the idea.

00:29:34.359 --> 00:29:35.359
First, I said "no."

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:37.239
Very often, I say "no" first.

00:29:37.239 --> 00:29:40.659
Then, I think about it a little bit and I
say, "Ah, maybe."

00:29:40.659 --> 00:29:42.409
So, Pierre came up with the idea.

00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:50.440
I usually say that a couple should drink some
wine, not too much because if they drink too

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.369
much in the evening, she falls asleep and
he's not going to have an erection.

00:29:55.369 --> 00:29:57.820
So, I say drink a little.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:02.330
I say usually that less is more in terms of
love-making.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:10.669
So, here, end of April, we are going to have
a wine called Vin de Amor, a wine of love,

00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:12.539
and it has less alcohol.

00:30:12.539 --> 00:30:13.889
I don't know if it's good or not.

00:30:13.889 --> 00:30:15.499
You will have to judge it.

00:30:15.499 --> 00:30:16.499
[laughter]

00:30:16.499 --> 00:30:20.659
I'm not an expert, but it will have less alcohol
content.

00:30:20.659 --> 00:30:26.899
So, it will give the idea of having a glass
of wine, relaxing.

00:30:26.899 --> 00:30:33.690
Hopefully, it will bring about a good sexual
encounter because it has less alcohol and

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.279
it'll have my face on it.

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:36.279
And--

00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:37.279
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Guaranteed.

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:39.380
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: And half a glass.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.559
And then it will say, "Less is more."

00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:47.149
So, I hope that it gives people a message:
Go and have sex.

00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:48.799
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Thank you.

00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:49.919
[laughter]

00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:51.039
[applause]

00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:57.639
So, we have some mics there and there.

00:30:57.639 --> 00:31:00.489
So, this would be a great time to ask some
questions.

00:31:00.489 --> 00:31:04.669
And I know that you're gonna give people,
what, good sex for the rest of their lives

00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:06.570
if they ask good questions?

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:07.710
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Yes.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:12.470
And say, "Somebody at Google" or say "somebody
else" or say a "friend of mine."

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:13.509
You don't have to say "I."

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:16.870
Who is the most courageous gets a keychain.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.289
The most courageous person has a question.

00:31:19.289 --> 00:31:20.289
Yeah?

00:31:20.289 --> 00:31:21.289
Bravo.

00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:22.299
You get a keychain.

00:31:22.299 --> 00:31:25.309
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: All right.

00:31:25.309 --> 00:31:28.820
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Everybody applaud her for being--.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.820
[applause]

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:34.849
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Well, I figure
I work in HR, so if I ask the first question,

00:31:34.849 --> 00:31:35.899
everyone would feel comfortable, right?

00:31:35.899 --> 00:31:39.639
I have a two and a half year old at home.

00:31:39.639 --> 00:31:40.779
And I have another one on the way.

00:31:40.779 --> 00:31:44.370
And I told a friend of mine, who has a child
the same age.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.889
And she looked at me in all honesty and she
didn't say "congratulations" or "that's wonderful."

00:31:47.889 --> 00:31:50.179
She said, "You had sex?"

00:31:50.179 --> 00:31:51.970
That was the first thing out of her mouth.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.220
And I said to her that we have always been
really comfortable in our house with closing

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.070
the door and having Mom and Dad time.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.970
And my two and a half year old seems to understand
that.

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:05.379
And we haven't really told him that we're
having sex or anything, but that's our time.

00:32:05.379 --> 00:32:07.259
And eventually, we figure we'll tell him about
that.

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:09.799
But I'm wondering if you think that two and
a half is too young.

00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:10.799
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: No.

00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:12.429
I think bravo.

00:32:12.429 --> 00:32:15.809
I think to say to give that message.

00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:21.399
You have your time with your toys, with your
dolls, whatever at two and a half years.

00:32:21.399 --> 00:32:25.119
And Mommy and Daddy have some time for themselves.

00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:32.320
Not only that, I do suggest for parents of
young children to have, not to lock the door

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.679
because Mothers' are particularly worried,
that the door will not open.

00:32:36.679 --> 00:32:43.179
But to have a hook, because everybody can
open that hook, so that when they do have

00:32:43.179 --> 00:32:45.769
sex, that they don't have to worry.

00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:52.700
This is particularly important for women because
if a woman listens with one ear if a child

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.110
is OK, she cannot concentrate.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:33:00.369
And then very often what happens to women,
I know that in my private practice when people

00:33:00.369 --> 00:33:08.399
tell me their problems, women very often sabotage
their sexual, the orgasm, because they say

00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:10.340
to themselves, "It's not going to happen.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.309
Nevermind, it's not going to happen."

00:33:12.309 --> 00:33:17.730
If she says to herself, "It's not going to
happen," she can be sure that it won't happen.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.779
So, it's particularly important when there
are small kids.

00:33:21.779 --> 00:33:28.820
We have less premature ejaculations these
days because people have, I did a book, "Sex

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:35.549
for Dummies" and people have learned from
other people that premature ejaculation, they

00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:42.759
used to think, is that a man doesn't really
like to engage in sex, that he doesn't like

00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:47.570
women, that he doesn't want to give her the
pleasure of his company.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.570
Not so.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.230
It's a learning difficulty, easily remedied.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:57.289
So, on the one hand, the importance is to
say "that's Mommy and Daddy time," and for

00:33:57.289 --> 00:34:04.369
the woman to say, "I will have an orgasm"
even if she once in a while doesn't have one.

00:34:04.369 --> 00:34:07.150
I want to say one more thing about women.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:13.030
Women who have difficulties having orgasm,
I say use a vibrator.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:22.220
I did endorse one, only because the guy who
came up with the Erosciillator is a scientist

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:27.650
from Switzerland, who came up with the first
one with an electric toothbrush.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:28.650
That made me laugh.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:29.650
I said, "OK.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:30.840
I can."

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.990
So, women should use it, but here's a danger.

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:42.750
Not to get hooked on a vibrator because no
penis can duplicate the vibrations of a vibrator.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:48.510
So, to use it to get aroused, to get up on
that curve of sexual arousal, then to put

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:53.120
it aside and let him or herself bring an orgasm.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.740
But what you are doing with the child is perfect.

00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:02.440
Once he will ask how, he will not only ask
how did that baby get in, how is it being

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.440
born?

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.440
That's easy.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.800
A special place.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.400
And that's how you were born.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.760
But he will ask you how did it get in.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.740
And then, it's important to say, "When a Mommy
and a Daddy love each other, he places his

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.550
penis inside the vagina.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.680
It feels good.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.710
And then there is--."

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.890
Don't talk about Cesarean sections.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:29.300
But talk about "it feels good and then there
is another baby."

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.500
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Thank you.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.500
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Very good.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.670
You'll get the keychain later.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:33.860
Can I get another question?

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:38.220
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Have we heard any of these
words in Tech Talk before?

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.490
We are breaking down some walls.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:42.300
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Another keychain.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.460
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: They really should
turn the spotlights off.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.460
[laughter]

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.460
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: What?

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.460
I didn't hear.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.460
Michelle.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.820
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Oh, Karen chose
to use the kids, too, but I really want a

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.820
keychain.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.820
No.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:55.820
Quick question.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:00.870
As Googlers, a lot of us do a lot of travelling,
so any advice for "absence makes the heart

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:01.870
grow fonder" or--

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:02.870
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Yes.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.990
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: or ways to keep
things happening while you're long-distance?

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:06.580
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Fabulous question.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:12.270
Not just for young professionals, but also
for people who go to different schools, or

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.580
people who go to different graduate schools.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:22.360
And you people are very fortunate because
of all of your iPhones and because of the

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.980
computers.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:28.470
And to use it, to keep that messages going.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.040
It's very important.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:37.110
And long-distance relationships can survive,
but you both have to put some effort in it.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.830
You have to take some time out to be able
to communicate.

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:46.370
If there is no iPhone or something like this,
to get on the phone.

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:50.090
And to make a plan to talk a little bit about
sex.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:53.040
To make a plan by saying, "I'm coming home
Wednesday.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.030
I will not be too tired.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:56.490
I'll sleep on the plane.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.610
We are going to have great sex."

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:02.090
And I will tell guys, women like flowers.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:06.670
So, if she's travelling, get her some flowers
home.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:12.030
So, when she comes home, not just for Valentine's
Day, not just for her birthday, for no reason

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:16.080
whatsoever, just to say, "I'm so glad I have
you.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.210
I'm so glad we are in this relationship."

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.060
But you do have to work on it.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:26.990
And this is true for people who travel, but
it's also true for any of you professionals

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.290
who work very many hours.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:30.780
You just have to--.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:35.550
I say that to people who are attorneys, to
medical students.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:43.120
You just have to make sure that you put the
emphasis and that will--.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.180
It doesn't always have to be intercourse.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.540
It can be just caressing.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.200
Let me tell you one more thing.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.980
Let's suppose that he wants to have more sex
than you.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.580
Let's suppose you come back from the trip
and you're really not in the mood.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.590
I'll tell you a secret.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:01.900
Give him an ejaculation.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.250
It takes two minutes.

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.250
[laughter]

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:05.650
Two minutes.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:08.700
You don't have to have a sexual arousal.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.660
You don't have to have an orgasm.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.070
You don't have to have intercourse.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:21.750
And you men, if she wants to have more sex
than you do, then I tell you it doesn't have

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.840
to have an erect penis.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.840
You can use--.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.970
You can go down on her.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.220
Young people do that more than the older generation.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.900
Perform cunnilingus.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.500
You can satisfy her with your hand.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.330
You can satisfy her with a vibrator.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:44.370
Or, you can satisfy her with your big toe,
but make sure that your toe is clean.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:45.370
[laughter]

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:50.730
So, people are not Siamese twins.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:55.840
If he or she is not in the mood, they don't
have to make a big catastrophe out of it.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.800
Why are you not in the mood?

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.050
Don't you love me anymore?

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.860
Do you have somebody else?

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.240
Did you have somebody else on your trip?

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:08.760
So, there has to be that trust that this couple
is really together.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:15.980
And to satisfy each other whenever he or she
wants to have more sexual satisfaction than

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:16.980
the other one.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.180
Can I have one more?

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:22.810
I have another keychain.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:23.810
One more question.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:24.810
Bravo.

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:28.130
I need one man to get up and ask a question.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.060
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: OK.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.550
So, there's a whole bunch of us that I work
with that are just out of relationships.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.550
And--.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:36.550
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: You have what?

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:37.790
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Just out of relationships.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:38.790
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Yes.

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.380
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: And I'm just
wondering why is it that break-up sex is always

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.380
just--.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.380
Is there any--.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.380
It's just amazing.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.380
Why is there--?

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.380
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Break-up sex?

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.670
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Yeah.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:52.150
Like, you break up and then you have sex one
more time.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:53.150
[laughter]

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:56.670
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: You see?

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:00.710
That's what happened with my ten years on
radio.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:08.310
And that's what happens here, that sometimes,
I know that whoever is asking me the question

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.580
already knows what I would say.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:18.450
I would say if people break up on a very serious
note, I would say, psychologically speaking

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:22.330
and emotionally speaking, then don't have
sex that last time.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:27.220
I really don't believe in that because somebody
is getting hurt.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.980
Somebody, even if both have--.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:37.100
He ejaculates up to the ceiling and she has
an orgasm like never before, not a good idea.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:44.760
If two people have decided to move on, then
they should stick to that and move on.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:50.330
I also don't believe in hooking up for one
night.

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:52.650
I'm worried about sexually transmitted diseases.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:59.640
We will get a rise in sexually transmitted
diseases in New York because we have sex clubs

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.340
springing up all over.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.360
And people think nothing is going to happen.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.780
AIDS, you can take a medication.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:14.350
And I'm worried about that because I don't
want to see another curve up with gonorrhea

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.280
and syphilis and AIDS.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:27.250
So, I think that if people decide to break
up, make sure you make appointments with your

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.380
girlfriends, with anybody.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:37.300
Visit anybody, but have a plan of what to
do in the evenings, not to sit home and mourn.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:43.460
If you decided that this is the end, be a
little bit sad because that's human.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.470
But then, go on from there.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.330
Be that turtle who takes a risk and goes on.

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:50.140
OK, I have one more question.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.190
Then, I'll sign books.

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.190
OK.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:53.310
Hey, he gets a keychain.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:54.310
Oh yeah.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:55.860
I have one guy there and one guy--.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.820
I have two more questions.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:58.820
Yes.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.820
Three.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:03.900
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: I'm trying to reconcile
my mind what you said about keeping fantasies

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:04.900
to yourself.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:05.950
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: To what?

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:06.950
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: To yourself.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:07.950
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Yes.

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:11.990
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: A lot of fantasies
might need cooperation.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:16.740
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: I tell you that's a very important
question.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:23.430
Some people like to hear about fantasies and
they should use it because it relaxes them.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.600
They don't think about a boss.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.730
They don't think about the next day's work.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:31.730
They don't think about the pressures that
all of us are under.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:32.730
They should use it.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:39.020
I'm saying, if the fantasy is something that
the other person doesn't want to hear, then

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.410
just to use it in your own head, but to use
it.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.770
Like I told the guy from Brazil and the girl.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:50.160
Make believe that the whole soccer team is
in bed with you.

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.880
So, some people will like it and some will
not.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:59.100
That's why I said some of the books like "Men
in Love" are fantasies collected, or "Playboy

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.180
Reader," are fantasies collected.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:04.370
I don't even know if they make it up or not.

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:05.640
But they're fantasies collected.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.640
Use them.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.740
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: But there's a tension
there if you're not sharing it.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.550
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Doesn't matter.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:15.670
The not sharing, I do not believe that everything
has to be shared.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:21.600
I also don't believe that everybody should
tell their new partner about the fantastic

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.260
sex that they had with a last lover.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.770
I don't believe that people should share everything.

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:35.400
I believe that there are certain things that
should be in your heart and in your head,

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.950
don't have to be shared.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.840
One more.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.910
You come later, you get a keychain.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:41.900
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: So, a friend of
mine was wondering--

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:42.900
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Yes.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:43.900
[laughter]

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.230
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: If your partner
is really stressed out about work, what can

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.310
you do to help her out with that?

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:50.310
Just relax.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:51.310
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Say that again.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:56.350
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: If your partner
is really stressed out by something like,

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:57.350
say, work for example,--

00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:58.350
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Yes.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:00.630
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: what can you do
to help out, help her relax?

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:01.730
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Right.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:08.110
So, one of the things to do is to not right
away go into sex, but try watch a sexually

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:09.780
explicit movie.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.510
I'm all for something--.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:18.220
If you can watch a sexually explicit movie,
and together, you don't even have to watch

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.670
the whole movie, just watch the sex part--

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:21.670
[laughter]

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:23.440
and for adults.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.050
I'm not talking about children.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:26.800
I'm talking--

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.940
[laughter]

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.180
about for adult.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:30.620
And it will get you in the mood.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:37.980
What it will help is to put the pressure that
all of us have of work, of anything that's

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.810
hard, it reduces it.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:41.810
OK.

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:43.960
Can I get one more?

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.290
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: I think we're out of time.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:48.870
Oh, one more.

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:49.870
OK.

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:51.500
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: One more.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.500
[pause]

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.640
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: If someone has
chosen to be celibate, maybe not at the beginning

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.390
of the relationship, but in preparation for
marriage, which is probably the dirtiest word

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:04.450
anyone here hears about.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:10.800
In marriage, when, let's say, arousal via
pornography is not an option and when you're

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.950
still trying to maintain the intimacy of the
relationship in preparation for marriage,

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:23.490
for long-term, how does a man prepare himself
for that psychologically without necessarily

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:26.570
having to be hooked on pornography and masturbation?

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.640
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Very important.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:34.800
For Catholic people, I did two years of helping
Pre-Cana counseling.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:40.720
That's the counseling before the wedding with
an economist, the priest, and I talked about

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.720
sex.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:47.270
For Orthodox Jews, who have decided not to
be sexually active before because it doesn't

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:51.790
fit into their framework, into their values,
don't do it.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:56.110
And how to prepare for that, for example,
in the Jewish tradition, and I think that

00:45:56.110 --> 00:46:02.630
can hold true for everything, there is a prayer
that the Orthodox Jewish men tells his wife

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:03.800
every Friday night.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:09.780
It says there are many wonderful women out
there, but you, he says to his wife, you are

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.990
the very best.

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:12.800
So, that will be--.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:19.060
That's the best sentence in terms of sexual
arousal that a wife can hear.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:25.190
Whoever decides not to be sexually active
and not to look at pornography, it does not

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:26.190
matter.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:36.060
They can still read some manual of sexual
activity without it interfering with their

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.700
values and their beliefs.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:38.810
Very good question.

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:43.430
So, I'm going to go up there to sign books.

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:47.240
And I'm giving you the keychains to give out
to each one who asked a question.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.240
&gt;&gt;Michelle Baller: Yes.

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.240
Thank you guys so much for coming and thank
you, Dr. Ruth.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:49.244
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruth: Okay.
