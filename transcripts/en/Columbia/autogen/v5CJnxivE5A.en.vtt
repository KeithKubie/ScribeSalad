entered not a single primary and one not
one vote and I'm convinced that at the

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480
one vote and I'm convinced that at the
 

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.259
one vote and I'm convinced that at the
Chicago Convention because this is what

00:48:45.259 --> 00:48:45.269
Chicago Convention because this is what
 

00:48:45.269 --> 00:48:47.150
Chicago Convention because this is what
Democrats did back then they would have

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.460

nominated Bobby Kennedy and Hubert

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:49.470
nominated Bobby Kennedy and Hubert
 

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.799
nominated Bobby Kennedy and Hubert
Humphrey despite Lyndon Johnson's

00:48:51.799 --> 00:48:51.809
Humphrey despite Lyndon Johnson's
 

00:48:51.809 --> 00:48:53.930
Humphrey despite Lyndon Johnson's
protestations or maybe just the stick at

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:53.940
protestations or maybe just the stick at
 

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.339
protestations or maybe just the stick at
the Lyndon Johnson because I think he

00:48:55.339 --> 00:48:55.349
the Lyndon Johnson because I think he
 

00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:57.650
the Lyndon Johnson because I think he
was tired of being his vice president he

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:57.660
was tired of being his vice president he
 

00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.539
was tired of being his vice president he
would have been on the ticket with Bobby

00:48:59.539 --> 00:48:59.549
would have been on the ticket with Bobby
 

00:48:59.549 --> 00:49:02.690
would have been on the ticket with Bobby
and that had you had a ticket that was

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.539
Bobby Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey going
up against richard nixon without the

up against richard nixon without the
 

00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:12.230
up against richard nixon without the
taint of riots in chicago you will

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240
taint of riots in chicago you will
 

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.970
taint of riots in chicago you will
remember that Hubert Humphrey came

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:13.980
remember that Hubert Humphrey came
 

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.829
remember that Hubert Humphrey came
within a whisker of beating Richard

00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839
within a whisker of beating Richard
 

00:49:15.839 --> 00:49:18.049
within a whisker of beating Richard
Nixon and you will also remember that

00:49:18.049 --> 00:49:18.059
Nixon and you will also remember that
 

00:49:18.059 --> 00:49:21.259
Nixon and you will also remember that
there was nobody in America in 1968 who

00:49:21.259 --> 00:49:21.269
there was nobody in America in 1968 who
 

00:49:21.269 --> 00:49:23.059
there was nobody in America in 1968 who
understood Richard Nixon's

00:49:23.059 --> 00:49:23.069
understood Richard Nixon's
 

00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:25.130
understood Richard Nixon's
vulnerabilities better than the guy who

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.140
vulnerabilities better than the guy who
 

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.319
vulnerabilities better than the guy who
had run his brothers successful campaign

00:49:27.319 --> 00:49:27.329
had run his brothers successful campaign
 

00:49:27.329 --> 00:49:29.599
had run his brothers successful campaign
eight years before against richard nixon

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:29.609
eight years before against richard nixon
 

00:49:29.609 --> 00:49:32.450
eight years before against richard nixon
and in his memoirs Nixon says that he

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.460
and in his memoirs Nixon says that he
 

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.849
and in his memoirs Nixon says that he
expected and feared that his opponent

00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859
expected and feared that his opponent
 

00:49:34.859 --> 00:49:37.130
expected and feared that his opponent
would be Bobby Kennedy so I think not

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140
would be Bobby Kennedy so I think not
 

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.749
would be Bobby Kennedy so I think not
just that Bobby Kennedy would have won

00:49:38.749 --> 00:49:38.759
just that Bobby Kennedy would have won
 

00:49:38.759 --> 00:49:40.519
just that Bobby Kennedy would have won
but he would have won with a kind of

00:49:40.519 --> 00:49:40.529
but he would have won with a kind of
 

00:49:40.529 --> 00:49:42.740
but he would have won with a kind of
coalition we talked about earlier of

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:42.750
coalition we talked about earlier of
 

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:45.079
coalition we talked about earlier of
whites and minorities and liberals and

00:49:45.079 --> 00:49:45.089
whites and minorities and liberals and
 

00:49:45.089 --> 00:49:48.769
whites and minorities and liberals and
conservatives and the least stretch of

00:49:48.769 --> 00:49:48.779
conservatives and the least stretch of
 

00:49:48.779 --> 00:49:51.109
conservatives and the least stretch of
all would have been that America would

00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119
all would have been that America would
 

00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:53.269
all would have been that America would
have been a very different place not

00:49:53.269 --> 00:49:53.279
have been a very different place not
 

00:49:53.279 --> 00:49:56.779
have been a very different place not
just in 1968 but 50 years later if we

00:49:56.779 --> 00:49:56.789
just in 1968 but 50 years later if we
 

00:49:56.789 --> 00:49:59.480
just in 1968 but 50 years later if we
had dealt with issues like racial

00:49:59.480 --> 00:49:59.490
had dealt with issues like racial
 

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:02.269
had dealt with issues like racial
intolerance 50 years before and hadn't

00:50:02.269 --> 00:50:02.279
intolerance 50 years before and hadn't
 

00:50:02.279 --> 00:50:06.289
intolerance 50 years before and hadn't
let them simmer for another 50 years and

00:50:06.289 --> 00:50:06.299
let them simmer for another 50 years and
 

00:50:06.299 --> 00:50:08.839
let them simmer for another 50 years and
it just it makes me when I think back

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:08.849
it just it makes me when I think back
 

00:50:08.849 --> 00:50:11.450
