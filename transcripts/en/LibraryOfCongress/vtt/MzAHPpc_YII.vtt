00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.360
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Schadl: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.650
to the Library of Congress --
oh my gosh, that's so loud.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.770
I have the privilege of
working with a tremendous team

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.910
of librarians in the Hispanic
Division, who work to improve

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.030
at best the diverse publications
written in Spanish, Portuguese,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.620
English and many indigenous
languages of the Americas.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.750
It is our collective honor
to welcome Mexican writer --

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.660
not just novelist,
Cristina Rivera Garza

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.630
and translators Suzanne
Jill Levine and Aviva Kana,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.500
and our moderator Manuel --

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.800
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: Cuellar.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.100
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Schadl: Cuellar.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.260
I wanted to do that in
Portuguese, I'm sorry.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.140
To discuss "The Taiga Syndrome",

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.520
the 2018 English
language translation

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.520
of Cristina Rivera Garza's
"El mal de la Taiga".

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.840
For the librarians in the
room this has nothing to do

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.660
with the Taiga Forum --

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.460
other than the reference
to far reaches.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.710
It is important to
me to use this moment

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.690
to acknowledge Catalina
Gomez who is our curator

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.520
of the archive of Hispanic
literature on tape,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.270
and the Hispanic Division
as well as Anya Creightney

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.220
and Rob Casper from the
Poetry and Literature Center-

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.480
And I just learned from Rob
that we have a connection

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.860
through the Huntington
endowment,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.440
so thanks for that information.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.840
Along with the Mexican
Cultural Institute

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.910
on the Dorothy Project,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.760
these three individuals
have led efforts

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.380
to make this event possible,
of course, with our panelists.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.680
Before I pass the microphone --

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.090
because we'd like to
pass the microphones

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.220
in these formal events, to
Anya Creightney program manager

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.490
and the Poetry and
Literature Center,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.830
I'd like to share a
quote and a reference

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.960
to another work authored
by Cristina Rivera Garza.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.520
It's called "The
Unusual Manifesto".

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.390
"Writing is a community-making
practice.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.160
If we write, we write
with others, inescapably.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.570
If we write, we write about
others, even when we write

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.550
about ourselves in small
diaries that remain hidden

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.020
and locked in drawers.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.520
Constantly borrowing from the
language we share, with entire

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.050
and varied communities at once.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.890
When we write, we acquire
debt, a real material debt,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.670
with the practitioners
of such languages.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.310
It is an immense debt.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.450
The same could be said
about library work,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.130
and its likely translation.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.150
It is a community
making practice,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.550
which we do with others,
describing and sharing writing,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.580
always borrowing and
continually building

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.730
on an already enormous debt".

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.530
Thank you all for being part of
this community today and know

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.980
that you are welcome in
the Hispanic Division.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.270
We'd love to tell you
more about what we do.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.510
And with that, I will
pass the mic to Anya.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.860
[ Applause ]

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.160
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Thanks, Suzanne.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.130
We're thrilled to join forces
with this, but I just have

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.620
to say, this podium
is severe [laughter].

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.080
I can see just heads here.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.530
Anyway, we're thrilled
to join forces

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.910
with the Hispanic Division.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.290
It's a pleasure to
build such valuable work

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.970
with such committed and talented
colleagues, it's a real thrill.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.900
As Suzanne mentioned, my
name is Anya Creightney,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.720
I'm the program's manager at the
Poetry and Literature Center,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.830
rather, which is
housed just upstairs.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.680
Our lovely guests
here worked there

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.470
in that space earlier today,
and our center is charged

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.040
with highlighting the ongoing

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.400
and sustained value
of poetry and prose.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.340
We're an important charge.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.140
We celebrate all things literary
through public readings,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.880
such as this one, lectures,
symposia, festivals,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.330
along with a bevy
of online features,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.910
most prominently the archive of
recorded poetry and literature,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.170
which is sort of a
twin to the archive

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.970
that Suzanne just mentioned.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.150
We're also the home of
the US poet laureate.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.050
You may know this years'
laureate, Ms. Tracy K. Smith,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.940
who is now on her second term,

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.490
and we just land
there's a connection.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.220
Cristina has translated a
poem of Tracy's from "Life

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.450
on Mars" so, we're in
good company today.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.490
This year Tracy is holding
reading and listening sessions

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.270
in rural communities
all over the country,

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.030
as part of her project
"American Conversations".

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.710
She's also just launched
a podcast in association

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.890
with the Minnesota Public Radio
and American Public Media,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.920
titled "The Slowdown"
so, we encourage you

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.770
to please take a listen.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.610
And of course, I've just
scratched the surface

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.770
of our center's offerings
rather so, please come back.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.610
Come tomorrow to our events
and take a look online.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.610
We're reachable at
loc.gov/poetry,

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.650
and you can also add your name
to the signup sheet by the door.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.450
And I just want to say what
a thrill is to work, again,

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.750
with our colleagues here.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.350
It's a deep pleasure for us to
honor writing and translation.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.120
We feel strongly about it
and so, without further ado,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.760
I want to hand it over to
my dear friend Catalina,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.310
who is going to talk a
little bit about the flow

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.230
of the even today, and also
introduce our lovely guests.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.030
Catalina.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.960
[ Applause ]

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.260
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez:
Thank you, Anya.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.560
Thank you, Suzanne.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.860
We're just also --
I want to say I'm

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.320
so thrilled that Suzanne's here.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.310
This is our second week as a
chief of the Hispanic Division

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.580
and we are just very excited
to welcome her to the library.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.940
So, I'm Catalina Gomez, I'm
a reference librarian here

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.520
at the Hispanic Division.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.910
I just want to say
that this event,

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.910
it was really cool
how it came about,

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.810
because Cristina was
actually doing research

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.730
in our reading room
here, I think for one

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.440
of her upcoming books.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.970
Okay. And I was on my reference
duty and I saw her and I'm like,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.740
"oh, you're Cristina
Rivera Garza.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.750
We should do an event
with you here".

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.730
And it was a lot of fun and
we also love the division

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.030
to celebrate translation.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.480
And we piled during the
Taiga Syndrome was going

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.410
to be published this year.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.300
So, we thought it was
a perfect opportunity

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.970
to celebrate this book.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.050
This is one of three events
that Cristina is doing

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.710
in Washington this week.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.280
Tomorrow she has a lecture at
the Mexican Cultural Institute,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.660
at 6:45p.m. It's actually going
to be in Spanish and it's going

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.660
to be about writing in
Spanish in the United States.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.560
And this Friday October 19th
at 03:00p.m, at the University

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.210
of Maryland College Park she'll
be giving another lecture titled

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.140
"José Emilio Pacheco, our
great dissappropriationist".

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.440
For more information, check

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.950
out the Mexican Cultural
Institute's website

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.060
at www.instituteofmexicodc.org.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.820
So, before we move
on to the program,

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:51.880
I just have some housekeeping
items and announcements.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.270
If you all could please silence
your cellphones and we also want

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.580
to let you know that
we're filming the event,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.160
so if you participate in the
Q&amp;A session of the program,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.480
you're giving the Library
of Congress permission

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.200
to have your voice on the video.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.420
I also want to briefly announce
that Cristina is reporting

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.490
for our archive on
Hispanic literature on tape,

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.200
was recently made
available online.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.540
Every September the Hispanic
Division releases 52 recordings

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.840
of this collection
for online streaming,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.930
and this year's batch includes
Cristina's 2015 recording,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.230
where she's actually reading

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.720
from the book we're
here to celebrate.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.790
For those of you who don't
know about this archive,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.240
it's a 75-year-old project that
we curate here at the library.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.750
Consists of close to
800 audio recordings

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.550
of Luso-Hispanic poets

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.850
and writers reading
from their works.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.650
It's passed 32 countries
and more than ten languages.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.010
And we have recordings
with figures like Borges,

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.290
Gabriel Garcia Marquez,
Juan Rulfo,

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.500
Gabriela Mistral and many more.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.380
We have a flyer about the
project, and again, so,

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.870
whoever's interested,
you can find out more.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.360
And now on to the program.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.670
That will consist of two
sections, a bilingual reading

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.970
where Cristina will be --

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.250
from the Spanish edition
of today's celebrated book

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.000
"El mal de la Taiga",
which was published

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.380
by Tusquets Mexico in 2013.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.940
And then translators
Suzanne Jill Levine

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.670
and Aviva Kana will
read excerpts

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.480
from the English translation,
which was published this year

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.910
by the Dorothy Project.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.230
The second portion will be a
conversation between Cristina,

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.700
Suzanne -- Suzanne
Jill and Aviva,

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.140
moderated by Manuel Cuellar

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.120
from the George Washington
University.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.400
Cristina Rivera Garza
was born in Matamoros,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.030
Tamaulipas, Mexico in 1964.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.740
She's the author of six
novels, three collections

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.560
of short stories, five
collections of poetry

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.490
and three non-fiction books.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.280
Her books have been translated
to multiple languages,

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.660
including English, French,
Italian, Portuguese and Korean.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.800
She has a PhD from the
University of Houston,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.590
at her dissertation from
the departure point for both

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.130
"Nadie me verá llorar", one
of her most golden novels,

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.740
and the historical non-fiction
book "La Castañeda",

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.840

and cultural studies,
with an emphasis

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.470
on race, gender and sexuality.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.940
His current book
manuscript "Assemblages

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.480
of a festive nation,
queer embodiments

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.790
and dancing histories of
Mexico" studies dancing bodies

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.530
and public spaces, in order to
privilege movement as a means

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.690
to examine questions
of citizen formation

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.500
and national belonging.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.510
Please join me in
welcoming our participants.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:13.860
[ Applause ]

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.160
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza: Hello.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.460
Hello, everybody.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.010
This has been already a great
great day, great touching.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:24.680
I'm very grateful for
your generous welcoming

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.570
to this institution, to this
place that I really adore.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.460
I spend many, many hours
in the research here.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.660
And as Catalina was saying,
this, my forthcoming book,

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.980
is very much based on research
that I've conducted right here

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.440
in the documents of
this institution.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.820
So, I feel absolutely privileged
and lucky to be here with all

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:54.670
of you, with the generous
people in Mexican Institute,

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.530
professors from the
University of Maryland,

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:01.540
and these two wonderful
translators I just adore,

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.560
Jill and Aviva, and we'll talk

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.560
about the whole process
in a little bit.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.560
What I want to do right
now, I'm going to read

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.400
in Spanish a section on the
first book of these novel,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:18.670
and a section also of the
seventh chapter of this novel.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:23.560
They're not very long
chapters, and then Aviva

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.410
and Jill will be reading the
translation into English,

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.050
and then we'll get to
the conversation, okay?

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:37.130
"Lo mismo, que habían
vivido ahí, me dijeron.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.430
Que esa era la casa,

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.800
y la señalaban con una especie
de timidez que bien podía

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.750
confundirse con el
respeto o con el terror.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.190
Sus dedos apenas lograban
asomarse por las bocamangas de

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.920
unos abrigos pesados y negros.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.210
El olor a carbón bajo sus
brazos, las uñas sucias,

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.660
esos labios tan resecos.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:04.950
Sus pupilas, que se movían
con discreción hacia el objeto

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.960
señalado, no tardaban en
regresar a su punto de partida,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.260
la mirada frontal.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.620
¿Qué buscaba ahí en realidad?

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.590
Eso era lo que me preguntaban
sin atreverse a preguntar.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:20.200
Y yo, que tampoco lo
sabía con exactitud,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.120
acoplaba mis pasos a los suyos.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:28.080
Y los seguía de regreso a
la comarca entre la nieve.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.420
No era una casa.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.180
Eso habría que decirlo
desde ahora.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.800
Yo hubiera descrito lo que vi
esa mañana de inicios de otoño

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.640
como una cabaña, tal vez menos.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.240
Una casucha.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.190
Era, en todo caso,

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.920
una estructura habitacional
hecha de tablas de madera y

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.950
pedazos de cartón, y
abundantes ramas secas.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.460
Tenía un techo, en
efecto, de dos aguas,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.880
y un par de ventanas
que a falta de vidrio,

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.930
recubrían con un plástico
grueso y transparente.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.320
Tenía el aire de ser
un último refugio.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.960
Daba la impresión de que
más allá solo quedaban la

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:12.380
intemperie y la ley de la
intemperie y el cielo, muy azul,

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.060
tan alto, sobre la intemperie.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.970
Recuerdo el frío.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.390
Recuerdo el frío sobre todo.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.380
Recuerdo las mandíbulas
apartadas,

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:27.800
los puños dentro
de los bolsillos.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.630
Habían llegado ahí según mis
datos a inicios del invierno.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.620
Lo había colegido así porque
la última comunicación que

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.670
emitieron había salido de una
oficina de telégrafos de un

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.210
poblado fronterizo, que
quedaba a unos 200 kilómetros

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.620
de distancia.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.670
El telegrama, dirigido al hombre
que me había encargado la

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.630
investigación, afirmaba
escueta,

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:53.550
pero solo indirectamente, que
no pensaban regresar jamás.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:58.580
Cuando decimos adiós, ¿qué
es lo que saludamos en realidad?

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.070
Tomé el caso porque siempre he
sentido una debilidad achacosa

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.120
por formas de escritura
que ya están en desuso.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.670
El radiograma, la
taquigrafía, los telegramas.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:13.060
Fue cosa de tocar el papel
amarillento y empezar a soñar.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.300
Las yemas de los dedos sobre
las arrugas de la hoja,

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.640
el olor a viejo, algo guardado.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.940
¿A quién se le hubiera
ocurrido hacer algo así?

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.240
A esos dos, por supuesto.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.170
De entre todos, solo
a ellos dos.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.880
¿Desde qué lugar tan
lejano en el espacio,

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.520
tan lejano en el tiempo
había partido este puñado

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.820
de mayúsculas?

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.920
Y, sobre todo, ¿qué
habían saludado en realidad?

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.230
¿Qué cosa o cosas habían
aceptado en sus vidas?

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.220
Quise saber eso desde el inicio.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.520
Quise entender.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.850
Recuerdo el lobo.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:57.220
Vi, en efecto, un lobo
enorme y gris sobre la nieve.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.110
Vi sus fauces abiertas,
sus ojos, sus garras.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:04.470
Vi el hilo rojo que partía de
su huella y se deslizaba luego

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.250
entre la nieve, hasta enredarse
en el tronco del abeto.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.600
Vi el abeto, majestuoso.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.440
Trepaba entonces, el hilo
rojo por sus ramas compas,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.390
por sus perennes hojas
aciculares hasta alcanzar en lo

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.190
alto las ramas verdes
de otra conífera.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.770
Fue por eso que observé
el cielo, gris, también.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.000
Repleto de gruesas
nubes abigarradas.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.430
¿Cuál gris?

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:35.170
El gris de diez minutos antes
de la tormenta, naturalmente.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.620
No oía, no podía
escuchar nada,

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.000
pero vi cómo el lobo
se preparaba para saltar

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.300
sobre algo.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.670
Vi como la saliva, sus
dientes, sus labios".

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.850
I'm jumping to chapter seven.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:58.880
"Algo de su lengua
en mi lengua".

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.840
"Que todo esto ocurría
a inicios de otoño,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.100
haría falta aclararlo,
por ejemplo.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.210
Que el viento entre
los cabellos,

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.990
gélido ya, o aproximándose.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.730
Que la alberca, la curiosidad
que producía o el terror.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:20.290
Una alberca en medio del
bosque y a través de la bruma,

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.540
¿qué cosa en realidad era eso?

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.900
Todas estas imágenes y luego el
largo trayecto hacia todas esas

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.030
imágenes que se llevó
a cabo, en efecto,

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:34.010
durante los últimos días del
verano que ya se convertían

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:38.670
poco a poco primero y de
súbito después en el otoño.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.650
Antes, compré los boletos de
avión, los boletos de tren,

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:46.130
los boletos de barco o barcaza.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.730
Hice reservaciones
de hotel, de hostal,

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.240
de cuartos pequeños cuando fue
posible hacerlo desde lejos,

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.930
electrónicamente.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.790
Contacté amigos, que a su vez
se pusieron en contacto con

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:02.090
amigos, que poco a poco me
fueron aproximando a la tarea.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.810
Hacía falta, como siempre
hace falta, un traductor,

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:10.460
un informante, y
mucho antes de llegar,

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.890
mucho antes de partir incluso,

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:17.780
tenía ya entre mis contactos
al hablante de su lengua que se

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:22.360
encargaría de ponerlo
todo en mi lengua.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.470
Recuerdo las muchas frases
que repetí esa frase.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:30.450
El hablante de su lengua que se
encargaría de ponerlo todo en

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.750
mi lengua.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.890
La sonrisa que no la risa.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.110
El gesto de intriga
o de desconsuelo.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:41.770
El suspiro o esto, esta
otra cosa más serena.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:46.960
En el informe que le escribiría
al hombre que había tenido dos

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.770
esposas, le pediría que tomara
en cuenta que nada de lo escrito

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.120
habría ocurrido tal cual.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.270
Nada de lo escrito
ocurre nunca tal cual.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.630
Repetiría eso o algo parecido.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.680
Le pediría, de una cierta
manera cuidadosa y elegante --

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.940
asumiendo que él
estaría al tanto,

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.610
pero sabiendo también que
este tipo de cosas pasan

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.870
desapercibidas casi siempre.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:16.990
Que tomar en cuenta que había
mucho tiempo entre alocución

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.670
y alocución.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.150
'Deténgase', le pediría.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.580
'Lea, como si hubiera muchos
minutos, incluso algunas horas,

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.350
entre las palabras
pronunciadas primero,

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.300
y luego las palabras escritas,
transcritas, las frases'.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:39.680
Le diría, por ejemplo, que
cuando yo escribiera -- cito,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.060
'les pregunté si tenían
electricidad y ellos me

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.340
respondieron mostrándome
una vela encendida'.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.220
Debía considerar que la
pregunta la había enunciado yo,

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.060
en efecto, pero que antes
de recibir la respuesta,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.360
que tardó en llegar,

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.870
el traductor tuvo que hacerme
repetir la pregunta un par de

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:02.000
veces, y luego tuvo que
enunciarla él también un par

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.420
de veces, hasta que los
habitantes de la comarca de la

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.090
última Taiga pudieron
entenderla,

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.140
y a su vez, contestarla.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.880
Y luego, hubimos de esperar.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:18.120
El traductor, los habitantes,
yo misma, a que la acción --

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.160
el hecho de mostrar
la vela encendida,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.120
y el hecho de pronunciar a la
vez las palabras 'no tenemos

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.740
electricidad' pasara por el
entendimiento y luego por la

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.380
sorpresa, y finalmente
por la incredulidad.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.480
Recuerdo la imagen del abismo.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.260
Recuerdo, sobre todo,

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.000
las palabras 'fin del
mundo', todas juntas.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.610
Las muchas imágenes
de mi propia ciudad,

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.960
ese sitio lleno de
espacios oscuros que había,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.510
yo diría, dejado atrás.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.730
El traductor me esperó en el
aeropuerto de la última ciudad

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.930
grande que visitaron antes de
internarse en los pequeños

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.790
poblados de la Taiga.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.130
De ahí, de esa ciudad
fronteriza,

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:09.380
había salido el telegrama,
'nunca tan cerca lo lejos'.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.710
Supuse que ellos habían
aterrizado en el mismo

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.360
aeropuerto y que abrochándose
el abrigo y enredándose la

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.700
bufanda en el cuello se habrían
dado algo de tiempo para mirar

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.140
el cielo".

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.560
"Nunca supe si eso
fue alguna vez cierto.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.030
Nunca tuve idea de cuánto
tiempo les llevó conseguir el

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.750
chofer que los llevó,
¿a dónde?

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:33.130
Supuse que habrían dormido
ahí en esa ciudad de 200.000

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.740
habitantes, donde
se extrae petróleo,

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.040
pero no estaba segura de nada.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.380
Lo único, de lo único
que sí tenía evidencia,

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:46.330
era que de esa ciudad había
partido un telegrama lleno

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:47.870
de mayúsculas.

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:52.280
Un telegrama y una
carta, también.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.560
Una carta muy breve, escrita
a lápiz por una mano que se

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.060
presentía entumida o cansada.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:04.250
Jamás lo lejos arremetió
tan cerca.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.510
Las variaciones continuaban".

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:25.030
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: "'The thing that
lived there', they told me,

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.250
'in that house, there'.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.520
And they pointed it out
with an apprehension

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.530
that could easily be
mistaken for respect or fear.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.980
Their fingers barely
peeked out from the cuffs

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.910
of their heavy black coats.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:43.980
The smell of ash under their
arms, dirty nails, dry lips.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.470
Their eyes, having
discreetly moved towards

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.840
where they were pointing,
quickly returned

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.600
to their original position,
gazing straight ahead.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.340
'What are you really
looking for?'

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.680
They asked, without
daring to say so.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.100
And I, who didn't exactly
know, followed their steps

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.880
like a shadow, back
to the village

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.220
over snow-covered trails.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.230
It wasn't really a
house, I should say first.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.600
I would have described
what I saw on that morning

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.480
at the beginning of autumn
as a shack, maybe not even.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.240
A hobble. In any case, it was
a habitable structure made

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.630
from wood, cardboard and
lots of dry branches.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.920
It did have a roof,
a ridged roof,

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.050
and a pair of windows
covered in thick,

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.860
transparent plastic
instead of glass.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.540
It had the air of a last refuge.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.090
It gave the impression that
beyond was only open space

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.950
and the law of the
wilderness, and the sky so blue,

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.650
so high above the wild.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.250
I remember the cold.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.580
Above all, I remember the cold.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:49.460
I remember my clenched jaw,
fists deep in my coat pockets.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.640
They had arrived there
according to my information,

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.100
at the beginning of winter.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.340
I had come to that conclusion

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.680
because their last communication
came from a telegram office

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.000
in a border town about
200 kilometers away.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.330
The telegram, addressed to
the man who had hired me

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.880
to investigate the
case, said briefly --

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.000
and somewhat obliquely that
they were never coming back.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.990
What are we letting in
when we say goodbye?

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.870
I took the case because I have
always had an all-consuming

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.840
weakness for forms of
writing no longer in use.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.800
Radiograms, stenography,
telegrams.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.100
As soon as I placed my hands

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.780
on the faded paper,
I began to dream.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.540
The tips of my fingers skimmed
the creases of the paper,

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.950
the stale smell of
age, something hidden.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.090
Who would set out
on such a journey?

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.090
Bad men, of course.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.860
Out of everyone, only those two.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.160
From what place?

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.430
So far away in space,
so far away in time.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.100
Have his fistful of
capital letters, then sent.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.490
And what were the two
of them hoping for?

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.690
What have they led
into their lives?

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.820
That was what I wanted
to know, from the start.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:58.380
That was what I wanted
to understand.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.640
I remember the wolf, I
saw him, an enormous wolf.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.000
Grey against the snow, his
jaw open, his eyes, his paws.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.100
I saw the red thread that
extended from his tracks,

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.070
and slither to the snow before
momentarily getting lost

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.910
in the trunk of a far tree.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.480
I saw the fur, so majestic.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.530
Then inclined, the red thread,
through the warped branches,

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.440
through the evergreen
pine needles until high

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.550
above it reached the green
branches of another conifer.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.470
That was what made me look
up at the sky, also gray,

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.790
filled with thick,
jumbled clouds.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.320
What shade of grey?

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.570
Ten minutes before
storm grey, of course.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.140
I didn't hear anything,
couldn't hear anything,

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.200
but I saw that the wolf
was preparing to pounce.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.930
I saw his saliva, teeth, lips."

&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
"Tongue to tongue".

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.460
"Among other things, I
should explain that all

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.050
of this occurred at the
beginning of autumn.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.990
That the wind blowing my hair
was icy, nearly freezing.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.520
That the pool caused
curiosity -- or terror.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.190
A pool in the middle
of the forest

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.600
through the mist,
how could this be?

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.060
All these images in the long
journey toward these images

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.500
ended, essentially, during
the last days of summer.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.210
Already returning
little by little --

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.950
at first, then all
at once into autumn.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.490
Before I had bought the plane
tickets, the train tickets,

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.420
the passage for the barge.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.470
Whenever it was possible from
far away, electronically,

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.240
I had made reservations
at hotels

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.730
and hostels for single rooms.

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.540
I contacted friends who put me
in contact with their friends,

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.630
who little by little brought
me close to the tidal.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.140
It was necessary, as
it is always necessary,

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.990
to find a translator, a guide.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:56.980
So, long before I arrived and
even longer before I left,

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.000
I had among my contacts a
speaker of their tongue,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.480
who would just transmit
everything into my tongue.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.690
I remember how many times
I repeated the same phrase,

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.070
tongue to tongue, at the
speaker of their tongue

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.370
who would translate
everything into my tongue.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:15.820
A smile, know, a laugh, a
look of intrigue or distress,

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.290
a sigh or something more serene.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:22.350
In the report I would --
" should I continue this?

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.650

for the man who had two wives.

I would ask him to
take into account

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.620
that nothing had happened
exactly as I claimed.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.790
I would tell him that nothing
happens as it is written.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:39.220
I would constantly repeat
this, or something like it.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.550
I would ask him in a
careful and tactful way,

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.160
assuming that he knew but
realizing also that these types

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.830
of things are as hard to bear
in mind, to take into account

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.480
that there is a great distance
between speech and writing.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.460
'Take your time',
I would remind him.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.370
Read as if there
are many minutes,

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.560
even hours before
the word spoken

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.390
and the ones written down.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.950
'Transcribe, the phrases'.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.920
I would tell him, for example,
when I wrote, 'I asked them

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.190
if they had electricity,
and they responded

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.050
by showing me a lit candle'.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.310
That he should realize I had, in
fact, pronounced that question,

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.290
but before I received the
answer, which came much later,

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:19.440
the translator had made me
repeat the question several

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.070
times, and then had said
it several times himself

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.720
until the inhabitants
of the village

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.920
in the Taiga could
understand it and answer.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.440
And then we had to wait,
translator, inhabitants, myself,

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.270
until the action
showing the candle

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.530
in articulate words 'we don't
have electricity' was heard

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.420
and understood first
with surprise

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.510
and then finally, disbelief."

of translation

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.890
and translating women out
first, I was captivated by how,

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:17.570
Cristina, you engaged issues of
gender, writing, sexual labor,

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.750
constructive capitalism,
and ways of --

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.760
this is something I'm obsessed
with, ways of relating others

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.630
and relating to others.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.330
conceived this project?

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.040
Just to get us started.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.170
In other words, what
inspired you?

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:47.250
What led you to the Taiga?

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.550
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera
Garza: The Taiga is

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.850
such a faraway place, huh?

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:53.390
At least if we take into
consideration our position

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.880
in the globe right now.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.800
I was thinking more
and more about scape.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.130
And one of the challenges
that I wanted to go through

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:08.720
and I wanted to take
leaders with me,

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.880
was about how far away I could
get, in terms of the writing,

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.180
in terms of telling the story,

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.920
in terms of telling
a story of escape.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:23.060
How far away I could
get with my readers, so,

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:28.380
at what point the story
might become unintelligible?

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:33.840
So, the challenge for me was
to move away as much as I could

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.510
from known, familiar
territory, and I was going

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.950
to approach places, languages,

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.780
landscapes as alien
to me as possible.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.650
And I wanted to use language
that was able to embody

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:54.410
that strangeness, while
keeping my reader still with me,

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:58.650
while creating a
sense of strange,

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.260
unique familiarity between us.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.270
I suppose that was
the main issue.

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:10.690
And I was living in
Mexico by then --

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:13.870
or most of the writing I
think, I lived in Mexico.

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.900
So, I guess the more faraway
place that I could think

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.520
of was the Taiga for, again,

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.260
mostly the winter,
that kind of winter.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.880
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: I'm going
to ask you one more question

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.820
and then I'll get to
our translators then.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:33.860
This is, as you've heard,
multi-sensorial creative work.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:39.120
I think it really transcends
the written work, and if we look

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.630
at the different versions
of the translation

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.630
of the original work, the
original comes with drawings

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:49.080
by Carlos Maiques, and it
really enhances the sort

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.800
of atmosphere Cristina's
trying to capture.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.930
But also, both editions come
with that so, just a playlist.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:57.480
And I wanted her to know --
I was explaining this morning

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.200
for my students -- yes, what
they were thinking about this.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.730
I wanted to find out
whether you could comment

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.030
on this creative process.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.620
Do you think of the list first?

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.500
Because it really enhances
that sense of eeriness

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.000
that you certainly heard, right?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.680
Did you think of it at the end,
or while you were writing it?

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.980
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera
Garza: Yes, thank you.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.280
Thank you for those questions.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.900
And yes, in fact, the original
version in Spanish comes

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.650
with some eerie drawings
that I really loved.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.200
And then I kind of
decided not to include

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.150
that in the English version,

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:37.410
but perhaps in the second
edition we might be able

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.710
to include them.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:41.640
I'm just annunciating
that right now.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.940
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: We
try to convince them, right?

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.970
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza: We
did, we did our best, yes.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:46.630
That's what was for.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.190
But let me see, I'm the
kind of writer who has

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:53.800
to be annunciating the
words that I'm writing

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.560
as I'm writing so, every time
that I'm writing in a room,

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.420
it sounds as there's a
conversation going on,

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:07.090
because I'm actually enunciating
out loud every single word.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:12.820
And I think the reason why
I've been doing that is

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.480
because I want the words
to go through my body,

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.920
and I want to measure my
breathing pattern and try

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.820
to accommodate, to
fit all those words

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.300
within my own breathing pattern.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.760
So, if I write a sentence that
is too long or too convoluted

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.590
and I'm not able to pronounce
that in a way that is pleasing

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.020
to my ear at that point
well, that sentence has

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.210
to go, obviously, right?

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:42.420
And so, I do that and because
of that I've gotten very used

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:47.140
to my own, very at ease with
my own breathing patterns.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.860
And when I was writing this
book, and as I told you earlier,

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.500
I wanted to go through this
experience of unfamiliarity

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.540
and I wanted to take the reader
to these other faraway places

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.020
in terms of the landscape and
in terms of the writing as such,

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.160
this election of the writing and
the rhythm of the sentences and,

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.280
you know, the use of punctuation
signs and things like that.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.340
So, what I said from the
beginning I need to interrupt,

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.830
I need to interfere my
own breathing patterns

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.330
with something else.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:19.890
And so, I look for some of these
songs and some of these pieces

00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:25.120
and some of them have words
in them and stories in them.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.110
But many of those are
just instrumental.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:33.840
Some of those are a
collection of electronic music,

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.410
contemporary music, some
music from the area as well.

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:45.200
And I used to play them as I
was writing these different

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.310
chapters, and I wanted to
pay very close attention

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:51.860
to their own rhythms and
the sounds and the words,

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:57.120
and I wanted to have these
external elements interfering

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.270
with my own breathing patterns.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:04.990
So, if I wanted to embody
that sense of unfamiliarity,

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:10.990
of being in a foreign territory,
I assumed that by doing

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:16.510
that I was also placing myself
in the writing process as such

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:19.920
in that foreign territory
as well.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.680
But I think the songs
are really good too,

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.950
and some of the videos
are actually quite good.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.910
And so, there was
also that connection

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:29.040
between what I was
imagining and the kind

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:34.190
of landscape I was trying
to convey in this piece.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.490
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: Wonderful.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.150
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
You actually translated one

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:41.260
of the titles, because
the ritual reality,

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.140
was ritual virtuality.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.440
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera
Garza: Is that right?

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.740
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: Yes, and
I thought that was interesting

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.950
that you unconsciously did that.

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.610
I, myself, feel very
irresponsible

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:52.910
because I didn't listen to these

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.480
until after I translated
[laughter].

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.930
I know, because I know.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.060
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza: The
second edition [laughter].

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.960
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: I
mean, that's what we have

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.410
to do, a second edition.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:08.140
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: I actually
wanted you to share with us

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.130
and the audience
a little bit more

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.870
about the process
of translating.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.690
How do you decide to
translate this novel?

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:18.520
And part of the question
has to do with the political

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.750
and ethical states of
translating from Spanish

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:24.080
to English, and also
questions of the market,

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.310
since we'll be talking
about the editor,

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.210
whether it include the
drawings, etcetera, right?

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.910
And how that shaped your
ability to translate

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:32.960
and publish these
creative works.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.320
And I'm thinking specifically
of this Dorothy Project,

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.730
the publisher who
focuses on women writers.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.720
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: Yes,
they are wonderful small press.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.030
They've done Nails
Inc., for example.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:44.660
They choose very -- oh.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.800
They choose their
writers very carefully.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.100
Oh, now it's on.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.560
They choose their
writers very carefully.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.990
Does that make a difference?

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.290
I'm pretty loud anyway.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:58.900
Okay, maybe that's a
better one here, well.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:02.160
Oh [laugher].

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.260
Well, you heard me
anyway, I said, yes.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:09.820
So, it's a very wonderful small
press, and I mean, just thinking

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.290
about small presses --
I'm just jumping in here.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:17.350
They really amazingly survived

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:20.210
and have proliferated
despite the market place being

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:21.510
so challenging.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.750
So, it's something
really to admire.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.580
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: Oh, I was
just going to jump in.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:31.880
Well, maybe I don't wish
I had a better answer,

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.250
but originally I wanted

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.830
to translate a different
book of Cristina's.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.130
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: Which one?

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.200
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: "La
cresta de Ilión", yes.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.140
"The Iliac Crest", I originally
contacted her about that book,

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.580
and some of us were
already translating it

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.780
and she sent me this
book or, you know, said,

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.500
"what about this one?"

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.340
So, I immediately
sat down and read it.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:00.020
So, it's sort of random I guess,
which I think kind of fits

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.530
with the type of
book and I said,

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.830
"all right, I'm going to do it".

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:06.530
And then one thing
I wanted to say just

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.200
about what Cristina was saying
about reading it out loud,

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.840
I found that really interesting,

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.840
because I don't know
how many people

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.580
in coffee shops I harassed
trying to get them to listen

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.670
to a certain sentence that
I was saying in my head

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:22.060
and I just had to
say it out loud.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.100
I know you think with
translation you have to say it

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.130
out loud, it just bounces
around in your head.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:28.510
It just doesn't work.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.310
So, yes, a lot of talking
to myself but then a lot

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:35.740
of coffee shop harassment
and harassment

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.040
of friends [laughter].

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.340
Whoever would listen.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.640
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
Yes so, that began --

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.740
and it really began as
Aviva's project, right?

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:47.420
And you were doing that also
for your emphasis, right?

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.740
Your work as your doctoral.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.930
So, it didn't began
as a marketplace --

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.230
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: Wonderful.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:55.910
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
It worked as an academic

00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:01.760
and intellectual project, and
then Dorothy Project somehow --

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.690
I don't know how they stepped
in, but they stepped in --

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.090
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: I sent it, yes.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:12.040
But Cristina had recommended
that publisher and I had sent it

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.140
to some places before
and it came

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.530
that it really was
a pretty ideal fit

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.370
which is their mission
statement.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:22.690
I could see it could be
written about your writing.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:23.990
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza:
I was pretty familiar

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.290
with the Dorothy project.

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:30.130
Is a press that I love the
canon, I love the authors

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.230
and I read several of the
conferences, especially the work

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:39.090
by Renee Gladman, and I was
thinking, "if this work belongs

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:44.560
in any press in the United
States it would be that one".

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.140
So, from the very beginning I
thought about Dorothy Project

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.070
and I was very settled that
one, and Aviva was asking me,

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:52.370
"where should I send it?"

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:54.400
I said, "well, the Dorothy
Project, obviously".

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.850
And so, it turned out that
it was a good call, yes.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:00.320
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: Is that
why you chose this book

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.620
in particular?

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.070
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza:
Yes, because there's the one

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.890
that I find the catalogue,
the conversation

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.550
that they are engaging with
in terms of experimentation

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:14.220
and cross gender writing, in
terms of writing of women,

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.980
not only from the United States
but also from other places.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.900
And in addition to that,

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.970
they have been recently
translating the work

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:26.010
by Leonora Carrington, which
is of my also favorite writes,

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:32.260
who is not from Mexico but lived
in Mexico, but was from Uruguay.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.740
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: I wanted
Jill and Aviva to share

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.860
with us your approach
to translation,

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.630
but then I mean your method
or theory, and what it was

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:44.880
like to translate this work?

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.470
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: Well,
again, the project began

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:52.290
with Aviva, and,
you know, for me,

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:55.530
translation is editing anyway.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.130
So, I mean, that's
what writing is too,

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.930
writing is rewriting,
it's editing.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:05.460
So, I sort of stepped in
as the director, I suppose,

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:11.660
on the academic setting of the
project, but also as an editor.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.270
And so, you know,
obviously we talked

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:19.360
about sound, rhythm, language.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.930
I was looking to make this --

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:26.880
because when you look
at Cristina's writing,

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.900
it actually has impact.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.180
I mean, in other words,

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:36.360
you'll straight something
is very concise, and so,

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.320
I felt that the English
had to be very tight,

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.250
and at the same time
have sensuality,

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:47.210
have images that
were very clear.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:51.640
So, it was a very
difficult project.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.580
I mean, maybe we should talk
about some of our challenges,

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:58.700
the specific challenges.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.610
And I think maybe you want
to begin with what you liked,

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:05.770
but I know that what made
Cristina very happy was

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.920
when we came up with
"tongue to tongue",

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:14.240
because that originally said,
"something in his tongue",

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.530
"algo en su lengua"
-- ¿cómo is that?

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:20.900
Algo en su lengua
que -- ¿cómo es?

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.090
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: "Algo
de su lengua en mi lengua".

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:24.390
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: So,

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.900
"algo de su lengua
en mi lengua", okay.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.970
To me it was suggestive.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.560
In other words --

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.860
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar:
Yes [laughter].

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.450
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
Language into language, okay.

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:36.800
But wait a minute.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.050
You know, "something
into something" --

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:43.650
so, basically "tongue"
had to be there, right?

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:51.150
Mother's tongue or whoever's
tongue had to be there.

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:55.100
And, you know, it says,
in English, something --

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.710
it's weak, but it says,
"tongue to tongue",

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:01.250
I think the reader gets the
idea, and then, of course,

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:03.460
you see the repetition
of the phrase

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:07.100
as the phrase was
in the text, right?

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.600
So, I think titles
are very curious.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.270
The titles of her
chapters are amazing.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.540
I mean, she has a
sense of humor.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.900
I know she reads very serious
but she's very sensed in humor.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.270
"Muy serio", says over here.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:23.940
The thing is, but
she's very funny.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.340
And so, these titles
are sharp and funny,

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.720
and I think that that
had to come through

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.210
and you read a chapter or --

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.500
you read a book through
its title so,

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.970
in some ways the title
is very important,

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.550
which comes to "El
mal de la Taiga".

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:41.780
We could've call it "the
disease of the tiger"

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.350
or "the tiger disease",
but you know,

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:47.980
first of all it sounds
like "tiger".

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.350
Well, the tiger's disease?

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.100
What's going on?

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.650
But the thing is I used "the
syndrome" and it was so perfect.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.160
Because first of
all I was thinking

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.460
of "the China syndrome",

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:01.530
which of course has all the
implications of capitalism

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.880
and this corruption,
the technology, ecology,

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.490
all that sort of problem.

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:11.000
Ecological disaster so,
the idea of syndrome came,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.300
and of course, it's a disease.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:17.650
So, you see these so-called
"changes", they're translations,

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:20.820
it's like writing the text
so, that it is as impactful

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:25.060
as it is in the original.

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.400
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: Yes, I think a
lot of it has to do with balance

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.230
and Jill and I have
talked about this a lot.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:34.280
It's just that because
everything, by necessity has

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.490
to be changed up and modeled
around, then there's sort

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:42.400
of an aspect of, "well,
we're losing this so,

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.940
we're putting something
else in",

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.990
sort of a constant push
and pull with that.

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:47.890
And it's not always
the exact, same thing,

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:49.840
because sometimes you
can't or you don't want

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.270
to for whatever reason because
it have the different languages

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.820
function, but then maybe
in the next paragraph,

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.170
maybe it's repetition of
something else but you want

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:59.830
to hold that repetition.

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.570
One of the challenges was
definitely the word "that",

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:05.380
which -- we all talked
about that a lot.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:10.510
It's a huge one,
it's one little word,

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:13.690
but it was a huge
one issue because --

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:15.180
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
When I first looked

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.480
at the text, I said --

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.780
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: So
many "that's" --

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.700
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
There's too many "that's" there.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.000
That.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.890
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: And there were
and, I mean, the problem is,

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:28.010
of course that in English
we just have one "that"

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:30.180
and in Spanish you
have multiple so,

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:33.950
what in Spanish would be three
different words in one sentence,

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:37.890
was something ending up being
the same word three times very

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:42.670
quickly, and yet at the
same time, the use of "que"

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:44.890
in Spanish is indispensable.

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.920
That's everything,
so much of the book

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:52.000
because it's this being told
that this happened, that --

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.390
you know, and it cannot be taken
away, but it read really heavy

00:45:56.390 --> 00:46:00.130
in English because we use
"that" just all over the place.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:04.030
So, that I thought
was tiny, but huge.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.870
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza:
And it was important that --

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:12.140
for me, at least, that you
have kept it exactly as it was

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.580
in Spanish, because this
indirect speech is central,

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.260
is fundamental for the story.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:22.150
I wanted to emphasize mediation,
the filtering of information,

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:25.550
how knowledge is being produced
at every stage of the story,

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:29.950
and so, in order to do that in
Spanish we use "que", right?

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.250
This is indirect speech

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:33.100
and there is no other
way around that.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.780
But then, yes, there were
too many "that's" [laughter].

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.080
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: But it
was very important to have that,

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.380
it was the first word
search [laughter].

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.680
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: I did a
text search at one point

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.030
and just started
to take them out.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.000
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza: On
the other hand, I'm very happy

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.010
that you had actually caught
my great sense of humor.

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:51.470
Actually people don't
believe that.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:54.330
I'm with you [laughter].

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:56.270
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
I know, I know.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:57.730
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: I
wanted to ask you, Cristina,

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:00.940
and the translators whether you
collaborated this time around.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.820
You surprised us last
time with the Iliac Crest

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.650
because you did collaborate
a lot right under that.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:06.950
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera
Garza: Yes, yes.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.860
Last year the Feminist
Press published

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.230
"The Iliac Crest"
translated by Sarah Booker,

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:16.860
and in just a said word with
Jill and Aviva very closely

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.930
in the translation, I
did the same with Sarah.

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:22.210
"The Iliac Crest" is a
novel that I published

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:25.950
in Spanish originally in 2003.

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:31.240
And so, many years had passed
from the original publication

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.270
to the moment of
the translation.

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:36.190
And so, when I was reading
the English version,

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:45.500
I thought that if I were
writing that book at this point,

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.500
I would've added
some more paragraphs.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:53.270
And just the thought
crossed my mind and --

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:55.350
obviously, and I
talked to the editor,

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:59.130
to Lauren at the Feminist
Press and she said, "well,

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.780
it's your book, you
know" [laughter].

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.300
"You can do whatever
you want", and I said,

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.600
"you shouldn't say that".

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.370
There were too many ideas
in my mind, and so, I did.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:15.160
I added a series of paragraphs,
I altered some sentences

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:19.220
and in all that, I wrote
originally in English,

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.960
and then went back
into the Spanish.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.090
So, the situation has become
really interesting now

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:30.650
because the book is being
republished this year in Mexico,

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:35.930
and so they had to translate
the paragraphs that I had added

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:40.050
in English, now they're being
translated back into Spanish.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:44.040
And the book is kind of like the
same, but not necessarily so.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:50.180
It's been updated in a
radical way, I suppose.

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:53.280
But my idea was that I have
to be true to the moment

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.940
of the reading, I have to be
true to the spirit of the book,

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.720
and I do look that
writing is a living entity,

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.290
and is never finalized.

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:06.560
If I were able to, I will be
writing these books forever.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.250
Thankfully I'm not
able to do that

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:10.380
and I change from book to book.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.970
And so, that happened
with "Iliac Crest".

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:14.920
And with these we
worked very closely.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:20.470
We were emailing each other
almost daily at times.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:21.770
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
We were pestering her

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:23.800
basically [laughter].

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.100
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza: And
I don't know where the day

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.060
that we came up, you came up
with this "tongue to tongue"

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:31.170
and I was like, "man, this is
exactly what I wanted to say".

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:35.390
It has to sound like in
English, and we had several

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:40.980
of those findings throughout
the process, so, it was fun,

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.470
it was complicated --
complex, I should say.

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:46.610
But it was all in all a
very friendly exchange,

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:52.570
and I think we all were open
about suggestions that came

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:55.060
from all over the place.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.060
A lot of work, that's for sure.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.760
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: And
I think it's interesting.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.610
Did you translate the
English of the Iliac Crest,

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:04.700
those added paragraphs
back into Spanish or not?

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.000
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera
Garza: No, I didn't.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.300
Someone else did.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.600
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
How do you feel about that?

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.080
&gt;&gt; Why?

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.250
[ Laughter ]

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:13.550
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza:
The short answer was

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:18.980
that I was extremely busy,
and I didn't have time

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.610
and the press was on
a very tight deadline,

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.100
and so they needed that
for, like, yesterday,

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.410
and I was like, "I
just can't do it".

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:29.320
But I think the other
translator did a good job.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:33.100
I had a chance to go
over that so, yes.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.630
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: The
other thing I was going to say

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:37.830
that what you said after
we read the translation,

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:40.160
our translation,
you said, "you know,

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.400
in some ways I'm finally
understanding this

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.700
book" [laughter].

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:50.470
Which shows that you're still
involved in writing it, right?

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:54.740
And the other thing that you
said, which relates to that,

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.760
that actually seems more
alive what now you mention

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:02.540
that you wanted to make it
as far away as possible.

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:05.760
In some ways you were also,
in some ways thinking of it

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.370
in English a little bit.

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:11.760
And a couple of times we
ran into phrases like,

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.070
"para decir lo menos",
to say the least --

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.980
which is something
we say much more --

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.410
I'm just saying it's
very common in English.

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:20.540
And even though we say it in
Spanish too, I think it sort

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.440
of comes from English
a little bit so, yes.

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:26.650
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza: This
is something interesting to me

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:28.110
that I was thinking about
as a shocking finding,

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:34.240
that many of these books,
it looks they have been --

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:39.400
are in translation now,
I conceived of them

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.890
in this country while working
in English, while reading a lot

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:50.100
of literature in English, and
many of the references and many

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.700
of the authors that I was
reading very carefully were

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.850
authors that belonged
to divisions

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:58.680
that are not necessarily
linked or that linked

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.920
to Latin American literature.

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.310
So, what happened to me
when I first started to talk

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:06.890
about Iliac Crest in
translation into English was

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:09.660
that the questions and the
conversations were so much

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:15.580
like the ones that I had hoped
I could've have in Spanish

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:19.050
but never have, because it
was read with different eyes,

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:21.860
it was inscribed in a
different tradition.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.360
And the reading was good, and it
was very fruitful and all that

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.160
but it was not necessarily
the one that I had in mind.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.880
But now that the book was in
translation, it seems to me

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:36.490
that the book was kind of coming
back to its original language.

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:42.080
So, I had thought of it while
maintaining a conversation

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:45.500
with certain experimental
tradition in the United States,

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:50.300
and I think many of the clues
who responded to that interest,

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.740
which might have been kind
of obscure for readers,

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:57.230
reading in Spanish and
in Mexican tradition

00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:58.870
or in Latin American tradition.

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:03.250
And I think the same thing is
kind of happening with the Taiga

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:04.860
and this Taiga Syndrome.

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:08.100
And I became aware of the
situation in a conversation

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:15.060
about the Iliac Crest in the
university in San Francisco,

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:21.360
and one of the professors there
said, "well, this resembles

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:26.860
or it reminds me of" -- and he
mentioned two or three authors,

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.350
and I was, "well, exactly".

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:34.070
I mean, those were the ones that
I was trying to engage with.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:36.980
And it was so clear
and so direct.

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.300
And so, the very
idea of translation

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.780
of what is the original language

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.820
of the book came
totally into place.

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.360
So, perhaps this is a
translation of the translation.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.510
We have the original languages

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:53.000
[ Laughter ]

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.960
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: Now we can
open it up to the public and see

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.370
if anyone has questions.

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:58.830
And we have a microphone
going around.

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:04.050
&gt;&gt; Can you just tell us
what those two books were

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:05.430
that the professor counted?

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:06.730
[Laughter]

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:12.930
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza: Let
me see, it was mostly poetry.

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:15.650
I do read a lot of poetry.

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:18.240
I mostly read poetry,
I should say.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:24.590
And I don't want to lie to
you, and I'm bad with titles,

00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:27.370
but they were poets, it
must have been something

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:28.670
like Linka Genien [phonetic].

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.330
It must have been something
like Rae Armantrout.

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:36.970
That kind of west coast
experimental writing, yes.

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:46.290
&gt;&gt; I have a question about
translating the senses,

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:48.840
because I think that's something
that's very interesting,

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.290
and your work, and a
lot of Mexican work

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:54.100
that I think it's sort
of an indigenous thing,

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.040
is the capturing senses.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.150
So, you showed the
visuals in the book,

00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:01.190
you talked about the sound
and the importance of sort

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:05.430
of feeling the sounds
in your body and I think

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:07.810
that multiple senses
started to come

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:11.870
out in both the translation
and in Spanish.

00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:14.190
And I wondered if all of
you could talk a little bit

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:16.260
about translating senses,

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:17.560
because I think that's
another --

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:22.900
language is one thing and
is oral, and guttural,

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.570
but translating that
into written word

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:30.370
and then translating that
from the languages is very --

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.670
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
Well, you're going back --

00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:33.190
&gt;&gt; It's an interesting skill.

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:34.490
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
You're going back

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:36.990
to the original discussion
of translation,

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:40.510
which goes all the way
back to Saint Jerome,

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:42.650
and it has a biblical
translation.

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:46.510
Rather to really bring out
the true meaning of the book,

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:49.330
not word for word
but sense for sense.

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:55.500
So, this is like a foundational
idea in the discourse

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.010
on translation to being
with, so, you know.

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:00.310
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza:

00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:02.610
And that's especially
important for someone like me.

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:05.850
I believe in the writing
is an embodied practice.

00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:09.040
It's not something that we
do right here, it's something

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.720
that we're doing, a whole body

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.160
and perception is absolutely
essential right there.

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.950
And touching those poems and
investigating the language

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:22.940
that might convey and may
make these points shareable

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:25.760
with others I think that's
very much the challenge

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.600
of every writing practice.

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:29.900
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: I
also think it's part

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.010
of what made this translation
really fun, that it kind of has

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:36.580
that double translation aspect
where you have to be thinking

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:38.000
about these different
elements --

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.050
and it goes back to what Jill
was saying about preserving kind

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:42.660
of the impact, because I
think the senses is sort

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.080
of about how it hits you

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.760
and where it hits you
as a reader as well.

00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.990
And so, I think that
is definitely part

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:50.720
of what made it an
interesting translation.

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:54.290
I was thinking about that and I
think, you know, there was a lot

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:56.120
of times where you feel it

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.270
in your body while
you're translating it

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:01.210
and while you're reading
it and paying attention

00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:03.430
to that as a translator.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:06.710
Kind of 'how am I viewing this?'

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:09.110
is definitely a different
experience.

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:13.440
And it was a nice change
from other academic work

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:18.550
that I was doing at the time,
was that this was so visceral.

00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:21.120
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: In some
way it's the essential academic

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:25.140
work too in some
way, because I mean,

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:28.450
it's the closest reading you
can give, and this is one

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:31.000
of the things where academia
has been very slow to realize,

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.070
how essential to the humanities
translation is in the concept

00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:38.090
of its relationship to reading.

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:41.610
But just thinking of sense, for
a sense in one of the problems

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:45.480
that we had, which
was a huge one.

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:49.700
Throughout the book there
are certain sentences,

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.390
which are echoed, from time
to time they're repeated

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:56.880
and it sort of really had to do
a lot with the trust of the book

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.580
which is sort of understand
but don't understand

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:00.880
but you do understand.

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:04.520
It's one of those kind of senses
was, "cuando decimos adiós,

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.140
¿qué es lo que
saludamos en realidad?"

00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:08.940
Now, think about that.

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:11.060
What does she really mean?

00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.440
What is the sense?

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.740
So, we went through a lot

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:17.260
of different versions
of that, right?

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.990
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: I think we
ended up going back to one

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:21.060
of our earlier versions,
we -- yes.

00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:23.070
We got around.

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:24.370
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
And we often do that,

00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:26.390
which is one thing that
I think you noticed,

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:28.470
that you sometimes go back
to an original version,

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:33.740
but what we said there and,
you know, what are we letting

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.520
in when we say goodbye?

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.510
Which is sort of
metonymically --

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:41.870
letting is kind of a
metonymic relationship

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:43.910
to saludar, because you greet.

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:47.200
But is very interesting.

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:51.970
I thought it was
quite difficult.

00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:53.270
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar:
And I'm just going

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:55.770
to give you a quick example
while we have the microphone.

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.290
One word that really
captivated me was

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:01.400
"entrecortadamente",
which is an adverb.

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.870
And you translate it
as "breathlessly".

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:06.010
It's an adverb with rhythm.

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.060
I thought it was very powerful.

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.290
The whole idea of
"entrecortadamente" versus

00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:12.020
"breathlessly" which is
why you embodied that.

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:13.390
It's the same concept, right?

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:14.690
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: You
know who taught us that?

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:17.340
Borges [Laughter].

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:20.590
Borges taught many writers
things, and I learned a lot

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:23.890
when I looked at his
translation of Virginia Wolfe.

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:28.470
Because he translates basically,
he realized that English is

00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:32.880
so much more elegant in terms
of adverbs, because "tedioso" is

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.360
like "heavymente"
in Spanish, right?

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:40.580
So, basically he would translate
the adverb into an adjective,

00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:44.170
to avoid that "mente"
so, for example,

00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:48.750
I think the sentence was, "she
grinned at him triumphantly" --

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:52.560
he said, "le hacía
muecas triunfales".

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.310
You see? And it's much
more elegant and tighter.

00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:56.610
So, you see that?

00:59:56.610 --> 00:59:58.820
But that's very interesting
that you brought that example.

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.680
That's one of those grammatical
problems that's very strong

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.980
between English and Spanish.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:05.280
I mean, very problematic.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.370
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar: Albert?

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:12.170
&gt;&gt; I'd like to [inaudible]
your take on -- usually --

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:16.370
at least in my case, always
you're supposed to read a book,

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:21.730
if you can, in the language
that it was written originally.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:27.140
But a translation is like re
writing a book and sometimes,

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.020
for example -- let's
put an example,

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.770
in "Memorias de Adriano" by
Cortázar from the French

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:40.330
to Spanish is so beautifully
translated that I'm pretty sure

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:43.700
that it's like reading
a different book.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.160
What is your take on this?

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.490
Shall we read you in English?

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:50.980
Shall we read you in Spanish?

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.880
Is it two different
versions of the same?

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.180
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza: Yes.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:01:00.170
You know, I've done
some translating myself,

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:04.260
and I've learned a lot
from the experience.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:07.310
I truly believe that a
translation is the version,

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:11.360
is the autonomous,
independent version of the book.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.860
And in this case, and in
the case of the Iliac Crest

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:22.290
with Sarah Booker's translation,
I was recommending everybody

01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:24.120
to read both, Spanish and
English, and it had nothing

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:29.350
to do with the market
[laughter], I swear,

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:32.400
but the work of the
translator is just

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:38.240
that there's this faithfulness,
but at the same time,

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:43.180
it's this radical transformation
that when it is done

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:48.960
as beautifully as Jill
and Aviva have done it,

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.280
in such a complex way, getting
to the heart of the matter,

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.110
I was not kidding
when I said at the end

01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:00.240
that I was finally understanding
some other aspects of the book,

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.140
in which I think the
translation is quite successful.

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:07.420
They are giving me a gift.

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.990
I'm receiving a new book.

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:15.980
It's related to mine
in very precise ways,

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:20.140
in very faithful ways,
but at the same time,

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:23.330
it is a totally different
experience.

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:28.740
So, now that I have been reading
this book out loud in English

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:34.110
in some of these readings,
I'm always thinking of that

01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:38.330
by things that I
was not expecting.

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:43.950
And finding the new version
enticing and alluring

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:46.670
and teaching me something
about my own writing

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:49.730
that I didn't notice -- that
I hadn't been able to notice,

01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:52.450
and I think because of
the process of translation

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:54.890
and the conversation
that came with it.

01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:57.570
So, I'm absolutely
grateful to these two,

01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:00.260
and as I said earlier,
I just adore them,

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.660
and the conversation was
fun and it was rewarding.

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.820
And I don't know what
you think about that.

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.600
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine: Well,
two things that I wanted

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.200
to mention to Hadrian -- and
of course Aviva and it was

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.420
that in the subversive
scribe that one

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:16.020
of the main points I make
is that translation --

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.090
if it is a good translation
and fulfills a potential.

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:21.510
In other words, it brings
out something that is

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:25.300
in the original but in a
different way, and then it sort

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.590
of kind of gives it
a light afterwards.

01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:30.540
But you have to think that maybe
all writing it's translation.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:34.920
I mean, Hadrian after all is
wonderful Marguerite Yourcenar,

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.980
she wrote it in French,
and I read it in English,

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.110
which I think she collaborated
in with her partner,

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:44.970
Grace Frick, her name was,
who did the English version.

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:48.630
But when I was reading that
book, I was thinking, "well,

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:50.690
this feels like it's Hadrian.

01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:53.570
I feel like I'm hearing
the voice of Hadrian".

01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:57.160
I mean, curiously I
didn't know it was English.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.720
Also when we see these
British films that are based

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.460
on Shakespeare and stuff -- yes,
I mean, Shakespeare is based

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.980
on roman stories
and stuff like that.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.890
But it's always the Brits
playing the ancient Greeks

01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:11.210
and stuff, but nonetheless,
it felt to me

01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:15.470
like I was hearing Hadrian as
well as Marguerite Yourcenar --

01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:18.010
even though she had written
in French so, I mean,

01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:21.750
in some ways the writing is a
translation of a translation

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:24.480
because there's always a
text underneath and so,

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.020
that's part of the
idea, I think.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:30.230
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera Garza: I
do read a lot in translation.

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:31.530
By the way, I'm sorry.

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:32.940
But a lot in translation,

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.300
actually the best
book I read this year,

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:40.210
and I highly recommend,
is by this Danish author,

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:42.480
Madame Nielsen, and the
title of the book is

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.010
"The endless summer", and one

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:48.120
of the reasons why I love
this book is the quality

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.910
of the sentences
is just so amazing.

01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:56.790
They're long sentences, almost
like Spanish-like sentences,

01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:59.180
with a wonderful use
of punctuation signs

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.950
and the sound -- and everything
is perfect, and I was thinking,

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:05.140
"I'm reading this,
this is a translation".

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:09.390
I have no idea -- I don't
speak Danish, of course,

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:13.300
I have no idea about how the
sentences are like or sound

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.570
like in the original
language, but the translation

01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:22.110
as such is just -- I don't
want to read it in Danish.

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:24.780
Well, because I don't
know Danish [laughter].

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.010
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: And I was
just going to say that yes,

01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:32.350
it was a real privilege to
be working with an author

01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:37.800
who wasn't possessive
over her writing.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.550
A lot of times when we would
send something, I would be kind

01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:44.400
of predicting, "oh, we may
have gone too far with this,

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.560
this is where there's
going to be an issue",

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.140
maybe there would
probably be an issue,

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.730
but it was somewhere
completely different.

01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:52.680
It was always surprising kind of
the spots where it wasn't like,

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.580
"oh, a lot of liberties
were taken here,

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:56.070
this is what she's going
to send back and be

01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:57.670
like 'this is not
what I wrote'",

01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:00.710
and that was not really
something that you did.

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:05.060
And it was more like something
else so, it was always kind

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:08.770
of a surprising read
from Cristina as well,

01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:11.830
and whenever I would
assume something,

01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:14.850
I was pretty much
wrong with that.

01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:18.120
Which was great, because then
there was a certain liberty

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.640
with that of how we
were able to experiment

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.850
as well as translators.

01:06:22.850 --> 01:06:24.150
&gt;&gt; Cristina Rivera
Garza: But you know what?

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:25.620
I was not always like this.

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:28.220
I have to tell you,
I have to be honest.

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:32.810
When a novel of mine was
translated back in 2003,

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:37.510
"No one will see me cry",
I just gave my translator

01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:42.420
such a hard time, because I had
not translated myself anything.

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:46.310
I hadn't gone through the
process of translation,

01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:50.900
and I was way more possessive
about the meaning of things.

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:56.410
I was not that bad,
I'm exaggerating.

01:06:56.410 --> 01:07:00.920
Before I embarked
in this translation

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:04.710
and also the Iliac Crest,
I had translated some works

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:06.850
by Vanessa Placeman,
Robert Peterman,

01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:10.180
and I translated
recently the work

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:12.990
by this poet, Fred Mountain.

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:16.730
And so, I had myself
gone through that.

01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:20.210
And that has just changed so
much the way in which I think

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:23.880
of my own work, my
relationship with the language

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:28.130
and just the carefulness,
devotion that goes

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:33.040
through every single decision
in this process of translation.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.560
So, it's good.

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.430
&gt;&gt; Aviva Kana: The
right moment, yes.

01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:39.730
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Jill Levine:
We learned a lot though --

01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:42.620
I mean, there are
points that, you know,

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.680
you made also that helped us.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.860
I mean, for example, indirect
discourse should be able

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:53.990
to strange and emphasizing
that was really important.

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:55.740
&gt;&gt; Manuel Cuellar:
Well, please join me

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:58.510
in thanking our great panelists.

01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:05.230
[ Applause ]

01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:06.530
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yes.

01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:10.920
I can only -- can you hear me?

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.680
Wait a second, there we go.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.250
I can only say the same thing.

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:20.740
Thank you Manuel, for moderating
that wonderful wild panel.

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.200
Thanks to all of you
for your great work

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.740
on behalf of literature.

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:28.240
I'm Rob Casper, I'm the head of
the poetry and literature center

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.020
and before I let you
go, just a couple

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.680
of things I want to tell you.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.920
First of all, I'm sure you all,
like me, want to get a copy

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.220
of "The Taiga Syndrome".

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:37.520
It is in the back.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:43.810
I'm sure that all three of our
great writers, translators,

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:50.450
will sign copies so, please
get one, get more than one.

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.110
Give it to everyone you know.

01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:55.720
Secondly, you should
have a survey.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.520
We'd love to have
you fill this out.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.790
It's really helpful for
us to know what kind

01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:03.090
of programs we should be doing

01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:05.090
and how we can improve
our programs.

01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:09.590
So, you met Anya and
Catalina and Angel,

01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:11.480
is right there, she
was with the mic.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.680
You can give the
surveys to anyone of us,

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.910
we'd love to have your
comments, especially we'd love

01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:18.130
to know how you might
have already engaged

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:19.430
with the library.

01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:21.400
There's a little bit in the
bottom there you can fill out.

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:25.550
Finally, we hope to see
you back here very soon.

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:28.700
On Wednesday November
7th, at the same time

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:32.500
in the same room we have an
event co-sponsored by the Poetry

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.860
and Literature Center,
and the Hispanic division,

01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:38.110
featuring Uruguayan poetry,
and we hope you can make it.

01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:40.390
So, until then, enjoy.

01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:42.390
[Applause]
