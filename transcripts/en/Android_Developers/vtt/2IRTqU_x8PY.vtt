RETO MEIER: Hello, and welcome
to "This Week in Android

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.640
Development" for
July 15, 2013.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.530
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.030
Last week we saw Ankur Kotwal
show us how to make our apps

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.170
beautiful by making them more
modern, as well as how to use

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.970
spacing in typography, while
Chet taught us how to add

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.500
curves to our motion.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.290
Good advice, both within your
apps and in the club.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.040
We also opened the mid-year
Android Developer Survey.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.780
These surveys are critical for
helping us understand your

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.479
Android developer challenges
and frustrations so that we

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.460
can help you overcome them.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.450
This year's survey is available
in Japanese and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.130
simplified and traditional
Chinese as well as English, so

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.590
you can tell us exactly what you
think in the language of

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.390
your choice.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.180
The [? writer ?]

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.480
team have put together an
excellent guide for efficient

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600
data transfers using
sync adapters.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.540
Remember, every time you use a
repeating alarm to sync data,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.510
Sundar kills a Bugdroid.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.840
So this is one Android training
class you should be

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840
paying close attention to.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.470
In terms of apps, we saw the
latest Google Maps release.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.230
CBS Sports released an app for
fans of the NFL and another

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.800
app for every other sport.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.000
And Trulia released an update
to their popular app, which

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.470
provides Bay Area residents with
a way to shock and alarm

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.140
their friends and families in
other states and countries.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.200
In Android Developers Live,
the Google Play games team

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.710
talk Google Play games.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.240
And Android Design in Action
returns with an app redesigned

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.610
from our GDG Oslo App Clinic,
which also includes a guide to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.350
design consistency.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.770
Last week's backstage was
delayed until this week, so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.740
join the guys for a session
of Q&amp;A around making apps

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.500
beautiful before checking out
the last DevByte in that

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.420
series as Ankur looks
at making your apps

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.150
beautiful on tablets.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.140
Then on Friday, I'll be taking
a look at cricket apps in the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.910
app clinic, just in time for
Australia to tie up the Ashes

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.520
within three days of
the second Test.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.400
As always, you can go
to developers.googl

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.070
e.com/live/android to see what
we've got planned for ADL this

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.110
coming week.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.060
That's all for "This Week
in Android Developers"

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.620
for July 15, 2013.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.510
All day, all night, I've got
the lights in my eyes.
