years ago people would walk around

00:30:00.129 --> 00:30:00.139
years ago people would walk around
 

00:30:00.139 --> 00:30:02.289
years ago people would walk around
saying oh yes digital transformation and

00:30:02.289 --> 00:30:02.299

types of impact that information
 

00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:19.789
types of impact that information
technology is exerting on the workforce

00:47:19.789 --> 00:47:19.799
technology is exerting on the workforce
 

00:47:19.799 --> 00:47:23.240
technology is exerting on the workforce
and I want to list those here the first

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:23.250
and I want to list those here the first
 

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.339
and I want to list those here the first
and most obvious one is on jobs of

00:47:25.339 --> 00:47:25.349
and most obvious one is on jobs of
 

00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:29.809
and most obvious one is on jobs of
course for example there are jobs that

00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819
course for example there are jobs that
 

00:47:29.819 --> 00:47:32.930
course for example there are jobs that
are going to be eliminated by technology

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940
are going to be eliminated by technology
 

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.329
are going to be eliminated by technology
there's no doubt about it if you are a

00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:35.339
there's no doubt about it if you are a
 

00:47:35.339 --> 00:47:38.120
there's no doubt about it if you are a
tollbooth operator your job will be

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:38.130
tollbooth operator your job will be
 

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:41.079
tollbooth operator your job will be
eliminated in the coming decade it's

00:47:41.079 --> 00:47:41.089
eliminated in the coming decade it's
 

00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:43.579
eliminated in the coming decade it's
it's easier and more efficient to do

00:47:43.579 --> 00:47:43.589
it's easier and more efficient to do
 

00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:46.730
it's easier and more efficient to do
that with technology and it's already

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740
that with technology and it's already
 

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.700
that with technology and it's already
happening it will happen more but there

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:49.710
happening it will happen more but there
 

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:51.859
happening it will happen more but there
are other kinds of jobs and as we looked

00:47:51.859 --> 00:47:51.869
are other kinds of jobs and as we looked
 

00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:54.079
are other kinds of jobs and as we looked
more and more into this in the national

00:47:54.079 --> 00:47:54.089
more and more into this in the national
 

00:47:54.089 --> 00:47:56.359
more and more into this in the national
academy study and in some follow-up

00:47:56.359 --> 00:47:56.369
academy study and in some follow-up
 

00:47:56.369 --> 00:47:58.760
academy study and in some follow-up
research i've been doing in

collaboration with Erik Brynjolfsson at
 

00:48:02.839 --> 00:48:06.890
collaboration with Erik Brynjolfsson at
an economist at MIT we found that in

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900
an economist at MIT we found that in
 

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:10.309
an economist at MIT we found that in
fact it looks to us like most jobs will

00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319
fact it looks to us like most jobs will
 

00:48:10.319 --> 00:48:12.980
fact it looks to us like most jobs will
not be eliminated but most jobs will be

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:12.990
not be eliminated but most jobs will be
 

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:16.490
not be eliminated but most jobs will be
impacted and here's kind of the quick

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:16.500
impacted and here's kind of the quick
 

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.099
impacted and here's kind of the quick
explanation of why think about the job

00:48:19.099 --> 00:48:19.109
explanation of why think about the job
 

00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:22.130
explanation of why think about the job
of a doctor well the doctors job be

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.140
of a doctor well the doctors job be
 

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.740
of a doctor well the doctors job be
eliminated by technology I think the

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:24.750
eliminated by technology I think the
 

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.359
eliminated by technology I think the
answer is no but it'll be dramatically

00:48:26.359 --> 00:48:26.369
answer is no but it'll be dramatically
 

00:48:26.369 --> 00:48:29.240
answer is no but it'll be dramatically
changed so the way to think about this

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:29.250
changed so the way to think about this
 

00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:31.569
changed so the way to think about this
is if you're a doctor

00:48:31.569 --> 00:48:31.579
is if you're a doctor
 

00:48:31.579 --> 00:48:35.120
is if you're a doctor
unlike Tollbooth operator your job

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:35.130
unlike Tollbooth operator your job
 

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:38.359
unlike Tollbooth operator your job
involves many tasks you have to diagnose

00:48:38.359 --> 00:48:38.369
involves many tasks you have to diagnose
 

00:48:38.369 --> 00:48:40.660
involves many tasks you have to diagnose
the patient you have to come up with

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:40.670
the patient you have to come up with
 

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:44.059
the patient you have to come up with
candidate therapies you have to discuss

00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:44.069
candidate therapies you have to discuss
 

00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:46.069
candidate therapies you have to discuss
with that patient which of those

00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079
with that patient which of those
 

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:49.220
with that patient which of those
therapies they really elect to proceed

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:49.230
therapies they really elect to proceed
 

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:52.490
therapies they really elect to proceed
with and you have to build a patient so

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500
with and you have to build a patient so
 

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.770
with and you have to build a patient so
those are some of the tasks involved and

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:54.780
those are some of the tasks involved and
 

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.300
those are some of the tasks involved and
when you think about automation the

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:56.310
when you think about automation the
 

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:58.520
when you think about automation the
right way to think about it is it

00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:58.530
right way to think about it is it
 

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:01.250

applies not to the whole job at once but

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260
applies not to the whole job at once but
 

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:04.010
applies not to the whole job at once but
to those individual tasks so we did a

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.020
to those individual tasks so we did a
 

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.859
to those individual tasks so we did a
study using the Bureau of Labor

00:49:06.859 --> 00:49:06.869
study using the Bureau of Labor
 

00:49:06.869 --> 00:49:09.620
study using the Bureau of Labor
Statistics taxonomy of jobs and the

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:09.630
Statistics taxonomy of jobs and the
 

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:12.500
Statistics taxonomy of jobs and the
affiliated tasks and what our study

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:12.510
affiliated tasks and what our study
 

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:15.700
affiliated tasks and what our study
indicated was that in fact most jobs

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:15.710
indicated was that in fact most jobs
 

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:19.430
indicated was that in fact most jobs
like the doctor involve multiple tasks

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440
like the doctor involve multiple tasks
 

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.309
like the doctor involve multiple tasks
most of those jobs will have at least

00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319
most of those jobs will have at least
 

00:49:22.319 --> 00:49:26.210
most of those jobs will have at least
some tasks influenced augmented or

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220
some tasks influenced augmented or
 

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.960
some tasks influenced augmented or
perhaps automated by technology but most

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:29.970
perhaps automated by technology but most
 

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:32.210
perhaps automated by technology but most
jobs will not be eliminated because

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:32.220
jobs will not be eliminated because
 

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.270
jobs will not be eliminated because
there will remain other tasks that are

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280
there will remain other tasks that are
 

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.190
there will remain other tasks that are
not going to be amenable to automation

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200
not going to be amenable to automation
 

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.620
not going to be amenable to automation
in the near term so for example a doctor

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:39.630
in the near term so for example a doctor
 

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:43.940
in the near term so for example a doctor
I think that jobs not going away but in

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:43.950
I think that jobs not going away but in
 

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:45.740
I think that jobs not going away but in
the future we could expect that doctors

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:45.750
the future we could expect that doctors
 

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:49.370
the future we could expect that doctors
will receive more aid from computers for

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:49.380
will receive more aid from computers for
 

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.589
will receive more aid from computers for
diagnosis and therapy generation

00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599
diagnosis and therapy generation
 

00:49:51.599 --> 00:49:54.920
diagnosis and therapy generation
probably not more aid from computers for

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:54.930
probably not more aid from computers for
 

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:56.930
probably not more aid from computers for
having the heart-to-heart chat with the

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940
having the heart-to-heart chat with the
 

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:00.500
having the heart-to-heart chat with the
patient about what to do and so that's

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:00.510
patient about what to do and so that's
 

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:04.099
patient about what to do and so that's
that was that's kind of the good or the

00:50:04.099 --> 00:50:04.109
that was that's kind of the good or the
 

00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:07.250
that was that's kind of the good or the
bad news for us I think many jobs will

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260
bad news for us I think many jobs will
 

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:10.280
bad news for us I think many jobs will
be impacted in fact our studies show

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:10.290
be impacted in fact our studies show
 

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:12.800
be impacted in fact our studies show
that the majority of jobs will be but in

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:12.810
that the majority of jobs will be but in
 

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:15.200
that the majority of jobs will be but in
fact rather than being eliminated

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:15.210
fact rather than being eliminated
 

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:17.809
fact rather than being eliminated
they'll be redefined by redistributing

they'll be redefined by redistributing
 

00:50:17.819 --> 00:50:21.160
they'll be redefined by redistributing
those tasks so that's one kind of impact

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:21.170
those tasks so that's one kind of impact
 

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:23.780
those tasks so that's one kind of impact
second kind of impact is on education

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:23.790
second kind of impact is on education
 

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.420
second kind of impact is on education
both the supply and the demand for

both the supply and the demand for
 

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:29.470
both the supply and the demand for
education one way to think about that is

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:29.480
education one way to think about that is
 

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:34.970
education one way to think about that is
in terms of when what and how we teach

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:34.980
in terms of when what and how we teach
 

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:37.640
in terms of when what and how we teach
so today at Carnegie Mellon we typically

so today at Carnegie Mellon we typically
 

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:40.010
so today at Carnegie Mellon we typically
teach undergraduates for four years and

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.020
teach undergraduates for four years and
 

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.150
teach undergraduates for four years and
send them on their way

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160
send them on their way
 

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.730
send them on their way
but in the world where

we're going to want more and more

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:52.330
we're going to want more and more
 

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:56.460
we're going to want more and more
continuing education so that's the wind

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:56.470
continuing education so that's the wind
 

00:50:56.470 --> 00:51:00.150

part the what part what do we want to

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160
part the what part what do we want to
 

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.400

educate people to do what do we want to
 

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:06.510
educate people to do what do we want to
teach and here again it looks like we

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:06.520
teach and here again it looks like we
 

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.400
teach and here again it looks like we
want maybe we need to do a little less

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:08.410
want maybe we need to do a little less
 

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:11.460

things we can do both at the government

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520
things we can do both at the government
 

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.240
things we can do both at the government
level and at the technology development

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:56.250
level and at the technology development
 

01:00:56.250 --> 01:01:01.160

that sort of thing
 

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:22.380
that sort of thing
and many of us enjoy some benefits from

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:22.390
and many of us enjoy some benefits from
 

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.450
and many of us enjoy some benefits from
these advances based on what they can

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:24.460
these advances based on what they can
 

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.480
these advances based on what they can
help us do like get to work on time when

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:27.490
help us do like get to work on time when
 

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:32.820
help us do like get to work on time when
it snows however there is a flip side to

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:32.830
it snows however there is a flip side to
 

01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:35.760
it snows however there is a flip side to
this which is that the rewards the

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:35.770
this which is that the rewards the
 

01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:40.020
this which is that the rewards the
economic rewards of these advances so

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:40.030
economic rewards of these advances so
 

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:42.150
economic rewards of these advances so
far have mostly gone to those at the

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160
far have mostly gone to those at the
 

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:49.470
far have mostly gone to those at the
very top of the economic ladder is where

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:49.480
very top of the economic ladder is where
 

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.030
very top of the economic ladder is where
those advances that where those gains

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:51.040
those advances that where those gains
 

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.180
those advances that where those gains
have gone so far and in fact social

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:54.190
have gone so far and in fact social
 

01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:56.100

technological advances in in hard in
 

01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:04.530
technological advances in in hard in
various kinds of technology including

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:04.540
various kinds of technology including
 

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.810
various kinds of technology including
artificial intelligence and machine

01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:06.820
artificial intelligence and machine
 

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:10.470

learning as one of the key drivers for
 

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.380
learning as one of the key drivers for
the stark increase in inequality and

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:13.390
the stark increase in inequality and
 

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.030
the stark increase in inequality and
income inequality that we've all

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:15.040
income inequality that we've all
 

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.060
income inequality that we've all
experienced over the last couple decades

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:17.070
experienced over the last couple decades
 

01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:19.770
experienced over the last couple decades
along with the fallout of that

01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:19.780
along with the fallout of that
 

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:22.950
along with the fallout of that
inequality so in this figure you can see

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960
inequality so in this figure you can see
 

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.530
inequality so in this figure you can see
that blue line is showing those at the

01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:25.540
that blue line is showing those at the
 

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:28.740
that blue line is showing those at the
top of the ladder this is the top 1% of

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:28.750
top of the ladder this is the top 1% of
 

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:32.610
top of the ladder this is the top 1% of
Learner of earners and the share of all

01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:32.620
Learner of earners and the share of all
 

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:34.650
Learner of earners and the share of all
income that they've been getting over

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:34.660
income that they've been getting over
 

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.230
income that they've been getting over
time and we can see that going sharply

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:37.240
time and we can see that going sharply
 

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.170
time and we can see that going sharply
up and commensurately at the bottom the

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:40.180
up and commensurately at the bottom the
 

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.350
up and commensurately at the bottom the
bottom 50% of earners that's the red

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:43.360
bottom 50% of earners that's the red
 

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.110
bottom 50% of earners that's the red
line is falling over that same time

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:46.120
line is falling over that same time
 

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.920
line is falling over that same time
period

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:48.930
 

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:51.320
so maybe we shouldn't be too surprised

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:51.330
so maybe we shouldn't be too surprised
 

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:54.230
so maybe we shouldn't be too surprised
that at first these technological

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240
that at first these technological
 

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.360
that at first these technological
advances are going to be put to work for

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:56.370
advances are going to be put to work for
 

01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:59.450
advances are going to be put to work for
the benefit of those at the top but here

01:03:59.450 --> 01:03:59.460
the benefit of those at the top but here
 

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.730
the benefit of those at the top but here
at the block Center we're focused on

our benefits in this talk I'm going to
 

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:17.210
our benefits in this talk I'm going to
focus on one of these emerging

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220
focus on one of these emerging
 

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.060
focus on one of these emerging
opportunities and dive into it some with

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:20.070
opportunities and dive into it some with
 

01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:22.940
opportunities and dive into it some with
you all we're going to be looking at how

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:22.950
you all we're going to be looking at how
 

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.340
you all we're going to be looking at how
AI can be put to work for some of the

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:25.350
AI can be put to work for some of the
 

01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:28.100
AI can be put to work for some of the
most vulnerable among us for children

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:28.110
most vulnerable among us for children
 

01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:32.900
most vulnerable among us for children
who are facing abuse and neglect so

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:32.910
who are facing abuse and neglect so
 

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:35.180
who are facing abuse and neglect so
what's the connection between AI and

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:35.190
what's the connection between AI and
 

01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:38.150
what's the connection between AI and
this vulnerable group of children the

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160
this vulnerable group of children the
 

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.860
this vulnerable group of children the
connections going to come through the

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:39.870
connections going to come through the
 

01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:43.010
connections going to come through the
main way that people report suspected

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020
main way that people report suspected
 

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:45.980
main way that people report suspected
abuse and neglect which is phone

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:45.990
abuse and neglect which is phone
 

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:48.800
abuse and neglect which is phone
hotlines so let's look into these lot

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:48.810
hotlines so let's look into these lot
 

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:51.770
hotlines so let's look into these lot
hotlines so who's working here in these

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:51.780
hotlines so who's working here in these
 

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.960
hotlines so who's working here in these
hotlines it tends to be social workers

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:53.970
hotlines it tends to be social workers
 

01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:56.840
hotlines it tends to be social workers
these are highly trained skilled workers

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:56.850
these are highly trained skilled workers
 

01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.540
these are highly trained skilled workers
who have graduate degrees and let's

01:04:59.540 --> 01:04:59.550
who have graduate degrees and let's
 

01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:02.960
who have graduate degrees and let's
think now about their bundle of tasks

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:02.970
think now about their bundle of tasks
 

01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:06.560
think now about their bundle of tasks
and how AI has some opportunities to

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:06.570
and how AI has some opportunities to
 

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:11.900
and how AI has some opportunities to
help in a high-stakes situation so there

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:11.910
help in a high-stakes situation so there
 

01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:14.120
help in a high-stakes situation so there
are two main ways that AI tends to come

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:17.180
are two main ways that AI tends to come
in and interact with our tasks one is

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:17.190
in and interact with our tasks one is
 

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:20.450
in and interact with our tasks one is
that the AI can come in and take a task

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.460
that the AI can come in and take a task
 

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:23.210
that the AI can come in and take a task
out into the AI world and fully

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:23.220
out into the AI world and fully
 

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:26.120
out into the AI world and fully
accomplish it so that task is removed

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:26.130
accomplish it so that task is removed

reconfigured the other way this tends to
happen is that the AI comes in and sits

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640
happen is that the AI comes in and sits
 

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.870
happen is that the AI comes in and sits
next to us here at work and it tries to

01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880
next to us here at work and it tries to
 

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.480
next to us here at work and it tries to
help with a task that we are still

well how urgent or we can decide to

screen this family out so typically
that's because we've decided that this

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:08.470
that's because we've decided that this
 

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:10.560
that's because we've decided that this
family had some other need that the

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:10.570
family had some other need that the

children didn't need additional
protection there's something else going

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:13.330
protection there's something else going
 

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:13.890
protection there's something else going
on here

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:13.900

like maybe this famil

01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:14.920

I was having a hard time paying their

01:08:16.019 --> 01:08:16.029
I was having a hard time paying their
 

01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:19.740
I was having a hard time paying their
heating bills okay and so what we can do

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:19.750
heating bills okay and so what we can do
 

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.599
heating bills okay and so what we can do
is provide information about that

01:08:21.599 --> 01:08:21.609
is provide information about that
 

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:24.240
is provide information about that
program to them meet that need and

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:24.250
program to them meet that need and
 

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:26.760
program to them meet that need and
stream them out of these protective

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:26.770
stream them out of these protective
 

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:29.669
stream them out of these protective
services so these are our decisions most

01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679
services so these are our decisions most
 

01:08:29.679 --> 01:08:32.099
services so these are our decisions most
of the time we're highly trained experts

01:08:32.099 --> 01:08:32.109
of the time we're highly trained experts
 

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:34.590
of the time we're highly trained experts
and we get it right right the kids who

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600
and we get it right right the kids who
 

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.360
and we get it right right the kids who
are in need of protection get that

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:36.370
are in need of protection get that
 

01:08:36.370 --> 01:08:38.550
are in need of protection get that
protection the families that had other

01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560
protection the families that had other
 

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.680
protection the families that had other
needs get routed in that direction and

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:40.690
needs get routed in that direction and
 

01:08:40.690 --> 01:08:46.559
needs get routed in that direction and
it works fine but not always we are not

01:08:46.559 --> 01:08:46.569
it works fine but not always we are not
 

01:08:46.569 --> 01:08:48.510
it works fine but not always we are not
going to be perfect about doing this and

01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:48.520
going to be perfect about doing this and
 

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.280
going to be perfect about doing this and
this is where there starts to be an

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:50.290
this is where there starts to be an
 

01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:54.059
this is where there starts to be an
opening to ask the question could a I

01:08:54.059 --> 01:08:54.069
opening to ask the question could a I
 

01:08:54.069 --> 01:08:57.900
opening to ask the question could a I
come in and help and we need to really

01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:57.910
come in and help and we need to really
 

01:08:57.910 --> 01:09:00.539
come in and help and we need to really
look at what is the nature of the ways

01:09:00.539 --> 01:09:00.549
look at what is the nature of the ways
 

01:09:00.549 --> 01:09:02.970
look at what is the nature of the ways
in which we're not able to do as well as

01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:02.980
in which we're not able to do as well as
 

01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.760
in which we're not able to do as well as
we want to understand where AI could

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:05.770
we want to understand where AI could
 

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:08.430
we want to understand where AI could
come in and how it could or couldn't be

01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:08.440
come in and how it could or couldn't be
 

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.289
come in and how it could or couldn't be
helpful what are the pitfalls that could

01:09:10.289 --> 01:09:10.299
helpful what are the pitfalls that could
 

01:09:10.299 --> 01:09:12.720
helpful what are the pitfalls that could
happen so let's look at the ways those

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:12.730
happen so let's look at the ways those
 

01:09:12.730 --> 01:09:15.599
happen so let's look at the ways those
cook overall so we could make that

01:09:15.599 --> 01:09:15.609
cook overall so we could make that
 

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.370
cook overall so we could make that
choice just reading the family out and

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:17.380
choice just reading the family out and
 

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:20.970
choice just reading the family out and
we could be wrong so this is clearly

01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:20.980
we could be wrong so this is clearly
 

01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:23.579
we could be wrong so this is clearly
something we want to avoid these are

01:09:23.579 --> 01:09:23.589
something we want to avoid these are
 

01:09:23.589 --> 01:09:25.349
something we want to avoid these are
children who will need to be protected

01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359
children who will need to be protected
 

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:27.360
children who will need to be protected
we got a call that they needed help and

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:27.370
we got a call that they needed help and
 

01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:29.510
we got a call that they needed help and
we did not provide aunt that protection

01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520
we did not provide aunt that protection
 

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.999
we did not provide aunt that protection
that's one way I can go wrong but it

01:09:32.999 --> 01:09:33.009
that's one way I can go wrong but it
 

01:09:33.009 --> 01:09:35.249
that's one way I can go wrong but it
also can go wrong the other way which is

01:09:35.249 --> 01:09:35.259
also can go wrong the other way which is
 

01:09:35.259 --> 01:09:38.519
also can go wrong the other way which is
that we screen them in and if it turns

01:09:38.519 --> 01:09:38.529
that we screen them in and if it turns
 

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:40.019
that we screen them in and if it turns
out that those children didn't need

01:09:40.019 --> 01:09:40.029
out that those children didn't need
 

01:09:40.029 --> 01:09:42.090
out that those children didn't need
protection and we spritz bring them in

01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:42.100
protection and we spritz bring them in
 

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.099
protection and we spritz bring them in
it's not only an inefficient allocation

01:09:44.099 --> 01:09:44.109
it's not only an inefficient allocation
 

01:09:44.109 --> 01:09:47.430
it's not only an inefficient allocation
of resources there's also a burden for

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440
of resources there's also a burden for
 

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.039
of resources there's also a burden for
that family part of this is that they

01:09:50.039 --> 01:09:50.049
that family part of this is that they
 

01:09:50.049 --> 01:09:53.340
that family part of this is that they
get investigated this is an invasive

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:53.350
get investigated this is an invasive
 

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:56.160
get investigated this is an invasive
investigation it's often ever serial

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:56.170
investigation it's often ever serial
 

01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:58.140
investigation it's often ever serial
between the family and the people doing

01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:58.150
between the family and the people doing
 

01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:00.169
between the family and the people doing
the investigation this is always

01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:00.179
the investigation this is always
 

01:10:00.179 --> 01:10:02.610
the investigation this is always
stressful for the adults that were

01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:02.620
stressful for the adults that were
 

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.770
stressful for the adults that were
involved and the children tend to be

01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:04.780
involved and the children tend to be
 

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:08.400
involved and the children tend to be
confused and possibly frightened so

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:08.410
confused and possibly frightened so
 

01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:11.959
confused and possibly frightened so
their burdens with that error as well

01:10:11.959 --> 01:10:11.969
their burdens with that error as well
 

01:10:11.969 --> 01:10:14.550
their burdens with that error as well
both directions these are are high

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560
both directions these are are high
 

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:18.840
both directions these are are high
stakes in this situation so we want to

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:18.850
stakes in this situation so we want to
 

01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:23.010
stakes in this situation so we want to
think here about why is it that we are

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:23.020
think here about why is it that we are
 

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.560
think here about why is it that we are
not always able to reach our goal the

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:25.570
not always able to reach our goal the
 

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:27.660
not always able to reach our goal the
goal is accurate this is

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:27.670
goal is accurate this is
 

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:32.370
goal is accurate this is
and fair decisions very clear here what

01:10:32.370 --> 01:10:32.380
and fair decisions very clear here what
 

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.220
and fair decisions very clear here what
our goal is so what are the things on

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:35.230
our goal is so what are the things on
 

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:37.590
our goal is so what are the things on
the human side that are making us fall

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600
the human side that are making us fall
 

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.220
the human side that are making us fall
short of being able to get there so one

01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:41.230
short of being able to get there so one
 

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:43.260
short of being able to get there so one
of the things that's true is that we get

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:43.270
of the things that's true is that we get
 

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:45.030
of the things that's true is that we get
this call we get this new information

01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040
this call we get this new information
 

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.520
this call we get this new information
and we have to decide how to interpret

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:47.530
and we have to decide how to interpret
 

01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:51.660
and we have to decide how to interpret
it what would really help with that is

01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:51.670
it what would really help with that is
 

01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:54.030
it what would really help with that is
background information so let's say for

this is unstructured data in lots of
 

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.750
this is unstructured data in lots of
different settings and we need to pull

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760
different settings and we need to pull
 

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.640

of opportunities for us to help improve
 

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:29.610
of opportunities for us to help improve
accuracy okay that's one way that humans

01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:29.620
accuracy okay that's one way that humans
 

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.310
accuracy okay that's one way that humans
could use some help here and in doing a

01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320
could use some help here and in doing a
 

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.050
could use some help here and in doing a
slightly better job I also mentioned

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:34.060
slightly better job I also mentioned
 

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:38.130
slightly better job I also mentioned
this issue of fairness so here's our

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:38.140
this issue of fairness so here's our
 

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.920
this issue of fairness so here's our
human being overwhelmed by a data

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:40.930
human being overwhelmed by a data
 

01:12:40.930 --> 01:12:43.690
human being overwhelmed by a data
so I also talked a little bit about

01:12:43.690 --> 01:12:43.700
so I also talked a little bit about
 

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:44.350
so I also talked a little bit about
fairness

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.360
fairness
 

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.500

so we also don't want certain

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:47.510
so we also don't want certain
 

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:51.040
so we also don't want certain
communities of kids some subpopulations

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:51.050
communities of kids some subpopulations
 

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:53.560

not receiving help they needed it and

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:56.110
not receiving help they needed it and
 

01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:59.010
not receiving help they needed it and
the other way around we don't want some

01:12:59.010 --> 01:12:59.020
the other way around we don't want some
 

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.230
the other way around we don't want some
subpopulations of families to

01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:01.240
subpopulations of families to
 

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.370
subpopulations of families to
disproportionately bear the burden of

01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:03.380
disproportionately bear the burden of
 

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.820
disproportionately bear the burden of
being investigated when there was no

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:06.830
being investigated when there was no
 

01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:10.240
being investigated when there was no
need for that investigation so why does

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:10.250
need for that investigation so why does
 

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:12.460
need for that investigation so why does
this happen for humans if the human is

01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:12.470
this happen for humans if the human is
 

01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:13.960
this happen for humans if the human is
doing the siding why does this happen

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:13.970
doing the siding why does this happen
 

01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:16.990
doing the siding why does this happen
when the humans are committed to doing

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:17.000
when the humans are committed to doing
 

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.840
when the humans are committed to doing
this fairly and they are a well-trained

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:19.850
this fairly and they are a well-trained
 

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:23.650
this fairly and they are a well-trained
highly trained so again social and

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:23.660

behavioral slaves comes in and helps us

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:26.150
behavioral slaves comes in and helps us
 

01:13:26.150 --> 01:13:28.120
behavioral slaves comes in and helps us
understand what are the ways that people

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:28.130
understand what are the ways that people
 

01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:32.620

up exhibiting biases and we know a lot

01:13:36.190 --> 01:13:36.200
up exhibiting biases and we know a lot
 

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.370
up exhibiting biases and we know a lot
about this actually so for instance we

01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:39.380
about this actually so for instance we
 

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:42.910
about this actually so for instance we
know that people are sensitive to what's

01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920
know that people are sensitive to what's
 

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:45.760
know that people are sensitive to what's
called recency bias so let's say that we

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:45.770
called recency bias so let's say that we
 

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:47.170
called recency bias so let's say that we
