00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.740
Although it's not a universal rule, in general,
the best superhero movie adaptation are faithful

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.000
to the comic books they're based on - and
that includes in terms of the character aesthetics.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.020
The likes of Spider-Man, Iron Man, Batman
and Superman have always at least heavily

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.020
resembled their comic book counterparts when
they've appeared on screen, for example.However,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.020
for various reasons, a number of characters
in superhero movies have been barely recognisable

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.110
in terms of their physical appearance when
compared to the source material.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.050
In most cases, this results in a fan backlash
- which kind of makes you wonder why the movie-makers

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.770
thought it was a good idea to change the way
they look in the first place.In this video,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.270
we'll take a look at some of the most extreme
examples.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.300
Here are ten superhero movie characters who
look nothing like the comics.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.180
Wolverine
Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is a rare example

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.500
of a superhero movie character who has proven
to be extremely popular, in spite of the fact

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.860
that he really doesn't look like his comic
book counterpart.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.870
Sure, he's muscular, has the same hair and
the claws, but that's where the physical resemblance

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.960
ends.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.420
Jackman is more than six feet tall, whereas
Wolverine classically hovers around the five-and-a-half

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.690
feet mark and, most notably, movie Wolverine
lacks the iconic yellow costume of comic book

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.690
Wolverine.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.929
Still, the eight X-Men movies that Jackman
has appeared in so far would suggest that

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.340
it's done the character no harm.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.650
Apocalypse
It was a long wait for a villain as monstrous

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.600
as Apocalypse in the X-Men movie universe,
so when he was announced as the antagonist

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.600
in 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse, fans were excited.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.310
Unfortunately, instead of the hulking seven-foot-tall
brute from the comic books who's as wide as

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.930
two average men, we were given a fairly unintimidating
villain the size of an average adult male.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.070
Moreover, his colouring was different.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.759
Instead of the classic vibrant blue coloured
armour, he wore a drab greyish-blue costume

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.649
and, in some promo pics, even looked a weird
shade of pinky purple.

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.610
He looked more like a low-budget Doctor Who
villain, or a character from one of the shoddy

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.889
live action Mortal Kombat adaptations than
he did the legendary mutant from the comic

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:54.099
books.

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.570
Enchantress
Suicide Squad has opened to some pretty scathing

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.750
reviews and one of the reasons it is being
criticised is the over-sexualisation of its

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.229
female characters.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.160
Cara Delevingne's Enchantress is a prime example,
as Warner Brothers have made her look completely

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.420
different to the comic book version in order
to make her sexier.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.269
In the comics, Enchantress classically wears
a grand, green, flowing dress and gown, but

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.579
Warner Brothers took advantage of the fact
that gorgeous fashion model Delevingne was

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.810
portraying the character by putting her in
what was essentially a chainmail bikini.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.819
It was really quite unnecessary and quite
a lot of people have taken offence to it.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.310
Lex Luthor
Superman's arch-nemesis Lex Luthor has been

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.610
portrayed by three different actors - Gene
Hackman, Kevin Spacey and Jesse Eisenberg

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.440
- in five live action movies, and none of
them have really looked anything like the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.989
classic comic book version.

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.120
They've all ended up bald - which is Luthor's
most distinguishing feature - but the classic

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.379
Luthor also has very recognisable, stern and
chiseled facial features that none of the

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.330
actors who've played him have possessed.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.519
He's also quite a muscular man who is actually
very capable of handling himself in physical

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.890
combat - and none of the actors who have played
him have had that quality.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.489
Doctor Doom
Both movie versions of Doctor Doom - Julian

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.450
McMahon's and Toby Kebbell's - have been terrible,
but McMahon's at least resembled the comic

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.090
book version of the character physically.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.799
Kebbell's 2015 version, however... not so
much.

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.180
As well as having very different origins to
the classic version of Doom, Kebbell's version

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.180
looked absolutely nothing like him.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.200
His armour and iconic metal mask were replaced
by an allover metallic look that came courtesy

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.049
of being fused to his space suit.

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.879
His regal green cloak was replaced with what
was essentially a dark green rag.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.519
And his entire body was covered in lacerations
that emitted a green glow reminiscent of the

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.819
environment that gave him his powers - and
they certainly aren't seen on the comic book

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:43.819
version.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.890
Hawkeye
Jeremy Renner has now played Clint Barton

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.830
AKA Hawkeye in four MCU movies to date - Thor,
The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron and

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.019
Captain America: Civil War - and he's yet
to look anything like how the character looks

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.120
in the comics.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.150
Classically, Hawkeye wears a purple costume
with a very striking purple mask - but the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.400
MCU version wears something far more practical.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.440
It's black for starters, making it more covert
(although there is a touch of dark purple

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.159
in the latest incarnation in Civil War) and,
most noticeably, there's no mask.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.401
Although, to be fair to Marvel Studios, the
mask probably wouldn't have looked great in

00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:14.430
live action.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.241
Bullseye
There wasn't much about 2003's Daredevil movie

00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:22.070
to speak positively about - it was absolutely
awful - and Colin Farrell's portrayal of Bullseye

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.070
epitomised that.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.321
He wasn't very good in general, but the fact
that he looked nothing like the comic book

00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:28.630
version of the character really didn't help.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.630
Bullseye is known for wearing an allover bodysuit
that includes a headpiece with a bullseye

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.750
printed on it.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.170
Farrell's version simply wore street clothes
- a leather coat, leather trousers and a black

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.380
vest - although he did have a bullseye-shaped
scar on his head - like the comic book version

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.780
does under his costume.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.560
Poor Farrell looked rather stupid, to be honest.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.500
Aldrich Killian
Guy Pearce portrayed Aldrich Killian in 2013's

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.110
Iron Man 3, but this Aldrich Killian was different
in many ways to the version in the comic books

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.320
- not least because he also claimed to be
the MCU's version of the Mandarin.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.750
However, he didn't look anything like the
comic versions of Killian or the Mandarin.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.690
Pearce's Killian had slicked-back blonde hair
and mostly wore a suit, while the comic book

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.940
version had side-parted black hair and tended
to wear lab clothes.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.450
And as for not looking like the Mandarin...
well, the Mandarin is a Chinese character

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.530
in the comic books and wears grand oriental
gowns and ten rings that possess various superpowers.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.140
Pearce's character really couldn't look less
like him if he tried.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.250
Galactus
When it comes to superhero movie characters

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.700
looking NOTHING like how they do in the comics,
there's no better example than Galactus.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.350
Galactus appeared as the main antagonist in
2007's Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.950
Surfer - and he was about as far removed from
the gigantic humanoid in purple armour that

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.970
fans know from the comics as it was possible
to be!

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.860
This version was simply an enormous world-devouring
cloud, with no discernible personality or

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.860
characteristics.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.830
It was arguably the worst depiction of any
comic book character on film in history - although

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.910
we must admit that a planet-eating giant in
purple armour might have looked a bit silly

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.500
on film too.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.660
Deadpool
The 2016 version of Deadpool totally nailed

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.760
the character in every respect.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.990
He looked great and Ryan Reynolds played the
character to perfection - but the previous

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.970
version from 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine
absolutely sucked.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:14.970
We could complain about everything that was
wrong with him all day, but let's stick to

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:15.970
his appearance for the purposes of this video.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:16.970
Where was the iconic red and black suit?

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.680
This Deadpool was topless, wore elasticated
trousers, had blades protruding from his hands,

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.490
had his mouth sewn shut and was covered in
pen markings.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.020
Talk about butchering a character!
