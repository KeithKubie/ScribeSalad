00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's recap the TLS Handshake.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
There's an important part of it that we haven't focused on yet.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first step is the hello from the client to server.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The second step, the server responds--both of these messages include new randomness,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and part of this response is the certificate.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In the third step, the client sends a new random value encrypted with the server's public key.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
At the end of this process, the client and the server have agreed on the master secret,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which is used to derive the keys for communication.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So the key question and the goal of the protocol is for the client to know

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that it's communicating with the correct server,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and that that master secret is only shared with the server it intends to communicate with.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The question is how can the client trust that it's communicating

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
with the server it intends to communicate with.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Here are the choices, select the best answer, and I should warn you

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
this is a bit of an unfair question since we haven't talked about this yet,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but I think you'll know enough to figure out the answer based on what you've seen so far.
