- Hold it, hold,

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.110
now!

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.444
- [Pie Guys] Oh!

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.115 align:start size:81% position:19%
- You got crazy
lungs, Apocalypto!

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.450
- Yeah, I can hit
(garbled speech)

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.985 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't know
what you're saying!

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:20.153
(all laugh)

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:20.987
- Hey, hey,

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:22.155
you guys ever do coke?

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.423
- What?

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.759
- They said they'd never
seen a lower LSAT score.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.260 align:start size:81% position:19%
- What'd you get?
- 90.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.194 align:start size:72% position:28%
- That's an A.
- A minus.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.529
- That's not how that works.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.764
- Guys, where's Sal?

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.332
It's the lunch rush,
we have three orders.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.433
- Who?

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.068
- Salvatore, our head cook?

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.836
Giant Oaxacan, you
ever heard of him?

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:38.571
- Oh, Apocalypto.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.839
- Oh.

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.708
I didn't know his
name has Salvatore.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.976
- I didn't know he was Italian.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.045
- It's fine, dude,
he's right here.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:45.879
(horn honks)

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:46.713
- Oh my god.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.947
- He's fixing my horn.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:48.815
Sounds good, buddy!

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.083
Good work.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.618
- Oh no, he's the only
decent cook we have!

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:52.452
Who wants out?

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:53.753
Ow, ow my arm!

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:56.856
(techno theme music)

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.530
- So he rear-ends me,
gets out of his car,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.065
it's Beau Bridges.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.366
Could not have been nicer guy.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.967
- I saw Randy Quaid
at Wendy's once.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.669
- Hey what's up Jacinda?

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.072 align:start size:97% position:3%
Guess how many perfect
push-ups I did this morning.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.406
Almost 30.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.975
- Cool, can't wait
to tell my boyfriend.

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.410
- Oh, progress.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.611 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Pretty good.
- Yeah.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.147 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Guys, this is
getting out of hand.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.682
- What's getting out of hand?

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:24.617
- I may look like an idiot,
but I'm not an idiot, John.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.520 align:start size:97% position:3%
Smells like Bob Marley's
butt-hole all over this place.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.255
- Uh, so it smells like shit?

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.190
- No.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.691
Weed.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:32.659
- Then why does he say it
smells like a butt-hole.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.561
- That's why I said Bob Marley.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.362 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know, he smoked
a lot of weed.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.398
- I think what Mort's saying
is that it's still a butt hole

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:39.499
so it smells like shit,

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:40.533
no matter whose butt-hole it is.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.135
- My cats only eat cat food,

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.204
but their butt holes
still smell like shit.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.738
- You smell your
cat's butt-hole?

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.006
- No, I just wake up in the
morning and they're like,

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.241
kind of around my face.

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.642 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Hey, what kind of
cats do you have again?

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:50.777
- A orange tabby and a Burmese.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:51.611
- Oh, cute.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:52.445
- [Mort] It is.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.413
- Guys!

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.814
I mean look what you did to Sal.

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:56.382
- That's called
a siesta, Samuel.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:57.617
Okay, it's part of his culture.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.585
What are you, a racist?

00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.552
- What, no!

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:00.820
- [] Sound a little racist.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.689 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Guys.
(Mort babbles)

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:03.556
My office.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.858
Now!

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.759
That's it guys, no more smoking.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.594
- What?

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:08.661
That's insane.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:09.829
It's basically part of our job.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.498 align:start size:81% position:19%
Guys, back me up.
- I'll stop.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:13.066
- You're a coward,
always have been.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.701 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Samuel, if I'm
being totally honest.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.169 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Only be honest if
it's agreeing with me.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.471 align:start size:94% position:6%
- It doesn't make me more
focused at work, but,

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.840
there are a lot of studies
that show happy employees

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.775 align:start size:88% position:13%
are more productive
than unhappy employees.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.310
- See, Samuel, studies.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.678
Dude, you hate your job.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.547
- I don't hate my job.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:28.948 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We hear you
crying in here, man.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.583 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Last week we heard
you call yourself

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.685
a divorced pile of shit.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.255
- I was reading an article.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.756
(Sal groans)

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:37.590
What, no, Sal.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.424
Sal.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:39.792
- Oh, no no no no.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.895
- [Samuel] I'm in a meeting!

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.630
Go, go into the parking lot.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.797
- Look at what you
have to deal with!

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:45.932
You should be high at work.

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.400
- I can't get high.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.902
- What do you mean
you can't get high?

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:51.804 align:start position:0%
- I tried when I was in college
and nothing happened to me.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.307 align:start size:97% position:3%
Pot wasn't that big at Brown
when I was there anyway.

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:56.743
- Whoa, is that an
Ivy League school?

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.112
- More importantly
you can't get high?

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.713
- No.
