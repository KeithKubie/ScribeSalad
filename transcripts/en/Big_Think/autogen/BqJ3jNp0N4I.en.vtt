take time it actually accelerates the

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129
take time it actually accelerates the
 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.279
take time it actually accelerates the
effectiveness of the decision the

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289

so it's retraining how we're actually

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460
so it's retraining how we're actually

so it's retraining how we're actually
you know thinking about time yes it's

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419
you know thinking about time yes it's
 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.139
you know thinking about time yes it's
not such a linear process it's more of

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:09.149
not such a linear process it's more of
 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:12.439
not such a linear process it's more of
okay what is our engagement here look

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449
okay what is our engagement here look
 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.629
okay what is our engagement here look
like so we can produce the read and you

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639
like so we can produce the read and you
 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.579
like so we can produce the read and you
know the the absolute best result we

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:16.589
know the the absolute best result we
 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:18.469
know the the absolute best result we
could it's really quality over quantity

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479
could it's really quality over quantity
 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.320
could it's really quality over quantity
yeah it's so slow to go fast or slow to

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330
yeah it's so slow to go fast or slow to
 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.230
yeah it's so slow to go fast or slow to
go best you know and ultimately we go

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240
go best you know and ultimately we go
 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.719
go best you know and ultimately we go
fast faster together and the quality of

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729
fast faster together and the quality of
 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.480
fast faster together and the quality of
our output is going to be better and how

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490
our output is going to be better and how
 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.459
our output is going to be better and how
we got there is going to feel that we

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:31.469
we got there is going to feel that we
 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:34.879
we got there is going to feel that we
were honored yeah right versus making a

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889
were honored yeah right versus making a
 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.399
were honored yeah right versus making a
decision going forward just for the sake

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409
decision going forward just for the sake
 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:39.529
decision going forward just for the sake
of going forward yeah right so I mean

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539
of going forward yeah right so I mean
 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:41.300
of going forward yeah right so I mean
this is so classic it's like a classic
