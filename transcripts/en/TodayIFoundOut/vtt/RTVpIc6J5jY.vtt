00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.230
Hello I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
Today I Found Out youtube channel, in the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.980
video today, we're looking at the origin of
the thumbs up gesture and whether it really

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.170
had anything to do with Roman Gladiators.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:18.080
There are few hand gestures out there as well
known or ubiquitous as the humble thumbs up.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.130
But why is this seemingly innocuous gesture
so widespread; how did it come to mean “everything

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.759
is okay” in so many cultures and where did
it come from?

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.439
The commonly told origin is that it came from
the Romans and their gladiatorial games: thumbs

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.399
up meant live and thumbs down meant die.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.829
This is unequivocally false.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.690
While it is true that in the days of gladiatorial
combat in the Colosseum and the earlier (and

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.179
significantly larger) Circus Maximus, the
audience could decide the fate of a fallen

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.770
gladiator with a simple hand gesture, this
isn’t typically depicted accurately and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.040
has little to do with why thumbs up and thumbs
down means what it does today.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.429
The fate of a gladiator, in terms of whether
the audience was voting for a kill, was decided

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.790
with what is known as “pollice verso”,
a Latin term which roughly translates to “turned

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.790
thumb”.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.299
More precisely what this means isn’t known
and there are no accounts that have survived

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.470
to this day that describe it in any real detail.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.330
As such, we’re unable to say for sure which
way the thumb was supposed to be pointed if

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.340
the audience wanted a given gladiator to be
killed or if they could just wave their thumbs

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.570
around at random, which it seems may well
have been the case.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.729
So that’s voting for death, what about life?

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.770
The gesture to spare a given gladiator’s
life seems to have been neither a thumbs up

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.770
nor a thumbs down.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.729
Instead, you had to hide your thumb inside
your fist, forming a gesture known as pollice

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.039
compresso, “compressed thumb”.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.409
The reasons for this has been speculated to
be twofold: first, it made the decision of

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.240
the crowd easier to discern, since it’s
easier to tell the difference between a thumbs

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.210
turned and a closed fist than a thumbs up
and a thumbs down from a long ways away.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.719
And two, the gestures themselves are thought
to be largely symbolic of what they represented-

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.229
a pointed thumb represented the audience’s
desire for the victorious gladiator to deliver

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.810
his coup de grâce (stab the fallen foe),
while a hidden thumb symbolised that they

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.830
wished for the gladiator to stay his blade,
sheathing it much in the way they’d hidden

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.060
their thumbs.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.690
Hence why it’s thought “turned thumb”
may well have been simply waving your thumb

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.250
around in the air, perhaps in a stabbing motion.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.110
However, this fact is largely absent from
pop culture representations, most notably

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.030
in the otherwise enjoyable 2000 movie, Gladiator,
in which Joaquin Phoenix is shown giving a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.390
defeated gladiator a thumbs down to signify
that he wishes for him to be killed.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.700
According to director Ridley Scott, that scene
was inspired by a painting from 1872 called

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.910
“Pollice Verso“.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.210
The painting depicts a victorious gladiator
standing over the lifeless body of his opponent

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.660
while a baying crowd jeers and delivers a
tsunami of down-turned thumbs.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.960
Scott stated of the painting, “That image
spoke to me of the Roman Empire in all its

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.370
glory and wickedness.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.570
I knew right then and there I was hooked.”

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.540
That particular painting has been noted by
historians as the catalyst for why the concept

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.760
of pollice verso is so poorly understood today
by the masses.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.450
What makes this fact so surprising is that
the painter behind the piece, Jean-Léon Gérôme,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.060
was a hugely respected historical artist who
was internationally renowned for his “archaeologically

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.690
correct history paintings”.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.350
Gérôme has been described as a “learned
classicist” and was famous for extensively

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.550
researching his pieces before putting brush
to canvas.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.260
For example, with “Pollice Verso” Gérôme
studied actual pieces of armor from the ruins

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.890
of Pompeii so that the gladiators in his paintings
looked authentic.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.180
Gérôme’s legendary attention to detail
is probably the reason that his interpretation

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.260
of pollice verso was so widely accepted by
academics and why it was so widely disseminated,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.370
even after it was proven false.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.680
As for what historians of his era thought,
interpretations varied greatly from thumbs

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.740
up meaning kill and thumbs down meaning live
(and vice versa), to hidden thumb in fist

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.660
meaning live and thumbs down meaning kill,
and pretty much every variation therein.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.040
Why Gérôme chose thumbs down isn’t known,
or even whether he meant it as is often interpreted-

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040
“kill”.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.510
People predominantly interpreted the painting
this way (and still do), but in truth there

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.430
is no evidence that this was what Gérôme
was going for.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.570
So, if the Romans aren’t generally thought
today to be the origin of the thumbs up gesture,

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.670
who was?

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.609
That isn’t known precisely and we’re left
mostly with just guesses.

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.750
But it might surprise you that the mass-popularity
of thumbs up / thumbs down, meaning as it

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.490
does today, is a fairly recent phenomenon,
though gesturing with one’s thumb is prevalent

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.940
in many cultures throughout much of history
with varied meanings.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.969
So what about some educated guesses as to
the origin of the thumb gestures?

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:36.199
If you ask linguist anthropologist Joel Sherzer
of the University of Texas, the gesture (meaning

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.139
something) likely pre-dates the Romans.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.650
He went on to say of Europeans, “The dichotomy
of up meaning ‘positive’ and down meaning

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.090
‘negative’ pervades the language and gesture
systems of Europe…

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.419
The thumbs-up gesture probably originates
from this contrast.”

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.449
We can see evidence of this gesture in such
images as the 1617 painting by Spanish artist

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.490
Diego Velázquez titled, The Lunch, though
what the gesture meant precisely in this case

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.419
is open to interpretation.

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.400
As for a speculative theory that is a little
more concrete, one of the more convincing

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.050
theories of the origin of the modern meaning
of thumbs up comes from Desmond Morris’

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.479
1979 work, Gestures: Their Origins and Distribution.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.449
He states that it derives from a custom prevalent
in medieval times where people making a deal

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.009
would lick their thumbs and press them up
against one another, rather like shaking hands

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.009
today.

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.889
It’s theorised that over time this diluted
to the act of simply sticking one’s non-licked

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.620
thumb into the air to symbolise approval.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.819
Whatever the case, at the least, we do know
how the meaning was so widely popularised.

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.319
For this one, we need to fast-forward to much
more recently in history- WWII.

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:44.229
During WWII, the thumbs up gesture was used
extensively by American pilots as a shorthand

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.499
way of indicating to their ground crews that
they were ready to fly.

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:51.539
It has been speculated that they got this
from the Chinese, with specifically the Flying

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.509
Tiger brigade of American pilots based in
China seemingly being the first (or among

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.969
the first) to popularly use the gesture, at
least as far as photographic evidence from

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:02.449
the era seems to indicate.

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.360
To the Chinese at this time, the thumbs up
gesture meant “number one” or “nice

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.790
job” depending on context.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.650
(Why this is the case is up for debate.)

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.819
Whether it truly was adopted from the Chinese
or some other source, the American pilot version

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.430
initially meant “I’m ready” or “good
to go”.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.449
From here, things become much more clear.

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.370
This “ready” meaning soon evolved into
a simple, all-encompassing way to indicate

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.630
that everything was okay in situations where
verbal cues weren’t possible or advisable.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.650
It was also picked up by the rest of the American
military who proceeded to make extensive use

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.930
of the gesture during their many campaigns
across Europe; in the process, it was picked

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.090
up by the locals and soldiers from other militaries.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.240
From there, the thumbs up symbol temporarily
declined somewhat in popularity by the 1960s,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.599
but made a huge comeback thanks to Hollywood,
and particularly Fonzie and his two thumbs

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:56.360
up “aaaaaaaaay” gesture in Happy Days
which debuted in 1974.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.629
Today, thanks to the widespread use of thumbs
up meaning “like” or “good” and thumbs

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:05.650
down meaning the opposite on numerous popular
websites and apps, this meaning of the hand

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.919
gesture is likely not going anywhere for the
foreseeable future.

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:09.919
Bonus Fact:

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:13.729
As we alluded to previously, there are several
places on Earth where a thumbs up is considered

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.249
a grave insult.

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:19.000
For example, in places like Iraq and Greece,
sticking up your thumb is akin to saying “shove

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
it up your a**”.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.479
It also meant this in Australia before WWII,
but afterward switched to the modern meaning

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.129
thanks to the dissemination of the gesture
throughout the Allied military.

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:32.620
The exact reasoning behind this meaning, as
with many gestures, isn’t clear, but it’s

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.490
believed to be representative of the action
that would be required for you to act out

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.699
the insult itself.

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:42.069
In fact, in some of these cultures that interpret
it this way, an up and down movement often

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:45.090
accompanies the gesture to make the meaning
perfectly clear.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.099
On that note, when American troops first started
being stationed in Iraq, some reported being

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:54.099
greeted by civilians offering a thumbs up,
with the soldiers (and many in the media)

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:59.039
interpreting it as most Westerners would,
all the while not realising the obscene connotations

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.389
it has in that country.
