LESTER CHEN: So
my name is Lester.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.190
I'll be talking about the
hyper growth of mobile gaming

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.126
on YouTube.

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:12.500
So when people
have conversations

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.040
around mobile gaming, they often
talk about the amount of users,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.630
the amount of revenue generated.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.210
But rarely do to talk
about the amount of content

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.820
that's actually
consumed on video.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.820
So on YouTube,
mobile gaming content

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.700
comprises around
1.6 billion hours

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.349
watched in last year, 2016.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.390
Now it's from some of
these games mentioned here,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.710
but many others, some of
which you guys developed.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.520
Now this is huge mainly because
in 2015 mobile gaming really

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.280
wasn't a category that we
were paying attention to.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.370
With the advent of hardware,
better software, better

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.767
graphics engines, it's
become more available

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:50.600
for people to actually
want to go on YouTube

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.320
and watch more robust
content from these games.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.660
So in comparison to all
the rest of the gaming

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.430
corpus on YouTube--

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.330
that's Call of Duty, League of
Legends, any MOBAs, Minecraft--

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.550
mobile gaming as a
category-- these games--

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.430
actually grew at a
clip of around 110%,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.220
which is what we
consider hyper growth.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.480
In July, we saw a huge spike in
hours consumed with Pokemon Go,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.780
obviously, being released.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.010
But even after the months
following Pokemon Go,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.510
we saw huge uplift in
mobile game consumption.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.040
This is mainly aided by games
such as Clash Royale, Pokemon

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.090
Go, and two indie titles--
slither.io and Agar.io.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.810
We think that as far
as Clash Royale goes,

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.490
Supercell has done a great
job releasing content

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.880
as far as cart updates,
balance and patch notes, which

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.890
makes the game really
sticky for audiences

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.340
and the broadcasters
of this game company

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.749
to really produce more and more
content for their audience.

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:48.290
With the case of
Pokemon Go, the game

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.540
was just so explosive
with so many millions

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.500
of registered users.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.930
Obviously, it is going to
create a desire from audiences

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.930
to want to watch, whether that's
where the next Poke Stop is

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.440
or someone falling into a
lake, tripping over something,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.790
or whatever have you.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.860
And with slither.io
and agar.io, these

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.786
are both very simplistic
games with high replayability.

00:02:06.786 --> 00:02:08.160
You can just pick
it up and play.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.410
I think if any of you guys
have seen "House of Cards,"

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.530
even Kevin Spacey in
that game was playing it.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.140
So the concept there was kind
of a vehicle through which

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.930
creators on YouTube could
create their commentary

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.929
and do game play over.

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.470
So you can't talk
about all the games

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.220
without also talking
about the creators.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.950
Last year, these
are just a handful

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.350
of the creators who are
publishing mobile gaming

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.720
content exclusively
on their channels.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.880
There's over 350
more of these guys

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.710
just like the ones you see here.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.780
But combined, the
audience that they have

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.590
is around 20 million
total subscribers.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.060
So the question really is--

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.280
now setting the stage of
how big mobile gaming is--

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.904
how do you really
use all these content

00:02:44.904 --> 00:02:46.580
to influence game decisions?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.230
And vice versa, how
can game decisions

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.260
really help spur content
creation on a video platform?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.680
So in the case of YouTube,
this is our first Foray.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.320
We created an event called the
King's Cup, which we partnered

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.080
with Supercell and
Google Play to create

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.090
a really unique tournament.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.550
We used the top 8 live
streamers and content creators

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.524
of Clash Royale and got them
to a one day Los Angeles-based

00:03:09.524 --> 00:03:11.690
tournament location where
we're going to live stream

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.620
the whole tournament.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.627
Now, that's simple.

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:14.960
It's just creating a live event.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.626
It's a very competitive
game, of course.

00:03:16.626 --> 00:03:18.500
That's going to be
pretty attractive.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.291
But we also parroted
with an in-game feature--

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:22.790
and this is the
first time Supercell

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.480
had released an in-game heavily
discounted bundle of discounted

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.210
chests and gems as well as
an in-game challenge mode.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.360
I think since now, they've
released three or four

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.972
other game challenge modes,
but this was the first one.

00:03:34.972 --> 00:03:36.680
And this is really
influenced by the fact

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.260
that we were producing
and executing

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.690
a live event that was big
enough with as many creators

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.610
as they have that
really pushed them

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.680
to create an in-game solution.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.560
So obviously, the chests and
discounts was an awesome offer,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.110
but within the King's
Cup Challenge itself,

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.390
players at home during
the live stream event

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.160
could play with
decks pre-selected

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.340
from the top gamers,
the top YouTubers,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.660
and the top pro players.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.670
So they kind of got to
have a shared experience.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.830
And since this event
was so big, there's

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.480
also a sense of scarcity, right?

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.810
Where people want to tune in
and watch this high profile

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.670
event, and also at
home feel like they

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.025
are part of the experience.

00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:14.150
And when they're seeing
the best decks being played

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.910
at this tournament, they're
also incentivized to, of course,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.855
buy cards and buy
chests to play more.

00:04:19.855 --> 00:04:21.980
So this is a concept we
kind of played around with.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.470
We really had no idea how
this was going to do--

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.970
just kind of producing and
executing a concept like this.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.390
But at the end, we had
around 63,000 people

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.370
watching the live event--

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.080
over eight and a half,
nine million views

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.120
generated on the video itself.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.310
We had Korean and English feeds.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.540
And the event was kind of an
in-person one day event where

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.250
we invited--

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.060
it was the most bizarre--

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.560
call it e-sports--
competitive event

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.360
where there was 400
people in a room

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.360
all heads down, quiet
for about four hours,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.352
just grinding out
Clash Royale game play.

00:04:52.352 --> 00:04:53.810
I've been to a lot
of gaming events

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.607
and that is by far the
most eerie/surreal one.

00:04:57.607 --> 00:04:59.690
But it was amazing seeing
so many people connected

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.120
playing a mobile game in a
physical location in one place.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.770
Imagine if all of you guys
were all on your phones

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.540
right now competing
against one another.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.050
It was a really
unique experience.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.870
On the left, we basically
drummed up a lot of excitement

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.410
by sending the creators special
Clash Royale chests, which

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.860
the top eight creators
kind of, Willy Wonka style,

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.982
got invited to this
tournament or they came.

00:05:19.982 --> 00:05:21.940
And these guys were kind
of like the Iron Chegs

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.030
of the whole broadcast, where
the 300 people kind of had

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.160
to face off in order to
play against these guys

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.080
in the finale.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.367
So in the end, there
was one winner.

00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:32.950
It was a very unique
idea that we just

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.710
want to prove out a concept.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.330
As far as YouTube
gaming goes, we

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.830
saw huge amount of uplift of
people downloading the app

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.832
and activating with
YouTube Gaming.

00:05:41.832 --> 00:05:43.540
For the publisher as
well as Google Play,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.579
we saw a huge multiplier
on day-of revenues.

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:48.370
And in total, we created
a big experience--

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.320
a high profile
unique experience--

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.970
where almost 8.5
million people tuned in.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.020
So kind of the recipe for
success that we learned

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.110
she was really
using influencers.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.170
I'm sure none of you guys are
new to leveraging influencers.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.200
But really, tying that to kind
of a triangle where you create

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.649
a live opportunity where
there's a high profile event--

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:09.940
where it's so exciting and
everyone wants to watch this

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.080
one event--

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.750
and also tie that to a live
ops opportunity where people--

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.800
the millions of registered users
at home-- can also participate.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.854
Whether it's purchasing or
downloading in-game content

00:06:20.854 --> 00:06:23.020
and also having an ability
to play a challenge mode,

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.710
much like what they can
see on the YouTube content.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.210
It really created
an ecosystem where

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.580
it was really sticky
and really attractive

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.830
to both audiences, Google
Play, and the game publishers.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.380
So-- up next is Dan.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.080
Thank you so much for your time.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.530
