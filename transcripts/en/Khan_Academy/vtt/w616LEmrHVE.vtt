00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
 

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:08.880
We need to add 7.056
to 605.7 to 5.67.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.170
Now when you're adding any
number, you always want to

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.370
make sure you line up numbers
in the same place.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.910
And especially when you're
dealing with decimals, the

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.790
easiest way to do that is to
just line up the decimals.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.900
So let's do that.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:27.010
So the first number right
here is 7.056.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:36.700
This second number right
here is 605.7.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.150
And then this last
number is 5.67.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.940
So now we have everything
lined up.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.340
Everything that's in the ones
place is below or above

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.420
everything else in
the ones place.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.430
Everything in the tenths place
is below or above everything

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.190
else in the tenths place,
and so on and so forth.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.770
So we can add.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.020
So let's add it.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.370
 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.690
So you want to start off
in the smallest place.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.040
So you start off here.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.950
This is the tenths, hundredths,
thousandths place.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.680
This is literally 6 thousandths,
and you want to

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.170
add it to the other
thousandths.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.990
There aren't any other
thousandths.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.950
So you can view it two ways.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.770
You can just bring in this 6
down, or you could view this

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.450
605.7 as the same thing
as 605.700.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.920
You can add as many zeroes to
the right of this decimal, to

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.970
the right of the 7, as you want,
since we're sitting on

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.890
the right side of the decimal,
without changing its value.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.840
You can also do it here.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.350
This 5.67, you can write
it as 5.670.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.800
When you write it like
this, and you have 6

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.910
plus 0 plus 0 is 6.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.780
And you keep going.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.550
5 plus 0 plus 7 is 12.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.480
You write the 2 in the
hundredths place,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.130
and carry the 1.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.440
1 plus 0 plus 7 is
8, plus 6 is 14.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.170
Write the 4, regroup the
1 into the ones place.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.950
1 plus 7 is 8.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.759
8 plus 5 is 13.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.350
13 plus 5 is 18.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.500
This is 18.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.190
Carry or regroup the 1.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.120
1 plus 0 is just 1.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.010
And then finally.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.380
You have the 6 in the
hundreds place.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.840
Nothing gets added to it, so you
can just bring down that 6

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.190
and it's right there.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.410
And you don't want to
forget the decimal.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.730
And so when you add the numbers
you get 618.426, or

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.010
618 and 426 thousandths.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.620
And we're done.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.120
