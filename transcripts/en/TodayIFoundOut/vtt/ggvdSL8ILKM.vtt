00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:15.410
Anyone who has ever tried to reason with a
sleepwalker knows they can seem to be awake,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.320
yet have bizarre and irrational behaviors.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.800
Stubborn during the best of episodes, and
inconsolable, unreasonable and intense in

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.950
the worst, it is not hard to imagine these
walking dreamers acting out nightmares, and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.440
unintentionally turning violent.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.080
In fact, the sleepwalker’s lack of intent
has been used successfully as a defense in

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.320
several shocking murder trials over the years.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.590
One of the earliest known sleepwalking murders
was committed by Albert Tirrell in October

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.190
1845 in Boston, Massachusetts.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.150
His mistress, Mary Ann Bickford, was found
dead in her seedy boardinghouse.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.640
Her throat had been slashed (6 inches across
and three deep), one ear was cut and an earring

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.670
was missing, her skin was charred and her
hair was singed.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.220
Her killer had set her bed on fire.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.720
Tirrell was a wealthy and married man who
had taken to carousing with Mary years earlier

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.890
(although both were, at the time of her death,
only in their early 20s), and their relationship

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.110
was known to be tempestuous.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.630
On the night she was killed, Mary had been
seen with Tirrell, although he had left by

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.070
the time she was discovered.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.860
Witnesses testified that he obtained a ride
hurriedly that evening, and had sought out

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.270
relatives for assistance with leaving Boston.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.000
His brother-in-law testified that Tirrell
said he was fleeing from an earlier charge

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.140
of adultery, and seemed surprised to hear
of Mary’s murder.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.299
At his trial, Tirrell’s able attorney used
several examples from history to explain how

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.190
capable, yet unaware, sleepwalkers could be.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.410
He also presented testimony from Tirrell’s
family about the extent of Tirrell’s somnambulism

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.410
since a young age.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.729
After two hours of deliberation, the jury
returned a verdict of not guilty.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.590
On May 24, 1987, late in the evening, Kenneth
Parks, who had fallen asleep in his living

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.159
room, abruptly rose, put on his coat, grabbed
his car keys and left his house in Toronto,

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.159
Canada.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.439
On his way out, he left both the front door,
and the door to the garage, open.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.340
He drove about 14 miles to the home of his
in-laws, Barbara and Donald Woods.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.990
He was planning on attending a fun family
event there the next day, and all agreed that

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.480
before the evening of the killings, he had
a good relationship with his in-laws and had

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.040
no motive for hurting them.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.480
After he entered their home, the Woods tried
to restrain Parks.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.870
He then strangled (but not to death) Donald
and bludgeoned and stabbed Barbara many times,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.870
causing her death.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.780
While committing the crime, he severed every
flexor tendon on each of his 10 fingers.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.290
As he left their home, he was observed by
the Woods’ teenage daughters who heard him

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.690
grunting like an animal.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.510
Later that night (or early morning), he went
to the police station and told them, “I

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.650
think I killed somebody.”

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.900
At his trial for murder, the defense presented
his well-established history of sleepwalking,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.650
which ran strongly in his family, as well
as the other facts of the case, in order to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.660
establish an automatism (sleepwalking) defense.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.319
He was acquitted of murder, and that judgment
was sustained on appeal.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.820
On or about October 30, 2003 in Manchester,
England, Jules Lowe, 32, beat his 83-year-old

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.660
father, Edward Lowe, to death.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.209
The two men resided together and were known
to have a close relationship.

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.090
The evening of the beating, the two had gotten
seriously drunk after they had attended Lowe’s

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.090
stepmother’s funeral.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.050
Lowe reported that he had fallen asleep that
night and had no memory of anything until

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.680
he discovered his father dead on their driveway
the next morning.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.640
The investigation revealed that the assault
spanned three floors of the home, and that

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.770
Edward had 90 distinct injuries.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.240
The jury found Lowe not guilty by reason of
insanity, and he was detained under a hospital

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.420
order.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.519
The three people identified above are the
exception, as most people who try to use the

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.269
automatism defense are unsuccessful.

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.260
One notable murder, where the facts are (at
least to me) as compelling as some of those

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.150
where the killer was acquitted, happened in
California in 2001.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.409
After a night of drinking, cocaine and fun
in a hotel room on Catalina Island, Stephen

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:53.930
Otto Reitz, age 25, awoke and found his girlfriend,
Eva Marie Weinfurtner, dead from several stab

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.380
wounds to the back of her neck.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.150
When reporting the death to the police, he
noted that although he had no memory of attacking

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.159
her (he did have a dream of struggling with
an attacker), the knife wounds to Eva were

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.120
similar to those he used in his work (he was
a shark fisherman).

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.129
At his trial, it was revealed that Reitz,
who was bi-polar, had forgotten his medication,

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.220
but took some anti-anxiety medicine Eva had
given him.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.299
In addition, he had a history of sleepwalking,
and a later investigation at a sleep clinic

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.909
showed not only that he suffered from sleepwalking,
but night terrors as well.

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:41.860
Regardless, he was convicted and sentenced
to at least 26 years in prison.
