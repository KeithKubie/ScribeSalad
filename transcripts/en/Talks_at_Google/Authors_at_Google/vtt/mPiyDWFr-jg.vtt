00:00:01.944 --> 00:00:05.832
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:08.890
STEW FRIEDMAN: Hi, everybody.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.140
Thanks so much for being here.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.200
I see some old faces.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.450
There's a former student here.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.410
So I'll be cold
calling you, Vincent.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.340
You better be ready.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.340
No, it's great to be here.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.460
I was actually here
about six years ago.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.150
And it's wonderful to be back.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.790
So, yeah I'm going to be
a bit of a provocateur,

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.790
I hope, and get you
to think about things

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.530
in perhaps a different way.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.889
I want to challenge you to
think about this question.

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:35.430
And when I ask it-- I've been
asking this question a lot now.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.470
People have been asking me.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.440
I've been asking them.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.370
We've been having all kinds
of interesting conversations.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.786
Are you leading
the life you want?

00:00:40.786 --> 00:00:42.700
Most people say no.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.020
So that seems sad to me.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.520
And it creates all kinds of
opportunities for all of us

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.230
to rethink, well,
what does it mean

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.900
to be leading the life you want?

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.150
What do we know from research
in leadership development

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.410
and in work-life
integration, which

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.530
I've been doing for
almost three decades now?

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.670
What do we know about
how to bring together

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.010
the different parts of
life for mutual gain?

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.140
And what I hope to do
in this next 45 minutes

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.230
or so is to give you some ideas,
some models, and some tools

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.930
that you can use so
that you leave here

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.230
with a specific
plan for something

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.760
that you're going
to do that's new,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.560
that's you design to
make things better

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.410
in the different
parts of your life.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.750
So I want this to be practical.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.416
This is not just going
to be me talking.

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.180
In fact, at a certain
point very soon,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.340
I'm going to ask you to
take out your smartphones

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.780
or your computers
and go to a site

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.780
online and do an 18-item
assessment that will take you

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.020
about three minutes,
which will hopefully

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.150
provoke your thinking further.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.870
So thank you so much, again,
Ashley, for inviting me

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.170
and to all of you for coming.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.714
Let's start with this
question, because this

00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:52.130
is about leadership, and it's
about work-life integration.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.079
It's really a marriage of
those two fields, my approach.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.120
When I ask you this
question, what comes to mind?

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.560
What's your response
in a word or phrase?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.844
AUDIENCE: Creative.

00:02:05.844 --> 00:02:07.260
STEW FRIEDMAN:
Creative, yeah, OK.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.840
What else, what other thoughts?

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.373
Sorry?

00:02:09.373 --> 00:02:10.039
AUDIENCE: Gutsy.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.659
STEW FRIEDMAN: Gutsy.

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:13.640
AUDIENCE: Flexible.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.576
STEW FRIEDMAN: Sorry?

00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:15.290
AUDIENCE: Flexible.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.860
STEW FRIEDMAN: Flexible.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.068
Yeah, that's the one-- I've
been asking this question

00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:20.965
many, many times now over
the last few years in talks

00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:23.465
about leadership from the point
of view of the whole person.

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:25.730
And that's the one I hear
most no matter where I go,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.620
whether it's in Santiago, Chile,
or in Paris or in Brooklyn.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.509
It's the need to be
adaptive and creative.

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:33.300
AUDIENCE: Feminine.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.650
STEW FRIEDMAN: Sorry?

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.520
AUDIENCE: Feminine.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.520
STEW FRIEDMAN: Feminine.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.830
I don't usually hear
that, [? Gobi. ?]

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.470
But I think the bringing
together of the masculine

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.890
and the feminine
and of embracing

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.510
many different worldviews.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.570
Well, I want to start to get
your mental juices flowing

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.080
here, thinking about the
concept of leadership

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.360
and what it means to you.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.520
Because the models for
leadership that most of us

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.490
grew up with as children are
no longer fitting for the world

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.610
as it is.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.760
And so we need to rethink.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.040
So let me just take a little
bit of a backwards view.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.694
How has the world shifted
even over the 30 years

00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:13.610
that I've been teaching
at the Wharton School?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.746
That's correct, 30 years.

00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:17.870
Give me some love for that.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.630
[LAUGHING]

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.950
STEW FRIEDMAN: 30 years.
[INAUDIBLE], Vincent, come on.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.800
Things have changed a lot, so
all kinds of societal shifts.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.060
And we've been studying
at Wharton for decades

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.000
now how attitudes
and values of people

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.720
at our school and
elsewhere are changing.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.930
And of course they're
radical, the roles

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.150
of women in society,
the nature of work,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.450
what people expect of work.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.780
This, as you can see, if you
see that young man in the middle

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.000
there-- do you recognize him?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.570
That's me 20 years ago in
one of our early conferences

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.410
on how to integrate work
and the rest of life.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.040
So we've been at
this for a long time.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.550
And we went into the
field to look for models.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.554
Who's doing this well?

00:04:06.554 --> 00:04:08.720
Who's integrating the
different parts of their lives

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.550
in a way that works for them
and for their businesses

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.190
and for their families
and communities?

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.130
And how do they do it?

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.260
So that's what I'm
here to share with you,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.740
the fruits of that research
and where that has gone.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.130
But so many changes in terms
of what people expect of work.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.130
One of the questions we've
been asking for years

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.290
is, do you expect to
work at the same company

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.210
when you graduate
as when you retire?

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.460
So I've been asking this
since the mid-'80s of Wharton

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.310
students.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.985
Back in the mid-'80s, what
do you think the percentage

00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:40.693
of people who said,
yeah, that's my plan,

00:04:40.693 --> 00:04:43.253
I'm going to work
in the same company?

00:04:43.253 --> 00:04:44.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.480
STEW FRIEDMAN: It was about 70%.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.430
And a while ago,
not too long ago,

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.210
I asked the same question of
a group of 70 fresh-faced MBA

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.710
students.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.460
How many of you plan to
be in the same company

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.460
your whole career?

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.966
How many hands do
you think went up?

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:00.660
AUDIENCE: One.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.870
STEW FRIEDMAN: Well,
there were two.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.495
There were two.

00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:04.740
And then they were both
heirs to major fortunes, so.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.470
[LAUGHING]

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.060
All kinds of
changes in mobility.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.250
People expect to move, as
probably most of you do.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.880
And naturally the
digital age has

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.880
changed everything about the
nature of human communication

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.059
and how we build trust.

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:20.100
And most importantly, as
you think about yourself

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.183
as a leader-- and that's
who I see when I look out

00:05:22.183 --> 00:05:25.770
on this room, is a group
of developing leaders.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.210
So this is not about a
position in a hierarchy.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.530
It's really about
you as a person

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.110
and how you mobilize people
towards goals that matter.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.630
The big question is, what do
you focus your attention on?

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.550
And that's become
a lot harder thing

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.350
to manage in the
digital age when

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.610
the pull for your attention
is sitting either close

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.360
to your heart or in your
back pocket all the time.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.380
So now in the modern world,
the boundaries between work

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.570
and the rest of
life are no longer

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.400
on the basis of the natural
flow of seasons and time

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.720
and the sun rising
and the sun setting.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.500
It's all internal.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.130
You choose when to turn it
on, when to turn it off.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.690
Completely new, none of
us grew up with that.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.849
So learning how to respond
to that and globalization,

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.890
so many other aspects have
changed the leadership

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.931
landscape, which requires
us to think differently

00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:18.970
about what we mean
by leadership.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.522
So that's where I
want to start, just

00:06:20.522 --> 00:06:21.730
shake up your thinking a bit.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.510
Yeah what I learned as a kid
probably doesn't hold anymore.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.980
Yet I still probably
have it in my head.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.580
So we went out to the
field and found, all right,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.926
what is it that people
do who are successful?

00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:33.550
And we found that
there are these three

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.310
principles that they follow.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.950
And they seem to be
kind of universal

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.510
across business sectors and,
indeed, across countries.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.520
And I wrote about this in a
book called "Total Leadership,"

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.280
which really is the story of
this course that I created,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.960
initially at Ford Motor Company.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.980
So in 1999, I went to Ford Motor
Company for 2 and 1/2 years.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.590
I left Wharton and was head of
leadership development there.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.550
And there we had an
opportunity to create

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.880
some new ways of
learning leadership.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.480
And that's where we created
Total Leadership, which

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.262
is about how to produce
mutual gains in all

00:07:11.262 --> 00:07:13.220
the different parts, how
to improve performance

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.310
at work, at home, in the
community, and for yourself.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.620
So it's about what I call Four
Way Wins, which are a lot more

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.040
available to everyone
than most people think.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.780
Most people think you have
to balance and trade off.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.000
And that is the
wrong way to think

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.830
about the relationship
between work and life.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.034
Because when you think
about balance, you think,

00:07:36.034 --> 00:07:37.450
well, my career
is getting better.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.720
I'm getting a lot more money, a
lot more authority, a lot more

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.470
opportunities for
creative action.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.130
And what's wrong
with this picture?

00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:48.900
AUDIENCE: You didn't
start with it?

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.430
STEW FRIEDMAN:
Something-- say it again?

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.710
AUDIENCE: You didn't
start with it?

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.370
STEW FRIEDMAN: You
didn't start with what?

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.411
AUDIENCE: You said what's
wrong with the picture.

00:07:55.411 --> 00:07:57.794
You said that this
person has a [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:57.794 --> 00:07:58.710
Now I can be creative.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.988
But before they didn't.

00:07:59.988 --> 00:08:01.950
STEW FRIEDMAN: Ah,
yeah, so it's only

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.260
after a certain amount of time.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.190
But what I mainly
wanted to point to

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.560
was the fact that if you think
about the scales in balance

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.490
and one going up the and
the other going down,

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.022
it connotes this notion of
trading off all the time.

00:08:15.022 --> 00:08:16.230
And that's your mental frame.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.740
You're thinking, I have to give
something up in order to gain.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.070
And what I want
to challenge here

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.610
is the idea that it doesn't
have to always be true.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.710
Of course, sacrifice
is necessary.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.270
Of course there's going to be
disappointment, even tragedy.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:37.299
But in what we've seen now
through many years of work

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.970
in a number of different
organizations and with students

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.724
is that if you look for
opportunities to make things

00:08:45.724 --> 00:08:47.140
better in all the
different parts,

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.723
it's a lot more likely that you
can do that than if you assume

00:08:49.723 --> 00:08:50.690
you can't.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.000
So how do you do that?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.200
Well, you've got to think about
these different domains, work,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.400
home, community, and self,
and what they mean to you.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.430
And so what I described
in this book was

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.820
this step-by-step course,
a program, really,

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.620
that took about four months.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.450
And it starts with being real.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.890
So that's the first principle.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.196
What matters most to you?

00:09:13.196 --> 00:09:14.570
How do you act
with authenticity?

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.540
By clarifying what
matters most to you,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.169
so your values your vision.

00:09:18.169 --> 00:09:19.960
And you spend some time
writing about that,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.570
thinking about that, talking
about that with peers.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.960
What does it mean to be whole?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.650
To respect the whole,
to act with integrity

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.300
by bringing the pieces
together as one.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.430
So the root of the
term "integrity"

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.970
is one, integer, coherence.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.550
And there, it's a matter of
respecting the whole person

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.100
by identifying who
matters most to you

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.100
in the different
parts of your life,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.890
at work, at home,
in the community.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.090
Who are those people?

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.490
Why are they important to you?

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.716
What do they expect of you?

00:09:49.716 --> 00:09:50.840
What do you expect of them?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.900
And in speaking to them about
your mutual expectations,

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.410
clarifying them through
conversation, which also takes

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.570
a few weeks and
is pretty intense,

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.030
and from all of that
kind of diagnostic work,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.500
coming up with ideas
for innovation,

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.770
being innovative,
acting with creativity,

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:13.280
by experimenting continually
with how things get done.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.060
So there's a period
of a month or two

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.530
where you do experiments
that you design

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.804
that are intended to
pursue Four Way Wins.

00:10:19.804 --> 00:10:20.970
And you measure the results.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.930
And you reflect on what works
and what doesn't and learn

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.160
some new things about
what's possible in terms

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.330
of your creating change in
your world that's sustainable,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.550
because it works
not just for you,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.890
not just for your business,
not just for your home,

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:38.260
not just for your family, but
for all the different parts.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.170
Well, reflecting
on that, you draw

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.630
insights for how you can
take these ideas further

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.150
and discover more such
opportunities for creating

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.700
meaningful change in your world.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.640
But the problem
with this is that it

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.030
takes about four months.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.950
And people were
saying to me, well,

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.450
what if I don't
want the whole meal,

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:58.900
if I just want to
go to the buffet

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.240
and just take a little
piece here and there?

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.850
Right now I'm teaching this
course on a MOOC, on Coursera.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.276
And we've got
almost 90,000 people

00:11:09.276 --> 00:11:10.650
that have enrolled
in this class.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.500
So it's happening
all over the world.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.560
But that's a 1-week
process, and not

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.810
everybody's willing to invest.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.730
So one of the reasons why
I wrote the current book

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:24.160
was to create a way that
people could sample and access

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.840
content in a faster, easier way.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.820
But the more pressing
point was this question

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.120
that I got wherever I went
from super-high achievers.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.070
And that is, well, come on,
Stew, to be really successful,

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.470
don't you have to
sacrifice everything?

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.730
And the answer is no.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.070
Now, you might think of people
who are contrary to that.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.600
But I urge you to
think about what

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.460
success means for
them and for you.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.230
And you might be quite
skeptical right now as I'm

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.254
speaking and thinking,
well, yeah, Stew,

00:11:57.254 --> 00:11:58.420
you don't really understand.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.128
You don't get it.

00:11:59.128 --> 00:12:00.580
You don't know my family.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.070
You don't know my business life.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:02.930
You don't know my career.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:03.800
You don't know
where I come from.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.383
You don't know what
I'm trying-- well,

00:12:05.383 --> 00:12:08.450
of course I know
none of those things.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.090
But what I'm asking you to do
for this next half hour or so

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.080
is just keep an open mind
and see where this takes you

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.220
in thinking about
what might be possible

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.970
for you to take yourself
to the next level

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.261
that you haven't thought about.

00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:23.340
So the current
book is a response

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.040
to those two needs,
something faster and easier

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.830
and to help to demonstrate
that, in fact, the people who

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.520
are most successful
are those who

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.890
don't forsake the other
parts of their lives,

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.665
but rather embrace them.

00:12:40.665 --> 00:12:42.540
And that's what I want
to tell you about here

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.200
and hopefully inspire
you and perhaps

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.340
instruct you on how
you can develop greater

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.480
capacity for doing
the same thing.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.615
Let me ask you to think
about this chart here.

00:12:51.615 --> 00:12:52.990
You don't have to
write anything.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.570
I just want you to
think about this.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.903
So I'm going to ask you to
take a quick snapshot of what

00:12:56.903 --> 00:12:58.190
I'll call The Four-Way View.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.900
So you've got these
four domains, however

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.840
you want to define them work,
home, community, and self.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.840
If you were to take 100
points and allocate them

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.110
according to, right now,
how important each domain is

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.607
to you, how would you
allocate those 100 points?

00:13:12.607 --> 00:13:13.940
Just think about that for a sec.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:23.220
Now think about your waking
time during a typical week.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.370
Where is your attention?

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.150
Because now we're talking
about your attention, right?

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.360
Because this is your most
precious asset, not just

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.750
your physical presence, but
your psychological presence,

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.800
which are two different things.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.031
What did I just say?

00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:38.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.835
STEW FRIEDMAN: What
exactly did I just say?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.654
Can you repeat what I just said?

00:13:46.654 --> 00:13:49.640
AUDIENCE: The exact sentence?

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.796
STEW FRIEDMAN:
Close, paraphrase.

00:13:51.796 --> 00:13:55.220
AUDIENCE: Well, you [INAUDIBLE]
to see the difference between

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.860
the focus--

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.334
STEW FRIEDMAN: Yes.

00:13:59.334 --> 00:14:02.743
AUDIENCE: --on the
four categories

00:14:02.743 --> 00:14:05.414
and the real importance
you give them.

00:14:05.414 --> 00:14:07.830
STEW FRIEDMAN: OK, that's what
I had just asked you to do.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:08.954
So you're paying attention.

00:14:08.954 --> 00:14:11.760
So you're physically present
and psychologically present.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.090
Maybe not everyone here is.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.780
But it's hard.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.360
It's hard to manage
those boundaries.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.930
I want you to
think about where's

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.860
your head at when
you're awake, according

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.830
to these four domains.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.829
So you take another 100
points and allocate them

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:27.360
according to where your
mind is, all right?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.640
And now I want you to think,
quickly now, what would you

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.090
say about how satisfied you
are, your sense of well being?

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:40.340
And I know that you do
this here and that you

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.540
ask yourself these questions
as part of your regular survey

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.327
process.

00:14:45.327 --> 00:14:46.910
So you've probably
thought about this.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.520
How well are things
going for you

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.270
at work, at home,
in the community,

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:53.880
and for yourself, on a scale
of 1 to 10, from not at all

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.460
to wonderfully satisfying?

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.860
And then finally,
think about how well

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.700
things are going from the
perspective of other people.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.660
So if I were to have a
conversation, Vincent,

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:10.230
with the five people who
know you best at Google,

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.590
and I were to ask
them, how's Vincent

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.720
doing in meeting your
expectations for performance?

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.760
On average, Vincent,
on a scale of 1,

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.679
poorly, 10,
outstandingly-- and I

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:25.220
expect since you were such an
outstanding student in my class

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.990
20 years ago that it would
be a total 10, but maybe not.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.110
What would they say?

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.570
You don't have to answer this.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.306
But you probably all know this.

00:15:35.306 --> 00:15:36.930
Think about how the
same question would

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.600
go if we asked
members of your family

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.110
and in your community,
your friends, neighbors,

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.480
social groups, what have
you, and then for yourself,

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.710
your own performance in
meeting your own goals

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.240
for your intellectual
development,

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.750
your spiritual growth,
your emotional health,

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.960
your physical health.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.880
All right, so this snapshot
is the Four-Way View.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.310
And we typically do
this at the beginning

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.570
of this four-month program.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.700
And now what I want to
show you is what happens,

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.840
what people report-- and this
is a study of about 300 of them

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.460
who did this program not that
long ago-- four months later

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:21.230
when they completed the same
brief assessment, all right?

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.350
So let's look at
what has changed.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:27.450
So comparing the ratings-- this
is the average ratings for how

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:32.320
important the different domains
are before and after-- what

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.639
do you see?

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:35.430
[SOUND OF SEAGULLS]

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.640
Are we on the beach?

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.071
AUDIENCE: About the same.

00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:37.571
[LAUGHING]

00:16:37.571 --> 00:16:39.230
[SOUND OF SEAGULLS]

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.724
STEW FRIEDMAN: We
are on the beach.

00:16:41.724 --> 00:16:43.640
About the same, yeah,
exactly the same, right?

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.450
So there's no drugs here.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.110
This is not a cult.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.924
There's no surgery.

00:16:49.924 --> 00:16:51.090
Your values are your values.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.310
They don't shift.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.700
What does shift,
though, is we compare

00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.730
the tension, on average, where
it goes, before and after,

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.130
what do you see?

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.128
What has shifted?

00:17:03.128 --> 00:17:04.044
AUDIENCE: It goes out.

00:17:04.044 --> 00:17:05.240
It gets closer.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.490
STEW FRIEDMAN: It gets closer.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.370
And how does that happen?

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:09.829
AUDIENCE: Take away from work.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:13.079
STEW FRIEDMAN: Take
away from work, right.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.170
And that's what happens.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.960
When you ask people
to discover more

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.270
about what they care about,
what the people around them

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.849
need most from them,
and then experiment

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:25.010
with how to get things
done that are good for them

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.280
and good for you,
what typically happens

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.370
is some of the
attention shifts away

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.320
from work and towards
the other domains.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.750
And often when I present
this to senior executives,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.250
someone in the back
of the room will

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:41.430
say to her neighbor,
who is this jerk,

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.720
and why did we bring him here?

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.260
I don't understand what
we're talking about.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.718
Why would we-- I
mean, is this what

00:17:45.718 --> 00:17:48.690
they're teaching at Wharton now?

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:49.650
Less attention to work?

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.780
Why would we want that?

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.590
Well, we want that because
if you look at the results

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:59.440
in terms of improvements in
satisfaction and performance,

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.930
to a lesser degree, as assessed
by the people-- those are

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:07.360
delta percentages-- that 8%
percent, assuming these data

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.510
are valid, that's
a positive number.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.470
So how do you explain that?

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.750
Less attention to work, better
satisfaction across the board,

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.380
and improved
performance at work?

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.440
Less attention,
improved performance--

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.424
that seems paradoxical.

00:18:22.424 --> 00:18:23.340
How do you explain it?

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.476
What's your theory?

00:18:28.476 --> 00:18:35.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] then you
can perform better at work.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.470
STEW FRIEDMAN: Maybe when you
take care of things outside

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.270
of work, you are less
distracted when you're at work.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.290
That's one of the things that
we see time and time again,

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.530
less distraction,
better ability to focus.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.300
Any other reasons why you
might see this result?

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:49.800
Sir?

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.542
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] dropped
their standards on [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:52.542 --> 00:18:53.877
[LAUGHING]

00:18:53.877 --> 00:18:54.710
STEW FRIEDMAN: Sure.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.020
No, the measures change.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.300
And we ask about that, yeah.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.470
So you become more realistic
about what other people expect

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.580
of you, so it's easier to
meet those expectations

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.710
once you realize that they're
not as high as you thought,

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.520
yes, which in itself
is quite liberating

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.760
when you think about it.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.380
So yeah, you get a
more realistic picture

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.980
of what others expect of you.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.131
Other ideas?

00:19:16.131 --> 00:19:18.380
AUDIENCE: One specific example
of this that I've found

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.280
is that if I take
the time to work out

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.864
in the middle of the day, I feel
like I have more mental focus

00:19:22.864 --> 00:19:25.113
in the latter half of the
day instead of the afternoon

00:19:25.113 --> 00:19:25.870
malaise.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:26.844
STEW FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

00:19:26.844 --> 00:19:28.510
Your brain is working
differently, yeah.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.620
AUDIENCE: Like a runner's high.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.830
STEW FRIEDMAN: Like
the runner's high, yes.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.480
That does affect
your performance.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.070
And one of the most common kinds
of experiments that people do

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.490
is that they do physical
activity or they change

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.780
their diet so as to
make things better,

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.960
not just for their
physical health,

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.130
their mental functioning, but
their performance as assessed

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.610
by others at work, as
well as at home, as well

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.100
as in the community.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.230
So there are some
obvious reasons

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.840
why you'd see positive gains.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.340
Well, so that's one
way in which I'm

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.090
trying to address the skeptics.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.630
But it's usually not enough.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.061
They want to know, how
do I conquer the world

00:20:01.061 --> 00:20:03.560
and do all this other stuff,
all this nice stuff that you're

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.340
talking about,
Professor, Airhead,

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.890
doesn't really know anything
about the real world?

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.480
In fact, I was a
senior executive

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.260
at a big company
for a few years.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.430
So I have some idea.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.100
Well, that motivated me to
want to go out and find stories

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.180
of super successful
people, by most standards,

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.610
by any standard, and to
discover in their stories

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.670
how they did it.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.990
And so I've got
hundreds and hundreds

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.780
of biographies that
students have written

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.929
and that I have investigated,
and in this book,

00:20:34.929 --> 00:20:37.220
"Leading the Life You Want,
Skills for Integrating Work

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.594
and Life," I've
distilled it down

00:20:38.594 --> 00:20:41.000
to six people, some of whom
you know well, some of whom

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.670
you haven't heard of.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.271
And let me just
tell you they are,

00:20:44.271 --> 00:20:46.770
and then I'll tell you a little
bit about how they got there

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.540
and what you can learn
from their model.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.490
So Tom Tierney-- any of you
know who Tom Tierney is?

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.860
AUDIENCE: Bain.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.220
STEW FRIEDMAN: Yes, he was
the former CEO of Bain.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:02.660
And in his mid-40s in the late
'90s, he quit as CEO of Bain

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:07.950
and started up Bridgespan,
which is an offshoot that

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:12.120
brought Bain's consulting
services to the social sector.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.880
Now, Sheryl Sandberg
I know you all know.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.780
She used to work here.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:21.610
And four years ago when she
first got on my radar screen,

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.600
she wasn't the household
name that she is now.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.980
So there's probably
not much more

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.290
I can tell you about her
story, although there might be.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.980
Because my interview
with her for this book

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.980
revealed some things that
you might find interesting.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.400
Eric Greitens-- who
knows Eric Greitens?

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.700
OK, Eric Greitens is the
youngest of the group.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.960
He was a Rhodes scholar,
humanitarian worker

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.400
in the '90s, went to war-torn
areas, drug-infested areas

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.770
to basically feed children
and protect people,

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.290
but wasn't really
protecting them,

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.480
in fact, realized that
the heart is not enough,

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.890
that when bad guys
are out there,

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:06.700
you need a fist, too, to protect
people who are being hurt.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.470
So he became a Navy
SEAL in his late 20s

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.860
and then was deployed in
the Middle East three times,

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.570
won a Purple Heart
and a Bronze Star.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.030
And when he came
back, he created

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.390
an organization called The
Mission Continues, which

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:24.350
helps wounded veterans heal
by giving them opportunities

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.880
to serve here back at
home, remarkable story.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.090
Michelle Obama-- most
of you know who she is.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.840
But you may not
know about her story

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.480
and how she got to where she is.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.720
Julie Foudy-- soccer fans?

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.740
Hello?

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:40.560
No?

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.970
She's the co-captain of
the women's national team

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.780
that won the World Cup in
the '90s and two Olympic gold

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.890
medals.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.790
But she's in this
book, not because

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.710
of her prowess on the
field, but rather because

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.040
of her leadership
in women's sports

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.920
to create parity between men
and women in soccer and also

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.480
for her founding the
Sports Leadership Academy,

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:06.910
which empowers girls to become
great leaders through soccer.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.237
And finally, Bruce
Springsteen-- most of you

00:23:09.237 --> 00:23:11.570
are too young to know who
Bruce Springsteen is probably.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.470
[LAUGHING]

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.670
He's the oldest of the lot,
rock icon, true leader.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.960
OK, so what can we
learn from these people?

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.490
How do they get there?

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.870
Now I want you to actually
take out your machines

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.530
and go to this site,
because there's

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.260
an 18-item self-assessment
there that's

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.414
going to introduce
you to the skills

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:35.580
that these people have used.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.079
So I've taken those
three principles

00:23:37.079 --> 00:23:38.820
of be real, be
whole, be innovative,

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.720
and broken them down into
skills that anybody can learn.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.560
So first place to start
is assess yourself

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.920
on these skills.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.570
So tell me if you have any
problem getting to this site,

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:53.780
which is
qualtrics.com/totalleadership.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.850
Now, if you need a paper version
of this, Ashley has a copy.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.250
Anybody need paper?

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.630
Did you get who
you're most like?

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.777
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:03.777 --> 00:24:05.610
STEW FRIEDMAN: Who are
you most like, Becca?

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.068
AUDIENCE: You want
to guess, or no?

00:24:07.068 --> 00:24:09.682
STEW FRIEDMAN: No, no,
there's no way I'm guessing.

00:24:09.682 --> 00:24:10.390
I don't know you.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:11.431
AUDIENCE: Michelle Obama.

00:24:11.431 --> 00:24:14.224
STEW FRIEDMAN:
Michelle Obama, OK.

00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:14.890
AUDIENCE: Bruce.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:15.940
STEW FRIEDMAN: Bruce!

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.557
[LAUGHING]

00:24:16.557 --> 00:24:17.640
AUDIENCE: Sheryl Sandberg.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.820
STEW FRIEDMAN: Sheryl.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.661
Any Erics out there?

00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:23.160
Excellent.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.550
Tom?

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.500
Tommy T?

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.890
Let me tell you what this means.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.407
Can I move on?

00:24:36.407 --> 00:24:37.240
Who needs more time?

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.450
Raise your hand.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.440
OK, take another 30 seconds.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.290
Drew!

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.080
DREW: Hey, Stew.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:44.580
[LAUGHING]

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.300
DREW: Sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.470
STEW FRIEDMAN: No, we're just
finishing up a little exercise

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:54.194
here at this site,
which you can do later.

00:24:54.194 --> 00:24:55.110
It's great to see you.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.820
DREW: Great to see you.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.180
STEW FRIEDMAN: Eric?

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.096
Is there an Eric here?

00:24:57.096 --> 00:24:57.850
And a Julie, OK.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.240
So everybody's represented.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:05.280
All right, it's really just
to pique your interest.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.090
The way this works is
that your strengths

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.210
are most like the
three skills that

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:16.080
are particularly exemplary
in these six people.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.640
So let me just go through
those really quickly.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:23.910
So what I do in the book is
I've written "New Yorker" style

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.450
profiles of each of these six
people, which you will find

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.660
riveting reading,
I'm certain, 100%.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.460
So if you like stories,
the stories are fun.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.140
But then after each
story, I analyze them

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.090
in terms of these skills.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.350
How did they cultivate
these skills?

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.817
And what does it tell
us about how you can?

00:25:44.817 --> 00:25:46.400
And then in the back
half of the book,

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.270
and we're going to get
to that in a second,

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.050
there's a bunch of
exercises that I've

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:55.480
curated from modern research in
psychology and related fields

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.620
that you can pick and choose
to focus on developing

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.650
the skills that are
important to you.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.850
And we're going to do one of
those here before we're done.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.770
So with Tierney, for example,
envision your legacy,

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.120
really important skill.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:15.230
This is a guy who, since his
early days as a young adult,

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.430
has been journaling and
reflecting quite regularly

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:23.660
and almost obsessively
on his life.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.180
What am I doing?

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.640
Why am I doing it?

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.210
Am I going in a direction
that makes sense to me?

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.010
And back in the '80s, he
came up with this idea

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.510
of what he called a
make-a-difference company.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.260
He knew he wanted to
create a company that

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.150
was going to make a
difference in society.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:39.700
But he didn't know exactly
what that looked like.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.765
So he talked about it.

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:42.265
And the idea
germinated, germinated.

00:26:42.265 --> 00:26:45.560
It was 15 years later
that Bridgespan began.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.270
But he had in mind this idea
of envisioning his legacy.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.810
He's also really good at
weaving the difference

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:54.310
strands of his life
together and being creative

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.830
about seeing new
ways of doing things.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.490
But let's just focus on
that first one for now.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:04.060
With Sandburg, as she
told me, the first draft

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.260
of "Lean In"-- which
has sold how many books?

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.310
2 and 1/2 million?

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.312
The first draft of
that, her husband,

00:27:11.312 --> 00:27:13.910
who you may also know,
David Goldberg, the CEO

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.705
of surveymonkey,
told her, nobody's

00:27:15.705 --> 00:27:16.830
going to want to read this.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.020
It's really boring.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.000
Why was it boring?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.550
Well, it was quite
astute with respect

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.520
to the research on
unconscious bias

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.360
and the things that hold women
back at work and in society,

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.790
but what it was lacking was
any heart and soul or story.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.870
And yet, it was when
she kind of came out

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.830
at Barnard in the
commencement speech of 2011

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.097
and told her story
that people really

00:27:41.097 --> 00:27:42.430
started paying attention to her.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.830
So she's a natural
storyteller, and indeed

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.530
by then forcing herself
to bring those stories

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.290
into the narrative that
that book really came

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:56.840
alive and indeed launched
a kind of social movement.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.410
She's also exceptionally
good and exemplary

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:02.910
at building networks with
the women at Silicon Valley

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.350
and being creative about
resolving conflicts

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.390
between the different
parts of her life

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.080
in what seems very
clearly to be a 50/50

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.770
relationship with her husband.

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.820
All right, Eric Greitens-- I
told you something about him.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.000
It's hard to imagine a
better example of somebody

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.640
holding himself accountable
for what he really believed in.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.620
Because when he was
confronted with the idea

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:31.150
that I've got to protect these
people, not just feed them,

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.170
so what does that mean?

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:35.290
Well, it means I need to become
a Navy SEAL to be a fighter so

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.100
that I can actually do that.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.270
That's really holding
yourself accountable.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.580
But he's also very
good at taking

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.670
what he had cultivated
in one part of his life,

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:46.950
how he learned about
human resilience

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.950
in these terrible circumstances
and how people survive

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.000
by serving others,
and applying that

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.410
in the founding of
The Mission Continues.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.510
That's the founding idea.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.120
Wounded veterans want
to continue to serve.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.780
Let's create opportunities
for them to do that.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.180
And that's what The
Mission Continues is,

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.240
and indeed the first
fellow-- and now

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.580
there have been hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of them

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.880
who are placed in settings
where they can be of service.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.577
The very first one
is Chris Marvin.

00:29:16.577 --> 00:29:18.410
He was a student in my
class four years ago,

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.600
and that's how I found out
about Eric's amazing story.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.290
Michelle Obama-- none of these
people went to private school

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.910
or grew up with a lot of money.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.100
They made themselves
into who they are.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.910
Now, than they did have luck.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.780
They had talent, for sure.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.480
But what to me is inspiring
about these stories

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.130
is that they took
themselves further

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:43.740
and they are avid about
continually learning.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.360
And that's certainly
true of Obama,

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.810
whose story is especially
interesting when you think

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.607
about how she has
managed the boundaries

00:29:49.607 --> 00:29:51.190
among the different
parts of her life,

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.460
when she first moved
to the White House

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.734
and how she created as close
to normal an environment

00:29:58.734 --> 00:30:00.400
for her kids, which
was super important,

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.899
and how she's done
that and how they

00:30:01.899 --> 00:30:06.000
have done that as a family
is really quite instructive.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.070
Julie Foudy-- when she saw that
the men were getting a better

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:15.910
deal than the women in
soccer, she stood up and said,

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.037
that can't be.

00:30:18.037 --> 00:30:20.120
And she got the support
of people like Billie Jean

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.100
King and others to
figure out a way

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:27.250
to stand up to challenge
the status quo, based

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:32.260
on her knowledge, really
cultivated by her parents,

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.210
that you have to know what
really matters to yourself.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.210
Finally, Bruce, why
is Bruce in this?

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:41.560
Well, not only am
I a lifelong fan,

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.090
but he's also a
really good exemplar

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:47.775
of these skills of being
yourself wherever you go.

00:30:47.775 --> 00:30:51.330
of being very clear with other
people what matters to you

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.300
and listening to them,
including his audience,

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.540
and responding to
them all the time.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.860
And he's a teacher.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:03.680
If you watch is his 2012
keynote at South by Southwest,

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.620
it's really remarkable, a
history of rock and roll

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.440
and what he's trying to teach
young musicians about what

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.660
the field is all about.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.210
If you look at the video of
the 2014 Rock and Roll Hall

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.880
of Fame induction ceremony,
his bandmate and friend,

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.010
Steve Van Zandt says to him,
65 years old this guy is,

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.270
and he's got bigger
global market

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.140
share than he's ever
had in his life.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.580
They just continue to grow.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.960
Why is that?

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.250
Because he's constantly
pushing the boundaries

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.800
of his creative talent.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.000
And he makes other people
around him do the same.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.930
He creates cultures
of innovation.

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.750
All right, so this is
a very quick snapshot

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:46.500
of what these skills are--
what it means to be real,

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.590
to know what matters, to be
those values wherever you are,

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:54.870
to strive to align what you
do with what you care about

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:58.790
and to convey what matters
to you through stories;

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.520
to be able to
envision your future

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:05.060
and hold yourself accountable
for pursuing what matters most;

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:10.380
to be whole, clarifying
what matters most to you;

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.160
to be helping other people
all the time so that you're

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.430
building supportive networks
and taking what you have in one

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.610
part of your life and
applying it in the others;

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:22.134
and being smart about how
you manage boundaries.

00:32:22.134 --> 00:32:24.050
Sometimes that means
creating firm boundaries,

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.650
where you focus just on one
person or one thing at a time.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.330
Other times it
means merging them.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.970
But it's all about
conscious, deliberate choice

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:35.610
and experimentation and weaving
the different pieces together

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:37.420
in a way that works
for you and for them.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.010
To be innovative means
focusing our results

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.930
and letting the means
for their achievement

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.790
happen flexibly among
the people around you.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:48.520
To be creative about
resolving conflicts--

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.290
where you see a conflict, look
differently at the situation.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:56.230
Where is there an opportunity
for this to be a win-win?

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:58.774
And to be looking
back and saying,

00:32:58.774 --> 00:33:00.940
we don't have to do it that
way, and looking forward

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.580
and saying, how can we
do it some way different,

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.790
and having the
courage and support

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:08.390
to try new ways of
getting things done.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.930
And finally to be teaching
other people all the time.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:11.930
So these are the skills.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:13.250
This is a little overwhelming.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.350
Don't freak out.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:17.417
What I want you to do is think
about one of these right now,

00:33:17.417 --> 00:33:19.000
the one that is most
important for you

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.792
to focus on now based on what
you were just thinking about,

00:33:22.792 --> 00:33:24.250
perhaps as you were
listening to me

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:26.920
talk about these six
remarkable people

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.230
or in the self-assessment
you just did.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:34.130
If you had to choose one
that you could strengthen,

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:34.680
choose one.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:42.060
And then what I
would like you to do

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:45.792
is actually come up with an
idea for how you could do that.

00:33:45.792 --> 00:33:48.000
And then talk about it with
somebody else in the room

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.760
that you're willing
to talk to about this.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.520
So here's what I'm
asking you to do.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.420
It's real simple.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.480
I think you will benefit from
this, so give it a shot, OK?

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.000
Which is the most important
one for you to focus on?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.520
What could you do right now
that would make you stronger

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.637
on that skill?

00:34:04.637 --> 00:34:06.720
What action could you take
in the next week or so?

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.300
Be creative.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.659
And finally, if you did this
thing, this new thing that

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:20.900
would strengthen this skill,
what impact would that

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.364
have on your work, either
now or in the long game,

00:34:25.364 --> 00:34:26.989
maybe over the course,
your whole life?

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:28.989
Because that's how I think
about the integration

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:31.380
of the different parts, not
balance minute-to-minute.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.230
That's impossible.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.540
Forget that.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.610
Think instead about harmony over
the course of your whole life,

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:43.639
as these people have, and as all
of us have the capacity to do.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:47.170
At home, in the community,
and for yourself,

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.260
where would be the positive
impact of this thing

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.926
that you might try
that would strengthen

00:34:50.926 --> 00:34:53.429
that skill that's
important to you?

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:55.706
You can sketch out
a note about this.

00:34:55.706 --> 00:34:57.830
This is actually what's on
the back of the handout,

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.121
but you probably don't need it.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:03.960
There is a handout.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.260
Do you have it?

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:10.272
So just take a minute to
think about, what could I do?

00:35:10.272 --> 00:35:11.980
What could I do now
that would strengthen

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.460
the skill that
matters much to me?

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.820
And what positive
impact would that

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.810
have on the different parts?

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:25.080
All right, so just take a
minute to think of an idea.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.902
It can be half formed.

00:35:26.902 --> 00:35:29.680
[CHATTER]

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.870
All right, so here's
what I'd like you to do.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.020
Do you have an idea?

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:36.770
AUDIENCE: Not yet.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.728
STEW FRIEDMAN: Not yet.

00:35:37.728 --> 00:35:39.810
You're still thinking?

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.440
I want you to think with
somebody else, somebody

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.720
preferably who you don't know.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.570
That would be better.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.030
So what I'd like you to do
for the next five minutes,

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.790
find a discussion partner,
preferably someone

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:52.940
you do not know.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.599
It's better that
way and be more fun.

00:35:56.599 --> 00:35:58.890
Where you take a few minutes,
here's what I'm thinking.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.330
What do you think?

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.490
And she does the same.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.263
Is this something
you're willing to do?

00:36:04.263 --> 00:36:05.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.613
STEW FRIEDMAN: OK,
it's really simple.

00:36:06.613 --> 00:36:08.430
So you're coaching here, right?

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:12.206
So all you have to do is, how
would practicing this skill

00:36:12.206 --> 00:36:13.580
create a greater
sense of harmony

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.520
among the different parts
and improve all them?

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.240
And what exactly would
you be doing here?

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.790
And how would you know this
was improving your performance?

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.990
So just ask those
questions, pay attention,

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:29.280
give someone else the gift
of your caring attention

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.859
for just a few minutes.

00:36:30.859 --> 00:36:35.350
[CHATTER]

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:52.960
STEW FRIEDMAN: How can you
help each other going forward?

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.520
I can tell you how.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.900
If you talk to each
other occasionally,

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.250
maybe just text
or a quick hello.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.630
How is that idea going?

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:03.740
Are you doing it?

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.460
This is really important.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.544
And I know this from
literally decades

00:37:07.544 --> 00:37:08.960
of trying to do
this kind of work.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.430
You cannot do it on your own.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:12.346
And if you have somebody
else who's interested

00:37:12.346 --> 00:37:14.606
and wants to help you and
learn by teaching you,

00:37:14.606 --> 00:37:17.500
you stay connected somehow
in a very light way.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.100
It doesn't have to be a
deep, long conversation.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.090
Just continue to pay attention.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:25.540
And I hope you
will continue that.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:29.902
Let me give you a really quick
overview of the three dozen

00:37:29.902 --> 00:37:31.860
exercises that are in
the back half of the book

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.600
that you can choose from
to focus on these skills.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:38.100
So there's two exercises
that I've, again, curated

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:42.220
from the literature on how
you create positive change

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:43.640
for each one of the skills.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.670
So I'll just mention
a couple of them.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:46.660
And then we'll wrap up.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:50.260
So one of my favorites is
find the larger meaning

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.715
in terms of trying to align
your actions with your values.

00:37:52.715 --> 00:37:55.090
And all that really asks you
to do-- it's pretty simple--

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:57.467
is think about what's the
big purpose of what you're

00:37:57.467 --> 00:37:59.050
trying to do with
your work every day?

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.675
A lot of people don't
think about that.

00:38:00.675 --> 00:38:04.490
And when you do, you
see a greater connection

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.459
between what you're
doing, or you

00:38:06.459 --> 00:38:08.500
can find a greater connection
between what you're

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:13.520
doing every day and what
is really important to you.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.690
Autobiography-- that's also
pretty straightforward.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:19.710
And if you want to
get good at conveying

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.924
your values through stories,
which other people want

00:38:21.924 --> 00:38:23.840
to hear from you, because
they want to see you

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.230
as a human being just
like them, someone who

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:29.470
has struggled to try to achieve
something that matters and has

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:32.780
faced adversity and
somehow surmounted it,

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:36.310
you reflect on the two or
three or four critical episodes

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.880
of your life history that
have shaped who you are.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.940
And then figure out a
way to convey those,

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:45.250
if you're willing, to people who
would be interested in hearing

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.800
about them as a way
of conveying, again,

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.260
what matters most to you.

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.900
Time travel is another
cool thing to do.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.650
It's 15 years from now.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:57.010
Describe a day in the life.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:59.206
What happens?

00:38:59.206 --> 00:39:00.850
Who are you with
when you wake up?

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:01.910
What are you doing?

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:03.870
What impact are you
having on the world?

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:06.540
So those are some
simple exercises

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:11.380
to do to help you to get better
at acting with authenticity

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.060
by clarifying what
matters most to you.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.230
For being whole, a
couple of exercises

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:17.967
that you might want to try.

00:39:17.967 --> 00:39:19.550
We heard something
just like this now,

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.070
the Segment and Merge exercise.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:25.650
So here what you
do is take some way

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:28.830
in which the two parts of your
life, or three or four of them,

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:29.550
intersect.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.240
And try segmenting them.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.990
And that's kind of
what you just did here.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.630
Bounding time and place
for just one thing,

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.430
and it could be just
for five minutes,

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.740
or it could be for a day,
or it could be for week.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:46.380
But try segmenting in a way
that you haven't before so

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:50.740
that you can bring total
focus to one person or thing.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.410
See what happens.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.220
And then try the opposite.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.720
Try bringing together
two ports your life

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.040
that normally would
be very separated.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.570
And what happens there?

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.590
And what you discover
by consciously

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:05.490
and deliberately experimenting
with segmenting and merging

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:09.190
is how to be smarter about
creating those boundaries.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:11.500
It really just take stepping
back, experimenting,

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.210
and seeing what happens,
and then learning from that.

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:19.520
So those are some ideas
about being whole.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.940
Now, exercises for
practicing some

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.400
of the skills of
being innovative--

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.820
I'll just mention two,
and then we'll wrap up.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.582
Crowdsourcing solution-- so most
people in this room I suspect

00:40:30.582 --> 00:40:31.790
are probably pretty creative.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:32.990
But sometimes you get stuck.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:36.789
And you see a dilemma, and you
just can't find a solution.

00:40:36.789 --> 00:40:38.830
A really simple way to do
this-- and you probably

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.550
do this in your work life pretty
regularly-- bring together

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:44.420
a couple of people who
you trust and you're

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:47.930
willing to talk about
opportunities for alternatives.

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:49.700
And generate creative
solutions with them.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.590
So you crowdsource
solutions to problems

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:55.290
that you're facing in the
different parts of your life.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:59.070
And finally, challenging
your beliefs-- research

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:04.150
on behavioral therapy
for depression,

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:07.790
cognitive behavioral therapy,
is quite profound insights

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:12.359
from that literature, which show
that a lot of what holds people

00:41:12.359 --> 00:41:14.900
back from trying something new
that's going to make them feel

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.608
a greater sense of
control in their lives

00:41:16.608 --> 00:41:19.160
is their beliefs about
what might happen

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.240
if they did try something new.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.780
And if you challenge
those, and the exercise

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.270
that I describe
in the book helps

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.280
you to just in a simple
way look at the beliefs

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.810
that you have about a
certain course of action.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:34.740
It actually minimizes your
own resistance and your fear.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.280
There's lots more, but we're
reaching the end of the hour.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.640
I hope that these ideas
have sparked your thinking

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:49.420
about what you can do to build
the capacity to bring together

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.150
the different
parts of your life.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.570
Let me just ask
you really quickly,

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:55.550
what do you take
away from what we've

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:56.510
been talking about
here, what I've

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.009
been saying for the
last hour or so?

00:41:58.009 --> 00:42:00.280
What's the big idea for you?

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.544
AUDIENCE: Action.

00:42:01.544 --> 00:42:02.460
STEW FRIEDMAN: Action.

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.110
That's it.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.980
Just do something, yes.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.880
So I begin the second
part of the book,

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.850
after telling the stories, with,
when you read these stories,

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:15.040
you'll see the thing that comes
through is just this idea.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.770
These people don't sit still.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:19.070
They're moving,
moving all the time

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.364
and then reflecting
on what it is

00:42:21.364 --> 00:42:23.030
that they're learning
from their action.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:24.154
What else do you take away?

00:42:24.154 --> 00:42:25.250
AUDIENCE: Small changes.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:27.249
STEW FRIEDMAN: Small
changes towards a big idea.

00:42:27.249 --> 00:42:29.730
It's something we
all know intuitively.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.300
And it's within
everyone's grasp.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.230
And that's the beauty of small.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:37.720
You make it small enough
so that other people aren't

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.140
terrified by what you're trying,
and they see that, in fact,

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:44.840
what you're trying to do is good
for them, too, assuming it is,

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.340
and of course, that's part of
what you think about here when

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.380
you take the four-way view.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:49.920
What else?

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.690
Let's get one more.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:52.219
Yeah?

00:42:52.219 --> 00:42:54.010
AUDIENCE: There's no
such thing as balance.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:56.010
STEW FRIEDMAN: There's
no such thing as balance.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.120
All right, that's
a fitting-- I mean,

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.850
you can talk about balance,
but it's misguided.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:05.735
The metaphor I prefer
is the jazz quartet.

00:43:05.735 --> 00:43:07.760
So you've got these
four instruments, right?

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.440
And they're
improvising on a theme

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.007
over the course of
your whole life.

00:43:11.007 --> 00:43:12.590
You're trying to
make beautiful music.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:16.410
But sometimes you only
hear the trumpet, right?

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:18.880
Sometimes maybe it's only
family or it's only work.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.200
Sometimes you just hear
the bass and the drums.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.380
It doesn't have to all
be at the same amplitude

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:28.110
at the same time, thinking
instead about harmony

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.400
over the long haul.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.960
That's what these
folks have done.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.080
They also prove
that achievement,

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.350
significant achievement
in the world,

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:43.530
comes from taking action, taking
compassionate action that's

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:45.990
designed to take whatever
is unique about you,

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.980
your passions, your
skills, your talents,

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.990
and bringing them to
bear in a positive way

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:51.400
on the world around you.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.150
That's what each of
these people has done.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:54.525
And if you think
about the people

00:43:54.525 --> 00:43:57.190
you admire who have had
lives of significance,

00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:00.270
I'm pretty sure they will
have done the same thing.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:04.760
So the paradox of the title is
that leading the life you want

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:10.320
requires striving all the time
to be helping other people.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.790
That's what's liberating is the
idea of taking what you have

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:15.420
and bringing it to the world.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:20.700
And that finally, accomplishment
in one's career or public life

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.630
comes not so much at the
expense of the other parts,

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:26.440
but rather because
of the commitments

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.540
that you have to the
different parts of your life.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:33.820
And you can develop these
skills if you focus on doing so.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.770
And I hope that you'll
continue to do that.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:38.370
So thanks for joining us
today and for your attention.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:40.440
And thanks again,
Ashley, for inviting me.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.390
