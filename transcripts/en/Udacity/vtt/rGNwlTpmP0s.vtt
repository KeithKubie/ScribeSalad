00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.970
In the last lesson, you learned how to
implement your monetization strategy.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.005
As well as some basic techniques for
monitoring the success of your strategy.

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:13.100
&gt;&gt; And in this lesson, you'll
learn how to iterate on your model

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.105
if you find that it's not performing
in the manner that you expect it to.

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:20.765
Now, this ability to quickly react to
change is one of the advantages that

00:00:20.765 --> 00:00:23.175
you have over big companies.

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:27.531
&gt;&gt; Remember, our goal here is to tailor
the monetization solution per user.

00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:32.174
In this lesson, we will see what to do
in order to improve our process and

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:32.744
reach our goal.
