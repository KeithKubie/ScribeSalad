00:00:00.775 --> 00:00:03.747
- [Instructor] We can
calculate the depth d of snow,

00:00:03.747 --> 00:00:06.929
in centimeters, that
accumulates in Harper's yard

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:10.110
during the first h hours of a snowstorm

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.359
using the equation d is
equal to five times h.

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.193
So d is the depth of snow in centimeters,

00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:18.860
h is time that elapses in hours.

00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:23.926
How many hours does it take
for one centimeter of snow

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:25.853
to accumulate in Harper's yard?

00:00:25.853 --> 00:00:28.337
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:28.337 --> 00:00:30.543
All right so we wanna figure out what h

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:33.399
gives us a d of one centimeter.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.582
Remember d is measured in centimeters.

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:37.556
So we really just need
to solve the equation

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:40.737
one centimeter, when d is equal to one,

00:00:40.737 --> 00:00:42.570
what is h going to be?

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.381
And to solve for h we just need to divide

00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:47.424
both sides by five.

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:49.189
So you divide both sides by five,

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:50.884
the coefficient on the h,

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:54.831
and you are left with h is equal to 1/5.

00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:56.805
And the unit for h is hours,

00:00:56.805 --> 00:00:58.972
1/5 of an hour.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.238
So 1/5 of an hour.

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:03.307
If they had minutes there,

00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:04.909
then you would say well 1/5 of an hour,

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.022
there's 60 minutes,
well this is 12 minutes.

00:01:07.022 --> 00:01:09.460
But they just want it
as a number of hours,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.457
so 1/5 of an hour.

00:01:11.457 --> 00:01:13.291
How many centimeters of snow accumulates

00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:14.291
in per hour?

00:01:15.404 --> 00:01:17.331
Or this is a little bit of a typo.

00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:20.234
How many centimeters of snow accumulate in

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:22.695
we could say one hour,

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:24.297
in one hour, or they could have said

00:01:24.297 --> 00:01:27.386
how many centimeters of
snow accumulate per hour.

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:29.058
That's another way of thinking about it.

00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:31.821
So we could get rid of per hour.

00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:35.350
So pause the video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.067
Well there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:39.530
Perhaps the easiest one is to say,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.757
well what is d when h is equal to one?

00:01:42.757 --> 00:01:44.429
And so we could just say

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.400
d when h is equal to one,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.606
when only one hour has elapsed,

00:01:48.606 --> 00:01:50.417
well it's going to be five times one

00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:51.668
which is equal to five,

00:01:51.668 --> 00:01:54.872
and our units for d are in centimeters.

00:01:54.872 --> 00:01:56.915
So five centimeters.

00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:58.998
Let's do another example.

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.510
Betty's Bakery calculates
the total price d

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.600
in dollars for c cupcakes

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.248
using the equation

00:02:07.248 --> 00:02:08.915
d is equal to two c.

00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:13.703
What does two mean in this situation?

00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:18.138
So pause this video and see if
you can answer this question.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:22.364
So remember d is in
dollars for c cupcakes.

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:24.199
Now one way to think about it is,

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.262
what happens if we take d
is equal to two times c,

00:02:28.262 --> 00:02:30.816
what happens if we divide both sides by c?

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:32.233
You have d over c

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.926
is equal to two.

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:37.481
And so what would be the
units right over here?

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:39.547
Well we have dollars, d dollars,

00:02:39.547 --> 00:02:41.358
over c cupcakes.

00:02:41.358 --> 00:02:43.025
So this would be $2,

00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:47.326
because that's the units
for d, per cupcake,

00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:49.741
dollars per cupcake.

00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:51.830
This is the unit rate per cupcake.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.129
How much do you have to pay per cupcake?

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.265
So which of these
choices match up to that?

00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:58.402
The bakery charges $2 for each cupcake,

00:02:58.402 --> 00:03:01.072
yeah $2 per cupcake, that looks right.

00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:03.046
The bakery sells two
cupcakes for a dollar.

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:05.275
No that would be two cupcakes per dollar,

00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:06.858
not $2 per cupcake.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:09.872
The bakery sells two types of cupcakes.

00:03:09.872 --> 00:03:11.405
No no we're definitely not
talking about two types

00:03:11.405 --> 00:03:13.797
of cupcakes, they're just
talking about cupcakes generally,

00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:15.979
or I guess one type of
cupcake, we don't know,

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.710
but just cupcakes generally
is $2 per cupcake.
