What we need in a certificate is something that communicates the public key of the server

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to the client in a way that the client can trust.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here's one way to do that.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We'll make the certificate include the name of the domain and its public key.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's assume we're using RSA, so this would be an RSA key.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That's the public key, and that means that the server knows the corresponding private key.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is encrypted using a private key of some certificate authority

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that the client has to trust.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The question is how should the client verify the certificate?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Here are the possible answers. Select the best one.
