00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.470
Few mental afflictions are as humbling or
as terrifying as what is known as ‘Pure’

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.970
OCD or, more colloquially, Intrusive Thoughts.
In standard Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.150
a person is haunted by a worry that compels
them to repeat an often counterproductive

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.790
or fruitless action with manic intensity:
handwashing, turning off gas pipes, checking

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.980
their pulse and so on. But in ‘pure’ OCD,
there is no outward, physical action; the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.079
problem unfolds – hence the name – purely
in the mind, yet it is, if anything, an even

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.499
more distressing condition. Image result for
Frank auerbach The Pure OCD sufferer is tortured

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:44.519
by thoughts that they want to do, or have
done, some of the most censored and abhorred

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:51.010
acts in our societies, acts that they themselves
despise and fear at an intellectual level.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.239
They grow convinced of their wish, for example,
to murder a loved one, harm a child sexually

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.679
or assault a stranger. They cannot shut out
the idea that they may become, or have already

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:07.210
shown signs that they are, a psychopath, a
rapist or a paedophile. They scan their minds

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.100
ceaselessly, looking for evidence to confirm
their dreadful apprehension. So burdened are

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.570
they by these thoughts, they may not be able
to go anywhere near children or may take fright

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.229
at the sight of a knife in a drawer. Left
alone with a colleague, they may panic that

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.229
they could lose control and lunge inappropriately
at them. At the station, they are flooded

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.530
with anxiety at the feeling that they may
push their partner or their child under a

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.810
train. Having to think of oneself in these
terms quickly drains life of any of its pleasure.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.280
The Pure OCD sufferer wakes up every morning
certain that they are one of the worst people

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.090
ever to have walked on the planet. There is
not, as yet, a foolproof way of treating the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.719
condition – but discussions of how to approach
it reveal large differences in assessments

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:01.350
of how the mind operates. Psychiatrists tend
to prescribe antidepressants, in order to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.289
lift the general mood of sufferers and thereby
lessen the tendency to ruminate to the point

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.480
of exhaustion. CBT psychologists will try
to argue closely with the intrusive thoughts,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.030
so that eventually sufferers can logically
acknowledge that they truly have no intention

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.280
of harming anyone or doing anything obscene.
But it is psychotherapists

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.000
who have what is perhaps the most imaginative
and unexpected solution. They do not target

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.940
the thoughts themselves or argue with them
directly. They don’t try to reassure people

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.780
logically that they are not about to murder
a loved one or harm a child – because they

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.830
don’t believe that this is what is actually
at stake and judge that offering reassurance

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.440
on these points only legitimates a pattern
of thinking that has no basis in reality.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.190
They locate the origin of the problem somewhere
quite different: the sufferer of pure OCD

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.510
has, first and foremost, a problem with self-esteem
and shame. The unfortunate person feels, at

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.830
some level, utterly disgusting and beyond
the pale – and will in the background have

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.480
been feeling like this for a long time. Somewhere
in their past, normally as a result of very

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.750
traumatic and degrading childhood relationships,
they will have derived an impression that

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.681
they did not deserve to exist. Their current
thoughts are not plans for the future, they

00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:30.300
are attempts by the mind to find a match between
their basic sense of self and what would be

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.700
needed by their society to concur with it.
They are a move to bring about a form of dreadful

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.370
inner equilibrium, ensuring that the judgement
of the world falls in line with the judgement

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.290
of the self. Cases of Pure OCD are sometimes
diagnosed just after sufferers have achieved

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.340
something rather positive in the eyes of others:
they have been promoted or begun a fulfilling

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.760
relationship or mastered a project. It should
be a cause for celebration but happiness simply

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.650
feels unwarranted. By latching onto thoughts
of complete illegality, one is assured that

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.850
one’s self-esteem will remain at rock bottom.
Interestingly, in societies that find religious

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.290
transgression particularly abhorrent, Pure
OCD sufferers will be haunted by feelings

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.940
that they have offended God and are about
to be outed as sinners. Behind Pure OCD is

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.690
a person’s needs to find a reason to feel
awful, it isn’t about this or that condemned

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.910
act – and as the definition of awful changes,
so too will the manifest content of the intrusive

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.280
thoughts. The disease is anchored in self-loathing,
not in blasphemy, incipient paedophilia or

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.990
murderous intent.This analysis opens the way
to treatment. What the sufferer of pure OCD

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.000
needs, above all else, is to begin to repair
their self-loathing and shame. They need to

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.940
learn, through repeated encounters with an
outsider who casts a generous and sympathetic

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.660
eye on them, that they are not the worthless
being they take themselves for. Their problem

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.650
began with a deficit of love – and needs
to be healed by a loving act of witnessing.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.120
Pure OCD thoughts are not wishes, they are
symptoms of radical self-distrust – and

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.930
these will start to lift once the afflicted
learn that most vital of arts: being a friend

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:34.760
to oneself. Our book what is psychotherapy
tells us exactly what going through therapy

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.819
is like and why it is so important.
