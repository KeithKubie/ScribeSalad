00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.685
MEGAN BURNS: So how
is it going?

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:06.310
VANESSA RAY: Good,
how are you?

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.900
MEGAN BURNS: Contragulations.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.090
What is the square root of pi?

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.040
No, I'm just kidding.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.087
I've got some easier
questions for you.

00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:13.041
[LAUGHS]

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.720
VANESSA RAY: You're
smart, I suppose.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.460
MEGAN BURNS: No, I guess let's
start at a basic level, about

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.880
the storyline in itself.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.490
I mean, is this personal
for you?

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.810
DEVYN WAITT: Yeah, it's
definitely personal.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.680
It's not like the story of
my life or anything.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.880
But yeah, it's personal in that
I think it's like little

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.330
pieces that I've seen from my
life and my friends' lives all

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.880
cobble together.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.500
MEGAN BURNS: Well, it comes
off like super naturally.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.295
And I mean, obviously, that
is due to good acting.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.220
But how much creative freedom
did you have as an actress?

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.690
Or how scripted?

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.470
Or what's was that
process like?

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.250
VANESSA RAY: It's funny,
it does come across--

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.690
I think, when you watch it, it
all seems very spontaneous.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.430
But it was directed.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.000
The scenes were worked out and
rehearsed within an inch of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.700
their life.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.884
[LAUGHS]

00:01:05.884 --> 00:01:06.688
It was!

00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:07.505
No, that's a compliment.

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:08.210
It's good.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.770
It means that we had time
to work on things.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.540
MEGAN BURNS: Well, it's
super seamless.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.045
So that's amazing.

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:15.150
I would never have guessed.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.990
VANESSA RAY: Well, it's so
stylistic, in a sense, so to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.390
really narrow in on that
and hone that in

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.980
took a lot of practice.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.680
And Devyn's a great director.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.550
She knew what she wanted.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.740
DEVYN WAITT: I did know
what I wanted.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.600
But I was talking to Megan about
this the other day, and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.770
she mentioned that they had flew
down to Florida, and then

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.100
within a day had to become
best friends.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.120
But I think there was also
something to taking both of

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.300
them, plucking them out of
lives, and when they first

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.760
met, forcing them to stay
together in Florida, where

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.730
they didn't know anyone.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.220
So a natural friendship
developed between them, and I

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.160
think that helped a lot.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.880
Because they couldn't go home
at the end of the night to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.480
their real lives.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.090
They were like, oh, shit,
we're in Florida.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.450
VANESSA RAY: Yeah, we shared an
apartment and in this sort

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.500
of like, I don't know,
elderly community.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.740
MEGAN BURNS: Because
Florida is.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.180
VANESSA RAY: Yeah.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.740
And I think really it was.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.520
We had like a bottle of wine,
and just set it on the table,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.920
and we're like, who are you?

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.610
[LAUGHING]

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.970
VANESSA RAY: Tell
me your life.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.440
And so we truly became best
friends in like 24 hours.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.250
It was great.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.370
MEGAN BURNS: And then everyone
was split up for

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.430
the separate scenes.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.910
VANESSA RAY: Which also,
I think, fed into our

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.180
relationship in the
story as well.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.610
It was kind of perfectly
paced.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.210
Because we were together
at the beginning.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.250
And then she continued shooting
her stuff in Florida,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.850
and then I went to New York.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.880
And there was sort of like a
weird competition that we had,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.050
in a good way.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.310
When she came back to set, she
was like, oh, that's not how

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.210
we did it in Florida.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.556
We didn't wear that
makeup in Florida.

00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:54.760
And I was like, well, this
how we do it in New York!

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.430
And it really fed into
that sort of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.430
you're-going-to-stay-there,

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.850
I'm-going-to-stay-here kind of thing.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.210
DEVYN WAITT: It was nice.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.500
It was actually sort of awkward
when Megan first got

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.100
back and they were a little

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.010
uncomfortable around each other.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.310
And that was making
me really excited.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.330
Because I like, yes.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.740
That's like how it would be.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.240
Even your friend that you're
closest to, that first day,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.400
when you're getting back in the
groove of getting to know

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.270
someone, it's a little
uncomfortable.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.280
And that just naturally started
happening between them

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.040
because they'd been separated
for so long.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.190
VANESSA RAY: And we'd had these
separate relationships

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.930
on set with the people that we
were working exclusively with.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.790
And so it was like, wait, so you
love that person more than

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.760
you love me?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.700
What does this mean?

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.760
It was very interesting,
actually.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.990
MEGAN BURNS: Right.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.930
So in terms of casting
then, did you have

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.225
certain people in mind?

00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:41.750
Did you know each other
before this?

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.440
VANESSA RAY: No,
we hadn't met.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.747
But we did a chemistry test
with Megan and the guy who

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:52.790
plays Adam, Adam,
who plays Adam--

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.140
MEGAN BURNS: Will he ever
not play a role

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.670
that's Adam is the question.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.220
There's a lot of Adams
in his life.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.510
And there were several girls,
and they were all wonderful.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.030
But it was like you had to be
dumb if you didn't see that we

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.620
had an immediate chemistry,
an immediate friendship.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.300
DEVYN WAITT: And actually, the
character of Adam as I

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.470
envisioned him was really
different than who

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.370
Adam ended up being.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.610
And in the same way, their
chemistry was undeniable.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.779
And just what he brought to the
role and his presence, we

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.070
re-imagined it a little bit.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.600
Because he came in and we
were just really taken

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.180
with what he did.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.900
And at first, I actually was
worried that he was too

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.550
attractive.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.370
Because I was like, oh
wait, there's no way

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.810
she's not to like him.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.590
[LAUGHING]

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.220
DEVYN WAITT: I think that he
made Adam actually a better

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.560
character, because he's a little
more dynamic as opposed

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.040
to just being sort of--

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.820
I don't know, I think I
originally imagined Adam being

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.650
a little wimpier or something.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.490
MEGAN BURNS: I can't even--

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.420
I don't know, maybe that is a
credit also to "Girls." His

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.805
character is a little bit
scary on that one.

00:04:51.805 --> 00:04:55.341
So congrats for making him
not scary in this one.

00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:55.810
[LAUGHING]

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.210
DEVYN WAITT: We didn't
even know.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.460
We hadn't seen it.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.280
Maybe like five years ago
or something crazy.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.540
VANESSA RAY: I'm like,
wow, I look really

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.740
young in this movie.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.700
[LAUGHING]

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.680
DEVYN WAITT: It was
a long process.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.330
MEGAN BURNS: I was going
to ask that, too.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.280
How long exactly was the sort
of process like in terms of

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.800
when you wrote it?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.530
I'm sure it's huge.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.270
DEVYN WAITT: I think,
man, I don't even

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.710
remember the years anymore.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.600
But it took maybe a year and
a half to write the script.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.640
But it was was like there was
pieces of it and ideas that

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.340
were like little sketches that
I'd written all the way back.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.050
Maybe it was like two or three
years of thinking about it

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.330
before I even started
writing it.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.280
And then it took us about a year
to get the ball rolling

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.270
from when Nichole came on board,
and we started saying,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.860
OK, we're actually to do this.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.780
And then production took--

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.030
it was a long time.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.705
We filmed in Florida.

00:05:45.705 --> 00:05:46.530
We filmed in New York.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.850
And then we had to regroup and
raise some more money to film

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.110
the intro, "The Most Girl Part
of You," the prelude.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.600
So I would say production took
about three months, three or

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.130
four months.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.100
And then post production was
like a year and a half.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.060
So it took forever.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.740
MEGAN BURNS: Oh, wow.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.340
Well, speaking of "The Most Girl
Part of You," how did you

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.140
decide on that as an opener?

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.550
Because that's an interesting
little short to have.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.970
DEVYN WAITT: Well, Amy Hempel,
I'm just a massive fan of her.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.430
And I've always really
loved this story.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.060
And actually, I feel like I very
rarely re-read things.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.240
But a lot of her stories are
more like songs or something,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.390
where I think you can go back
and appreciate them over and

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.780
over again.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.040
Because I mean, there's plot
there, but you're not reading

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.260
it just to find out
what's happening.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.140
You're really appreciating all
the different words and the

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.970
little lines.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:32.980
And so I had just read it.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.540
And I was thinking, imagining
it like a movie in my head,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.100
and really got excited about the
idea of making it into a

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.570
short film.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.890
Because it's just such
a great story.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.955
But then I was-- oh, they
turned those off.

00:06:43.955 --> 00:06:45.540
That's so much better.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.630
VANESSA RAY: You guys
have no idea.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.570
There's like cameras of us here,
so we're both kind of

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.753
watching ourselves.

00:06:50.753 --> 00:06:53.940
[LAUGHING]

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.190
VANESSA RAY: Sorry!

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.165
DEVYN WAITT: Anyways, yeah, I
love this story, and I knew I

00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:00.020
wanted to make it into a film.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.220
But I was like, uh, not certain
how many people really

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.550
see short films.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.640
And I really have always loved
the idea of a short film

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.500
playing before a feature,
like a throwback thing.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.960
And so once I got that idea
in my head, I started to

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.720
recognize all these parallels
between the two.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.640
And then I think one of the
biggest reasons for me that I

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.330
really like the idea of putting
a short film before

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.240
the feature is I think a lot of
someone's experience when

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.950
they watch anything or read
anything is the frame of mind

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.700
they're in, like when
they see it.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.047
And I think that having a short
film play before "Not

00:07:33.047 --> 00:07:35.180
Waving But Drowning," if
someone's thinking about

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.490
whether or not they locked
their keys in the car,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.150
anything that's in their mind
that lulls you into really

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.100
specific place.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.580
And so I like the idea of
knowing where someone's head

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.095
is at right when "Not Waving
But Drowning" starts.

00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:49.450
So there's all those reasons.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.850
And then when I started to
dissect the stories, I think

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.890
they're both about
transformation and different

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.130
periods in a girl's life,
different transformations she

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.650
goes through.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.620
It was a lot of different
reasons, I guess.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.350
MEGAN BURNS: Yeah,
well, it's nice.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.810
I wish they would have
that instead of

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.980
trailers, as per usual.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.830
That's another thing I was
going to ask you about in

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.380
terms of putting it on YouTube
as opposed to traditional

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.620
screening, even if it
was small scale.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.520
Why did you decide
that that was--

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.520
I mean, it's a cool avenue to
take because I think that's

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.470
the way that things are
going, the direction.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.750
So to be on the spearhead
of that is amazing.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.530
And obviously, it's
convenient.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.630
Didn't have to get dressed
to watch it.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.790
VANESSA RAY: That's cool,
but I think it was

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.210
probably a big decision.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.600
Because Devyn always said from
the beginning-- she was like,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.789
I want people to see this movie
in the movie theater.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.760
You will see this on
a screen always.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.780
DEVYN WAITT: Loudly.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:40.980
VANESSA RAY: Loud.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.640
Yeah, it always has
to be very loud.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.140
So I think you should almost do
a video beforehand, say how

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.146
to watch the movie.

00:08:48.146 --> 00:08:50.370
DEVYN WAITT: So we tried that
a little bit on our website.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.400
MEGAN BURNS: I saw that
on the website.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.045
VANESSA RAY: Turn it up!

00:08:52.045 --> 00:08:53.090
DEVYN WAITT: We're like,
here's how you

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.500
should watch it--

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.220
super loud with headphones.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.840
Well, like what she had
mentioned, I definitely

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.920
imagined when I was
first making it.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.570
Because I've always gone to
the theater, I love the

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.940
theatrical experience.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.260
But I think when we started to
get down into it, we just

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.640
wanted as many people as
possible to see the movie.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.012
And I think that YouTube was
just, I don't know, something

00:09:13.012 --> 00:09:14.740
we didn't really think about
until late in the process.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.370
And then we're like, well,
what's really important here?

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.210
And I think at the scale we're
at, it was most important for

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.110
us to have as many people
see it as possible.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.920
And the idea that it's
so easily shareable--

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.680
like someone could post a link
to it on a Facebook wall.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.260
You can post it anywhere, and
there's nothing gating anyone

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.370
from watching it.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.030
So I think we were really
excited about that.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.660
And also I re-framed it, and
imagining how personal it is

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.070
for someone to sit on their
bed with headphones on and

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:41.950
watch it on a laptop.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.250
And I think there's a lot
of beauty to that

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.550
experience as well.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.720
And we're still continuing to
push to have theatrical

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.290
screenings.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:51.120
But I think we just got really
excited about doing things in

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.280
a different way and doing things
really in line with who

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.995
we see as the audience
for the film.

00:09:54.995 --> 00:10:00.530
And I know that there's a lot of
young girls who spend a lot

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:01.430
of time on YouTube.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.320
So we wanted to put the movie
where our audience was.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.970
MEGAN BURNS: I think its a good
little preface to coming

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.400
to New York.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.140
It doesn't de-glamorize it, but
it says this is probably

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.620
not what's going to
happen to you.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.400
Well, for Bed-Stuy.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.510
Why did you choose Bed-Stuy
out of everywhere?

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.830
It's sort of the new
Bushwick, I feel.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.510
DEVYN WAITT: And it's funny,
too, because it wasn't that

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.620
way when I wrote the script.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.300
I mean, maybe.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.880
I don't really know much about
how neighborhoods evolve.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.700
But when I first moved here,
well, I first lived in

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.870
Flatbush in my friend's
grandmother who had recently

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.280
passed away's room, with all
of her stuff still there.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.460
And that was really
terrifying.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.070
Yeah, it was weird.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.755
There was still newspaper
clippings that she had pinned

00:10:43.755 --> 00:10:46.040
up, and I just had
to look away.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.460
And then a couple of my friends
lived in Bed-Stuy.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.810
And so it just seemed
like where the Kim

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:50.740
character would live.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.880
Because it is.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.800
I actually love Bed-Stuy.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.490
MEGAN BURNS: It's great.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.365
DEVYN WAITT: I go to
jazz night there.

00:10:55.365 --> 00:10:56.280
I really love it there.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.270
But it seemed where
she would be.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.950
And like someone who had been
in New York for a little

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.780
while, maybe where they
would end up.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.750
But for the adult character who
had just gotten here and

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.180
imagined, like, walking down--

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.075
I don't know, I feel like it's
not at all what she imagined

00:11:09.075 --> 00:11:09.810
New York as.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.160
And so I thought it was
sort of perfect.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.490
Because it's kind of like if
you've been here for a little

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.830
while, I feel like you settle
into a place more like that.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.240
But if you're starry eyed and
dreaming of New York, you're

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.150
like, where am I?

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.210
MEGAN BURNS: So when you first
moved here, were you waving to

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:24.900
people on the streets saying,
uh, I'm here.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.225
DEVYN WAITT: Probably.

00:11:25.225 --> 00:11:26.936
I don't know.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.110
VANESSA RAY: I definitely was.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.745
I was so excited to
come to New York.

00:11:31.745 --> 00:11:34.276
And I was just like, hey!

00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:35.130
Hey, guys!

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.260
DEVYN WAITT: Some friends.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.560
VANESSA RAY: I was
really excited.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.250
I definitely feel like
that was a real

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.810
slice of life moment.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.540
MEGAN BURNS: I definitely
resonated with that.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.810
I was asking people, which
way to Manhattan?

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.240
And there was a big sign
on the subway--

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:46.390
Manhattan.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.760
VANESSA RAY: I would
just stand.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.310
I would just stand
and look lost.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.940
And inevitably, somebody would
come up and be like,

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.813
hey, you need help?

00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:54.380
Yeah.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.180
People are so nice here,
actually, if

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.660
you just look dumb.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.370
[LAUGHING]

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.300
MEGAN BURNS: They want to
be able to give you the

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.720
directions.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.740
VANESSA RAY: People love
to help you when

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.960
you're not very smart.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.086
It's great.

00:12:05.086 --> 00:12:06.000
MEGAN BURNS: [LAUGHS]

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.020
VANESSA RAY: There's a tip.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.190
MEGAN BURNS: Yes, absolutely.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.800
And I was also going to
ask you, can we please

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.570
talk about the horse?

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.980
I'm sure that that was a
logistical nightmare.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.070
DEVYN WAITT: I saw Nicole.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:16.630
She's here.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.920
VANESSA RAY: What's
his name again?

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.455
DEVYN WAITT: Smokey Joe.

00:12:18.455 --> 00:12:20.290
VANESSA RAY: Smokey
Joe, that's right.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.480
DEVYN WAITT: Yeah.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.810
So what do you know
about the horse?

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:23.530
MEGAN BURNS: Everything.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.650
Everything.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:25.240
No.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.590
I mean, I heard from Nicole that
you did not film that in

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.860
the city, because MTA
said no, we're not--

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.710
DEVYN WAITT: They said no.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.590
I think they laughed at her for
a really long time when

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.655
she called.

00:12:34.655 --> 00:12:35.910
MEGAN BURNS: Can you imagine
that phone call?

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.430
Can we just put a horse
on a train?

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.710
DEVYN WAITT: Actually, speaking
of coming to the

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.170
city, like, hi, there was a lot
of stuff with production

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.210
where I'm sure Nicole
just called up MTA

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.246
dot zero, zero, zero.

00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:49.610
Hey!

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:50.800
So we'd like to do this thing.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.140
Because this was our first
time doing this

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.960
all across the board.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.170
And I think that, actually, that
helped us a lot more than

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.650
it hurt us.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.000
Because we are kind of naive and
just asked people things,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
as opposed to having that
mentality that people were

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.760
going to say no.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.740
We were just like,
well, let's see.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.190
And I think it worked out.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.190
We didn't get the
subway train.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:13.530
But we got to film it at a
transportation museum.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.880
MEGAN BURNS: Yeah, I noticed
the train was a little

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.070
different inside.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:16.210
DEVYN WAITT: Stop it.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:16.720
No you didn't.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.600
[LAUGHING]

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.300
MEGAN BURNS: Not at all.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.175
It was super real.

00:13:19.175 --> 00:13:22.170
It was a hallucination
on my part.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.840
So for you, was a difficult,
or was there a difficult,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.160
scene to film?/ Because
again, it all

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.570
comes off very naturally.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.670
But did you have anything that
made you hesitant or

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.860
uncomfortable?

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.730
VANESSA RAY: Oh gosh.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.785
MEGAN BURNS: Or was there
something super easy?

00:13:36.785 --> 00:13:37.870
VANESSA RAY: I don't know.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.530
Well, I don't know.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.040
The horse stuff was tricky,
because he would

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.560
never look at me.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.490
And I think I had this in my
mind that this horse was going

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:51.460
to be connected to
me and love me.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.630
Smokey Joe was cool, he just
was not into me at all.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.880
DEVYN WAITT: He was trying
to the tree at the

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.640
other end of the train.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.770
VANESSA RAY: Yeah, he's
was really into the

00:13:58.770 --> 00:13:59.516
other end of the train.

00:13:59.516 --> 00:14:00.330
He's like, I'm good.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.640
This girl seems depressed.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.680
And he just wanted
to get away.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.680
So that was tricky, working
with a horse, I guess.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.940
But no--

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.910
DEVYN WAITT: I actually pulled
him to you, though.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.860
I feel like we probably
have hours and

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.880
hours of that footage.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.880
And like everything that's good
is in the movie, which is

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.570
really, really short.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.170
But I think at one point,
Vanessa just grabbed his face

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.550
and pulled it towards her.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.840
And then he stopped for a
second, so it worked out.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.170
VANESSA RAY: He finally
paid attention to me.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.160
It's really hard.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.300
No, I don't think anything was
particularly like, oh, that

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.250
was hard scene.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.750
But I think there was stuff to
maneuver and figure out.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.490
I think like the party scene on
the rooftop, that sort of,

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.310
like, semi was this a rape?

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.500
What is happening?

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.750
That scene was interesting to
figure out how we were going

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.330
to shoot it and what we
were going to do.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:53.890
It was tricky.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.800
And I was really obsessed
with weird things.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.120
Like I got really obsessed with
how does Adele get on the

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.000
train after she's been raped.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.300
I was so concerned that people
were going to be like, where

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.670
did she get her subway card?

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.080
It was a thing.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.740
I was so worried, because I
was like, if this really

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.320
happened, I would need to have
an ID and a subway card.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.760
DEVYN WAITT: I feel like Adele
would figured out, though.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.650
I feel like she's the kind of
girl that could have no shoes,

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:17.430
nothing, and just--

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.990
VANESSA RAY: She did.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.330
You know she jumped the train.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.705
She figured it out.

00:15:20.705 --> 00:15:24.340
But yeah, that was like
a big conversation, I

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.228
remember one night.

00:15:25.228 --> 00:15:26.560
It was like 2:00
in the morning.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.950
DEVYN WAITT: Someone get
Vanessa a MetroCard.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.060
She needs it.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.820
VANESSA RAY: Oh my God,
this girl's still

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.870
talking about the MetroCard.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.890
I don't know.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.560
MEGAN BURNS: Right.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.440
VANESSA RAY: Things you
don't think about.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.020
MEGAN BURNS: Exactly.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.740
I don't know if you can speak
on behalf of Megan at all.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.180
Obviously she had a different
experience in Florida.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.920
But Sylvia's character's
fantastic.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.020
That's super great.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.980
So I guess, did she say anything
about how different

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.810
her experience was to yours?

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.220
Was there anything
that stood out?

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.060
VANESSA RAY: I think maybe
the pace was different.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.275
It was really hot.

00:16:04.275 --> 00:16:07.480
DEVYN WAITT: It was
really hot.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.830
VANESSA RAY: It sounds silly,
but it was so hot.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:10.400
MEGAN BURNS: No, it's true.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.070
It was intense.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:11.840
Her stuff was intense.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.180
DEVYN WAITT: I'm used to it
because I'm from Florida.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.270
But yeah, we actually had this
kid from Boston, who's

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.940
wonderful, who worked
on the movie.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.380
And I have just such strong
memories in my head.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.760
I've never seen sweat
actually pour.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.860
But every image in my mind of
him working, he's got a

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.335
cigarette in his mouth, and he's
carrying something really

00:16:26.335 --> 00:16:29.190
heavy, and his eyes are closed
because there's so much sweat

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.470
falling in his face.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.530
And we had a lot of people that
weren't from the South or

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.260
Florida or anything.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.740
And they were all just
like, really?

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.640
This is what it's like?

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.260
So it was definitely hot.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.350
And also, people were really
welcoming in Florida.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.850
Everywhere we filmed,
they were like.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.390
wow, great to have
you guys here.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.410
And then in New York, it was
like really, really fast.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:51.420
And people were trying to hurry
us along or kick us out

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.840
of wherever we were.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.140
MEGAN BURNS: Right.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.700
Well, where did you film
it exactly in Florida?

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.030
It was Tampa area?

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.370
VANESSA RAY: Yeah, I'm from
Oldsmar, which is a small town

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:00.140
outside of Tampa.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.070
And so that's where we stayed.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.150
The film was actually set in
Bartow, because I wanted it to

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.069
be a little more central.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.880
I liked the idea of the
characters being a little more

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.560
landlocked.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.890
Because I actually live really
near the water, so it's, I

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.040
don't know, not as stifling.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.010
But yeah, we filmed all around
Pinellas County.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.010
And we filmed some stuff
actually in Bartow, which is

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.200
in central Florida.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.950
MEGAN BURNS: Well, it's just
nice to have that contrast of

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:24.079
the outdoors as opposed to,
obviously, a big city.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.329
I mean, I was thinking
about it today.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:26.869
I was like, I don't even know
where you would find puffy

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:27.750
dandelions here.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.980
I guess maybe.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.550
DEVYN WAITT: Fun fact, you
actually can't find them in

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.353
Florida either.

00:17:31.353 --> 00:17:32.630
VANESSA RAY: Yep.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.010
Yep.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.130
Yep, nope.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.720
They don't actually
grow there.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.300
So I think there was like PAs
that had to drive hours and

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.220
hours just to get those four.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.460
And I had a scene where
I pick one.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.400
And that didn't work.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.890
DEVYN WAITT: Because the
dandelions are all wilted.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.250
VANESSA RAY: It just
looked crazy.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.440
So we had to-- yeah.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.820
DEVYN WAITT: I think
I was driving near

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.480
where you're from.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.450
I was driving in the Pacific
Northwest somewhere.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.510
And I saw this beautiful field
of dandelions at sunset, and

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.800
all their little dandelion
heads were glowing.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.050
And I just transported
that memory to

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.170
Florida for some reason.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.800
So it made sense when
I wrote it.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.980
So we were looking everywhere.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.640
And we're like, where is this
field of dandelions?

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.970
And my uncle's actually a
botanist, and he was like,

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.236
it's not in Florida.

00:18:15.236 --> 00:18:17.170
So I was like, we'll make one.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.590
So there's actually only like
four dandelions in the movie,

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.320
just placed in such a way that
it looks like there was a lot

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:23.820
more of them.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.920
MEGAN BURNS: That's amazing!

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.940
Well, I'll know that there's
less wishing opportunity in

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.180
Florida now before I go.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.540
DEVYN WAITT: You can wish
on other things.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.900
You can wish on pennies.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.580
MEGAN BURNS: Railroad tracks?

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:34.050
Birthdays?

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.380
VANESSA RAY: There also
are mermaids there.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.370
DEVYN WAITT: Yeah, there's
real [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.780
VANESSA RAY: We shot down the
street from a place where

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.710
there were real mermaids.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.590
DEVYN WAITT: Yeah, Wickywashy.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.140
There's legitimate mermaids.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.130
MEGAN BURNS: They're making an
NBC comedy, I heard, that is a

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.090
mermaid who washes up in Miami
or something and is going to

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.480
become a bartender.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.460
VANESSA RAY: She's
going to [LAUGHS]

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.590
become a bartender.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.700
MEGAN BURNS: And discover the
mysteries of life at the bar.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.520
So I don't know.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.850
And so tell me a little bit
about the original score, too.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.045
Because that is also magical.

00:19:04.045 --> 00:19:05.670
VANESSA RAY: It's so good.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.530
DEVYN WAITT: So yeah, the
composer is a good friend of

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.280
mine named John.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.260
And I'd worked with
him before.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.400
We've known each other for
a really long time.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.770
And so he was always going
to do the music.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.790
And it's actually, that's
why post took so long.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.160
Because he's incredibly
talented,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.210
but we're both like--

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.030
the music was always--

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.315
I wanted, obviously, parts of
it to feel almost just like

00:19:30.315 --> 00:19:32.450
long music video sequences,
or really seamless.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.750
I wanted the whole movie to feel
like a song, or like a

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.610
record that you like to listen
to over and over again.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.730
And so he and I had been talking
about ideas for it for

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.130
years, even before the
movie started.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.910
And I kind of liked the idea of
having his voice in their

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.140
intermittently, so it's
almost like a

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.410
little bit of a narrator.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:54.680
When this voice comes
in, he's familiar.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.270
VANESSA RAY: Devyn had made a
mixed CD for us, for Megan and

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:03.280
I, before we started filming
of just music.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.365
And it's little bits of John's
stuff and some other songs

00:20:07.365 --> 00:20:10.260
that she sort of thought
influenced the movie.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:15.840
And that completely influenced
the whole filming

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.750
process, for sure.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:17.210
MEGAN BURNS: That's
a good idea.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.220
VANESSA RAY: It was
really cool.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.000
I still listen to it
and work out to it.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.860
I run to it.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.575
DEVYN WAITT: Oh yeah,
we're going to

00:20:21.575 --> 00:20:22.870
make a Spotify playlist.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:23.090
MEGAN BURNS: Oh nice.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.670
VANESSA RAY: Yay!

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.250
DEVYN WAITT: If I can,
I think you have it.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.400
And I like the idea, too--

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.880
some of my favorite parts in
movies are when you can relax

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.490
and feel what just happened.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.660
So there's a lot of little
pieces where I wanted it to

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.310
be, like maybe something
big happens between the

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:39.760
characters, and there's a period
of time where you can

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.290
just relax and let it happen,
let it sink in, let yourself,

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.460
I don't know, project your
own life onto it,

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.240
and then move on.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.780
MEGAN BURNS: No, it's nice to
have process time, for sure.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.510
And yeah, it felt like a little
Sofia Coppola-esque

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.910
there from "Marie Antoinette."
But let me just look at our

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:58.530
clock here.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.930
Because I don't want to
go all the questions.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.940
So audience, you guys have some

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.350
questions, comments, concerns?

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.536
Because I can continue
for a very long time.

00:21:14.536 --> 00:21:17.020
VANESSA RAY: That's like
a threat almost.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:17.710
I'll continue.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.660
MEGAN BURNS: Do you want to
continue hearing me talk?

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.710
VANESSA RAY: Yeah, two
years ago probably.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.760
Oh, you have to go to the mic.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.630
DEVYN WAITT: You have
a spotlight, too.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.600
VANESSA RAY: Oh my gosh.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.250
This is my friend
Jessica Waxman.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:35.660
Hi, Jessica.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.625
AUDIENCE: I'm Jessica Waxman.

00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:37.660
Thank you, find my light.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.780
So I saw it two years ago, and
then I definitely thought that

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.050
we'd be seeing it sooner.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.850
And what was the process like
in between for you?

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.100
Was it difficult?

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.580
Did you at some point
think that it

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.390
might not have happened?

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.920
Or has it been a process of just
getting the right people

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.730
attached to it to continue
to push it through?

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.880
Because all an all, it's been
about a five year process, is

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.670
that correct?

00:21:58.670 --> 00:21:59.530
Four years?

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:00.860
DEVYN WAITT: It's been long.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.740
AUDIENCE: With Vanessa,
I think.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.100
VANESSA RAY: What?

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.240
AUDIENCE: I just remember you
getting so excited about the

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.140
script and the film.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:06.600
VANESSA RAY: Oh, I loved it.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.450
Yeah, it's taken about
four years, I think.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:14.250
But yeah, we had a first
edit, right?

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.340
And then--

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.370
DEVYN WAITT: I don't
really know what

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.140
happened, to be honest.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.690
VANESSA RAY: And then
we edited it again.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.940
And then Devyn had a minute
where you needed to

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.810
walk away, I think.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.050
DEVYN WAITT: I had to get
up and just walk away.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.790
And then we came back and
cut like 15 minutes out.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.030
And then I was like, yeah.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:26.930
VANESSA RAY: Yeah, and then
you felt good about it.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.000
DEVYN WAITT: And then I
felt good about it.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.460
AUDIENCE: So you need
some time to--

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.610
VANESSA RAY: There was about two
years to cut 15 minutes.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:33.940
DEVYN WAITT: Yeah, there
was a little of that.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.190
And also, we were going
to festivals.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:40.680
And I think it was Nicole, who
produced, and I. So we're

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.050
like, well, what do
we do with it now?

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.940
To make a movie, I feel like
that's something I can

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.490
see the steps to.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:50.980
But as far as figuring out what
to do with it-- which

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.990
now, ultimately, is put it
on YouTube for free.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.420
So [LAUGHS]

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.080
maybe it shouldn't have been
so difficult to get.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:57.200
[LAUGHING]

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.950
But we wanted to go to
festivals, and we wanted to

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.790
try all these different
things and screen it

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.580
for different people.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.110
And we had a big screening in
Florida where I'm from.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.080
And then we had one
in New York.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.100
And so I think we've just been
enjoying the process of

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.340
showing it to people
little by little.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.990
And I don't know, now it just
feels right, I guess,

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.120
to let go of it.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.100
AUDIENCE: Congratulations
on timing and the film.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.680
And I can't wait to see how
it evolves from here.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.240
DEVYN WAITT: Me too.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.080
Tell your friends.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:24.720
VANESSA RAY: Thanks.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.420
Thanks a lot.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.822
[APPLAUSE]
