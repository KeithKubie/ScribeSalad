00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.520
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer:
Well, good afternoon.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.210
My name is Jason Steinhaeur.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.770
I'm a program specialist
with the John W. Kluge Center

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.540
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.850
Before we begin today's
program, please take a moment

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.250
to check your cellphones
and other electronic devices

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.300
and please set them to silent.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.990
I'll also make you aware that this
afternoon's program is being filmed

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.860
for placement on the Kluge
Center website as well

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.550 position:56%
as our YouTube and iTunes playlists.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.250
I encourage you to visit our
website, loc.gov/kluge, K-L-U-G-E,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.600
to view other lectures delivered
by current and past Kluge scholars.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.880
Today's lecture is presented by the
John W. Kluge Center at the Library

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.950
of Congress and cosponsored by the
embassy of the Republic of Bulgaria

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.690
as part of the 2016 European
Month of Culture celebrations.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.060
I wish to express our thanks
to the Bulgarian Embassy

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.630
and the EU Delegation to United
States for their collegiality

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.120
and collaboration this month.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.820
And to mention that in partnership
with the EU, we are featuring

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.500
on our blog all month the stories

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.200
of European scholars
who've conducted research

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.750
at the Kluge Center including
today's speaking Theo Christov,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.410
who is of Bulgarian heritage.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.450
And we are delighted and
honored this afternoon

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.270 position:56%
to have the ambassador from Bulgaria
to United States here with us today.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.340
And so, I'd like to take this
moment to call her Excellency

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.810
to offer a few words of welcome.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:14.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.340
&gt;&gt; Elena Poptodorova:
Good afternoon.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.020
I very well understand
why our master

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.420
of ceremonies today did
not dare mention my name.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.390
It can be a tongue twister.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.150
So I will pronounce
for you very dear host,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.890
also because there won't be many
days left for me to pronounce it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.280
out loud in this country.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.610
I'm just about to finish my
tour as ambassador of Bulgaria

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.830
to the United States of America
and what a greater opportunity.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.050
I even think if I'm not
mistaken, and I'm not,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.630
this is indeed my last
speaking event.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.100
So, that is to be recorded in my
mind at least and in my heart.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.670
And you will know why I
think it is so special.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.690
It is the event itself,
but, of course,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.310 position:56%
it falls into a much bigger context.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.150
So, you'll-- if you're here in this
room, you know why you're here.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.340
It is, of course, the very
interesting presentation,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.260
which I've been looking
forward to listening to.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.420
And I must confess some
ignorance, myself, on the subject.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.260
So it's very welcome in
a personal way as well.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:36.930 position:56%
But also, you would know that this
is not just a single one time event.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.580
May 9th is the day of Europe.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.770
And luckily, happily Bulgaria is
already part of the European family

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.350
of nations, who together
celebrate this date,

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.450
this occasion in this
town and elsewhere.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.840
So, it is a coordinated
program of all 28 countries

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.970
that happens all over the world.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.460
So, you can imagine what the
rate opportunity it is to be part

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.310
of such a massive-- such
a broad reaching effort.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.610
It is also extremely intense
and interesting in this town.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.810
All embassies are engaged in
different cultural programs,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:26.150
so you have all types of tastes
to be met, to be satisfied.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.480
It is visits through the embassies.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.030
It is cultural programs.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.610
It is the arts.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.570
It is literary programs.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.330
Some-- it is dance.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.950 position:56%
But I would say that today's event,
which is happily and thankfully part

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.580
of the program in cooperation
with probably the most,

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.140
I would call it sublime
institution in this country,

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.620
which is the Library of Congress,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.500
is the most intellectual
one, the most rewarding one.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.080
And I believe all of us
will only be very happy

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.740
to take the benefit
of this presentation.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.310
Why I said that this will be a
much-- and I think-- this might--

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.710
few words will be co-located
in a broader context.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.030
I moved in odd, by the fact
that we are holding this event

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.290
in this building in cooperation
with the Library of Congress

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.820
and the Center, the Kluge
Center and, of course,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.050
the delegation of the
European Union.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.990
The Library of Congress is not
only the institution that it is,

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.230
but it has been Bulgaria's
partner for so many years.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:47.550
And I must confess that I
take not only pride, humility,

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.630
but also deep emotion in
having been long time partner

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.750
and friend of Dr. Billington.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.380 position:56%
I think this country and the Library
of Congress have been blessed

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.400
to have this tighten
of intellectual thought

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.920
and of humane attitude
like Dr. Billington.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.240
We, of course, did not
always deal with the doctor,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.550
with Dr. Billington, I
mean, at that highest level.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.640 position:56%
We had great partnership with the
different teams here at the Library.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.210
We tried to provide and to
offer here as much as we could

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:35.030 position:56%
from our own archives, which were
not known and not admitted to travel

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.020 position:56%
to this library and to this country.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.730 position:56%
So, in so many words, I just really,
really wanted to let you know

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.110
that it was not only a protocol
courtesy or a diplomatic language

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.160
that I use in saying how
special the event is.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.130
For me, I find it serendipitous,
it's kind of a great,

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:01.750
great conclusion of a great
relationship, of course, personal

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.660
but also professional

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.920
as my country's ambassador
to this country.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:18.250 position:56%
So, I will really be self complacent
or if I would touch presentation

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.250
of Theo, because I won't be able
to do it as well as you would.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.900
So, I step away to be
part of the audience.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.440
We're really looking forward
to your presentation, Theo.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.240
Thank you.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:39.790
[ Applause ]

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.090
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer:
Thank you so much

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.300
for that warm introduction
and welcome.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.480
And it's fitting that you
bring up Dr. Billington

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.780
because we are standing in the John
W. Kluge Center, which was brought

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.970
to reality by the vision
of Dr. Billington

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.430
and the late John W. Kluge.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.900
The Kluge Center is a vibrant
scholar center on Capitol Hill.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.510
And we bring together scholars and
researchers from around the world

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.880
to stimulate and energize
one another, to distil wisdom

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.790
from the Library's rich
resources and to interact

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.150
with policymakers and the public.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.130
We offer opportunities for senior
scholars, post-doctoral fellows

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.190
and PhD candidates to conduct
research in the Library

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.640
of Congress' collections.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.010
And we also offer free public
lectures, conferences, symposia

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.900 position:56%
and other programs such as this one,

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.810
as well as administer
the Kluge Prize,

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.940
which recognizes outstanding
achievement

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.410
in the humanities and
social sciences.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.820
And as a side note, we are
currently accepting applications

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.620
for Kluge fellowships, which is
the fellowship that Theo holds.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.320
For more information
about the center,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.820
please visit loc.gov/kluge,
K-L-U-G-E.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.780
And I invite you sign up for
our RSS email list to learn

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.490
about future programs as
well opportunities for you

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.370
to conduct your own research
here at the Library of Congress.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.000
So, on to today's program.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.580
Today's program is
titled "The Law of Nations

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.330
in America's Independence."

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.000
It features scholar Theo
Christov, currently a Kluge fellow

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.370
at the John W. Kluge Center.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.150
While at the Library of Congress,
Theo has been working on a project

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.960
that situates the early American
republic within the emergence

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.730
of the field of international law.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.030
In particular, he exam--

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.060
he is examining the connections
between America's independence

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.520
and European philosophers
such as Emer Vattel,

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.510
about whom we'll hear more today.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.780
Vattel's name is not
well known to us today.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:43.010
However, in the period of 1789 to
1820, he was the most cited author

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.660
in legal documents
and court proceedings

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.090
in the early American republic.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.530
And his work was consulted
upon by delegates to the First

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.950
and Second Continental Congresses.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.370
Dr. Theo Christov is an
assistant professor of history

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.670
and international affairs

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:04.680
at the George Washington University
here in DC, my alma matter.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.130
He is also been a visiting
assistant professor

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.050
at North Western University.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.830
He received his PhD
from UCLA in 2008.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.030
And he is the author of "Before
Anarchy: Hobbes and His Critics

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.310
in Modern International Thought."

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.410 position:56%
He is also the author of several
book chapters, articles and reviews.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.480
And he has received numerous awards

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.580
and fellowships including
the European Society

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.100
of International Law
Young Scholar Fellowship,

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:37.240
Phi Beta Kappa International
Student Fellowship, excuse me,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.610
and UCLA Chancellor's Dissertation
Year Fellowship and, of course,

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.160
a Kluge Fellowship
here at the Library

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.620
of Congress, which
is now completing.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.510
So, please join me in
welcoming Theo Christov.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:58.410
[ Applause ]

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.690
&gt;&gt; Theo Christov: Thank you so much
for that very kind introduction

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.630
and a warm welcome
to our ambassador.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.170
Thank you for the kind words.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.540
Before I begin, let me--
can you all hear me?

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.390
I would like to thank
the Kluge Center

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.140
for these 11 months in residence.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.490
And I especially want to give
a special thanks to Mary Lou,

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:21.980
to Jason, to Travis, to Joan
for all the hospitality as well

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.950
as to all the Kluge fellows.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.420
Especially one of them,
I want to recognize,

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.490
that would be Will
Slauter [assumed spelling]

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.160
for all these wonderful
conversations.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:36.320
Now, I'm well aware that in
any [inaudible] and asset,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.690 position:56%
so the first President of the United
States delivered his inaugural

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.900
address in just about 135 words,
which was the shortest address,

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.650
whereas the 9th President, William
Henry Harrison delivered his speech

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.350
in over two and a half hours.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.510
So what I'm going to try to do--
and by the way, for those of you

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.950
who don't know he came down with
a flu the next died and he died

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.370
of pneumonia within a month.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:03.280
So with that in mind, I will keep
my remark trip all 45 minutes

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.880
and share some thoughts
with you on my research,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.210
which I have been conducting here
for the last nine or 10 months.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.920
And sadly, I have a less
than two months left.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.480
What I'm going to present to you
today is part of ongoing research,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.560
I have conducted at the
Library of Congress.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.940
The larger research asks the
question, how did the world

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.550
of states emerge from a
former world of empires?

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.750
After all, the existence
of states today is a fact

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.050
that we take for granted.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.860
The unprecedented growth of--

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.730
in the umber of states since the
mid 20th century has largely been a

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.270 position:56%
product of decolonization in Africa,
in Asia, but forms of sovereignty

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.660
which are recognizably
modern have existed

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.530
since at least late 18th century.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.270
And the founding of this
country in particular illuminates

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.840
at least one significant
point about the creation

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.530 position:56%
of states namely their desire for
independence or domestic sovereignty

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.450
but also commitment to
interdependence in their relations

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.870
with other states, what I call
international sovereignty.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.170
While writing the genealogy

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.090
of the modern statehood can
be approached variously,

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.510
the one story I have chosen
to pursue is the birth

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.410
of the United States in late
18th and early 19th century.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.220
Such a pursuit is not entirely
arbitrary tracing the origin

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.470
of the state back to British North
America in the 1770s allows us

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.140
to situate the idea of sovereignty
not only in its domestic,

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.340
but especially in its
international context.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.740
And I'll make that more
clear as I move along.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.920
That context can be found in what
was called at that time the law

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.060
of nature and nations
and that, which is coming

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.000
to be called international law.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.910
And some of you may know that
the term international law was

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.980
in fact coined by Jeremy Bentham in
1786 to designate a different way

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.480
of thinking about the
Law of Nations.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.700
Such a law was partially normative

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.390
for it prescribed how
states ought to behave.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.450
And it was partly conventional
for it was based in convention

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.590
and described the established
practices among states.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.430
In my remarks today, I locate
the rising United States

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:17.710
in late 18th century in these two
conceptions of international law,

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.250
the normative and the conventional.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.400
And I argue that the American
revolutionaries were making claims

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.690
not only for independence from
Britain, but also if not primarily

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.250
for interdependence
among other states.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.960
Their ultimate goal was not merely
domestic autonomy, but above all,

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.180
external recognition by
other states beyond Britain.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.200
They clearly understood that
independence was their ticket

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.340
for admission into the
international community of states,

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.580
but the American revolutionaries
would have hardly been able

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.120
to accomplish their global
reach had it not been

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.480
for a Swiss political thinker
by the name of Emer Vattel,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.500
the name I will be
mentioning in my discussion.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.020
So he is? Born in 1714 in the
Swiss principality of Neuchatel,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.240
Vattel came from a
privilege background.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.080
His father was a high ranking
clergyman while his mother was the

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.670
daughter of the treasure
of Prussian King.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.460
His interest in philosophy on his
father's side and taste of politics

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.760
on his mother's side
define his passion for both.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.140
His main work, the Law
of Nations published

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.140
in 1758 was not envisioned.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.440
And this is a key point.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.540
It was not envisioned to make an
original contribution it was simply

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.260
intended to popularize the works

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.610
of two German philosophers,
Leibniz and Wolff.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.540
Both of whom had produced
works on the law of nature.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.340
Ingenuous as their works were
and can tell that by the length

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:47.170
of their wigs, they remain largely
inaccessible to wider audience.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.320
Written in Latin, they were full
of mathematical demonstrations

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.400
to prove the inclinations
of human nature.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.020
Vattel said, to transform
liveness in Wolff's ideas

00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:00.060
in a comprehensible way and
free their cumbersome systems

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.660
from securities.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.770
The irony is that while the Law
of Nations was never intended

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.250
to be original in its content,
it became an instant classic

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:14.380
and a political guidebook in the
hands of every American statesman.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.010
Britain and Europe exported
across the Atlantic,

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.430
the book was so to speak
naturalized in the context

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.340
of American independence.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.740 position:56%
Many of the founding fathers
including George Washington were not

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:30.120
only deeply familiar with the
arguments of the Law of Nations,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:36.030
but also actively engaged in-- I
mean debates over the consecution.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.490
In this 1796 portrait of George
Washington by Gilbert Stewart,

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.810
the painter has carefully
chosen books

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.880
that represent Washington's world
of ideas and world of politics,

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.980
while Vattel's book is not among
the few depicted in this portrait,

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.210
it should have a very lightly
candidate as I'm about to argue.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.940
For a men known for his
diligence and integrity,

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.750
it comes as a surprise that he
failed to return two volumes

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.110 position:56%
that were due on November 2nd, 1789,

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.120 position:56%
both from the New York Society
Library, the books were Vattel's Law

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.920 position:56%
of Nations and a collection of works

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.750
from Britain's lower
house of parliament.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:20.310 position:56%
It was known not until 1934 that
the charge-out ledger was discovered

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.610
in the library's basement

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:26.730
and for almost a 150 years no
one could have possibly suspected

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.050
the misdeed.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.170
And these are the two
items from the ledger.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.430
Now the other borrowers including
Aaron Burr, Alexander Hamilton,

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.220
John Jay all returned
their library books,

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:42.730
but one conspicuous borrower
never returned his two books.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:46.250
And guess what, he was not even
a paying member of the library.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.490
And unlike the Library of Congress
today, which is absolutely free,

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.960
back then Patrons had to in
fact pay annual membership

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.720
to be able to check all the books.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.350 position:56%
So let's hope he Library of
Congress doesn't change that policy.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:03.170
Now, that patron had an
entree on October 5th, 1789,

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.960
which was recorded
simply as president

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.460
in the space of the borrower.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.290
Vattel's Law of Nations and volume
12 of the 14 volume collection

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.050
of common debates, which
contained transcripts of debates

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.570
from the house of commons must
have surely proved indispensable

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.990
for a man preoccupied with the
business of creating a new nation

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.280
and learning how to
be its president.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.120
Anecdote even has it that the new
president was found consulting

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.370
Vattel's book by visitors
on his first day in office

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:36.770
after his inauguration on
April 30th, 1789 in New York,

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:38.920
which was the capital
city back then.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.820
Now, when Philadelphia became the
capital city at the following year

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.840
in 1790, he merely took the
book with him never to return

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.880
to the library, that is until it
somehow reappeared 221 years later.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.530
The book was eventually returned

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.860
from the George Washington's
Mount Vernon Library,

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.920
not far from Washington DC to the
New York society library in 2010

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:08.840
with a waived fee of $300,000,
of course, inflation adjusted.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.030 position:56%
So what could have possibly prompted
the first president who had been

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.950
in office for mere five
months to send out a messenger

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.860
for his cherry street home

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.050
down to New York Society
Library in Federal Hall.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:26.530
Now, if you turn to the New York
Daily Gazette from October 5th,

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:31.530
1789, which the president must
have almost certainly have read

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:35.450
when he requested a copy of Vattel,
it reads like a global chronicle

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.060 position:56%
of stories covering four continents.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.590
It contains a letter on
the revolutions in Paris,

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.890
allusions to the Russians,
the English, the Turkish army,

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.780
the State of Holland, the African
prince, a Jamaican planter and,

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.960
of course, the general
assembly in Philadelphia itself.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.890 position:56%
Published as one of two dailies, the
New York Daily Gazette was anything

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.660
but local in its coverage and
inclusion of foreign affairs

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.120 position:56%
on its pages merely reflected how
America's saw its place in the world

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.320
as a nascent state trying to remain
neutral during your political

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.230
turmoil and emerge as a
fully pledge sovereign

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.530
of the international stage.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.440
The United States was inextricably
becoming part of a wider world

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.590
of customs and conventions
practiced between states.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.940
The work of Vattel provided
indispensable intellectual

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.940
ammunition to the defenders
of the republic

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.750
for decades surrounding
the birth and adolescence

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.750
of the new American nation.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.900
In the hands of the
early republicans,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.790
the Law of Nations written
largely for European audience,

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.900
this is a key point, it
served to the two-fold purpose

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.340
of justifying war for
independence from the British

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.600
and of weaving the unique
American political experience

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.880
into the larger fabric of the
European experience of liberty.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.450
It affectively linked ideologically
both sides of the Atlantic.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.060
The seemingly insignificant
discovery

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.850
of the book return
neglect reveals less

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.390
about the character
of the president.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:08.340
And let's not forget the never
lying George Washington story

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.550
of cutting down the cherry tree.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:14.780 position:56%
Then it reveals a [inaudible] about
the European thinkers who would come

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.610
to exercise a tremendous
influence on the leading statesmen

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.450
of the newly founded country.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.470
Faced with political
and religious turmoil

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.420
that threatened the very
fabric of their societies,

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.260
many political authors dismantled
all the European monarchical

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.420
arguments and fervently
defended a new constitution built

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.280
on the right of citizens.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.750
While their argument is in
favor of political models

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.510
of legitimate sovereignty
and statehood emerge

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:47.100 position:56%
from a distinctly intra-European
context of civil and religious wars,

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.690
they still can take a very
broad appeal to the universality

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.040
of human experience
and rightful demands

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.020
for political self governance.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:59.080
That universality proved critical
in making arguments not only

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.130
in defensive domestic autonomy
but also in the promotion

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.050
of international sovereignty
including the recognition

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.000
of the United States
by outside actors.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.560
In dependent states, the hallmark

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:14.590 position:56%
of Vattel's legacy must be sovereign
both in relation to themselves,

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.530
but also in relation to each other.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.220 position:56%
So Vattel's treaties served as an
indispensable guidebook in the hands

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.060
of the framers including the
first president who consulted it

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.890
in situating independence within
the large context of statehood.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:33.050
It also helped addressed the
question of how a declaration

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.860
of independence from Great
Britain served simultaneously

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.920
as a proclamation of inter
dependence to the world of states.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.090
Scholarship has generally
tended to acknowledge Vattel

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.290
as the most cited author
in legal documents

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:50.880
as Jason mentioned
earlier after 1789.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.090
And especially throughout the
19th century, the story I have

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:59.970
to tell it's a story of
Vattel before and around 1789.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.970
So in the time remaining I
will sketch that pre-1789 story

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:07.180
and reinstate Vattel not only
the preeminent thinker most

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.620
authoritative in debates over
the future of this country,

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:15.170
but also I want to argue and I know
this is no small claim to make,

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:20.600 position:56%
there was-- he was even more gasped,
influential then locked himself.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.960
And I might be being a
little theoretical but if I

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.680
in a different version I
would say, Vattel over lock.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.250
That would be the basic claim
that I would want to make today.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.270
Now, Vattel's authority

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.450
in this country can be
traced as far back as 1762.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.180
That is the earliest I have
been able to come up with,

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.620
which is a quarter of a
century before the drafting

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.960
of the constitution itself.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.300
So it's quite a long time.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:48.220
When Vattel request a copy of
the Law of Nations in 1789,

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.590
George Washington-- when George
Washington requested a copy

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:55.990
of Vattel's Law of Nations in
1789, he had already been familiar

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:59.480
with the arguments for independence
long before he became the

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.820
first president.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.650
As early as 1773, he
seems to have known about

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.780
and almost certainly
have read Vattel's work.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.530
And I have something to
show you to prove that.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:14.770
In a shipment request
dated October 6th, 1773,

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.780
George Washington submitted a list
of authors that included Hutchison,

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.880
Ferguson, Grotius, Smith,
Monstequieu and, of course, Vattel.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.390 position:56%
Fluent in French and verse in Latin
many of the founding fathers engaged

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.000
with political writings that derive
their rights and duties of states

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.920
from those of individuals placed

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.250
in their natural condition
of perfect equality.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.530
The essential analogy
between free persons

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.720
and sovereign states provided the
ideal context for making claims

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.380
for independence of the
newly formed United States.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.520
From Hobbes to Pufendorf, European
political thinkers preoccupied the

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.990
minds of the participants
in the central debate

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.160
over justifying revolution
and independence.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.470
Connected by similar experiences
of oppression and dependence,

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.610
Europe and American could not
have been brought any closer

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:07.220
in their ideological proximity in
addressing the fundamental question

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.790
of how to secure a free
and independent state.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:15.050
The political theory of John
Locke, whom Jefferson called,

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.250
you may be familiar with this,
it's actually here in the Library

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.620
of Congress, this is
Jefferson's own writing.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.610
He called the three greatest
men, John Locke was one of them

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.010
that ever lived without
any exception.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.800
And by the way, you see
in these circles Bacon

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.220
and Newton are the other
two in addition to Locke.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.390 position:56%
Those three for Jefferson had been--

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.810
that it was has been widely
noted and taken for granted.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:43.750
The alienable rights of life,
liberty and pursuit of happiness

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.070
and shrine in the declaration

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.210
of independence continually
get attributed to John Locke

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.200
and his idea of life,
liberty and state.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.990
But few, if any would link Vattel's
language of rights and sovereignty

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.960
with that of the founding document.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.920 position:56%
This is what I'm trying to do in my
own project, part of the explanation

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.220
for the conventional acceptance

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.900
of Locke's influence
life and chronology.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.740
Most scholars have tended to
emphasize the influence of Vattel

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.820 position:56%
after the revolutionary war and have
continued to stress the importance,

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.320
well, into the present day.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.320
Even the Supreme Court affirmed
as late as 1978 that Vattel was,

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.140
I quote, "The international
jurist most widely cited

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.900
in the first 50 years
after the Revolution."

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.560
Propositions make a
huge difference for me.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.860
So this is after the Revolution.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.530
I'm concerned with
prior to the revolution.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:36.320
Writing his introduction in
1916 to Vattel's own book,

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.700
Albert de La Pradelle concurs
that the fathers of independence,

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.530
I quote, "were in a court with the
ideas of Vattel and found his--

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:47.030
in his work all the maxims
of political liberty."

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:51.220
From the mid 1770s, the more
the United States progressed,

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:55.460
the greater became Vattel's
influence, so that in 1780 the Law

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.670
of Nations became a classic
textbook in universities.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.640
In fact as early as 1773, it
has been on the curriculum

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.150
of King's College or
Columbia University today.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.920 position:56%
But the history of Vattel's presence
in America extends even further back

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:15.230
by about a decade prior
to the 1760s.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.940
Much realistic knowledge has been
the contribution of his thought

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.440
to the intellectual
debates over independence

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.080
on the American republic
in the yeas leading

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:27.050
up to the revolution of 1776.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.260
The Law of Nations appeared
first in 1758 French,

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.990
one of the first treaties at
that time to have been written

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.380
in the vernacular rather
than the widely used Latin.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.280
The first English translation of
the work was published anonymously

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:45.120 position:56%
in London in 1759, followed by
another English translation in 1760.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.390
Only two years later,
1762 in September.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:54.090
Vattel's treaties in fact
made its way to New York.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.030
It was imported from London.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.880
It was made available for
purchase from Garrat Noel,

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.190 position:56%
the first New York bookseller
located on Dock Street in Manhattan.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:07.010 position:56%
From his shop, Noel also operated
what he called a circulating library

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:11.650
of several thousand volumes of
choice book for those who delight

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.610
in reading like all of us.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:14.910
And almost certain, the Law

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.650
of Nations would have been a
monkey [phonetic] circulating book,

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.530
which would have made it even more
widely accessible to readership

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.700
without the means to
own a copy of it.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.800
John Adams, a delegate to
the Continental Congress

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.620
and later the second US
president must have been one

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.710
of the very first customers to
have purchase the Law of Nations.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:41.190
In his diary on February
1st, 1763 or just two months

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.560
after the book was made available
on this side of the Atlantic,

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.000
John Adams records that after
spending the day frivolously,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.290
you could ask what he was doing,
instead of reading and thinking,

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:56.030
" I employed however, too little
of my time thinking reading.

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.340
I might have spent much more."

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:03.570
The idea of Mr. Vattel indeed
scalding and frowning haunted me.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.610
While one they only
speculate which specific idea

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.160
of the treaties may have haunted
Adams, it would have been--

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.500
it would be possible to
suggest that he may have sought

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.110
to appropriate Vattel's arguments
within the larger context

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.780
of the imperial crisis over the
future of the British empire

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.550
which had brewing since
at least 1763.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.800
In reading Vattel, Adams must
have surely been pretty occupied

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.470
with establishing the
proper relationship

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.340
between Britain's legitimate
power into colonies

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.710
and the rights of the Americans.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.620
Again, the rights of
British subjects

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.350
in the imperial periphery
be reconciled

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.650
with government at its core.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:43.950
As one of the most learned

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.790
and widely read among
the founding fathers,

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:51.550
Adams had not only read extensively
and was impressed with Vattel,

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.700
but he was also deeply familiar
with the works of those compatriots

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.130
who had made use of Vattel's ideas.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.750
One of the earliest colonial
defenders to employ Vattel

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.060
in political arguments about the
power and limits of parliament

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.320
in the case of the colonies
was the Massachusetts lawyer,

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:14.080
James Otis whom the young
Adams both knew and admired.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.950
Educated at Harvard
College, James Otis was--

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.250
and I'm quoting here from Adams
himself, "well versed in Greek

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:24.320
and Roman history, philosophy,
oratory, poetry, methology,"

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.090
whose "classical studies
had been unusually ardent

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:30.250
and his acquisitions
uncommonly great.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:33.080
He was considered a great master
of the law of nature and nations

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.350 position:56%
and have read Pufendorf and Vattel."

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:40.430 position:56%
Arguing the famous assistance case
for five years in the old statehouse

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:44.390
in Boston in 1761 and challenging
the authority of parliament

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.020
on behalf of 53 boss and merchants.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.540
Otis made a dramatic speech holding

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.540
that ultimately the
general rich were contrary

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.690
to both natural law
and English practice.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.800 position:56%
The 26 year old Adams was present as
described during the actual speech

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.240
and was so impressed
with what he have heard

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.050
that he described the events on
56 late year later as I quote,

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:10.900
"The first scene of the
first act of all position

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.370
to the arbitrary claims
of Great Britain.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:17.070
Then and there the child
independence was born."

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:22.060
This was Adams almost close
to the end of his life.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.360
Vattel has soon emerged

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.590
as a political thinker whose
treaties provided grounds

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.950
for resistance against
arbitrary of power.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.190
And he would subsequently
get incorporated

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.840
into the larger discourse
on the origin of government.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.990
Otis explained in his-- expanded
his argument in the colonists,

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.280
this is in his work
called the rights

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.250
of the British colonist
asserted and proved of 1764.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.660
And he extensively cited
the position of Vattel

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.620
to support the authority of
parliament of Great Britain

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.770
that that authority is in fact
circumscribed by certain balance

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:58.500
which if exceeded their acts
become those of mere power

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.540 position:56%
without right and consequently void.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.320
Such a doctrine is agreeable to
the law of nature and nations

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.360
and Vattel was quoted,
"As the authority

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.050
on the subject rights are derived
from nature not from consent."

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:15.400
And as Vattel had shown, any
violation of the constitution

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.270
of natural law amounted
to a breach of contract.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:23.550
Critics of the very idea of consent
objected to the voluntary nature

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:27.410
of civil government dismissed
such argument as merely I quote,

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:31.060
"Chimerical and unsupported
by reason and experience."

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.700
And quote.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.960
"Already born into the
political compact of society,

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.490
citizens may not renounce the
very protection that bites--

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.430
that binds them together."

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.170
And here is what Otis says
about Vattel, I quote,

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:48.160 position:56%
"Those who want a full answer to the
question of why consent is the base

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.470
of any political community
may consult, not John Law,

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:56.180
but may consult Mr.
Vattel on the law of nature

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.590
and their consciousness."

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:02.350
The reference to Vattel in
support of the basic claim

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:06.680
that any political government rest
on the consent of its citizens,

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.940
and when that trust has been
violated, they have the right

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.890
to resist is unequivocally
endorsed as the voice of reason.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.450
Otis's inclusion of Vattel
in the ranks of Locke

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:20.240
and other major political thinkers
would baptize the Swiss jurors

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.110
as the spokesperson for resistance
against British rule and in support

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.630
of waging a just war against it.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:30.470
The reliance on Vattel as
the indisputable authority

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.210
in the major pamphlet of the
American revolution paved the way

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:38.720
as early as 1764 for a long
trajectory of his influence

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.830
on how the revolutionary framed
their arguments for independence.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.500
Vattel's argument in
defense of political liberty

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.380
and independence was not confined
to political pathway theories

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.270
in New England nor localized
or publish in Boston.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:56.440
Later in the same year, it had
spread south to North Carolina,

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.810
the last remaining original colony
to acquire a printing press.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:04.790
And it's customary with most
newspapers at that time,

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.350
it was filled with
extensive extracts when works

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:10.970
of religious writers and historians
as well as essays and text

00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:13.240
of important legislative acts.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.660
In this July 1764 issue,
a lone history

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:19.200
of the Roman Empire was
began and convenient

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.210
for several succeeding installments
only to be followed in September

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.710
by a celebration of a
genius whose book I quote,

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:29.950
"is reckoned among the first
for learning and rendition

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:32.410
and sound reasoning," unquote.

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:36.440
It is not entirely incidental
that commentaries on Roman history

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.940
and Vattel's Law of Nations
appeared consecutively.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.560
Both of them consider
liberty and autonomy

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.540
as foundational to a free society.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:48.600
Now, the central theme of the
review of the Law of Nations,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.820
which you will see despite
the inclusion of long various

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.410
and carefully selected extracts
is the nature of sovereignty,

00:34:56.410 --> 00:34:58.100
who possesses political authority

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:02.200
in a civil society whose
end is public happiness.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.050
While the priest [phonetic] derived
his authority from the nation

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:08.510
and the words of the learned
author who has strictly

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:11.070
and simply invested
him with sovereignty,

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:14.150
his regal prerogatives are limited
to the well being of his subjects

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:17.210
and regulated by the
fundamental laws.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:21.300
Roman history shows that when
supreme authority such as

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.490
that of Nero has been abused and
its holder becomes discouraged

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.580
of the state and effectively a
public enemy, then the nation may

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.540
and ought to defend itself.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:36.010
So in other words, the argument
I'm making is that this review

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:42.410
of the Law of Nations as early as
1764 has been engaged with not only

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:45.760
in New England but is really
moving south in North Carolina.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.810 position:56%
And the main argument essentially is
that obedience to authority is based

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.010
on the consent of the governed.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.960
It is established for
their common good.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:00.030
And Vattel is used as a preeminent
authority to defend that argument.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.270
Now, during the First and Second
Continental Congress which convened

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:09.250
between 1774 and 1781 delegates
from all 13 colonies convened

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.780
to decide on their future.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.610
Benjamin Franklin who
had put his idea

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.580
for such a meeting knew
his Vattel quite well.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.250
Thanks to someone who has remained

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.720
in my view the most
acknowledge inspiration

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.370
for the American Revolution.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:35.720
And that is the-- in fact I
was not able to find his--

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.440
in fact, so obscure this
person that in fact I've not--

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.220 position:56%
have not been able to find an image.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.690
And I cannot show you an image.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:47.740
I tried quite a bit on-- find
any images of him on the internet

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.020
and I have not been
able to find any.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.340
Who is he?

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:54.850
He was a Frenchman or at
least he was born a Frenchman,

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:57.010
but he resided in the
Hake [phonetic].

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:01.750
He was the first American spy
who was hired by the Americans

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:03.540
but he lived in the Hake.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.820
His name was Charles Dumas.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.580
Now who is Charles Dumas?

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.720
He was acting as a secret agent of
the American colonies at the Hake

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.680
and he designed the first
revolutionary diplomatic cipher

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.980
to mask correspondence between
the Continental Congress

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:24.150
and its foreign agents in Europe
and devoted his life to the cause

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.230
of the American independence.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:28.500
In fact in the view of the
first American judge to serve

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.290
on the permanent court
of the international--

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:35.220
of international justice, Dumas
described as, and I quote,

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.970
"With the exception of Adams,
Franklin and Jay, Dumas rendered

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:42.860
to the American cause in
Europe services more important

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.880
than did any other man."

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.910
Versed in the ancient classics, and
skilled in many modern languages,

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:53.910
Dumas edited the original 1758
edition of Vattel's Law of Nations

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:58.020
and sends Frankin three copies
in French in that same year

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:02.980
with the instruction to distribute,
I quote, "One for your own library,

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:08.030
another for that in Philadelphia
and third for such other library

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:10.840
and colony as you may choose."

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.540
That is he's referring to Franklin.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.450
Now, an ardent support of
the American revolutionaries

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:19.980 position:56%
and their struggles for independence
although he himself never crossed

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.830
the Atlantic, Dumas edited the
Law of Nations specifically

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:28.100
to aid his American friends
and de facto employers

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.180 position:56%
in their revolt against the British.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:34.060
He reinvigorated Vattel's arguments
for independence and brought

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.700
out the relevance of the
idea of external sovereignty

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.800
in the context of the
Law of Nations.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.280
Statehood demands independence
internationally.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.580
The three copies of the Law

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.450
of Nations were considered
a most timely gift according

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:52.930
to Franklin's biographer James
Parton, which was, and I quote,

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.360
"pounced upon by studious members
of Congress, groping their way

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.280
without the light of precedents."

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.860
Now, upon-- In Philadelphia,
Franklin wrote to Dumas

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:09.250
in December 19th, 1775 and allow
me to read this long letter.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:14.780
Now this is again from-- this
is the words of Franklin.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:19.570
"I am much obliged by the kind
present," he's referring to Dumas,

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.680
"you have made us of
your edition of Vattel.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.800
It came to us in good
season, when the circumstances

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.800
of a rising state make
it necessary frequently

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.640
to consult the Law of Nations.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.710
Accordingly, that copy which
I kept, after depositing one

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:37.530
in my own library and sending
the other to the college

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:40.120
of Massachusetts Bay,
Harvard University,

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.580 position:56%
as you directed has been continually
in the hands of the members

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.310
of our congress, now sitting, who
are much pleased with your notes

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.680
and preface, and have
entertained a high

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.890
and just esteem for their author.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.670
Your manuscript is also
well relished and may

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:58.330
in time have its effect," unquote.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.330
Now, the fate of the
copy that Franklin kept

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.510
for himself is not known.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:06.830
The second Harvard copy of Dumas
Vattel contains a handwritten

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.200
commentary written by Dumas himself

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.660
in which he shares his idea
upon government and royalty

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.810
and effectively endorses
the urgency of Vattel

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:18.470
to the American context
of independence.

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:24.600
In practicable an consequently used
and dangerous to discuss in Europe,

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.720
Dumas says, "I thought
that sowed in America,

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.560
the Law of Nations would
take root there germinate

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.780
and fructify one day."

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:37.210
Now, the third copy that Dumas
sent was presented by Franklin

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:39.840
to the Library Company
of Philadelphia.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:45.930
On October 10th, 1775, the minute
from the library's director reads,

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:49.600 position:56%
"Should you may having presented
the library with a very late edition

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.270
of Vattel's law of
nature and nations,

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:55.480
the board direct the
secretary to return

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.320
that gentleman their
thanks," unquote.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.540
Now, of all three copies, the third
one must almost certainly have been

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:10.050
most heavily used namely the copy
used by the Continental Congress.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.590
And one important reason why
the delegates of the First

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:17.380
and Second Continental Congress
chose to meet in Carpenters Hall,

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:21.400
this is the image of
Carpenters Hall around 1774.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.860
The reason why they chose, I think,
and this might be a little bit

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:27.610
of a stretch, so I'll take
any accusations or any attacks

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.040
that may come from you, but I think
the reason why they chose to meet

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.440
in Carpenters Hall
is for simple reason,

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.940
the building also has the
Library Company of Philadelphia.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.930
Its librarians, Francis Damon
[assumed spelling] reported

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:41.660
that Vattel was one of
the main sources consulted

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.650
by delegates during the
First Continental Congress,

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:48.500
which met from September
5th to October 26th, 1774.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.120
And I quote, this is the librarian

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.960
of the Library Company
of Philadelphia.

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.310
"Philadelphia has become
another Cairo," he wrote,

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:00.910
"with this difference that the one
is a city swarming with merchants,

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:04.990
the other with politician
and statesmen," unquote.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.740
They debated like philosopher for--

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:11.070
by what I was told and this
is him again, "Vattel locked

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:15.140
and Montesquiei seemed to be
standards to which refer either

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.450
when settling the rights of
colonies or when a dispute arises

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:25.090
on the justice of propriety
of a measure," unquote.

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:29.970 position:56%
The Library Company already owned a
copy of the 1760 English translation

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:33.200 position:56%
of the first French edition of 1758,

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:37.330
which may have been received
at any time before 1763.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:40.180
So in other words, all I'm saying
is there's multiple variants

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.780
and editions being
distributed and circulated.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.360
The authority of Vattel
on questions on the Law

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:51.120
of Nations had thus been well
established by the early 1770s.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.160
A few months prior to
the congressional debates

00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:00.070
in December 28, 1773 letter from
the Library Company of Philadelphia

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:04.730
to Benjamin Franklin it stated,
I quote, "the books enclosed

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:09.680 position:56%
within wire lattices are kept in one
large room and there are available

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.880
to be consulted by
delegates," unquote.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:19.140 position:56%
By the time Dumas own copy of
Vattel reached Philadelphia in 1775,

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:23.080
the earlier English translation
from 1760 had already been

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.890
in such heavy use by statesmen
that it have been rebound

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:30.160
with more modern kind
of paper than that upon

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.450
which the book was
originally printed.

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:35.850
The study of the Law of
Nations by the delegates

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:39.580
of the Continental Congress whose
task was in Franklin's language

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:43.340
to inquire into the
circumstances of arising state,

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.820
and rising is the key
point I'm making.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:49.970
Reflected simply the spirit of the
declaration of independence itself,

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:52.860
its central assertion that
governments are instituted

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.320
to fulfill the inalienable rights
of life, liberty and pursuit

00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:00.550
of happiness owed intellectual
debt to Vattel's own argument

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:05.190
on legitimacy for our people
overthrow a tyrannical sovereign.

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:09.600
Governments may not-- may not
be usurping the transient--

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:14.720
and governments may not be usurp
for transient and trivial causes,

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.040
but they can be overthrown
after a long chain of abuses

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:24.730
of their own basic
political and social rights.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:28.970
After repeated appeals to the
British brethren who remained deaf

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:32.690
to the voice of justice
and consanguinity,

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:35.090
the Americans were prepared
to declare their independence

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.020
from the British ground
with a full right

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:41.760
of a sovereign government truly--
to levy war, conclude peace,

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:46.910
contract alliances and establish
commerce and to do all other acts

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:51.710
and things, which independent
states may of right do.

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:56.370
The Law of Nations, the book
not only a short legitimacy

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:59.550
to the claims for independence,
it also provided a blueprint

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.760
for the practice of statehood
in the world of sovereigns.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.930
The newly founded United States in
a confluence of early intended acts

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:10.290
and fortunate circumstances
will become the first state

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:16.040
to make international independence
the whole mark of statehood.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.950
Like all the other founding fathers

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:21.860
who did not demarcate the domestics
fear from that of the foreign,

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:26.060
Jefferson, and by the way, this
building is named after him,

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.730
he accumulated nearly all
treatises on the subject

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:34.140
of natural law Grotius, Pufendorf,
Wolff and, of course, not one

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.600
but two different editions
of Vattel's Law of Nations.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.470
Jefferson's copy of Vattel's
later edition which he loan

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:42.190
to representative from
North Carolina

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:45.420
and to another representative
from Rhode Island reveals

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.880
that the cross-- that he cross
reference Vattel on the Law

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.480
of Nations with the work

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.140
of the German juror
George Fredrickson Martins

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.440
[assumed spelling].

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.690
In referencing Vattel's
work to that of Bodin,

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:00.770 position:56%
the 16th century political theorist,
Jefferson positioned the theory

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:04.280
of domestic sovereignty within
the larger context of relations

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.330
between independent states.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:11.020
Sovereignty as independence, the
main justification for waging a war

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:15.280
against British oppression was
located into the larger context

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:19.630
of relations between states and the
law of nature as applied to them.

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:23.420
In bringing my story to an end,

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.810
allow me to draw three
main conclusions.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:29.250
The first one should be
quite obvious by now, mainly,

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:33.290
that far from being marginal and
irrelevant, marginal at best,

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:38.740
irrelevant at worst, Vattel was
in fact at the heart of debate

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:42.310
in the early American republic over
the core ideals of the revolution

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:45.390
that produced a political
conditions for life, liberty

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:47.670
and the pursuit of happiness.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:50.790
While many of us are
continually reminded of the impact

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:53.930
of John Locke's political
theory exercise on the birth

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:56.610
of this nation, and
I'm not denying that,

00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:00.660
the authority of Vattel was
significantly I think far more

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.720
reaching and far more lasting.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.210
Vattel over lock, conclusion one.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:12.180
Second conclusion, it isn't a
way a corollary of the first,

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:16.570
while we consistently regard
independence as the hard one price

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:19.050
of the revolutionaries
and I'm not denying that.

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:22.510
I think in fact it
was interdependence

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:25.170
that was central to their ideology.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:28.390
They had to become independent
in the first place in order

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:32.420
to realize their independence
in a world of states.

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:36.930
They did so by making use of
available language of the Law

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:41.510
of Nations, a language which
Vattel so conveniently yet,

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:45.590
conclusion number two, so
unintentionally provided to them.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:50.400
In short the boundary between home
and abroad was merely imaginary.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:54.370
Americas have always been
part of a much larger world.

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:58.040
The third conclusion, and this
is the final conclusion I want

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.720
to leave you with, how we should
transform our understanding

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.380
of the American revolution.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.490
Unlike the French revolution,
which has always been regarded

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.080 position:56%
as truly international in its reach,

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.030
the American Revolution
has generally

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:16.250
and there has been recent changes
in scholarship on this point,

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:18.740
that American revolution has
generally been seen as the marking

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.540
of the birth of a new nation.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.350
And I'm not denying that story,

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:27.780
but the story I have told you
today should unsettle this very

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.240
common belief.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.620
It was not simply a domestic
revolution for independence,

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.410
it was primarily the
beginning of the modern state.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:41.870
Writing in 1963, the political
thinker, very prominent,

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:47.350
Hannah Arendt writes and I quote,
"The sad truth of the matter is

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:49.010
that the French Revolution,

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:53.190
which ended in disaster
has made world history,

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:55.110
while the American Revolution,

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:59.280
so triumphantly successful
has remained an event

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.430
of little more than
local importance."

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:07.190
The American Revolution as
I've to show was an event

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:13.080 position:56%
of a truly global significance whose
effects can be felt with us today.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:19.560
Ironically none of these effects
were in any way intended by Vattel

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:24.960
and yet he would gratefully take
credit for them as he should.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.760
Thanks for the attention.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:39.440
[ Applause ]

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:44.440
So, we should probably take the
floor and open it questions.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.120
I think we have at least 10 minutes

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:50.980
for any questions that
anyone may have.

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.630
Yes, Kennedy?

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:57.470
&gt;&gt; Kennedy: That was terrific.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:01.720
And you persuaded me that
Vattel is a crucial figure

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.500
in American Revolution.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:18.230
I want to bring us back to
the open remarks you made,

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:31.090
however in your lecture,
and think in this way,

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:38.280
Vattel talks about
nations in a context

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:45.910
of nature as I understand it.

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:53.720 position:56%
And he talks about state, he doesn't
talk about nations [inaudible].

00:50:53.720 --> 00:51:00.810
And particularly my question is
how we get from these categories

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:06.910
of nations and states and impart
the distinction that we can gather

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:12.220
in 20th, we nation states and
[inaudible] this distinction

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:17.010
that is embedded in the
arguments of Vattel [inaudible]

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:21.650
or is it something
that comes a little--

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:24.530
&gt;&gt; Theo Christov: Great question.

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:28.990
That's really the heart
of what I'm trying to do,

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:33.980
how we transition from
empire to states.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.510
Let me just say what
Vattel is not doing.

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:40.500
Vattel is not endorsing
any imperial ways

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.690
of perpetuating the European
experience of empires

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:46.840
in the 18th century,
he speaks of nations.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:52.030
And actually he speaks of
patriarch in the French edition.

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:57.420
So he-- he's very much
thinking in terms of homelands.

00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:00.360
He's not thinking in terms
of the nation and state

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.210
as we would understand it today.

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:06.260
Now, that is not to say that the
revolutionaries were not making use

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:07.560
to their own ends, and part

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.510
of my argument is there have
been unintended consequences

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:18.530
of using Vattel for purposes of
claiming independence in order

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.970
to claim interdependence
among other states.

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:24.390
So in other words what
I'm trying to say is

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:29.640
that Vattel's argument is
being used to make claims

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.250
for external sovereignty.

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:36.810
But in order to make a claim
for external sovereignty,

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:40.360
you have to have a claim
to domestic sovereignty.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.800
And the thing we've lost track of
the second part of the equation,

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:48.380
we focus so much on domestic
independence and sovereignty,

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:51.990
we've lost track of the
external sovereignty.

00:52:51.990 --> 00:53:00.760 position:56%
I think what Vattel is doing is he's
giving us the legitimacy criteria

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.240
according to which
we can make a claim

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:10.290
for how a state can become an
equal member of the international

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:14.180
and I don't like to use
the word society of states,

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:22.020
but essentially what he is doing
is enumerating the conditions

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.000
on which we can claim independence.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:35.020
And he's making that
argument on various point,

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:44.350
I'm not going to go too much into
it, but he's making distinction

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:46.270
between free persons
and free states,

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:56.180
that there is an analogy
between the two.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:02.030
That analogy breaks down
because free persons come

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:06.510
and institute society, but free
states don't necessarily come

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:07.900
and institute a global society.

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:13.000
But I think what is critical is
that Vattel speaks of independence

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.560
as a condition for interdependence.

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.010
And I think that part
of the argument is taken

00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:19.300
up by the early Americans.

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:25.360
So I think your point is well taken
that we have to be careful to speak

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.800 position:56%
of nation states in the 20th century

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:31.380
and perhaps even how those
nation states are being unsettled

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.680
by non state actors.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.790
But I do think Vattel's approach
of taking interdependence

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:43.180
as a consequent-- consequence
of independence is critical

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.060
that we have to start
with independence

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.010 position:56%
and then move on to interdependence.

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:49.340
I hope that answers
part of the question.

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:50.640
Yes?

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:51.940
&gt;&gt; How, you know, how does this
comfort with interdependence

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.240
that you've spoken off square

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.540
with Washington's ammunition
the steer clear

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:55.840
of national attachments
on the [inaudible]?

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.140
&gt;&gt; Theo Christov: Right.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.440
So I think what all of
these Washington, Franklin,

00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.740
Adams are doing is reading very
carefully Vattel as opposed

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:01.040
to they are endorsing every
single aspect of his theory.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.340
But I think in doing so, Vattel
really serves as an authority.

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:03.640
And I've had conversations with the
other colleague fellow Will Slauter

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.940
on the question of how Vattel
is being used as an authority.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.240
And I can say a little
bit more about that

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.540
in a more extended answer, but
let me just say briefly that,

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.840
what is a question of
authority and how Vattel

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.140
in late 18th century is being
used as a political authority?

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.440
And the really thing he's
being used as a source

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.740
for intellectual ammunition, there
is a bit of a cherry picking going

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.040
on in the sense that whatever is
being convenient from his treaties

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.340 position:56%
in his theory, he is being used by
many of the frames to make arguments

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.640
that would be useful to their ends.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.940
But fundamentally I think he's
being used as an authority

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.240
and he's eventually addressed
as he's just the authority.

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.690
I mean, Locke is another one
and Montesquieu is another one,

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:22.100
but Vattel is a true authority
in the Law of Nations.

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:23.400
So I do think that Washington--

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.700
there is a certain selectivity
in which he is being used.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.060
And by the way, there's a lot
more engagements of correspondents

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.360
that I just couldn't
really gage into.

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.660
But that sort of-- that
there is a selective process

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:29.960
in which he's being used.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.760
[Inaudible].

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.810
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:36.610
Yes.

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:58.230
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:03.380
The British loved Vattel
for one simple reason

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:07.580
because he really made very
important the question of commerce

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:10.290
and how the British have
established commercial relations,

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:13.200
which needs to be replicated
in the rest of Europe.

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.680
The French did not like Vattel.

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.920
And in fact, he was published
in Amsterdam and London.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.840
The very first edition was
published in Neuchatel.

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.800
Although I've-- from
what I have read,

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:25.680
it's even questionably first
published in Neuchatel,

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:31.860
but in 1759 an anonymous editor
publishes the work in London.

00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:34.740
I don't think that's insignificant
and he praises the British

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.690
because one simple reason,
in addition to the fact

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:40.580
that they develop commercial
relations, British love liberty

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:42.830
in a way that no other nation does.

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:44.740
And I think it's very
critical for him

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.620
that he doesn't endorse the French,
he doesn't endorse even the Swiss,

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.220
he himself is a Swiss,
he's from Neuchatel.

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.350
And by the way, he's a
contemporary of Rosso,

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:56.420 position:56%
but yet he's very much engaging with
the British because they provide

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.070
that blueprint for liberty.

00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:01.680
So I do think that he's very
much embraced on the island,

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.700
but within continental Europe,
he's much more questionable.

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.320
And I think this also a very
interesting point to make,

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:13.450
how he's being used and how
his theory has been transformed

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:15.160
in the American context.

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:19.010 position:56%
He was not writing for the Americans
and yet in the hands, precisely,

00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:24.290
of the editor Charles Dumas, he
was able to be very much used here.

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:26.110
And the first part
of the question was

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:28.450
that on any relation with Grotius?

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:32.110
So Grotius was the early
17th century Dutch jurist

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:36.420
and Vattel comes about a
130, a 140 years later.

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:40.970 position:56%
It's a very interesting question
because Grotius in many ways is seen

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:43.670
as much more rigid on the
question of intervention.

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.340
Vattel on the other hand is--

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:48.520
although that's even
somewhat questionable,

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:52.960
but I think he's much more reserved
on the question, can intervention

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.840
within international
relations is that permissible.

00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:01.750
I think in general Vattel would say
no at least in relation to Grotius.

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:03.610
What connects both
Grotius and Vattel

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:08.270
and by the way there's also a third
name Pufendorf because in 1785,

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:11.930 position:56%
Immanuel Kant writes of all three of
them, Grotius, Pufendorf and Vattel

00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:13.930
as sorry comforters, why?

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:15.590
Simply because they were not--

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:19.480
they were simply very fanciful
with their legal theories

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:21.130
because you cannot
put them in practice.

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:22.830
I think it's a struggle
we have today.

00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:26.540
Can international law be
imposed or is simple chimerical?

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:29.000
According to Immanuel Kant,
they were simply chimerical.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.940 position:56%
So Grotius, Vattel and Pufendorf was
the three he calls sorry comforters,

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:37.450
because they're just comforting us,
but actually we should feel sorry

00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:39.630
for that because they're not
really providing anything.

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:43.350
But Grotius is very much
I think coming out of--

00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:46.050
and I have actually a reason
to say this, he's really coming

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:50.860
out of use especially in 19th
century because citations,

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:55.500
Vattel in the 19th century in
legal-- in the Supreme Court cases,

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.560
in legal proceedings
far exceed those

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:01.190
of Grotius and Pufendorf combined.

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:03.520
So I think the legacy of
Grotius is still there,

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.130
but I think question
is practical use.

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:09.190
This was a practical guidebook,
Americans really needed

00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:11.390
that guidebook to kind of
struggle with questions

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:14.010
of diplomatic practice,
relations with other states,

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:15.890
Vattel provided that for them.

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:19.640
And I think that kind of
practicality aspect unlike Grotius

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:23.610
who was much more embedded
in his context of Portuguese

00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:28.230
versus Spanish imperial rivalry
was much more distance and kind

00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:33.200
of less practical than
someone like Vattel.

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.500
One more question?

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:36.300
Yes?

00:59:36.300 --> 01:00:20.880
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.920
So yeah. Let me-- And I think
it's a very good point to kind

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.970
of end some of my remarks.

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:29.340
The question, how can we think
of the rise of the American--

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.640
of the United States as
the emergence of the kind

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:37.350
of modernly recognizable
modern system?

01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:40.070
Often times, at least in
historiography, people take six

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:44.120
and 48 as that kind of foundational
year that that was when the treaty

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.170
of his failure-- the treaties
of his failure were signed.

01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:50.030
And I think there's a good
reason to have a marking point.

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:51.580
Periodization [phonetic]
is always nice.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:55.210
But I think there's lot of issues
with that six and 48 date namely

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:58.590
that Washington starts to
think that this is the birth

01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:01.790
of the nation state as
often times especially

01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:03.440
in international relations.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.460
Scholarship people
take that birth date

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.770
as unequivocally unambiguously
central.

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:13.320
I think there's issues with
that because it's not really

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.750
until the question

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:20.600
of how independence
provides the first condition

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.310
for external recognition.

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:25.260
And in many ways that's what
I'm trying to argue in my point

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:28.350
that you cannot establish
external recognition,

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:31.100
meaning outside recognizing you

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:36.860 position:56%
as a state before you claim
domestic autonomy of a certain kind.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.390
Now, there's very-- various ways

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:41.280 position:56%
in which one can establish political
autonomy and I think someone

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.980
like Vattel is more reserved

01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:45.640
about how he should structure
our political system.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.050
He's open to various kinds

01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:49.550
of political systems
and political regimes.

01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:54.310 position:56%
What is critical is to establish the
conditions for domestic sovereignty,

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:58.390
then and only then external
recondition can be demanded.

01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:01.520
And that's exactly what I think
people like David Armitage

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.610
for instance have insisted
the declaration

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:07.960
of independence is a legal document
in relation to international law.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:13.530 position:56%
How the birth of what we can call
today international law began by way

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:17.230
of moving from independence
to interdependence.

01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:21.080
In other words, you're not simply
on autonomous entity existing

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.240
on your own, but you're in
relation in a sort of web

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.390
of relations with other states.

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:29.800
And I think the birth of the
United States provides that kind

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:33.510
of pivotal moment because
in many ways, let's face it,

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:37.170
America was a fortunate
circumstance,

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:40.960
because nature favored
them in many ways.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:45.400
And I think that fortunate
circumstance provided the impetus

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.000
for how in the 19th and
especially in the second half

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.810 position:56%
of the 20th century the number of
states would quadruple from about 50

01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:55.110
around the time that the founding

01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:58.150
into United Nations
to almost 200 today.

01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:02.440 position:56%
And I think Vattel is providing that
kind of prescriptive model moving

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.630
from independence to
interdependence.

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:06.970
He's also very explicit

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:10.670
that independence is can sometimes
be very violent and very bloody.

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:12.700
It then can go on for sometime.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:17.130 position:56%
But once you have accomplished that,
then you are in a position to--

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:21.030
in my sort of words, you have
gained your ticket of admission

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:24.950
into that kind of larger
international society of states.

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:27.420
And the reason why I kind of
brought this story of the emergence

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.900
of the state in the
American context is largely

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.380
because I think it
provides that momentum

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:38.110 position:56%
for thinking how a very fortunate
nation has come in late 18th century

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:42.230
by sometimes [inaudible]
circumstances to emerge

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:46.030
as a global actor on
the international stage,

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:47.920
an event which doesn't
really happen until--

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.060
really until the late
19th, early 20th century.

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:55.150 position:56%
But I do think you can already begin
to see how in late 18th century,

01:03:55.150 --> 01:04:01.140 position:56%
there is some manifestations of that
desire to emerge as an equal act

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.100
or on the international stage.

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.400
Yeah.
