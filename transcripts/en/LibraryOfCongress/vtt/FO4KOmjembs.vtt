to when I call your school name.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.590
As you know we have few isles and
a lot of students so it's important

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.220
that you listen for your

get you out accordingly.

Thank you so much for

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.750
Thank you for the library

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.830
Thank you to Dina Sherman and
Disney Publishing Worldwide

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.630
for getting us all here
and getting you guys here.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.480
You guys are in for
a real treat today.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.860
You may have heard the story of
Star Wars but you've never heard it

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.040
like this before, and when you
hear these four authors come out

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.520
and read the story, your
minds will be blown.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.320
It'll be as if you're
hearing it for the first time.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.950
The stories that you're going to
hear today is where it all began

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.730
and that's why this is so cool.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.390
So without further ado let
me bring out these authors

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.000
so they can tell you
the stories themselves.

Alright lady and gentlemen before
we get started I thought it would be

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.150
nice if each of you could
introduce yourselves,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.330
tell this fine crowd what you're
known for and what your take is

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.430
on these awesome Star Wars books.

I'm Tony DiTerlizzi.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.440
I've written and illustrated
all kinds of books;

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.920 position:56%
probably most notably the Spiderwick
Chronicles, which I created

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.830
with my friend Holly
Black, thank you.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.200
I've done some picture books as
well and I am absolutely honored

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.820
to be the author of the Adventures
of Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.320
which is a picture book that I
put together for younger readers

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.870
that uses the artwork of a man
named Ralph McQuarrie who worked

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.180
with George Lucas way
back when in the 1970's

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.100
to envision what Star
Wars would actually look

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.080
like before the films
were even made.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.360
So I was able to have the amazing
task of returning Star Wars back

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.850
to words and pictures,
so I hope you like it.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: Awesome.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.450
Thank you Tony.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.130
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Hi guys.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.430
I'm Alex Bracken.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.410
I wrote the Y-Series The Darkest
Minds and I am also lucky enough

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.500
to be the author of the Star
Wars the New Hope Retelling,

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.490
the Princess, the Scoundrel
and the Farm Boy.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:42.410
And as you could probably guess
from the title I've taken the story

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.790
that you guys all know and love
from the film and I've divided

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.790
between Leia, Hans and Luke's
perspectives and I delve

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.960
in really deep to their
characters and kind

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.320
of give you little
sneak peeks and looks

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.030
into what they're doing off camera.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.580
So there are a bunch of scenes
that are not included in the film.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.880
So I hope you guys like it.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.480
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Hello
everybody, I'm Adam Gidwitz.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.520
I'm the author of A Tale Dark
and Grimm, In a Glass Grimmly

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.840 position:56%
and The Grimm Conclusion, and I've
now written the Empire Strikes Back,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.010
So You Want to Be a Jedi?

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.150
And what I do in So You Want to
Be a Jedi is I retell the story

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:28.890
of Empire Strikes Back, you are
Luke, you fight the battle on Hoth,

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.910
you are trained by Yoda and you
have to face Vader at the end.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.960
And between each chapter I
have Jedi training lessons

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.840
where I teach you how to do
important Jedi skills like meditate

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.550
and meditate while balancing
on one foot and other things

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.800
and maybe we'll even do a
couple of those here today.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.100
Alright.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.740
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Hey
I'm Tom Angleberger.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.310
I wrote The Origami Yoda series.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.700
Thanks guys.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.000
Thanks guys.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.300
That's nice of you.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.310
Yeah, me and origami Yoda we've
been together for a long time,

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:08.180
and one day I got this phone call
and they told me they wanted me

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.830
to write a book about
Yoda but with no origami.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.590
So at first I wasn't sure but
then they told me it was going

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.150
to be Return of the Jedi, and I
loved the movie Return of the Jedi.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.310
I saw it when I was your age
when it was in the theater

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.060
for the first time, just
like you guys are going

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.080
to go see Force Awakens and
it's going to blow your mind,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.770
I went to see Return of the
Jedi and it blew my mind.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.040
And so when I got the chance to
write it I just had so much fun

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.220
and I tried to pack as much
fun as possible into the book

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.810
and I kept packing and packing,
that's why my book is the longest

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.080
because I just packed in
everything I loved like the Ewoks

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.190
and Jabba the Hut and
I just had so much fun.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.430
I hope if you guys read it that
you'll have a lot of fun too.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: Awesome.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.560
Thank you Tom.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.580
Now that you guys now a little bit
about the authors and a little bit

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.120
about their books, we're
going to let them jump

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.220
into it, their reader's theater.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.520
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: We are.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.820

excited to be here at the Library

read for you guys,

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.690
and actually though there
are four of us here to read,

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.060
it turned out there
were of couple parts

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.220
that we needed help with reading.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.710
So there's one part
of this character,

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.510
I don't know if you guys have heard
of this guy, his name is Yoda.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.100
Does anyone know who Yoda is?

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.420
We actually need someone
to read the part of Yoda.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.640
Is there anyone out here that can
do like a good Yoda impression?

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.940

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.240
So many candidates.

should hold an audition Dina.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.040
Okay.

[ Background Sounds ]

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.130

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.730
There is no try.

What do you guys think?

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.510

maybe what we can do is

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.230
by show of applause, no?

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.960

just bring him

know I was telling you guys

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.550
that I stuffed a lot of stuff
into my books, well sometimes

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.030
when a book gets overstuffed
you use footnotes.

Do you guys know what
a footnote is like?

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.570
Right, well for a footnote, we
need somebody to read the footnotes

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.970
but wait a minute, it's got
to be something with a really

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.060
like a teacher kind of voice.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.510
Are there any teachers here?

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:48.170
[ Cheering ]

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.750
Alright they've got
to be a great teacher.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.870
We're looking for a great teacher.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.100
&gt;&gt; I think we've got a start here.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.400
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Okay.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.700
What's your name?

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.000
&gt;&gt; Knowles.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.300
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
Your name is Moe?

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.600
&gt;&gt; Knowles.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.900
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
Knowles, Mr. Knowles.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.200
Good old Mr. Knowles, and Mr.
Knowles let's hear you read

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.770
like a teacher kind of voice thing.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.490 position:56%
Give us a fact, an interesting fact.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.440
&gt;&gt; It was a dark and stormy night.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.100
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Oh yes,
yes, yes, that's my guy.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.990
The one I want, yeah.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:23.570
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: They've got
both people from their school.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:31.860
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Alright hold
on a second, hold on a second guys.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.160
There's one more we need.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.860
You can come on down Mr. Knowles.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.500
There's one more we need.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.800
We're actually running out of time.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.750
We don't have time to individually
audition people anymore.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:46.080
If you can do Chewbacca just go
ahead and give me your Chewbacca.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.650
[Inaudible] Alright, alright,
good, good, good, good.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:56.290
Hold on. Shh.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.770
You're all hired, you're all hired.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.270
When Chewbacca's moment
comes, and you'll know

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.620
when Chewbacca's moment comes, when
it's time for Chewbacca it's going

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.630
to tell you what Chewbacca
word to say, I want everybody

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.950
that just did it and everybody
else too, to do it all at once.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.570
We want a Chewbacca roar okay?

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: As loud as you can.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.540
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Let's
just test it out one time,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:27.040
one more time let's hear
Chewbacca one more time.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.820
[Inaudible] Good, good, good.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.110
Save it for the show.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:34.410
Good, perfect.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.710
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi:
Alright, Siglain.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: Go for it.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.310
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Alright.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:44.050
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: A long time
ago in a galaxy far, far away.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:51.860
This is a story of good versus
evil, of light dispelling darkness.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.900
This is a story of hope.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.730
It begins on the distant
planet of Tatooine

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:02.380
with a farm boy named
Luke Skywalker.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.450
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Luke
never knew his parents.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:09.600 position:56%
He lived with his Aunt and Uncle in
a farm that harvested precious water

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.740
from the dry desert air, and though
he was busy with his many chores

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.890
on the moisture farm,
Luke was bored.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.580
He dreamed of exploring
the twinkling frontier

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:25.180
of space beyond the scorching
twin suns of his dustbowl home.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.390
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Luke Skywalker
you're in for adventure.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.390
Little did he know that
just beyond the atmosphere

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.950
of his little planet an adventure,
his adventure, was beginning.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.160
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: It was
known throughout the galaxy

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.830
that the fearsome Darth Vader
was the face of the Empire.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.650
Under orders from his master,
Emperor Palpatine, Vader had hunted

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.110
down and exterminated all
members of the ancient order

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:54.230
or Jedi Knights except one.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.500
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Darth Vader
had seized Princess Leia's starship

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.590
and ordered a squadron of
storm troopers to track

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.940
down the two escaped
droids, R2D2 and C3PO.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.450
That they had fled to Luke's
planet where they located

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.950
that last known Jedi knight.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.700
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: From R2's eye
came a flickering image of a girl,

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.250 position:56%
though adorned in elegant robes of a
princess, her face was one of worry.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.350
Her recorded voice trembled.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.010
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.690
You're my only hope.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.870
The door hissed open and this dark
shape swept in followed closely

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.080
by two security officers.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.900
The two men fell into place
on either side of the door.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.240
Their gazes fixed on the ceiling.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.180
For a long terrible
second there is no sound

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.570
in the small cell beyond the steady
wheeze of Darth Vader's respirator.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.540
A cold drip of alarm
ran down Leia's back.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:50.150
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: I hope you find
your quarters adequate princess.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.920
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: No fear,
no breaking, no screaming.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.430
I demand to be released
and given a formal trial.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.670
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Spare
me your indignation.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.230
I've neither the time
nor the patience for it.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.180
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: A strange
sound, a beeping that sizzled

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.480
through the air like a bolt

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.500
of static made the hair
rise on Leia's neck.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.690
Vader stepped aside
allowing a spherical droid

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.150
to float in behind him.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.660
It bobbed slightly as
it came toward her.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.310
Its glossy, black exterior
shot through with silver

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.090
and punctuated by a red eye light.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.390
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: What?

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.690
No.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.680
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Leia knew what
it was; an interrogation droid.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.540
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: This is
your last chance your highness.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.880
If you will not tell
me where the plans are

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.330
and where I'll find
the rebel's fortress,

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.910
I will force the answers from you.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.450
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
There was nowhere to run.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:42.100
Leia bolted toward the door but
Vader's arms locked around her,

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.350
swaying her back into the
interrogation droid's path.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.190 position:56%
The pain that lanced through her
arm as the needle punctured her skin

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.020
and the serum seeped into
her system was unbearable.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.420
And then a voice floated
to her through the clouds.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.490
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Your
highness, you're safe.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.040
You can trust me.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.000
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Leia
shook her head, turning her face

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.600
against something cold,
hard, smooth.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.890
Cell, she was in a
cell, on the, on the,

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.920
why couldn't she hold
onto a thought?

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.780
Her pulse was pounding
in her ears again.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.830
She pressed her hands against them.

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:18.440
Not safe, not safe, not safe.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.070
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: I'm
with the rebel alliance.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.880
I need to know what you did
with the Death Star plans.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.420
You must tell me.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.260
You must trust me.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.970
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: There
was a bad taste in her mouth,

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.070
a pounding in her skull, Leia was
so sure she was going to be sick,

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.570
she bent at the waist
ignoring the way fire seemed

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.040
to burn through her blood.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.100
Words popped like bubbles
in her mind.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.200
Interrogation, Death Star, Vader.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.500
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: We need them Leia.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.550
Tell me where to find the plans.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.090
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Leave me alone.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.860
Interrogation, Rebels, can't tell
the truth, don't tell the truth.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.920
Antilles, [inaudible]
Alderaan, Senate, Galaxy.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.730 position:56%
You'll be forced to give
information her instructor had said,

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.960
truthful information but it doesn't
have to be current information.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.550
There's always a way to
give a truth that's related

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.290
but not the answer they want.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.610
Find a connection.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.160
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi:
Where are the plans?

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.460
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
I don't have them.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.760
I don't have them.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.060
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Where are they?

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.360
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
I don't have them.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.660
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi:
Where did you send them?

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.960
Where is the rebel base?

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.440
If you do not tell me where to
find the rebels lives will be lost.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.670
All the rebel deaths
will be on your head.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.920
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Your father
wants you to trust us.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.190
He wants you to tell us
where to find the rebels.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.560
He's worried about you.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.040
He wants you to come home.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.400
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Alderaan is my home.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.400
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Are you a
member of the Rebel Alliance?

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.840
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
I'm Princess Leia Organa.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.920
I'm the Senator from Alderaan.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.970
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
And that was the truth.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.050
Vader stepped back watching
her as stilly and silently

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.420
as any poisonous snake
about to strike.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.390
He began to turn signaling
something to the security officers.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.150
Leia slumped back against
the metal cot in relief.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.460
They were leaving.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.760
It was over.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.210
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Careful.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.570
If you continue to resist,
soon you will be neither.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:07.810
Luke fled the icy battlefield and
boarded his hidden X-wing fighter

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.080
where R2D2 waited for him.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.170
As they flew away, Obi-Wan Kenobi's
voice drifted into Luke's mind.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.570
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: You will
go to the [inaudible] system.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:21.730
There, you will learn from Yoda,
the Jedi Master who instructed me.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Luke and R2 arrived
on the boggy planet of Dagobah.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: I don't know R2.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.100
Seems like a strange place
to find a Jedi Master.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.470
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: At dusk
a wizened creature appeared

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.770
from the mists.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.070
It was Yoda.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.760
Under Yoda's guidance Luke
began the rigorous practice

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.570
of becoming a Jedi,
exercising both body and mind.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.520
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: What we're going

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.140
to do now is we're going
to do a Jedi lesson.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.080
I'm not Yoda but I can teach you a
little bit of how to become a Jedi.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.440
So there's going to be a few
stages to this Jedi lesson.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.320
The first stage is that everybody
in the audience needs to be sitting

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.370
in a comfortable, seated position
with both feet on the ground.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.640
If you can't reach then
try as best you can.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.280
I want you to close your eyes.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.630
I want you to start to
breathe calmly and quietly

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.570
in through your nose and
out through your nose.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:20.010
Think of nothing but your breath
going in and out of your nose.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.360
See if you can let this
place where we are,

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.150
the people around you just
disappear as you just focus

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:33.140
on the breath going in
and out, in and out.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.670
When you feel calm
and you feel focused,

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.300
if you would like to volunteer for
the second stage of the Jedi test,

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:45.620
you may calmly open your eyes and
raise your hand and I will call

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.460
on a calm Padawan to do
the next stage of the test.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.900
Sir in the white shirt you
look super calm and ready.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.930
You can put your jacket down
and come up here on the stage.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.320
You can give him a hand.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.820
What's your name?

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.120
&gt;&gt; Matheno [assumed spelling]

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.420
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Mathena?

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.720
&gt;&gt; Matheno.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.020
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Matheno.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.320
What school do you go to?

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.620
&gt;&gt; Maury Elementary.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.920
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Alright,
okay, are you ready for this?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.220
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.520
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: You sure?

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.820
&gt;&gt; Okay. I need this right now.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.990
What I'd like you to do
is I want you to face me.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.260
I want you to first regain
that peace you had before.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:27.760
Close your eyes, try to
breathe in and out, in and out.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.490
When you feel calm and ready
you may open your eyes again.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.440
Ready? I want you to take this
book, I want you to balance it

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.630
on your head and I want you to
continue to breathe in and out

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.790
of your nose calmly while
it's balanced on your head.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:47.990
Okay, good, in and out, in and out.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.640
Alright, give him a
round of applause.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.510
Are you ready for the second step?

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.810
This is the next stage.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.110
It's getting harder.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.410
Are you ready?

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.810
I have brought with me a
bag of my dirty laundry.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:05.440
I'm going to throw my dirty laundry
at you while you balance that book

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.760
on your head, and I want you
to raise your hands and see

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.680
if you can prevent the dirty
laundry from hitting you

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.980 position:56%
and knocking the book off your head.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.280
Do you want to do this?

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.580
Are you ready?

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.880
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.180
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Okay, he's ready.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.480
He wants me to throw my
dirty laundry at him.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.780
Alright. Open your eyes.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.300
As it comes you just
try to block it,

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.590
but if you swing too hard the
book is going to fall off okay?

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:26.890
Gotta stay calm.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.190
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Gentle, gentle.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.490
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Gotta stay calm.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.050
Good, good.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.290
Put it back on.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.590
Keep trying.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.890
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Keep going.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:38.850
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: He
doesn't let it hit him.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.150
That's good.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.450
Yeah.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.750
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yay!

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.050
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Give
him a hand everybody.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:45.350
Nice one. Goodbye.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.650
Thank you.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:55.770
I'm just going to leave
my socks on the stage.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:01.170
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
What is that a hat?

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:05.510
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Yeah
that was a dirty hat.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.810
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Nicely done.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.290
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Just a second.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.970
There's an odor problem.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.070
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Oh, you're
kicking them over to us, thanks.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:18.970
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: I'm
sensitive to disgusting odors.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.510
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Good work buddy.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: He blocked them.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.550
You guys ready?

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.850
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.560
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: As he
became stronger with the force,

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.610
Luke began to have visions.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:38.890
One of these visions was of Darth
Vader, another foretold the future.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.200
Luke saw a city in the clouds.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.750
His friends Han, Leia and Chewy
were there but they were in pain.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.360
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: I have to go.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.520
I can help them.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.710
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Yoda and
Obi Wan tried to stop Luke.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.500
He was not finished
with his training

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.600
but Luke had made up his mind.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.480
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
That boy is out last hope.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.140
&gt;&gt; No, there is another.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.180
&gt;&gt; He nailed it.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.510
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: You are
walking through a tunnel.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.520
You see nothing but you can
feel the shake of the space.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.740
The force is curling
around you in the form

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.870
of a metallic tube,
but Vader is not here.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.170
You press on.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.270
You emerge into a cluttered,
dark corridor.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.710
Large windows giving out onto the
central reactor core shed a very

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:27.010
dim light.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.980
You reach out with your senses.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.800
Vader is here but he is avoiding
you, muddying the force around you.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.290
A pang of fear slaps your heart.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.590
He is stronger than you are.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.360
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: And
that's when it hits you

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.230
like a barn being thrown by a
sand storm right into your body.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.500
You fall then rise again
throbbing with pain.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.950 position:56%
A giant piece of machinery has
clattered to the floor at your feet.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:54.190
You turn to look where it came from
and another crashes into your head.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:55.490
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
You are on your knees.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.580
You raise your lightsaber
to protect yourself

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.890
but the metal objects
are coming too fast.

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:01.780
Vader is detaching them from walls,

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.860
lifting them from the floor
and hurling them at you.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.250
You can see them, you
can't even sense them.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.930
Vader has muddied the
force too much.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:13.120
You're bleeding, you are
reeling, you are losing.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.880
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: And that's
when the biggest one hits you.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:20.270
You're flying through one of those
large windows glass shattering

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:25.190
around you like rain in a
storm, into the reactor shaft.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:30.570
There is nothing below you, nothing
for half a kilometer or more.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.210
Time has slowed which
is not necessarily good

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.150
because it's merely
giving you time to realize

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.190
that you are about to die.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.490
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: And then

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.800
as you fall you realize there is
a gantry platform, a long, thin,

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.650
steel catwalk very near you.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.930
You reach out, you are falling
but your hand touches steel,

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.700
you grab it, your body snaps
like a fish at the end of a line,

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.860
but your hand is still
gripping the steel.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.000
Below you the reactor core
descends into oblivion.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.810
Wind is whipping at your face.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.630
You smell your own sweat and your
legs are swinging over the abyss.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.340
You kick at the air but you cannot
raise yourself onto the platform.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.660
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Fear
is overpowering you now.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.880
You look down and back up.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:17.990 position:56%
Vader has appeared at the end of the
gantry, towering, dark, enormous.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.290
He is walking toward you.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:22.870
His steps echo like the
ticking of an enormous clock.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.490
You managed to pull
yourself up onto the gantry.

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.070
You climb to your feet which takes

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:30.090
about as much effort
as climbing a mountain.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:31.820
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
You ignite your sword.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.300
One last stand you tell
yourself, you can beat him.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.220
You try to feel calm but
you are merely trying

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.690 position:56%
so you do not feel calm, not at all.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.160
Maybe you should listen to Vader.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.400 position:56%
Maybe you should let your anger out.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.750
Give into it.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.700
But you can't do that.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.260
All you feel is fear.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.210
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: He
strides towards you.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:57.020
Dark, steady, familiar,
and then you leap at him,

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.200
your feet leaving the
ground entirely,

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.020
your lightsaber leading
like a lance.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.320
He [inaudible].

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.150
You land on your feet and
drive your lightsaber at him.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.150
You smell burning flesh.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.300
Gas is hissing somewhere.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.670
You stare.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.160
Vader looks down.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.590
You've hit him on the right arm.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.060
You've wounded him.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.570
You feel surprised, triumphant.

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.860
You are a great warrior.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.240
You have done the impossible.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.000
You have wounded Darth Vader.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.240
You are a Jedi.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.770
You have become

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.090
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: His sword
blazes through the air

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.160
and cuts your right
hand from your arm.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.370
The pain is blinding and is
instantly eclipsed by your fear.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.180
For as you watch the most
surreal sight you have ever seen,

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:45.220
your own hand tumbling away
from you into the reactor core,

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.610
you see tumbling with
it your lightsaber.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.240
And now the pain and
the fear are one

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.590
and they are greater
than you; much greater.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.330
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi:
There is no escape Luke.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.700
It is useless to resist.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.060
The rebel alliance
was larger than ever.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.030
Leaders from all over the
galaxy banded together

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.910
in a final effort to
defeat the empire.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:12.900
At the headquarters
of the rebel fleet,

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.230
Luke learned that Emperor Palpatine
had been secretly overseeing the

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:22.180
construction of a new Death
Star deadlier than the first.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.270
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: An
invisible shield protected this new

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.570
space station.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.820
A generator located on the
nearby force [inaudible] powered

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.120
the shield.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.050
If Luke and his friends deactivate
the shield then the rebel fighters

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:37.600
could strike destroying the Death
Star and the emperor with it.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.900
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: With Han

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.860 position:56%
and Chewy piloting a stolen imperial
shuttle, Luke, Leia, the droids

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.260
and the team of rebels attempt
to slip past the new Death Star

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.870
and touch down on the
forested moon of Endor.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.460
Chapter 36 in which
the rebel plan begins.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.150
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Bring her
out of light speed Chewy.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.330
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: The
blurred stars and cosmic clouds

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.180
that they've been watching for
hours freezes and they are looking

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.980 position:56%
at an ominous sight, an immense star
cruiser, one of the biggest ships

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.140
in the galaxy just ahead.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.240
Beyond it looms something
far bigger;

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.020
the empire's new space
station, the new Death Star.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.200
Now Death Star commander Moff
[inaudible] still doesn't have it

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.450
finished and one whole
hemisphere trails off into a mess

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.970
of scaffolding and girders.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.860
But even unfinished it still
seems unnaturally large.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.160
Footnote.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.440
&gt;&gt; A dozen planets were stripped
bare just to get the raw materials

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.110
to make this second Death Star.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:37.080
Even now other worlds
are being plundered

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.400
to obtain the fuel to power it.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.440
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: The best
footnote I've ever heard.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.150
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: I should have
had you read the whole thing.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.310
I could have been the footnote and
you could have been the narrator.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:48.760
That's good.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.790
Okay. It's an insult to the cosmos

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.150
that has already thrown off the
rotation of the nearby moon,

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.680
but our heroes are not
quite as frightened

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.400
as they might be after all.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.820
They've blown up one
of these things before

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:05.360
and this one isn't even working
yet, and yet Leia notices

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.640
that Luke seems more
worried than the rest.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.940
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Get the nav.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.240
computer to plot us a
course out of here Chewy.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:18.060
If they don't go for
this we're going to have

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:22.490
to get them here pretty quick.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:23.790
&gt;&gt; Yrrrggh.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.090
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: We
have you on screen now.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:26.390
Please identify.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:28.130
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Shuttle
[inaudible] requesting deactivation

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.580
of the deflector shield.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.480
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: [Inaudible]
transmit the clearance code

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.780
for shield passage.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.080
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Transmission
commencing.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.380
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Maintain present course

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.780
until code verification.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.890
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You didn't think the
[inaudible] worked for free did you?

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.480
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: It'll
work, it'll work.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.270
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
Vader is on that ship.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.530
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Don't
get jittery Luke.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:31:05.790
There are a lot of command ships,
keep your distance though Chewy,

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:15.590
but don't look like you're
trying to keep your distance.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.890
&gt;&gt; Yrrrggh.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.190
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: I
don't know, fly natural.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.490
&gt;&gt; Wuggg.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:20.790
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Wuggg.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.090
I want a hug.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:25.220
The Death Star began vaporizing
entire rebel cruisers in one shot.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:29.430
Luke felt pain watching the
defeat of his rebel friends.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.860
Anger and hate filled him.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.480
Luke Skywalker felt the power
of the dark side of the force.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.810
With lightning speed he
ignited his lightsaber

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.210
and battled Darth Vader once more.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.630
Luke's rage fueled his aggressions.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:46.490
In time Vader lay defeated
though not dead.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:47.790
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Good.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.100
Your hate has made you powerful.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:56.000
Now fulfill your destiny and take
your father's place at my side.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.700
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Luke looked
down to see his own reflection

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.410
in his father's black mask.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:02.930
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Never, I'll
never turn to the dark side.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.690 position:56%
I'm a Jedi like my father before me.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:08.120
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Furious, Emperor
Palpatine conjured the dark power

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.070
of the force and struck Luke
with bolts of evil lightning.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.880
The young Jedi fell to the
floor writhing in agony.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.710
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: But Luke's
father who still did have a glimmer

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:23.190 position:56%
of light in his dark existence
could not watch his son be betrayed.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.750
With his last bit of strength
Darth Vader seized the emperor,

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.240
lifted him high and thrust
him down a shaft that led

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.370
to the core of the Death Star.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:37.930
Palpatine exploded in a whoosh
of dark, hate-filled energy.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: On the surface of
the Death Star the rebels closed in.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.490
In minutes the space
station would be destroyed.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:48.030
Carrying his battered father Luke
stumbled to an imperial shuttle.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.050
&gt;&gt; Ka-Boom.

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:52.750
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Luke's
shuttle rocketed away

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.580
from the exploding
Death Star just in time.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:33:00.430
A dying Darth Vader asked his son
to remove his helmet and mask.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:03.210
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: You
were right about me Luke.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:06.150
Tell your sister you were right.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.820
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Anakin Skywalker
closed his battle weary eyes

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:12.280
for the last time and
Luke said goodbye.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.910
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: No longer
the farm boy from Tatooine,

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:17.560
Luke Skywalker fulfilled
his destiny.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.950
He became a Jedi Knight
and saved the galaxy.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:25.880
More important, he saved his
father and found his family.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.510
&gt;&gt; The force was with him.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:37.140
[ Applause ]

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.510
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: How about a
big hand for footnote and Yoda?

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:48.050
[ Applause ]

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain:
That was awesome.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.720
Thank you guys.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:57.110 position:56%
We have a little bit of time so what
we thought we would do is open it

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:01.160
up to the audience to see
if anyone had any questions

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.120
for our four authors up here.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.480
There's one right there.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.630
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: I'm just
cleaning up my laundry, sorry.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.100
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: And
before you ask questions.

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.550
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: I'm sorry too.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: We're not going

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:18.980
to tell you what happens
in The Force Awakens.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.810
&gt;&gt; Okay you have another one?

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:22.110
&gt;&gt; I was going to ask

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:27.820
who was holding Darth Vader's mask
during the video in the trailer.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.370
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: I
can't tell you that.

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:33.620
I mean I know of course
but I can't tell you.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.920
&gt;&gt; So we're going to take questions

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.390
about the original
movies and the books.

00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:40.010
We can't give away any secrets
about The Force Awakens.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: You don't
want me to spoil the movie now.

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:42.610
You've got ten more days.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:44.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Let's take the quadrant up there.

00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:49.990
You want to grab someone?

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:56.590
&gt;&gt; I have a question
about the books.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:00.050
What inspired you to write them?

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:01.550
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: What
inspired us to write the books?

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.850
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Wow.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:04.150
Good question.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:05.450
I think Tom you said it best.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:08.590
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
Star Trek inspired me.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:12.200
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: We were all
your age when we saw Star Wars.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.500
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Oh Star Wars.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.800
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Star Wars.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.100
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: I meant to say.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Was that a joke?

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:18.990
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: What?

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.290
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Were you joking?

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Were you joking?

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: I'm just trying
to mess with [inaudible] that's all.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.190
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi:
We were all your age

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.490 position:56%
and does anyone here love Star Wars?

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.890
Has anyone seen the movies?

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.190
That's us.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:32.550
We are huge Star Wars fans and
so we were greatly inspired

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:36.920
by these original films, and
I know I speak for myself,

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.930
probably for all you guys,
it greatly influenced us

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.290 position:56%
as story tellers in our other books.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.290
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Next question.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:45.960
We got a question up there?

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.350
&gt;&gt; What was the first
children's book you ever wrote?

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:51.940
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: First
children's book we ever wrote.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.240
Good question.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.540
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Start with me?

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:59.350
I did a book about a boy who loves
Moon Pies called Jimmy Zangwow's

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:02.120
Out-of-This-World Moon-Pie
Adventure.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.420
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
It sounds delicious.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.710
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
Give it up for Moon Pie.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.090
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Well thank you.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:09.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: I wrote a book

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.420
about a cursed wizard
called Brightly Woven.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.720
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
I didn't know that.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.380
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah,
that was my first one.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.230
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: I wrote a book
called A Tale Dark and Grimm

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.360
which about the original
Grimm Fairy Tales

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.690 position:56%
which are scary and bloody and dark.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.360
That was my first book.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.840
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: And I wrote,
my first book I wrote was about,

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.630
was a book called Horton
Halfpott and,

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.860
have you read Horton
Halfpott, that one guy?

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.490
You've actually read it?

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:38.790
Yes, one person.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.090
Thanks dude.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:41.460
Are you just making that
up to make me feel better?

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.760
It's alright.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Is that the
book about the exploding sewer pipe?

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.360
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: No.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.390
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Never mind.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.690
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
What the heck man.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.350
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Another
question right here.

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.570
&gt;&gt; What does Darth Vader look
like in the original movies?

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.420
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: What does he
look like in the original movies.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.500 position:56%
You mean when his mask is taken off?

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.100
You did that scene.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.400
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Right.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.700
I got to do that scene.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.470
I got to write that scene
and what's amazing is

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.330
to the viewer it's disgusting.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:10.300 position:56%
I mean he's been in that mask for so
many years, he's been badly injured.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.600
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: He
must smell pretty ripe.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.900
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
It's really weird.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.370
But so for the viewer
it's really disgusting

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:17.710
but for Luke Skywalker it's
the first chance he's ever had

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:20.110
to look his father in the eyes.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.770
It's his first chance to
ever see what his father is,

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.560
so it's a really strange scene.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.070
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: And he's
like dad, you're ugly.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:30.250
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: No, no, no.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:33.090
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Then
you put the mask back on.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.390
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Sorry dude.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.660
Next question.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.270
&gt;&gt; How many days did it take
to make those four books?

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.570
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Ask us again.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:42.870
We couldn't hear.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.020
&gt;&gt; How many days did it take
to make those four books?

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.130
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: How many days did
it take to write the four books?

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.430
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: A lot of days.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.730
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
Yeah, a lot of days.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: I think it
took them too many days actually.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:54.430
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: It took me
about a year to write my book

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.980
and it was not easy because I'm
trying to write a book that is

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.990
as exciting as one of my
favorite movies of all time,

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.290
so it's not easy to do that.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.790
And you can't just write
what you saw on the screen

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:06.260
because everybody else
saw that, that's boring.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.590
So you've got to find a way to make
it interesting, make it exciting

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.410
for a reader in a book, so I think
we all had different approaches

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.070
to try to do that and it
took a long time to do.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.370
So it took me a year.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:17.010
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah
it took me a couple months.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: A couple months?

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.780
Man.

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.080
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: She writes fast.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.380
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Yeah
she's a lot faster than I am.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.100
It took me forever because I
would watch the movie like,

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:28.650
and I would pause it after two
seconds and then write what I saw.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:29.950
Wait a minute.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.020
Anyway I had a great
time, it was the best.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:35.530
If it took about eight months,
it was an awesome eight months.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.720
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Question
up there right?

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.230
&gt;&gt; How long has it taken you; no.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.790
How many books have you made?

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.460
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: How many
books have we each made?

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.810
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Oh man.

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.300
A lot.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.910
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: A bunch.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:49.210
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Like seven.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:50.510
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Four.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.810
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
I'm up to like 14 now.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.110
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Wow.

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:54.410
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Over there.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:57.960
&gt;&gt; You left out, you left
out the part on Endor.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.260
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Yes.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.560
Let's reenact it right now.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.610
You guys want to be Ewoks?

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:04.910
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Yeah.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.210
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Let's do it.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.890
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Can
you guys be Ewoks too?

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:12.100
Because when the Ewoks go to
battle they have a battle cry

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.740 position:56%
and their battle cry is [inaudible].

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:20.290
So I'm going to be an Ewok and when
I raise my fist you guys do the

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:24.660
battle cry, [inaudible].

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.030
Yes, yes. We're all Ewoks.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:29.540
Is that good?

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.360
Are you satisfied now?

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.660
You satisfied now?

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.960
He's satisfied.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.260
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: That
scene is in the book,

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.640
so we just read little
parts of our book.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.620
In the book it's there.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.090
Alright down here we've
got a question.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.390
&gt;&gt; How did Darth Vader turn evil?

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.790
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: How did
Darth Vader turn evil?

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:47.090
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi:
That's a good question.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.720
That's a good question.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.610
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: He gave into
his anger and hatred and fear.

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:53.910
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: And fear.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.490
All the things Luke was
battling; anger, fear.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:00.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: He let his anger
take control of him and he let,

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.050
when anger and fear took
control of him he fell victim

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:08.890 position:56%
to the Emperor Palpatine and Emperor
Palpatine led him to the dark side,

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:11.890
even though Yoda was trying to
pull him back to the right side,

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.540
Emperor Palpatine was
too strong right then

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:18.180
because of Vader's fear and anger.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.480
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Over here.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.480
&gt;&gt; What were your biggest
challenges in writing Star Wars?

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.780
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Great question.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.330
What were the biggest
challenges in writing Star Wars?

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.850
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: A lot
of people love Star Wars.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:36.700
So there's a level of expectation
that we had to try to deliver this,

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:40.990
like Adam said, capture
this excitement in words

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.290
or in words and pictures.

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:44.700
It's really tough.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.640
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Another part
is like a big monster will come

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.790
on the screen, in one split
second you see that monster

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.450
and you know oh that's
the [inaudible],

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:56.470
it's got these giant teeth, but
to write and describe that is

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:59.110
like three pages to describe
just how big his teeth are.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.980
So that's one reason
it was really tricky.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.300
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Like 100 of
Tom's pages are just about teeth.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.600
Most of the book is just teeth.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.900
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
Teeth and drool.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: That's not true.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.500
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Over there.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.720
&gt;&gt; Are you going to do
like the Phantom Menace,

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.630
Attack of the Clones
and Revenge of the Sith?

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:14.930
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Good question.

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:16.230
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Do
you think we should?

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:18.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: Yeah,
do you want to see that?

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.530
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Should
we do Phantom Menace?

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: Alright.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.130
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: So the guy
over here, Mike Siglain,

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:27.030
runs the Lucas Film Publishing

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.620
and it's his decision whether
we write those books or not.

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.260
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Do you
think he should let one

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.560
of us write The Force Awakens?

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain:
What do you think?

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.010
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Right, me too.

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:37.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: Alright
you guys have to fight now

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.310
to figure out who writes it.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:42.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Alright, over here.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:46.680
&gt;&gt; Mr. Angleberger will you write
another book using origami Yoda?

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: You know I don't
want to take too much time here

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.490
but you know my series was
about Dwight and Harvey,

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:56.860 position:56%
Dwight versus Harvey, and that story
of Dwight and Harvey is over now

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:01.450
but it's possible that there'll be
a new story about different kids

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:03.340
with different characters,
maybe kids like you

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.480
that have seen The Force Awakens
and want to make origami based

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.010
on the new movie, so
it's possible man.

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:15.020
If I did another book who do you
think should be the cover star?

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.320
&gt;&gt; Kylo Ren.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.620
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Kylo Ren.

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.100
Good choice man, great choice.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.810
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Alright
question down here.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:26.780
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite
droid out of all the series?

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.080
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Favorite droid?

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.380
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.680
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Good question.

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.980
&gt;&gt; And BB-8 included.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:33.280
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: BB-8 included.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.880
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: What
favorite droid including BB-8.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.790
I love the Gonk droid.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.450
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Aw dude,
I was going to say Gonk droid.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:40.750
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Gonk droid.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.930
He's just a giant like
lunchbox with legs

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:47.210
and he goes gonk, gonk,
gonk, gonk, gonk.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:49.010
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Who's
your favorite Alex?

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.970
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Oh
I was going to say IG-88,

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:54.840
he's the bounty hunter,
he's scary, but I love R2.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.750
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Yeah I'm going
to go just really basic with R2D2

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.730
because I feel like every like
[inaudible] you know all the sounds

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:04.030 position:56%
that he makes, he's really just like
saying really bad words at people

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:07.180
but nobody understands it.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.230
I think he's cursing
through the whole movie.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Well if you're
going to go R2 I'm going to go C3PO.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:12.530
I love C3PO.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:13.830
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: It's
your first choice.

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:15.130
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: He's
underrated and in my book I point

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:18.450
out that the entire Star Wars
saga pivots on C3PO's ability

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:23.560
to translate Ewok, because if he
couldn't have translated Ewok,

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.770
everybody would have lost.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.070
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Down here.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:29.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I've got a question for the girl.

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:34.240
How did you make your
voice sound like that?

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.630
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: You
mean Emperor Palpatine?

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.280
That one?

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.580
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: That was good.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:47.230
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: You pretend
you're clearing your throat.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:48.570
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Up there.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:52.640
&gt;&gt; Who did Chewbacca kill?

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.700
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Who
does Chewbacca kill?

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:58.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Chewbacca is a
pretty deadly warrior and he shoots,

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.630
he shoots about half of the
speeder bike guys right?

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:02.930
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: Yeah.

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:04.230
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: And he shoots at
the storm troopers who are trying

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:05.730
to get onto the base on Hoth.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:11.180
&gt;&gt; What are your favorite
parts in the movie?

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.490
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Favorite
parts in the movie?

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:18.180
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi:
That's good, that's good.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:24.760
I still love when Luke looks at
the two suns setting when he's

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:29.740
like wants to leave his home and
he wants to go, go on an adventure

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.050
and explore and he
watches the sun sets.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:34.770
That was very, that meant
a lot to me as a kid.

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.070
I grew up down in Florida
and it feels

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.470
like we have two suns it's so hot.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:40.840
I also yearn to leave home.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.140
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken:
You guys know how that is

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.220
in this area and the sun.

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.710
It's hot. My favorite is still
when they escape the Death Star

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:51.120
and Leia has to save the boys
who are trying to save her.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.470
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: My favorite is
on [inaudible] when Luke tries

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:57.770
to lift the x-wing out the
swamp with just using the force

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:01.280
and he can't do it, and he says
Yoda you're asking the impossible.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.320
And then Yoda, little Yoda lifts
the whole ship out of the swamp

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.320 position:56%
and Luke says, I don't believe it,
and Yoda says, that is why you fail.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:16.940
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: I like that one
part where Han Solo says something

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:20.690
and then Chewbacca says
something and it sounds like this

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:21.990
&gt;&gt; Yrrrggh.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:25.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: I just like
hearing them do the Chewbacca sound.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:26.610
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: You
guys are pretty great Wookies.

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:27.910
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Who's next?

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.210
Down here right?

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:35.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; How did Darth Vader's voice, I
mean how did his face get all white?

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.690
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: When
his face gets all gross

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.420
and white in the movies right?

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:44.260
I think if you keep a giant
metal helmet on for like 30 years

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:45.950 position:56%
or whatever, you just get like that.

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:47.250
You get no sun exposure.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.550
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: No sun.

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:49.850
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: No suntan.

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:53.650
&gt;&gt; Why is he all battle
damaged and, why's he all hurt?

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.370
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: That's
because he and Obi Wan had a fight

00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:02.050
on the volcano planet and there
was a lot of lava and Anakin ends

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:06.650
up not only getting beaten by Obi
Wan but also falling into the lava,

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:08.490
so he's pretty badly damaged.

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.380
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: We've got
to keep moving over here now.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:12.680
Over here.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.040
&gt;&gt; What was the coolest
movie you made?

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.440
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: The
coolest of these movies?

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.940
All the Star Wars movies?

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.320
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Maybe
we should do an audience vote

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.280
on which film they like the best.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.580
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Yeah.

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.880
Okay.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.180
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Show of hands,
not cheering just show of hands.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.480
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: Raise your hand

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.780
if you think Phantom
Menace is the coolest?

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.250
Attack of the Clones?

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:31.370
Revenge of the Sith?

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:33.520
The Clone Wars TV show?

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.450
A New Hope?

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:36.860
Empire Strikes Back?

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:41.190 position:56%
Return of the Jedi the book I wrote?

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.130
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: The
Star Wars Holiday Special?

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:44.550
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger:
The Force Awakens?

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.850 position:56%
They love the Force Awakens already.

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:50.250
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Alright up here.

00:46:50.250 --> 00:47:03.560
Last couple of question right?

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.860
Okay.

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:08.600
&gt;&gt; Why did you choose to put
those characters on your books?

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.900
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Great question.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.330
Why did we choose these
characters for our books?

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:12.630
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Mike?

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:13.930
&gt;&gt; Mike Siglain: You
want me to take that?

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:15.230
Sure. Because we wanted
to do something

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:18.060
that hadn't been done before
and we figured for Star Wars,

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.820
the way Alex wrote it, is she
made it into three stories;

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.930
Princess Leia's story and
then you have Han's story

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:24.490
and then you have Luke's story,

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.930
so we wanted to start
with Princess Leia.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:29.720
For Adam's we said oh we wanted
to, Adam is teaching you how

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.110
to be a Jedi, so in between
the story you get a lesson

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:35.540
like he taught up here
about how to be a Jedi

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.930
and who's the greatest Jedi of all?

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:39.660
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: And if you read
the book with your friends you get

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.370
to throw your dirty
laundry at your friends

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:45.030
so I highly recommend
reading it together.

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:48.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: So we put Yoda
on that cover and then we have Luke

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:51.240
and Vader fighting, and then with
Tom's you know beware of the power

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:56.060
of the dark side, it's all
about Darth Vader so we had

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.360
to put Vader on top of Tom's.

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:05.460
And for Tony's we did Luke versus
Vader because it's his story,

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:06.760
it's Luke Skywalker's story.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:10.550
So we hope you like them, we
love them, hope you guys agree.

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:12.170
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Alright, last two.

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:23.890
&gt;&gt; Are you guys going to write
more books based on Star Wars?

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:26.320
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: I sure hope so.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.660
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: I hope so too.

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:32.320
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: You guys have
got to read these first though.

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.620
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: Yeah.

00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:36.620
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Alright
last question.

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:45.490
&gt;&gt; Why did Luke Skywalker go to
Yoda so he can become a Jedi?

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:47.610
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: I think you
answered your own question.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:49.860
So he could become a Jedi.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.900
Don't we all want to become a Jedi?

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.980
No? You going to become a Sith?

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.280
No, neither.

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: Before we go,
we've got just one last minute.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.180
I just wanted to, before, you
know, thank you to the Library

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.560
of Congress, thank you to
Disney, thank you to you guys.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:11.960
Very quickly what else
are you guys working on?

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:15.970
Where else could they, you know,
if these kids are interested

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:18.330
in your stories what do you got?

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.880
What's coming up?

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:23.460
&gt;&gt; Tony DiTerlizzi: I did a book
about a cat and a dog that live

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.760
in Paris France written by Mo
Willems, you may have heard of him,

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.220 position:56%
and I did all the drawings for that,

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:34.170
and it's a book called The
Story of Diva and Flea.

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:36.400
Just came out.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:42.540
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Bracken: I wrote a
book that's a time travel adventure

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:43.840
called Passenger.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.870
It comes out January
5th so really soon.

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:49.750
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: I wrote a book,
it takes place in the Middle Ages,

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:55.090
the time of knights and kings
and castle and it's a dark

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:58.130
and scary adventure, and
there may be a dragon in it

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:06.770
that kills people by
farting on them.

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.910
And it comes out in
the fall, in September.

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:10.510
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: That's gross.

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.450
So I wrote, have you guys heard
about Rocket Raccoon and Groot?

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:14.750
Yeah you guys like them?

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:17.850
I just wrote a book about Rocket
Raccoon and Groot and it's going

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:22.460
to come out this spring and
I wrote it just for you guys.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.210
Adults aren't allowed
to read it at all.

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:30.730
It's totally for you guys.

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:34.780
And Mike do you mind
if I say something?

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain: Go right ahead.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.380
&gt;&gt; Tom Angleberger: We're here
in the Library of Congress.

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.680
You guys like books
as much as we do?

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.980
You guys love books?

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.280
This is like in the whole world,
in the whole history of mankind,

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.580
this is building and the
buildings around it are one

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.880
of the greatest repositories,
the greatest collections of books

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.180
that have ever been created.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.480
So I thought it might be fitting,
while we were here surrounded

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.780
by the books we love if we all
said on the count of three,

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.080
may the books be with you.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.380
One, two, three.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.680
&gt;&gt; May the books be with you.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:53.980
&gt;&gt; Adam Gidwitz: Thank you guys.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.280
You were a great audience.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Siglain:
Thank you everybody.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:57.880
Thank you to the Library
of Congress.

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.180
Thank all of you guys.

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.480
May be Force be with you.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.780
Have a good day.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.080
Thanks guys.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.380
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
