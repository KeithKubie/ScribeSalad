00:00:06.025 --> 00:00:07.900
SPEAKER 1: Orgyen is an
author and meditation

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.920
master in the Dzogchen tradition
of the Tibetan Buddhism.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.309
He is the founder and spiritual
director of the Pristine Mind

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.070
Foundation, based
in Marion County.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.830
He studied with Jigmed
Phuntsok Rinpoche,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.370
one of the greatest Dzogchen
master in the 20th century, who

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.290
passed away recently.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.390
After completing an ambitious
studies with Jigmed Phuntsok

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.890
Rinpoche, he received
his khenpo degree,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.820
which is the highest degree
of Buddhist study and practice

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.100
in the Buddhist tradition.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.570
Orgyen currently lives in Bay
Area, travels around world

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.960
to give teachings and retreats.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.140
I'm very, very happy that Orgyen
is able to come to Google.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.915
Let's welcome Orgyen
Chowang Rinpoche to Google.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.780
ORGYEN CHOWANG: Thank you
for everyone coming today

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.230
to listen in teachings, and
also meditating together.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.490
I very happy to be in Google.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.130
Today, I want to
talk about my book.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.610
Actually, this book I wrote,
you know, almost 10 years,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.570
called "Our Pristine Mind."

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.980
This book is a meditation
book, and also how

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:35.870
do you transform human life
through cleaning up your mind.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.660
And then I want to
talk about today,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.240
how do you really live in
vitality, energy, and stress

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.370
free in life and each moment.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.790
What is most important
to do in your life?

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.320
And then, I'd like to talk
about particularly what

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.760
is really human mind is.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.850
A human mind is not
just what you think

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.220
and what it
fundamentally is, and how

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.310
the human mind has affected
every day of your life.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.600
Then I was, you know,
in last few years--

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.420
maybe almost 10 years--

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.860
I just worked on one book.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.220
It's a meditation book.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.670
Actually, many years
working this book,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.760
and finally finishing
last year in 2016.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.910
The book is called
"Our Pristine Mind."

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.030
It actually really
means, how do you really

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:46.160
release your mind of these
toxic, negative, pollute

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.120
experiences.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.990
How do you experience
your true self?

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.580
How do you experience your
natural conditioned mind?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.440
And I think really what is
the most important thing

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.050
is, really how do you do that?

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.260
It is through meditation.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.740
Meditation is like actually
pay attention to your mind.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.690
For example, pay
attention to your mind.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.700
You know, usually our
attention is always conditions,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.410
like always we have 100%
external conditions--

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.380
sounds, images,
taste, and everything.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.740
But one place we
don't pay attention,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.980
the only place, the most
important area, is the mind.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.910
Why many people are
stressed, sometimes

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.820
feel sad, or anger,
sometimes depressed,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.410
and all these
mental events happen

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.110
because the reason
is we don't know

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.340
what's going on in our mind.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.980
Many areas we take care of.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.350
We take care of our
business, we take care

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.540
our home, even our hair.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.360
You pay attention to you
hair every day, dress--

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.630
everything-- but
one place we ignore.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.519
What is that?

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.750
Our mind.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.120
If you forget your mind, then
your mind be very complicated.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.930
The reason the mind is
complicated, and mind is upset

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.030
and always ups and
downs, is because we

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.230
don't know how to fix that.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.110
We don't ever pay
attention to that area--

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.220
that particular area.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.340
Meditation means you pay
attention to your mind--

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.560
what it's really like.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.340
I think that's really what
it boils down to meditation,

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.390
and that's really I want
to talk about today.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.270
For example, let's
say your people

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.880
are stressed, angry, anxiety,
or fear, the meditation job is

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.260
how to release these things.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.760
How to release these energies.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.930
If you don't release, then you
have to continually experience

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.640
that uncomfortable feeling.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.600
The meditation's job
is how to release that.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.160
And that really, really,
means, for example,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.460
let's say you have a house.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.370
Your house you
have 20, 30 years.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.750
You never pay attention.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.130
You never clean up.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.100
You never pay attention
or clean up your house.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.010
You always walk in, but you
always never pay attention.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.320
What's like that house?

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.850
Very messy house, yeah?

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.490
It's a very, very
uncomfortable place

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.770
to live, because you never
clean your mind, and house.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.470
20, 30, 40 Years, we
never clean our mind.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.960
How many times do
you clean your mind?

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.890
We clean our bathroom,
kitchen, and any other areas,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.830
but how many times do
you clean your mind?

00:06:09.844 --> 00:06:11.510
The number one is
that you need to clean

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.020
your mind if we have
fresh, energetic,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.290
and light and experience.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.130
If we don't clean our
mind, the symptoms are--

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.770
when people are sad, that's a
result. Your mind is polluted.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.380
When you're sad, it's
because the mind is polluted.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.580
When you have anxiety,
the mind is polluted.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.730
When you have stress,
your mind is polluted.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.040
When you're angry,
your mind is polluted.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.000
If your mind is polluted, your
relationships are polluted,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.330
because if that's fact-- your
relationships and connections--

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.700
and that effects everyday
life, because you

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.520
look at the world as a
very stressful place.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.120
The reason is your
mind is polluted.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.270
And that's really
the reason meditation

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.080
is not just only paying
attention to conditions--

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.970
you can fix the conditions.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.880
You can fix your house,
you can get good job,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.840
but your mind, at the same
time, stirs stress, discontent,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.490
bad mood.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:25.360
If that always happens, then
how do you really fix that?

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.240
Number one, the
wonderful news is

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.720
that your mind is originally
pristine, but temporarily

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.440
polluted.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.450
And then I want to
show today here,

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:44.590
how do you experience
your pristine mind?

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.430
Someone says, someone who has
experienced a healthy body,

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.250
what's like that?

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.860
It feels good, yeah?

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.840
When you're sick
so many long years,

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.580
and then you feel sometimes, I
feel my healthy body, so good,

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.610
it's like myself.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.480
Similarly, if you feel
your pure consciousness--

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.270
you feel your clear mind
without anxiety, without fear,

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.390
without stress--

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.080
the clear mind you
experience, what's that?

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.140
That's the most
majestic experience

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.220
you've ever felt before.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.170
Very powerful experience.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.250
Then I want to introduce today,
how do you experience that?

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:35.210
Everybody in this
room's mind is pristine,

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.780
but there's too pristine,
but right now overcast

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.179
mental events.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:45.870
The thoughts, the emotions,
the beliefs, and the habits

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.780
overcast your mind.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.710
The sky is blue--

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.150
clean-- but the clouds
made overcast the sky.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.870
Maybe you don't see the sky
because clouds may obscure

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.009
[INAUDIBLE] to see the sky.

00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.550
It's similar.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.710
Similarly, if your
mind is made pristine,

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:10.490
but you cannot access because
there's so much clouds--

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.580
mental events like
stress, anger,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.040
fear, all these things there--

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.190
you cannot experience your
natural conditioned mind.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.000
Therefore, we always
know how to feel.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.490
We feel our thoughts.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.130
We feel our emotions.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.800
We feel our habits.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:37.410
But how many people feel
their pristine mind?

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.150
Feeling emotions are
not that comfortable.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.450
Feeling thoughts are
not that comfortable.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.790
It's very awkward.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.710
Why human beings have so
many different facials--

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.160
some people sit like this,
some people like that--

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.140
because they attach emotions.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.390
If you attach your emotions,
sad has a different expression,

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.900
the anger has a
different expression,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.070
the happiness is
different expression,

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.050
but all human beings know
how to attach their emotions,

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:10.590
how to attach their thoughts,
how to attach belief systems,

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.700
how to attach their body, but
how do you many people detach--

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.080
with their clear
awareness, pristine mind?

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.420
I think that's really
our about, and I

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:27.600
want to talk to today about
that's really [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.620
Basically, the message
is how to really

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.880
attach yourself without
layers, without fabrication.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.100
And then, let's say
human mind is pristine--

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.690
means very clear,
very flawless--

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:48.640
that's really the fundamental
message from the [INAUDIBLE],

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.550
master of Dzogchen master.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.930
Then how do you
attach with that?

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.450
This is very wonderful way.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.580
If you don't meditate, you never
know your mind is pristine.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.500
You've never meditated.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.060
Even if you've meditated, but
you didn't meditate properly,

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.840
you don't know your
mind is pristine.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.550
There are many
different meditations.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.820
Some meditations, as you
know, calm your mind.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.940
That's really the meditation--
the goal is calm your mind.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:27.480
Some meditations are designed
to have a pristine mind--

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.920
pristine awareness.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.040
And then, here we are
talking about a pristine mind

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.280
meditation.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.730
Pristine mind
meditation, you do that,

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:40.470
and you can experience
your flawless mind.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.550
Flawless mind.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.600
How do you do that?

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.190
What happened?

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.820
The reason is, we don't
experience our mind as calm,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.960
pristine--

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.880
the reason is, there's
so much mental events.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.060
When mental events
are disappeared,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.100
then you can experience.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.020
As long as there's
clouds in the sky,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.860
you cannot see the blue sky.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.840
That's noise.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.770
When clouds disappear,
then you see the blue sky.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.460
Similarly, as long as
our mind is overcast,

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.830
we cannot experience
our fundamental mind,

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.450
or pristine mind.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.610
Then when your mind is clear--

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.330
when-- because when
your mind is clear,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.230
and because when mental
events disappear,

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.200
then when is mental
events disappear?

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.420
During the meditation.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.300
I want to talk about
the technique, too.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.690
How do you disappear
your mental events?

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.690
If you do these four
steps, your mind is clear.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.400
Your emotions are clear.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.890
Your thoughts are clear.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.300
What is really the technique?

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.100
Technique of this meditation
is called [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.500
The meditation master of the--

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.780
he says, if you want
to clear your mind,

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.260
if you want to enjoy
your pristine mind,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.360
do these four steps.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.830
He says, first,
don't follow past.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.960
Let's say 20 minutes we are
doing meditation, for example.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.490
Don't follow past, don't
anticipate in future.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.860
Stay present moment.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.105
Leave your mind alone.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:27.970
If your mind is not past, not
future, stay present moment,

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.080
and you leave your mind alone,
then what happens internally,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.430
that's meditation.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.780
And that means your
thoughts, emotions, anxiety,

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.860
fear everything is dissipated,
because they're conditional.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.750
They cannot survive without
paying attention to the object.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:56.640
And then thoughts, emotions,
and sadness, anxiety, stress--

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.740
everything's disappeared.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:03.210
When they're disappeared,
what is your experience?

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.690
You experience your
awareness without layers,

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:11.340
then you experience
really pristine mind.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:16.500
The meditation is go into the
pristine mind time to time.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.110
Today I entered
the pristine mind--

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.470
I did this meditation technique,
and then my mind is clear,

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.620
and then I stayed
there 10 minutes.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.460
I stayed with pristine
mind 10 minutes.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.740
And tomorrow you
repeat the same thing.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.600
Your pristine mind, 10 minutes.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.080
Then over time, you have--

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.400
even if you are not
meditating, your mind

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.970
is 70% clearer than
normal people's minds.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.820
I think the number
one happiness is--

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.830
number one happiness
in this world--

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.300
you can tell me
better than that--

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.010
when someone's mind
is pristine, that's

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:59.430
the highest quality
happiness in this universe.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.140
You can't tell me
this is much better.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.600
I think when people's mind
is clear and pristine,

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.810
everything--

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:15.160
whole entire being is very
comfortable, and very sense

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.360
of well-being.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.840
And you have straight
forward of the world.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.310
There's no hindrance there.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.880
If your mind is,
let's say, distorted--

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.930
you know, polluted-- then
everything becomes complicated.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:33.400
Complication comes from when
mind is polluted and distorted.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:40.290
And that really means, human
beings, what we need like that,

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.540
we need enjoy the world.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:47.870
Since you enjoy the world, you
need to have beautiful mind.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.500
If you have the beautiful mind,
you have to enjoy the world.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.460
But if you have the mind
is not good a quality--

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.010
it's distorted-- then you
don't enjoy the world.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:04.100
Therefore, in order to enjoy
the world, success your work,

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:09.380
connect other people, and
also appreciate everything.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.460
What is really you need?

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.050
You need to have clear mind.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:18.920
Clear mind is key to the
success, effective, work,

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.330
and also relationships.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.640
Every day, what is
really key is clear mind.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.950
When you have clear
mind, nothing matters.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.360
You are fearless, and you are
comfortable with yourself.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.480
Your mind is 70% overcast--

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.640
let's say 70%.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.820
That means that day you
are not comfortable.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.650
Maybe you're stressed.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.430
You're maybe having anxiety,
and you are uncomfortable.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.360
Let's say that is 70%
overcast your mind.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.600
70%, 80%.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:03.130
That says, 70% clouds in sky,
that means 70% chance of rain.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:10.250
70%, 100%, and there's
tremendous clouds in sky,

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.430
sometimes there's
100% chance of rain.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.490
Why is there 100%
chance of rain?

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.400
Because there's so
many clouds in sky.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.750
Similar, the more
thoughts, emotions

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:25.290
there are, the more in your
mind, your mind is complete.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:30.760
There is 100%
chance you're upset,

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.830
and also 100% chance
you're maybe angry,

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.860
or maybe you have
offended someone,

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.830
or something happens, because
the mind is too cloudy.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.890
Here is the meditation.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:52.350
How do you reduce 70%
you mental events.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.850
It's not necessary.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.950
For example, you have a house.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.860
You don't put everything there.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.300
You can clean up time
to time your house.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:09.820
Similarly, the meditation is
time to time clear your mind.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.180
Therefore, I was talking
to many years here,

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.480
and people are meditating, and
then say they do meditation

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.520
today or tomorrow.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.380
The next few days, they
have best experiences.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.610
It's not only my doing, but I
train many different people,

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.020
like people--

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.580
I live in Marin County, and I
go to San Francisco, and Marin,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.310
and also other places--

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:37.000
tech companies-- I went to
Autodesk, some other tech

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.690
company I went to,
also I went to schools.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.270
I teach regular people.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:47.200
They tell me, they say,
oh, I did meditation.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.290
Three, four, one week,
is tremendous benefit,

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.280
because meditation means you
are directly working your mind.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.930
You're directly
working your mind.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.070
It means of course impact there.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:03.340
Therefore I want to talk about
[INAUDIBLE] here, pristine mind

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.860
and unconditional happiness.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.870
But I think this is
a very beautiful--

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.190
unconditional happiness--

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.310
I want to say a few things
unconditional happiness.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.070
Unconditional
happiness is connecting

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.390
with the pristine mind.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:22.660
If your mind is 70%
clear, and 70% are like--

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:29.470
60% are clear, and a
pristine-- definitely,

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:33.470
your happiness no
longer conditional.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.500
What does that mean?

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.820
The meaning is, if
your mind is pristine,

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:47.220
definitely your mind is
comfortable without condition.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.740
There's a sense of well-being.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.030
When mind is pristine,
definitely there

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.240
is a sense of well-being.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.890
There is a sense of
well-being, there's a presence,

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.960
there's very healthy--
mind is very healthy--

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.180
and without condition,
you feel good.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.260
Without condition you feel good.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.460
You don't need always needing
something's making me happy--

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.630
always searching.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.070
But if your mind is really
comfortable, fundamentally

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.860
comfortable, it's not
like just comfortable

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.500
come from some conditions.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.360
You went to talk to someone
that makes you feel comfortable,

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.330
or you eat something, that's
called conditional happiness.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.610
Conditional happiness
always recharge each time.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.090
Sometimes we are dependent
on conditional happiness.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.790
And then most times
condition of happiness

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:47.790
is called instant gratification,
like coffee, drinking coffee.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.370
Drinking coffee, immediately
you're very good,

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:55.140
and then a few hours later,
then it's finished that energy.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.140
Then external
condition or happiness

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.430
is a very instant gratification,
and then it disappears.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.760
But unconditional happiness
is always within you.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.780
What that means, your mind
is some degree pristine.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.210
You feel comfortable
all the time,

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.780
especially after
you do meditation.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.556
After your meditation,
your mind is comfortable,

00:21:18.556 --> 00:21:19.930
and then you talk
to other people

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.190
who are very comfortable.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:25.320
Just at your office, always
you go walking cities, towns,

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.660
they're very comfortable
because there's

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.610
no uncomfortable thoughts,
because the reason is

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.430
fear comes from your thoughts.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.880
The more you have thoughts, this
and that, positive, negative,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.470
the more you have fearful.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.890
The more you have thoughts,
the more you have anxiety.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.470
The more you have thoughts,
the more you have stress.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:50.280
Therefore, doing the meditation,
all thoughts are subside.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.140
When your thoughts are
subside, fear subsides.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:59.270
And because fear is to
related to your own thoughts,

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.370
then your thoughts are
subside, your anger subsides.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.640
Your thoughts subside,
everything subsides.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.270
And then one day,
all subsides, they

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.160
call it the fundamental peace.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:15.500
The true peace comes from with
your access of pristine mind.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.590
Therefore, unconditional
happiness means--

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.380
for example, my body is healthy.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.230
When my body is healthy, I
feel good no matter what--

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.410
because my body is healthy,
therefore I feel good.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.320
Similar, when your
mind is pristine,

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.700
you feel good no matter what.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.280
Similar.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.340
Physically you need a
healthy mind, healthy body,

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.250
but mentally you
need a pristine mind.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.310
The more your mind is polluted,
the more you are uncomfortable.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.560
Really, people
are uncomfortable,

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.840
the reason is, their mind
is polluted, distorted.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.180
A distorted mind is not that
happy, not that content.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:02.480
Therefore, usually if you
have a distorted mind,

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:07.160
then there is war between
your body and mind.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.020
Body, mind really
criticizes body.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:17.480
Mind says, body, you're ugly,
and you're fat, you're old,

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:22.220
you're bald, you have no hair,
you are not clean in mind.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.700
Mind always criticizes
body, and that's

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.230
the reason the
body is very sick,

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:30.920
because mind between
there's war, body and mind.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.300
And then the body's sick.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.540
Then when body is sick,
then mind is unhappy,

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.290
and mind is stressed
because of your body.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.480
There is war between body
and mind that's going on,

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.240
and that really
impacts people's life,

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.690
and impacts people's stress,
impacts relationships,

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.360
impacts their health.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:55.190
But when your mind is
pristine, the war ends.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.340
When your mind is
pristine, and then

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.650
the body and mind is united.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.470
They call yoga-- you
know what yoga means?

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.950
Union of body and mind.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:10.940
It means when your mind is
pristine, then your mind says--

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.797
hugs your body.

00:24:13.797 --> 00:24:14.630
It says, I like you.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.320
I love you.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.460
Your mind loves body,
body loves mind.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.300
There's union.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:26.060
There's harmony experience,
because all the symptoms

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:30.130
or thoughts, projections
and negative thoughts,

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.060
created between body and mind.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.270
When negative
thoughts disappear,

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:39.630
body, mind completely
come together.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.560
As Body and mind
come together, and I

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.680
think that's the
most beautiful thing.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.150
Say, what is really--

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.530
your body and mind
is same direction,

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.080
they're opposite direction.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.300
Body goes that, mind goes that.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.260
The conflict between most
every personal problems

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.310
come from that.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.200
Stress, anxiety, fear--
all these things.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.430
When your mind and body
are joined together,

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.320
then they're called happiness.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.490
Joy, healthy living,
success, enlightenment.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.485
Everything comes
from there, therefore

00:25:12.485 --> 00:25:15.920
in order to have body
and mind come together,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.230
I think you need to
have pristine mind.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:24.170
Pristine mind is the
number one solution.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.700
I like to talk about this.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.410
How do you do it happened?

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:33.660
Let's say, first they call
realization pristine mind.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.540
Realization pristine mind--

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.210
I mean, pristine mind means--

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.960
this is my meditation
introduction.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.880
You see this?

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.150
Globe.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.000
Fog globe.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.210
Only San Francisco has it.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.270
Only snow globe is different.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.700
And you see this
globe very clearly.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.620
It's pristine quality.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.120
That's real.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.870
This is natural condition mind.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:59.930
It's like this.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:06.750
When human mind is very
calm, relaxed, happy.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.740
And then it's like this.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.230
It's very pristine quality.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.820
It's a very, very natural
condition like that.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.160
This is really a human
mind is like that.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.520
Let's say when
you're upset, you're

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.370
thinking something negative--

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.430
someone doing
something negative--

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.220
you're thinking about
that, what happens?

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.680
You see?

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.240
Everything's distorted.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.870
You cannot see the
Golden Gate Bridge here.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.450
The Golden Gate
Bridge disappeared.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.850
Now everything's polluted.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:44.290
The more you shake,
the more you pollute.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:48.490
And similarly, the more you
think, the problem you have,

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.850
the more your mind is distorted,
and the more your mind

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.170
is polluted.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.420
And then, what it's really
like when you're angry,

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.080
your mind is like this.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.630
When you're sad, your
mind is like this.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.270
When you stress, your
mind is like this.

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.360
When you have any
other mental events,

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.690
your mind is like this,
because while you're like that,

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.530
we call pollute mind--
mind is pollute.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.270
How do you resolve that?

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.540
The more you continue to
shake, you continue like that.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:22.280
Similarly, some problem
occurs, and then you think

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.170
and continually, then
continually like that.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.700
How do you resolve that?

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.840
Meditation introduction
says, don't follow past,

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.540
don't anticipate the
future, stay present.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.700
Leave your mind alone.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.240
Let's leave this alone.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:38.900
What happens?

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.920
You see?

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.380
Slowly, slowly going.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.960
Leave mind alone.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.210
Don't follow past.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.550
Don't anticipate any future.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.860
Stay present moment.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.660
Leave your mind alone.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.360
You see, when you
leave your mind alone,

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:03.810
not going after the conditions,
this has become clear,

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:08.330
same as mind has become
more clear, clear,

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.055
and then your mind
has become pristine.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.510
If you do meditation,
for example,

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.870
someone says I'm angry,
I'm very stressed.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.230
What do I do?

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.270
What you do is--

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.390
when you stress--
don't follow past.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.430
Don't anticipate future.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.260
Stay present moment.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.950
Leave your mind alone.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.400
And then stay
there five minutes,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:36.230
and slowly, slowly,
the stress energy

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:41.480
free and then dissolve, because
they're not anywhere your mind.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.360
They are conditional.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.700
Stress is conditional.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.830
It does not exist in your
mind, because that's really--

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:49.850
mind is pristine.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.490
And same as your anger.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:56.360
When you're angry, how do
you really manage your anger?

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.070
Don't follow past.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.900
Don't anticipate any future.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.670
Stay present moment.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.590
Leave your mind alone.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.770
And then your anger
and that energy

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:10.010
fade away, because
they're conditional.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:13.580
I just put this book,
and everything--

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.220
I put this book everything
how to practice,

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.970
how do your mind become
clear, how do you really

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:25.220
enjoy in a pristine mind.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:29.240
And also, enjoy means, like--

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.720
I think this is very important--
the other is, one way,

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.450
meditation clarifies your mind.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:39.880
The other is, you want
to expand you enjoy,

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.120
and satisfaction,
the happiness--

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.810
what you need to do is you
need to clear your mind.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.350
When you clear your mind,
you enjoy everything.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:52.240
You enjoy-- you know--

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.450
people go somewhere and
you can do same thing.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.240
I was married
young, for example.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.840
Younger time, I
just always enjoyed

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.010
do something,
entertaining things.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.350
But when you're
getting old, everything

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.200
is same old, same old.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.190
Then, [INAUDIBLE], what I do--

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:16.240
my secret to happiness is, I did
meditation maybe 20 minutes--

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.950
pristine mind
meditation, 20 minutes--

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:24.200
that's really given me whole
day-- today, tomorrow--

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.570
my mind is--

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.790
I can enjoy
everything after that.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.590
It's not a conditions.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:33.580
Conditions are always there,
but mind is the problem-- not

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.290
enjoy, not appreciate.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:39.910
But you have the best
mind, you enjoy everything.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.740
There's a quote here, if you
found happiness within you,

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.400
you've found
happiness everywhere.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.440
It means your mind
is comfortable.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.690
You have unconditional
happiness,

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:57.730
the conditional happiness much
more powerful-- double, triple.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.360
Let's say, your
mind is complicated,

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.650
you'll never find
happiness anywhere,

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:07.200
because mind is unappreciated,
because happiness,

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.900
and joy, good connections,
relationships,

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:15.880
mainly depend how much you
have a beautiful mind--

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.100
I mean, very clear mind.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.090
I think there's really
between connection, clear mind

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:26.680
and happiness, and distorted
mind and happiness.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.040
When your mind is polluted,
definitely there's

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.440
unhappiness, stress.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.730
And when your mind is clear,
there's happiness and joy.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:37.870
You can tell that.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.720
For example, when you say,
today is a beautiful day.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.830
I'm very happy.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.360
You look at that moment.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.270
You see your mind is
clear at that moment.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.060
You see that, everybody.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.400
Say, today I'm angry, stress.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.810
You see that moment,
your mind is polluted.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:59.110
The pollution mind is connected
with unhappiness, stress,

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.040
all these things,
and pristine mind

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.090
is connected with
happiness and joy.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.970
You know how to
connect other people.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:10.180
You're more productive
for the world.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.240
You're more fearless.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.650
And I think those really are
the benefits about practice

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:21.500
of pristine mind, therefore I
don't have much time to right

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.000
now.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.710
I think we have
questions, answers.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.730
And I think you can do
this meditation, everybody,

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.360
because everybody has a duty
to clear out their mind.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.260
Once your mind is clear,
everything is straight forward.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.640
And that really, really we need.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.840
The world is so much
developed right now,

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:46.330
external conditions are so good,
but if you don't have that kind

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.490
mind-- if you don't have--

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:51.820
our mind's more
distorted than before.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.560
Our mind is more polluted.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.610
And I think now is time
to clean our human mind.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:02.020
And then we can factor
more external world,

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.950
and we can bring more happiness,
fulfillment, and therefore

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:08.340
I think that's number one.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:14.130
And I think therefore I want
to say briefly, and two things,

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:19.270
the meditation can say, pristine
mind meditation can change

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:24.070
your perception, because if
you change your perception,

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:27.230
you change your world,
and therefore changing

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.650
our perception--
what that means--

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:31.780
the more you
meditate, the more you

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.450
realize that your
mind is pristine.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:36.460
Oh yes, I can't believe--

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.520
I never noticed before,
because I never paid attention.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.190
Now I see my mind is pristine.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.250
And then you realize
second time, oh, yeah--

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.770
my thoughts, emotions,
stress, they're not me.

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.150
They're just mental events.

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:52.900
They're no different
than that cloud.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.860
The clouds are just there
because conditions are there.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.890
When the clouds disappear,
they're just gone.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:03.780
My happiness, sadness,
anger, all these things,

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:08.489
are just like that cloud, and
the meditators realize that.

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.980
They call it change
your perception,

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.960
and they change
your experiences.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.659
I want to say a few
things, and then I

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:24.420
think now I want to have some--

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:26.010
anybody have any
questions, I want

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:28.710
to have a question
and answer session.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.570
They want to do me that soon.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:31.290
That's very good.

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.780
And everyone has questions,
please raise your hands.

00:34:35.514 --> 00:34:37.139
AUDIENCE: In the
mindfulness tradition,

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:38.805
there are different
kinds of meditation.

00:34:38.805 --> 00:34:40.620
There's focus on
the breath, there's

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.449
open awareness, and
the transcendental,

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:45.389
there's a focus on a mantra.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:49.389
So, is this form of meditation
different from any of those?

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:50.639
ORGYEN CHOWANG: Good question.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:51.219
Yes.

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:54.719
[INAUDIBLE] meditations
are a goal sometimes.

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:56.820
There's two different
kinds of meditations.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.240
One is object based
meditation, and the other

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.310
is objectless meditation.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:07.260
Object based meditation means
your focus mantra and breath,

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.000
and that's really called--

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.540
Buddha says that when you
do go into slowly, slowly,

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.040
first [INAUDIBLE]
meditation, the goal

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.390
is calming the mind down.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.350
Calming the mind down, this is.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:25.680
And once you calm the
mind down, then slowly,

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.890
slowly journey into
slowly pristine mind.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.570
That's traditionally do that.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:35.340
First, do the focus mantra,
focus on the breath,

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.880
and when your mind is calmed
down, then what do you do?

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.010
What do you do when your
mind is calmed down?

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.550
And then it's leave
your mind alone.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.520
After that-- until
you are not calm,

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.000
try to make your
mind calm, relaxed.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.520
And then once your
mind is calmed down,

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.490
then don't rock the boat.

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.890
Don't rock the boat.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.480
Just sit with that.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.640
The more you sit with calmness--

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.550
and then that means you'll
leave your mind alone.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.750
First, you need focus.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:11.610
Maybe someone don't how to do
that, maybe you focus breath,

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:12.980
and also focus mantra.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.410
This tradition is
called [INAUDIBLE],

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.080
preparations of pristine mind.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.530
And then, once you know how to--

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.920
you have capable
watching the breath,

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.500
or you have mantra
many years, and then

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.830
you do the pristine mind,
going that direction.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:34.910
Or some people go--
they're able to directly.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:36.080
There are different methods.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.860
For example,
mindfulness, the goal

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:41.070
is totally calming
your mind down.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.800
And they want to
talk about, usually

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.630
traditionally, calm your
mind down, feel very peace,

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.440
and tranquil--

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.950
tranquility is the main focus.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:56.310
And then you want
to go beyond that,

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:59.520
then you focus pristine mind.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.460
And the pristine mind is then--

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.510
go to deep more.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.860
First, focus object--
external object.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.570
Breath is external object.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.930
Mantra is external object.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:12.810
When you talk about
pristine mind, you focus.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.940
Just leave conditions out.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:19.320
Just go more deep dive into--

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.660
deep into your awareness.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.020
And then that's called
pristine mind meditation.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:28.320
Traditionally, this is
called objectless meditation.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.490
There's no object focus.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:35.550
For example, an
airplane in the sky.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.870
Airplane in sky.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.630
First thing you need
to use a runway.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.440
Without a runway, you
cannot fly in the sky.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:47.030
But using the runway, then you
fly and continue into the sky.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.370
Similar, first, people don't
know how to calm their mind.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.390
They're using breath.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:55.230
And then that's runway.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:59.550
Take into the deep journey
your aware pristine mind.

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:02.070
And then runway and
mantra is focus.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:06.480
Sometimes sounds,
like water sounds.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.500
Focus that.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.690
These things give
you tranquility.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.960
Once your mind is calmed
down, then what do you do?

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.590
Leave your mind alone, then
continue doing journey.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.380
And then don't focus
external conditions.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.050
Then it's just only in.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.700
When you airplane
in the sky, just

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.250
going to continue into the sky.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.430
There's nothing
to do the runway.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.400
Similarly, when you're
deep into the awareness,

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.090
there's nothing to do
with the breath or mantra.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.790
All these things are
beginnings, they do,

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:42.990
and one is mantra,
and breath, they're

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:46.600
called object based
meditation, and pristine mind

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:51.210
is objectless meditation,
and that's the next step.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:51.900
Thank you.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.775
AUDIENCE: You
talked a little bit

00:38:53.775 --> 00:38:58.220
about conditional happiness,
and how having a clear mind,

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.350
it will lead to
unconditional happiness.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:02.730
Sometimes it feels
like I'm, like--

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.970
I want to go sit, because I
feel like I'm going to be happy,

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.450
and it feels I'm kind
of grasping for that,

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:12.710
or I'm turning the practice
into a conditional form

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:13.820
of happiness.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:18.480
Can you give any tips
on how to avoid that?

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.880
ORGYEN CHOWANG: It's no problem.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:24.860
You can-- say I
wanted to do practice,

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.240
and that's normal as anything.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:34.910
But I think the main thing is,
make sure your mind is really

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.980
doing the meditation properly.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.830
When you meditation
properly, you do it,

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:40.400
and everything is take care.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.730
But I think the number one
is, when you do meditation,

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.620
it doesn't matter how you--

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.920
you need to do something,
say, I need to do meditation.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.220
That's, I think-- we need that
inspiration, that motivation.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.640
Without that motivation,
you never do meditation.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.660
Therefore we need to do that
inspiration, that aspiration.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.520
Do I want to do meditation?

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.570
And that enthusiasm, very much.

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:06.440
And then, depend what
kind of meditation.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.830
People ask me, can
you fix my meditation?

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:13.120
But I ask first, I say, what
kind of meditation do you do?

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.980
And what are your goals?

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.250
When you do your exercise, we
know clear what are our goals.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:24.410
Doing exercises, go to gym,
you want a clear, healthy body,

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:29.750
and losing weight, therefore
you're going to exercise.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.450
Why people doing meditation?

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:34.190
You need to know
what the goal is.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:40.010
The goal is vanishing
negative thoughts, emotions.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:43.370
Mind becomes clear,
tranquil, pristine.

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:44.900
That's your goal.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:51.020
I think, then you have
that experience or not,

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:54.080
and if not, then you're
not doing properly,

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.900
maybe you need to find
out how do you do that.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:00.710
And then yes, then you're
going to reach your goals,

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:05.210
and therefore make sure your
mind is some degree pristine,

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:09.650
and some degree
clear, and tranquil.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:14.510
And tranquil means [INAUDIBLE]
very passive, but tranquil

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:17.000
means there's energy.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.580
For example, when you're
healthy, there's the energy.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:22.950
Very healthy, there's energy.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.560
Your healthy body
has lots of energy.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.930
Similar, when your
mind is tranquil,

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:29.940
there's lots of vibrant energy.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.330
It's not like, oh, I'm
[INAUDIBLE]-- it's peace--

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:33.200
it's not like that.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.550
It's a very strong energy.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.180
Tranquility, sense
of well-being,

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.070
and clear mind is so
strong presence there,

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:44.450
therefore make
sure that's there.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.420
I think you can--

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.970
it's very good.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:51.260
Therefore, I want
to mention, if you

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:56.150
have unconditional happiness,
and the conditional happiness

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.610
is double, triple this is.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:00.790
Say you go on vacation.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:03.050
Vacation is, let's say,
conditional happiness.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:07.400
And your mind is
calm, and tranquil,

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.490
but you enjoy more vacation.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:15.740
But your mind is turbulent,
complicated, polluted,

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.390
so you don't much
enjoy the vacation.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:21.110
Therefore, how much
enjoy external conditions

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:25.500
depend on how much you
have a comfortable mind?

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.790
Therefore that is
unconditional happiness.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:32.150
I don't know why human beings
are not focused on that.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.380
You understand why?

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.800
Because everything is
obsessed with the conditions,

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:42.200
but conditions only we
need get 30% happiness.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:46.250
I know, the more richer you are,
the more you are stressed for.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:48.800
The more famous you are,
the more you stress.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.150
There are so many--

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:57.440
any time, each year, one
musician [INAUDIBLE] die.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.310
Always we hear each year, like
Michael Jackson's most famous

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:05.260
rock star, but he
died with drugs.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:08.840
He's numbing his mind.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.300
In order for you to
enjoy conditions,

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.250
you need to have the right mind.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.550
If you don't have right
mind, you never enjoy life.

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:21.230
Conditions-- they are
for life, enlightenment,

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.440
and they all come from you
have the right mindset,

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:29.280
and pristine mind is key
to success this world,

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.040
and more effective.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:37.640
And also, I just have experience
training many people to--

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.790
high tech companies,
other place they work--

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.740
and they tell me
totally different

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.660
when they have
meditated, because they

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.630
have less fearful, there's
no anxiety, stress,

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:51.590
they can talk to other
people without fear.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:53.870
I think my own
experience, for example,

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.220
I go around to many
different groups.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:00.660
When my mind is self-conscious,
I cannot connect to people,

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.830
but when my mind to some degree
pristine, I can connect people,

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:07.935
even I never met, because
the thoughts only disconnect

00:44:07.935 --> 00:44:08.435
the people.

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:15.120
All thoughts of
self-consciousness, hesitation,

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.790
judgement is disappear.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.360
You can't stress
for this connection.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.720
I think that's a really
unconditional happiness.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.160
And when you have
unconditional happiness,

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:30.050
the conditional happiness is
much powerful, more last long.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:33.710
I think that's really
universal, also

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:36.500
understanding when your mind
is really such a good place.

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:39.440
AUDIENCE: I like that you
said that the pristine mind is

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:39.990
like that--

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.640
the goal.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:45.230
And you gave us, I
think, the four paths.

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:48.170
It seems like there's a lot
of freedom there you have.

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:50.600
Don't look to the past,
don't look to the future,

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.130
be in the moment--

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:54.470
I'm not using the exact
words-- and also--

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.900
ORGYEN CHOWANG: Leave your mind.

00:44:54.976 --> 00:44:56.392
AUDIENCE: --don't
follow the mind.

00:44:56.392 --> 00:44:58.580
And it sounds very
good, a lot of freedom,

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.500
and it sounds so good.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:04.652
My question is, is this
very open so that we can--

00:45:04.652 --> 00:45:06.110
like, you're not
necessarily saying

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:08.275
you have to do a
mantra meditation,

00:45:08.275 --> 00:45:09.400
or this kind of meditation.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.400
There's a lot of freedom
there, as long as we're

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.960
sticking to those steps,
we can actually simply

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.160
get to that pristine mind?

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:16.595
ORGYEN CHOWANG: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:17.095 --> 00:45:19.490
AUDIENCE: I can do walking,
I can do my own meditation.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:20.365
ORGYEN CHOWANG: Yeah.

00:45:20.365 --> 00:45:22.130
Good question.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.140
For example, when
you meditate, you

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.890
need two things
you are familiar.

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:29.110
One is, meditation
is repetition,

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:31.030
like when you go
to exercise-- gym

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:33.690
every day-- you do the same
thing, then losing weight.

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:34.370
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:37.570
Similarly, when you meditate,
two things you're learning.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:42.580
One is, remain in
present moment.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.070
That's your learning.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.510
You don't do today,
today meditate.

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:51.730
Let's say you begin today, and
then you stay present moment,

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.380
but your mind is chaos.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.340
You cannot do.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.990
And next time you
repeat that again.

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:59.500
Next time-- one, two,
three, four, five days--

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:03.490
five days later-- and,
yeah, I can little bit

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:06.540
much better than I can
stay present moment.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:10.240
I have ability to stay
present moment one minute.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.170
You have ability.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:14.070
You have ability one
minute stay present.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:17.050
And then you say, I gained
that maybe one week.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:20.170
And next, maybe, two
weeks after, and you

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.630
do more meditation.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:27.230
I have five minutes, I have the
ability to stay present moment.

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:31.810
If you have the ability to stay
present moment five minutes,

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:35.410
definitely your mind is
clear that five minutes.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:38.030
And then I'll say,
I have that ability,

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:40.400
then slowly, slowly,
you are learning,

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.190
leave your mind alone.

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:43.410
We don't know how to do that.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.730
Human beings, the mind is chaos.

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:51.520
But the more you meditate
and try to do, maybe one--

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.030
let's say today you start.

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:59.710
One month later, you're able
to leave your mind alone.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:03.840
If you do these two things--
if you stay present moment

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.490
awareness, leave
your mind alone,

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.860
definitely you
have pristine mind.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.625
Because if you do that,
all thoughts-- emotions--

00:47:11.625 --> 00:47:12.250
are dissipated.

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:14.050
They're conditional.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:16.500
Leave your mind alone,
[INAUDIBLE] you're angry,

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.830
there's no way.

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:19.980
You leave your mind
alone, you are stressed.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:20.650
No.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.680
If you do these two things--

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.540
stay present moment and
leave your mind alone--

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.760
and then your mind is
clear, because all thoughts,

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.770
emotions--

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.570
they're conditional mind.

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:32.560
They disappear.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.840
And that's you
learning, like exercise.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.660
And then gradually you occur.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:37.600
It's not overnight.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.630
It's not one workout.

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:41.830
You have the book.

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:43.120
You have the book.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.770
There's two guided
meditations this book.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:49.540
And one is second part
one guided meditation,

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.760
then other is third part.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.770
There's another
guided meditation.

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.030
Two guided meditations.

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:56.260
Also, there's audio book.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.760
That's very easy to do.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.530
There's guided meditation
directly take you

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:04.150
into this pristine mind.

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:06.240
And then it's just repeat.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.430
Meditation-- people think
they can do meditation--

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:10.450
but no.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:14.060
First, you learn meditation,
then you meditate.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:17.110
Like first you learn to
drive, then you drive.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:20.080
First, you say-- first
you are not meditating,

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:23.160
first you're just
learning meditation.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.280
After you learn how do
you stay present moment,

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.780
you leave your mind
alone, and then you

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.170
know how then you do that.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:33.970
And that really, really--

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:38.470
people tell me their mind is
chaos, like all over the place.

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:41.070
That's normal beginners.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.790
Don't discourage.

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:44.650
Beginner's mind is always chaos.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:45.720
That's normal.

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.980
Even if thoughts
occur, that's normal,

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.080
but you come back
present moment.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.750
If you're watching breath,
stay with the breath,

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:57.220
and you have the ability leave
your mind alone, you do that.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:01.750
And then, naturally, our
thoughts, emotions subside.

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:06.880
The more you do that, the
more your mind is 70% clear.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:10.780
And even if you are not a
meditate at that moment,

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.970
because gradually--

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:14.680
I think a percentage
is a very good.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.370
Percentage.

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:21.650
Let's say my mind is 20% clear,
then it's my mind is 40% clear,

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:23.850
then it's mind is 70% clear.

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:27.130
I like percentage works,
because that's a reality.

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:31.030
And that really means you
need familiar with how

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:35.050
do you stay present moment, how
do you leave your mind alone.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:38.680
These two things
can really, if you

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.980
are able to do that,
you have the ability to,

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.590
the meditators said they
have the ability to do that.

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:48.520
For example, someone do
the meditation one year,

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.630
that means--

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.180
it's not like, oh, they're
meditating sometimes

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.250
go room, come back,
there's your same person.

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.750
No.

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:57.690
You need to gain some ability.

00:49:57.690 --> 00:49:59.740
What kind of ability
should you gain?

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:03.040
You have stay present
moment without distracting.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.880
You have that ability, and
that's a result of meditation.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.036
You can leave your mind
alone when you are upset.

00:50:11.036 --> 00:50:12.910
When you leave your
mind-- when you're upset,

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:16.330
you leave your mind alone,
then everything dissolves.

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:20.980
You have that kind of ability,
it's the result of meditation.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.510
Therefore, two things you focus.

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:27.770
Just stay present moment,
leave your mind alone.

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:30.110
Just focus that, and then
I think you can do that.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.820
AUDIENCE: So, does that mean
that if you are meditating

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:40.657
properly, then you don't have
any thoughts in your mind?

00:50:40.657 --> 00:50:41.990
ORGYEN CHOWANG: You want or not?

00:50:42.735 --> 00:50:44.610
AUDIENCE: I mean, leaving
your mine a little.

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:47.701
ORGYEN CHOWANG: Doing the
meditation, and it's not--

00:50:47.701 --> 00:50:48.200
depends.

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:53.450
For example, let's say
doing the meditation,

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:56.240
let's say, 20 minutes
you're doing the meditation.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.370
The last thoughts
are more good--

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:02.030
last thoughts--
because even if--

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:06.230
someone's meditation-- even
a good meditation-- maybe

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:13.060
70% mind is pristine calm, but
you have still 20% [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:15.200
Let's say someone's yelling.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.820
Oh, there's someone yelling.

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.380
Or I say, what time is it?

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.640
That's normal.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:24.050
It's not like-- for
example, give you sky.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:28.970
Overcast sky is not problematic,
but little bit clouds

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:30.040
are not big deal.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.720
Here there are
clouds, no big deal.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.380
Hazy skies, it's no problem.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:39.400
When you're meditating,
most meditation

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:45.140
is a hazy mind state, because
hazy mind means you can aware,

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:48.560
but still you have
small, mental events.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:54.470
And that's really normal,
therefore thoughts occur during

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:58.590
the meditation normal,
but our overcast isn't--

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:00.200
you cannot meditate.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:04.700
Your mind is overcast, thoughts,
emotions, therefore first you

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.590
need work up overcast mind.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.500
When you overcast, mind
is no longer overcast.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:14.120
I think hazy mind is no problem.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.750
Our meditation is
almost hazy mind.

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:22.480
There are some clear, same time
there some thoughts, therefore

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.110
there are five different skies--

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:29.300
stormy sky, there's
thunder lightning sky,

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:34.670
there's raining sky,
there's cloudy sky,

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:36.670
and there's clear sky.

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:38.750
There's pristine sky.

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:40.040
Five different skies.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:44.290
Same is same different kind
of minds, very overcast mind,

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:49.400
and then there's rainy mind,
and there's cloudy mind,

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:54.800
then there's hazy mind, and
clear mind, and pristine mind.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.590
They all just go to the
human mind that way,

00:52:57.590 --> 00:53:00.170
and therefore thoughts
and no problem

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:01.780
you do in the meditation.

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:05.300
You lost into your present
moment, then it's problem.

00:53:05.534 --> 00:53:06.950
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering, what is

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.860
the difference between a clear
mind and a pristine mind?

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.230
I wasn't sure I
understood that part.

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.330
Is there some-- are
you saying we'll just

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:15.980
reach that point eventually?

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.500
ORGYEN CHOWANG: I
think clear means--

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.210
you know, clear is relative,
and pristine is not relative.

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:25.960
Pristine is the
high quality one.

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:30.030
Clear means-- someone says this
maybe clear, maybe subtly still

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.650
not clear.

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:33.440
Maybe still there
something's going on.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.900
Exactly similar, I think
they're a little bit different.

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:40.070
Pristine and clear, actually
they're two different words.

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:42.890
I think clear means
you see clearly.

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:44.850
Pristine means the high quality.

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:47.720
It's very natural
and unfabricated.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.380
I think high quality
is the pristine.

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:54.769
Clear water and pristine water
is a little bit different.

00:53:54.769 --> 00:53:55.560
You water is clear.

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.410
Still, maybe there is something.

00:53:57.410 --> 00:54:02.130
But pristine water
means fabulous water.

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:05.170
Similarly, pristine
mind and clear mind--

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:09.200
but pristine mind is the
natural, unfabricated original

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:09.950
mind--

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:10.861
is pristine mind.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.490
AUDIENCE: So, is there
something beyond pristine mind,

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:15.230
or is that the final goal?

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:17.210
ORGYEN CHOWANG:
That's the final goal.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:19.490
For example, human bodies--

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:22.070
the highest quality of health.

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:23.690
Very normal.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:28.220
Similarly, the highest
goal is pristine mind.

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:31.140
When you have
pristine mind, every--

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.050
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:39.180
They say, all
thoughts, emotions,

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:43.800
experiences take that
quality, pristine quality.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.030
This is your mind
is polluted, then

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:48.510
every thoughts,
emotions are polluted,

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:53.610
and that's really the reality.

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:54.974
That's really reality.

00:54:54.974 --> 00:54:55.515
That happens.

00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:59.060
SPEAKER 1: And thank you, again.

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:02.410
[APPLAUSE]
