00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.300
[music playing]

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:15.433
MAN 1: Does it feel different
to be up there without a rope?

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:17.834
MAN 2: It's obviously like
much higher consequence.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.500
MAN 3: People who know a little
bit about climbing, they're

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.467
like, oh, he's totally safe.

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.700
And then people who really
know exactly what he's doing

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.633
are freaked out.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.367
MAN 2: I've thought about
El Cap like for years.

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:35.600
And every year I'm like,
that's really scary.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.834
I'll never be content unless
I at least put in the effort.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.867
El Cap is the most
impressive wall on Earth.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:48.367
It's 3,200 feet
of sheer granite.

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:51.300
It's the center of the
rock climbing universe.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.767
Obviously I get interview
questions about it

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:53.800
all the time.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.800
Oh, would you like to do that?

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.567
You're like, yes, for sure.

00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:59.467
[music playing]

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.467
MAN 4: So you got a
girlfriend now I heard.

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:06.433
MAN 2: It's awesome, pretty much
makes life better in every way.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:11.734
WOMAN 1: It's really hard for
me to grasp why he wants this.

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:14.734
But and if he doesn't do
this stuff, he'd regret it.

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:17.934
MAN 5: Everybody who has
made free soloing a big part

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:19.700
of their life is dead now.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.567
MAN 2: I haven't been
injured in like seven years.

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:23.867
I suddenly start getting
injured all the time.

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:25.166
WOMAN 1: What if
something happens?

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.934
Aah!

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:29.367
WOMAN 1: What if I
don't see him again?

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:30.400
MAN 2: I could just walk away.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.867
But it's like, I don't want to.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:35.266
MAN 6: I've always
been conflicted

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.567
about shooting a film
about free soloing

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:38.700
just because it's so dangerous.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.533
It's hard to not imagine
your friend falling

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:45.333
through the frame to his death.

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.700
WOMAN 2: I think when
he's free soloing

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.500
that's when he feels the
most alive, most everything.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.834
How can you even think about
taking that away from somebody?

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:58.800
MAN 2: No mistakes tomorrow.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800
I'm starting to become afraid.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.600
If you're pushing the edge,
eventually you find the edge.

00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:12.867
MAN 7: I can't believe you guys
are actually going to watch.

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:14.367
Hey, Jimmy, do you copy?

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.667
Just started climbing.

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:19.367
[breathing heavily]

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:23.433
