ANDINI: Hi.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.510
My name is Andini.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.320
I'm 20 years old and from
British Columbia, Canada.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.440
My love for tinkering started
early on, with my first toy

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.680
being a box of transistors.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.450
I then started participating
in the local science fairs.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.420
And one of my inventions was
a flashlight that runs off

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.930
the heat of the human hand.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.230
I'm really passionate about
the crucial combination

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.850
of science and art.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.200
And I love writing my own book,
taking things apart, walking

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.065
my cat, Houdini--

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.440
--and devouring insects.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.020
I'm also very excited
to attend Google I/O

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.510
and learn from so many
amazing innovators.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.990
Hope to see you there!

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.590
Bye!

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.190
