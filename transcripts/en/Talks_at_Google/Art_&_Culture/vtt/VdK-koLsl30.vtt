[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:08.090
ANTON JABLOKOV: We actually
started with compositions

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.040
which were composed.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.070
So we used to play Strauss
and Viennese music.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.850
But then, we found
out that we enjoy

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.240
arranging music and changing
it to our own style.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.600
And also, we played only in a
three-piece band and quartet,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.060
so we wanted to make the
sound as big and interesting

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.420
as possible.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.290
So we made it all kinds of
techniques and arrangements,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.180
where we can show
everything we can do.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.810
And that's how this
program all was created.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.060
So actually, now, we
play all the compositions

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.735
that are our own arrangements
or our own compositions.

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:45.110
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
It's basically

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.460
we take the theme
of classical piece

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.820
or recent even of the modern
songs, as [INAUDIBLE] music.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.250
SPEAKER 1: As we saw last night?

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.430
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yes.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.665
Yes, we did that.

00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:57.310
And we just create
the compositions

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.880
based on those themes and trying
to make classical music, maybe,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.487
slightly more accessible.

00:01:02.487 --> 00:01:03.070
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.610
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
And that way, you

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.980
know, creating the
way of maybe not being

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.740
so afraid for some people
the classical music.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.490
ANTON JABLOKOV: Also,
we did like a bridge

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.240
from the classical world
to the pop music world

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.334
and also from the other side.

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:16.750
SPEAKER 1: And how
do you do that?

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.400
How do you bridge that?

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.720
ANTON JABLOKOV: So the
big bridge is the theme.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.240
If people know some melody,
they enjoy it much more.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.510
It's also from psychology.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.740
If you know the few
notes or the rhythm,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.280
you are enjoying
listening to it.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.340
So we take a theme
which everyone

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.680
knows from their
childhood or from a movie,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.550
and we compose a piece upon it.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.980
And then, we use the
classical music techniques

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.640
and composition techniques,
which are great,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.640
and we have a whole piece.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.916
So if the music is
only eight bars,

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:50.790
we can make a four-minute
piece [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.873
SPEAKER 1: That's amazing.

00:01:51.873 --> 00:01:53.505
Any chance of a
quick demonstration?

00:01:53.505 --> 00:01:54.380
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.270
We can just show a small
piece with just the piano.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.982
SPEAKER 1: OK, so without your--

00:01:59.982 --> 00:02:02.624
it's Adam, isn't it,
your usual pianist?

00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:04.040
So without Adam,
you could give us

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.330
a little short demonstration?

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.442
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Oh, yeah.

00:02:05.442 --> 00:02:05.950
We'll try something.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.075
SPEAKER 1: That'd be great.

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:07.698
Thank you.

00:02:12.688 --> 00:02:15.183
[VIOLIN MUSIC]

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.616
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.210
SPEAKER 1: Thanks, guys.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.751
You're right.

00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:54.180
It's definitely
very accessible--

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.822
a lot of beaming
faces [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:56.822 --> 00:02:59.270
That was beautiful.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.170
I'd like to talk a little
bit about improvisation.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.440
I know, Anton, that
that's your area.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.800
And there's some recordings,
very exciting recordings,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.740
on YouTube improvising
cadenzas, as Vladimir

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.280
just steps back and allows
you to do your thing.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.030
I get the impression
that, in classical music,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.780
that composers shudder at
the word, "improvisation".

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.340
Do you think there
is enough room

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.490
in classical music for
that playfulness and that

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.990
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.781
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah,
there is not anymore.

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.950
There used to be.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.840
In the past, all
the composers they

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.310
were often also performers.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.730
And they used to improvise
Mozart, and Bach, Beethoven.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.360
They were the best improvisers.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.660
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hm.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.160
Right.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.890
ANTON JABLOKOV: But
after some time,

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.170
they thought maybe
the performers--

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.500
that it's more safe to
have the cadenza written

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.650
because it's a risk.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.660
If you're on the stage
and you are nervous,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.949
it's very hard to improvise.

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.115
So you have to be very good.

00:03:58.115 --> 00:03:59.180
And that's why--

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.150
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Oh.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.840
ANTON JABLOKOV: No.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.320
SPEAKER 1: Oh.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.549
ANTON JABLOKOV:
Sometimes, I do disasters.

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.210
Sometimes, I finish
in the land of no man,

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.871
and I don't know what to
do with, is a part of it.

00:04:08.871 --> 00:04:10.746
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Oh,
he likes [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:10.746 --> 00:04:11.240
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.906
ANTON JABLOKOV: In the past, the
cadenzas used to be improvised,

00:04:13.906 --> 00:04:18.647
so the performer also showed
his skills of improvisation.

00:04:18.647 --> 00:04:20.230
And then slowly, the
composers started

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.480
to write down the cadenzas.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.490
And in the 20th
century, again, people

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.780
wanted to do only one thing,
and good, not many things,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.330
and not so good.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.440
So performers, they
stopped to write music,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.080
and they just concentrated
on playing music.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.870
And everything is written,
which is good for the technique.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.480
Andy they are not
doing mistakes, or so.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.284
But sometimes, it's
awfully boring.

00:04:42.284 --> 00:04:44.700
If you come to the concert,
you don't see his personality.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.000
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.520
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: I feel like
a victim of the classical world

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.880
where, from the early
days as we started,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.850
I was always told to play
exactly what's in the music.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.075
If I played one note
away, the teacher

00:04:58.075 --> 00:04:59.950
would immediately stop,
like, no, no, no, no,

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.690
like what's written in there?

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.150
Play that way, and so on.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.000
And I tried to cross
into that other world.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.570
But when I was already an
adult, like about 19 or 20,

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.320
that's too late if you
want to be natural.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.217
Anton started when
he was maybe 12.

00:05:13.217 --> 00:05:13.800
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.680
So that's why he's more
comfortable with the risk.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.590
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
He just likes--

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.440
I'm getting there,
but I'm a couple

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.740
of steps behind that
way, that I need to learn

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.790
everything note by note.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.064
Even if I play one note
wrong in two hours concert,

00:05:25.064 --> 00:05:27.730
I generally have to stop for two
bars to find myself where I am,

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.605
where I continue.

00:05:28.605 --> 00:05:29.230
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.440
So it really limits you.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.523
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: And for
him, it doesn't matter.

00:05:31.523 --> 00:05:33.610
Like he's always looking
at me like, error, error.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.630
Something is wrong here.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.710
Like he's thinking this.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.585
SPEAKER 1: Anton stops working.

00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:41.710
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: And
very [INAUDIBLE],, you know?

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.050
But I have to memorize every
single note and everything.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.230
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.040
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: And for him,
he just remembers the lines.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.260
And if something goes slightly
different, he's just--

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.885
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:05:48.885 --> 00:05:50.860
So that's an amazing
skill to have, actually.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.151
And I'm really jealous of that.

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:55.280
Like my experience with music
has been very similar to yours.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.680
And what I find-- the limitation
of the musical education

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.200
in [INAUDIBLE]---- or maybe
it's the same in Slovakia--

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.400
we have people who maybe study
music their entire lives,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.370
up until 18--

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.995
17, 18.

00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:10.120
They go to university and
stop playing for a few years.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.685
And now in their 30s,
they can't play "Do--

00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:13.185
A Deer."

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:14.101
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Oh.

00:06:14.101 --> 00:06:16.260
Well, you do have to study
the music [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.520
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.353
But they would have
studied for a long time.

00:06:18.353 --> 00:06:19.353
And because [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:19.353 --> 00:06:20.811
ANTON JABLOKOV: I
think the problem

00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:22.190
is they divided the worlds.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.415
So the people who play, I
don't know, Irish music,

00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:26.540
they know how to improvise,
and they enjoy playing.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.570
In the classical world, there's
something completely different.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.890
But it should be
connected, I think.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:30.730
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hm.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.855
Does it bother you, then,
if you improvise onstage,

00:06:32.855 --> 00:06:35.230
and it doesn't go so well?

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.456
How do you deal
with those mistakes?

00:06:37.456 --> 00:06:38.830
ANTON JABLOKOV:
We laugh, always.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.496
SPEAKER 1: Yeah?

00:06:39.496 --> 00:06:41.982
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:41.982 --> 00:06:43.440
ANTON JABLOKOV:
You do the cadenza.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.148
SPEAKER 1: A lot of
smiling [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:45.148 --> 00:06:47.385
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:47.385 --> 00:06:49.551
ANTON JABLOKOV: People,
they don't hear it, usually.

00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:50.135
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:06:50.135 --> 00:06:52.384
ANTON JABLOKOV: Fortunately,
they don't hear anything.

00:06:52.384 --> 00:06:53.500
I mean, from the cadenzas.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.867
So you do one wrong
note, my colleagues

00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:56.950
are laughing on the stage.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.060
And then we just continue.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.850
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.950
OK, that's great.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.070
So then, to continue on on the
arrangements and improvisation

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.460
thread-- when you're
working with--

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.302
you go back to Slovakia,
don't you, to work with Adam?

00:07:09.302 --> 00:07:11.010
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah,
or wherever we can.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.950
SPEAKER 1: Wherever
you can meet?

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:12.820
ANTON JABLOKOV: Where
[INAUDIBLE] are cheaper.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.320
[LAUGHS]

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.903
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:07:13.903 --> 00:07:14.920
That's fair enough.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.070
When you're working on an
arrangement for a new piece,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.630
then, are you the
type of musicians

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.809
that you push the boat way
out, go to the extreme,

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:25.100
and then bring yourselves back?

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.064
Or are you a bit more
deliberate and delicate

00:07:29.064 --> 00:07:30.730
in how you make your
choices when you're

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.070
working on a new arrangement?

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.066
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: The big
choice is usually the music--

00:07:36.066 --> 00:07:37.190
I mean, the piece of music.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.898
That's the first thing
we have to choose,

00:07:38.898 --> 00:07:41.830
or at least the theme, which
is possible to be arranged.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.350
Then we usually make
a plan on paper.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.740
And we say, what we would
like to have from the music?

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.404
Does it have to be very modern
or accessible for people?

00:07:50.404 --> 00:07:51.820
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Sometimes, they

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.416
go too far, that it becomes
very interesting for us about--

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:57.040
ANTON JABLOKOV: As
classical musicians.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.260
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: It's very
good to ask our advice--

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.593
what do you think of this piece?

00:08:00.593 --> 00:08:04.210
And if we hear that it
sounds very, very modern--

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.290
but if it's in the way of
modern classical music,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.627
that means it's all wrong.

00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:10.210
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.410
It's no longer accessible.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:11.860
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.130
Yeah.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:12.910
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.826
ANTON JABLOKOV: And then,
we just take a piece

00:08:14.826 --> 00:08:15.776
and we try to play it.

00:08:15.776 --> 00:08:16.900
Adam is a great improviser.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.170
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.820
ANTON JABLOKOV: He's a hundred
times better than myself.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.000
So we just play it
few times, and we

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.500
are looking for possible ways.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.380
And then, we record
sometimes also--

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.015
the playing.

00:08:27.015 --> 00:08:29.140
And then we start to write
the music to a computer.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.723
SPEAKER 1: And then, do you send
those back, then, to Ireland?

00:08:31.723 --> 00:08:32.289
To Vladimir?

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.150
ANTON JABLOKOV:
Yeah, to be approved.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.858
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I
was just going to ask.

00:08:35.858 --> 00:08:37.805
Do you sign off, then, Vladimir?

00:08:37.805 --> 00:08:40.520
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Well, I
start to globally try to-- no,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.645
I generally look after the
production and promotion

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:46.360
on the other side of--

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.810
the more business side of it.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:48.320
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, OK.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.870
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
So we always think

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.536
like, what would work
in the production?

00:08:51.536 --> 00:08:53.635
What is the next direction
we should be going?

00:08:53.635 --> 00:08:56.260
And yes, I always get the music
on the day when it's written,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.020
or the day after.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.000
And then we look whether we
all agree that it's good.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.710
It's a teamwork.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.460
It's not really that I
would be saying, OK, well,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.870
this is better, or something.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.345
I wouldn't, as much
as he does give out

00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:08.720
to me how I'm
doing the business,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.020
but then we generally
know our places.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.250
SPEAKER 1: OK, well,
that's a good segue way

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.650
into your relationship
and the dynamic.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.570
Like you market yourselves as
the dueling violin brothers.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.600
But how much does sibling--

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.812
like a sibling
rivalry, but also how,

00:09:28.812 --> 00:09:31.270
when you know someone so well
and you've grown up together,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.582
and it's so natural to rub
each other up the wrong way.

00:09:33.582 --> 00:09:35.790
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: No, we
criticize each other a lot.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.080
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.410
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
It's very [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:37.660
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.210
But it's great to--

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.820
ANTON JABLOKOV:
There is no filter.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.220
It's just no filter.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.990
Sometimes, it's too much, but--

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.156
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: So when
people come to our house,

00:09:46.156 --> 00:09:48.130
it's like our youngest
brother, Victor, worked

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.540
with us after four years--

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.540
first time.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.280
He did the orchestrations
for the 25-piece orchestra

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.420
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.260
Two-hours program.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.950
It was 700 pages of A3 scores.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.800
But so it's a lot of
writing and a lot of work,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.680
and he did that all.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.750
And he was conducting.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.050
And when he seen us,
like how much we argue.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.512
And when we said
anything to him,

00:10:09.512 --> 00:10:11.220
he goes like, how can
you work like that?

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.904
Like, he's a little bit out
of that world for some time,

00:10:13.904 --> 00:10:15.820
because he's studying
in Moscow at the moment,

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.462
so we don't see him that often.

00:10:17.462 --> 00:10:19.670
But I think he got used to
it at the end of the week.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.590
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah,
he's getting better.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.300
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yeah, we
are teaching him how to--

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.883
SPEAKER 1: Getting
more argumentative?

00:10:23.883 --> 00:10:25.460
[LAUGHS] And does
that help, then?

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.510
Does that improve the
speed of the process

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.540
and to get to move on?

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.610
ANTON JABLOKOV: Well, maybe
the quality, you know?

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.859
Because we are all criticized.

00:10:31.859 --> 00:10:35.000
I mean, if he plays, I'm
criticizing him all the time,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.290
so he has to improve.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.190
But also--

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.910
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
I'm criticizing him.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:38.110
ANTON JABLOKOV: --the other way.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.859
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: But
he doesn't take it.

00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:40.544
You know?

00:10:40.544 --> 00:10:41.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:41.920
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.210
ANTON JABLOKOV: It's good.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.460
When I pick a piece, he says,
no, no way, I usually hate it,

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.440
or it's boring.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.447
And that's why, if
we have an idea,

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:49.780
it has to be a really good idea.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.890
Otherwise, it doesn't work.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:51.835
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
We have to filter it

00:10:51.835 --> 00:10:53.110
through many resources.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.510
And then we ask people
around, and so on.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.540
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.610
Great.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:01.480
I'd like to talk to you two
about your lives as musicians.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.060
Vladimir, how long have
you been in Ireland again?

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.907
12 years?

00:11:04.907 --> 00:11:06.490
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Over 13 years, now.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:06.855
SPEAKER 1: Over 13 years.

00:11:06.855 --> 00:11:08.980
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: It'll
be 14 in September.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.430
SPEAKER 1: So Vladimir has
been here for nearly 14 years.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.630
And for our audience, the guys
come from a very musical family

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.980
and used to play with their
parents and their siblings

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.560
quite a bit.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.100
But when you left
to come to Ireland,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.744
why did you want to
leave your violin behind?

00:11:28.744 --> 00:11:30.910
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: It was
very obvious in our family

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.830
that we were going to
all become six siblings

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.970
and all become
professional musicians.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.830
But we were, sort of,
asked that question

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.820
when we were five
or six years of age.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.670
And once we decided then, you
know, music lessons four times

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.730
a week, and you go on with it.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.760
It was a great thing,
what our dad did,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.260
because I'm really happy now.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.330
But when I got to my teenage
years, when I was 17 or 18,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.970
I started to
struggle, as I could

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.420
see the classical world
was changing a lot.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.760
I don't know how it was here.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.360
But back in Slovakia-- or
Czechoslovakia before--

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.760
and around the musicians,
classical musicians

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.880
would be counted on sort
of the high ranking.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.809
Like, we had more possibilities
than doctors or anybody else.

00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:13.350
Like it was--

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.190
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:14.990
ANTON JABLOKOV:
To travel and to--

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.198
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: To travel.

00:12:16.198 --> 00:12:18.175
And also money would be
much, much better, even

00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:19.300
just working the orchestra.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.645
And the change in the '90s
that I could see happening,

00:12:22.645 --> 00:12:24.020
I was like,
actually, this is not

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.640
what I picked to be or to study.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.120
And I wasn't that much in
love with the classical music

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.620
as yet.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.610
And I discovered Eminem and
all sorts of other performers.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.470
And I said, I want to
try something different.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.410
So I just wanted to
leave everything behind

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.482
and go for a couple of months.

00:12:40.482 --> 00:12:42.690
I only planned to stay for
two and 1/2, three months.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.804
SPEAKER 1: For a
few months, yeah.

00:12:44.804 --> 00:12:46.220
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
And then, Anton

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.761
was actually giving
out to me to take

00:12:47.761 --> 00:12:52.410
the violin, because I hadn't
had a single word in English.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.385
SPEAKER 1: OK, right.

00:12:53.385 --> 00:12:55.220
ANTON JABLOKOV: He had one
word for the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:55.930
which was--

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.215
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:57.215 --> 00:12:58.173
SPEAKER 1: Fair enough.

00:12:58.173 --> 00:12:59.300
We can use our imaginations.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.440
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah, I
was listening to Eminem.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.455
And my mom was saying, oh,
so what are you listening to?

00:13:03.455 --> 00:13:05.396
I couldn't understand
a word, you know?

00:13:05.396 --> 00:13:06.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.525
SPEAKER 1: So then
you got to Ireland.

00:13:08.525 --> 00:13:10.790
And in a few days--

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.720
you were in the West for
a while, isn't that right?

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.150
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Yeah, I wanted to go.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.660
But when I came to Dublin, I
saw the reality of how it is

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.080
and how much everything costs--

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.955
back then, the difference
was very different.

00:13:19.955 --> 00:13:21.530
I brought 600
euros, and I thought

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.055
I'm going to survive a month.

00:13:23.055 --> 00:13:24.955
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.600
SPEAKER 1: Evil laugh
from the audience.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:27.965
[LAUGHS]

00:13:27.965 --> 00:13:28.147
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Yeah, that's what it is.

00:13:28.147 --> 00:13:30.146
And back then, it would
be possible in Slovakia.

00:13:30.146 --> 00:13:33.430
Now, it's all sort of equalizing
that [INAUDIBLE] 14 years ago.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.080
So I came in, and
then I realized, OK,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.010
so I would need to take a
flight in two weeks' time

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.060
or call my dad for money.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:38.510
SPEAKER 1: Hm.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:38.960
Wow.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.410
OK.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.868
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: And I didn't
want to do that, so I said,

00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:43.759
I want to try
something different.

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.050
And I want to create something.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.940
So I said, like OK,
just for some time,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.320
go back to [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.570
And then I realized that
I can get really, really

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.377
quick, direct impact with
what I'm doing from people.

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:56.960
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.650
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
So for example,

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.691
you are playing a piece
of music that you thought

00:13:59.691 --> 00:14:00.850
everybody's going to love--

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.200
or I love-- but no,
you don't make a cent.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.630
And then you play
something else,

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.640
and you just start seeing
that people are interested.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.707
So it was a really good
tester for the market.

00:14:10.707 --> 00:14:11.290
SPEAKER 1: Mm.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:11.420
That's great.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.540
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Then I
actually found the pieces

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.870
that I enjoyed and
people enjoyed.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:19.190
So then I created the first
band, and it was great.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.645
In 2005 and 2006, we sold over
20,000 CDs only on the street.

00:14:23.645 --> 00:14:24.270
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:24.970
That's amazing.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.712
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: And it was
going really, really well.

00:14:27.712 --> 00:14:29.920
But then, I wanted to move
it over somewhere further.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.630
But the musicians I had back
then, they were really happy

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.000
that, OK, we are making great
money here on the street.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.250
Like why would we
risk something?

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.100
Why would we try to
bring in somewhere else?

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.890
And then for 12 years,
I'm working on something

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.247
that, hopefully, we can bring
internationally next year.

00:14:45.247 --> 00:14:45.830
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:46.454
That's amazing.

00:14:46.454 --> 00:14:50.600
So real-life market
research with the shoppers

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.737
on Grafton Street, eh?

00:14:51.737 --> 00:14:54.070
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: It was a
really good start, you know?

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:58.659
I mean, within a year and 1/2,
I started to organize concerts

00:14:58.659 --> 00:15:01.325
with different promoters and so
on, until I became [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:01.325 --> 00:15:02.960
SPEAKER 1: Who was the
first promoter then

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.340
that you would have-- or
who was the first person

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.174
to put you on stage?

00:15:05.174 --> 00:15:06.756
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
It was Jim Mallory.

00:15:06.756 --> 00:15:08.600
He was actually a
very local promoter.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.959
He was more like a-- he retired,
and he did it as a hobby.

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:14.750
He actually came to
the concert last night.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.230
SPEAKER 1: Aw, lovely.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.420
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: He's 85
or 88, something like it.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.390
He's old now.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.610
But then, sort of, "Mr
Business" as I call it,

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.980
was Pat Egan, who would be
the main classical crossover

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.390
promotion in Ireland.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.280
And then, I worked
with [INAUDIBLE],,

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.650
which is the record company.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.590
And they're part of MCD.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.890
And at the moment,
we said about a year

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.280
ago or so that we actually need
to drop everyone, everything,

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.190
and start to sort of throw
ourselves to the water

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.150
and see what's possible.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.390
Because it was
struggling for a while.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.980
It wasn't moving anywhere.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.775
SPEAKER 1: Oh,
drop the promoters

00:15:49.775 --> 00:15:50.375
that you were working with?

00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:51.280
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:51.863
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:15:51.863 --> 00:15:54.550
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: And agent
and manager, and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.280
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.630
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: It's
a lot of different people

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.588
to be involved if you
want to get it somewhere,

00:15:58.588 --> 00:16:00.649
but we felt that all
those people were great

00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:02.190
and really enjoyed
working with them.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.390
I was with the record
company for seven years .

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.855
But you know, we
hit the brick wall.

00:16:07.855 --> 00:16:09.480
And actually, it
wasn't going anywhere.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.970
I thought, I have
an idea, said, we

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.280
have an idea of where to work.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.474
And I think we're getting
quite good results now

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:17.265
with the production
package from yesterday.

00:16:17.265 --> 00:16:18.880
I think it was
really, really good.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.420
And we did more work
within a couple of months

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.827
than we've done in a long time.

00:16:23.827 --> 00:16:24.410
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.220
That's amazing.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.600
When did you join, then, Anton?

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.850
ANTON JABLOKOV: It was about--

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.580
like, I always played with him.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:34.910
Or during my studies, I always
came here to Ireland in summer

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.580
to play weddings and things,
so I could pay all my studies

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.750
through the years.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:42.510
But actively, about four years
ago was the first concert

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:43.962
in the concert hall with him.

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:45.170
SPEAKER 1: Wow, that's great.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.007
So you're based in
Switzerland, isn't it?

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:47.840
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yes.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.548
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:16:48.548 --> 00:16:50.240
And we established this earlier.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.766
You have actually finished
all of your master's now.

00:16:52.766 --> 00:16:54.890
And you decided you're not
doing any more master's.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.473
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah,
it's enough now.

00:16:56.473 --> 00:16:58.820
I have to lead a real life.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.422
SPEAKER 1: So the
package, Vladimir,

00:17:00.422 --> 00:17:02.630
that you were talking about--
the performance package

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.640
that you've been working on over
the last year or so, I guess?

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.931
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Or so, yeah.

00:17:06.931 --> 00:17:08.936
SPEAKER 1: And that we
got to see last night.

00:17:08.936 --> 00:17:10.810
What are your hopes and
aspirations for that?

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.085
What's next with that package?

00:17:13.085 --> 00:17:15.710
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: First of all,
we have to create the package,

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.849
which will take another month.

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:17.973
We have to take highlights.

00:17:17.973 --> 00:17:22.160
We have take the orchestrations
and have it all prepared

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.079
as one package.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:28.150
We're hoping to forward it
onto different orchestras

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.861
and circles, like BBC, and just
offer it that is what we have.

00:17:32.861 --> 00:17:35.360
They have to see that the work
of the orchestration is good,

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.709
the music choice is right.

00:17:36.709 --> 00:17:38.750
And they have to see the
examples of how we play,

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.210
how it can look on
the stage, and so on.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.150
So that will be one.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.753
And secondly, we would
like to prepare--

00:17:44.753 --> 00:17:49.145
and those were the ideas about
the more sort of recent songs,

00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:52.720
rather than doing
everything only classical.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.140
We need some sort of
deal that will break us

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.510
through into different markets.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.735
And for example, America
would need something--

00:17:59.735 --> 00:18:00.860
SPEAKER 1: The more modern.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.750
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
More modern, but it

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.709
doesn't mean we have to
play it all the time,

00:18:03.709 --> 00:18:05.000
like through the whole concert.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.640
But you need to have a
couple of those things

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.090
that people actually like.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:07.320
ANTON JABLOKOV: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.350
SPEAKER 1: Can latch onto.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.050
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:09.716
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:18:09.716 --> 00:18:10.220
OK, great.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.207
And then, when you--

00:18:11.207 --> 00:18:13.540
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: So just
start to sell it and probably

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.060
get-- we have a couple of
different people highlighted

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.990
that we would like to work
with us as managers, as agents,

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.597
and then also as the producers.

00:18:20.597 --> 00:18:22.930
But at the moment, we're all
in the process of research,

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:24.240
because we don't want
to just jump into it,

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.500
because we feel that we do
have the product that we

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:26.970
could go [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:27.969
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:18:27.969 --> 00:18:29.590
And will your younger
brother continue

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:30.673
to do your orchestrations?

00:18:30.673 --> 00:18:32.470
Or when you go to
work an orchestra,

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:37.767
like the BBC Orchestra,
the RTE Orchestra,

00:18:37.767 --> 00:18:39.100
do you work with that conductor?

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.960
Or can you also bring
in your own conductor?

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.793
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: We
would like to have him

00:18:42.793 --> 00:18:44.860
on the list as a part of
the production package.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.290
But sometimes, they want to
have their own conductors,

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.020
or they have a conductor that
sells the tickets as well.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:50.710
SPEAKER 1: Sure.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.335
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
For example, if they

00:18:52.335 --> 00:18:53.950
did with half of the
concert or so on,

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.034
they had something else--
so he will be definitely

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:57.325
part of the production package.

00:18:57.325 --> 00:18:59.350
And it's really good to
work with him, actually.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.848
We enjoyed it [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:02.972
SPEAKER 1: He's a peace-maker,
by the sounds of it.

00:19:02.972 --> 00:19:03.205
[LAUGHS]

00:19:03.205 --> 00:19:04.275
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Oh, not exactly.

00:19:04.275 --> 00:19:05.441
I wouldn't tell it that way.

00:19:05.441 --> 00:19:07.750
But no, he really can
hold the orchestra well.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.390
It's the old Russian
school where they actually

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.807
show every single beat, and--

00:19:13.807 --> 00:19:14.640
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.570
ANTON JABLOKOV: At
work, yesterday,

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.944
it was a test,
actually, for him.

00:19:16.944 --> 00:19:17.902
He didn't know it.

00:19:17.902 --> 00:19:18.826
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:20.212
SPEAKER 1: So you'll keep him.

00:19:20.212 --> 00:19:22.378
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: What is
really hard for classical

00:19:22.378 --> 00:19:24.940
orchestras-- and we found it
with some of the BBC orchestras

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.320
as well--

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.270
they're not used
to play sometimes

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.280
as fast as we go
with the tempos.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:30.930
We call it [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.304
I don't know how
it's in English.

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:33.830
Like, when you go fast--

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.144
[COUNTING BEAT]---- and
they're just not quick enough

00:19:37.144 --> 00:19:39.310
to follow, because they
don't have the monitors yet,

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.870
or at least, like, the double
bass is somewhere there.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.195
And the violas will be on
the other side of the hall.

00:19:45.195 --> 00:19:46.070
And they have to go--

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.090
[CLAPPING]---- and--
[COUNTING BEAT]..

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.200
And when the sound comes,
it's already too late.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.950
So they actually have
to ignore the sound,

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.800
but they have to only
follow the conductor.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.030
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:55.575
OK.

00:19:55.575 --> 00:19:57.130
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.380
taken from the folk
music, these techniques.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.887
And that's where it
actually was the real test

00:20:02.887 --> 00:20:05.470
that it works for Victor, and
he was able to hold it together.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.910
SPEAKER 1: That's amazing.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.776
Yeah, he definitely
held it together

00:20:07.776 --> 00:20:08.900
and when he closed as well.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.150
ANTON JABLOKOV: Because we
could talk to him at home

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:11.108
and prepare everything.

00:20:11.108 --> 00:20:14.267
And you know, we could have
a professional conductor.

00:20:14.267 --> 00:20:16.100
We meet him 10 minutes
before the rehearsal,

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.424
and then it is not
enough time, probably.

00:20:18.424 --> 00:20:19.590
SPEAKER 1: OK, that's great.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.533
ANTON JABLOKOV: I
mean, it would work.

00:20:20.533 --> 00:20:20.622
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:20:20.622 --> 00:20:22.390
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: They would
sometimes underestimate how--

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.710
SPEAKER 1: About what the
expectations are as well.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.130
Yeah, that's fair enough.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.870
So you both have very busy
lives, by the sounds of it.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.280
And we've talked a little bit
about your lives over lunch.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.730
Can you tell us about--
like how do you manage that?

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.470
You're a musician,
you're a promoter,

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.390
but you were also a student--

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:44.580
your parents-- how do you
juggle that lifestyle?

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.970
ANTON JABLOKOV: Mine is
not so difficult. For me,

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.810
the difficult thing was the
studies and playing concerts.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.080
So I always had to organize
also with the teachers at school

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.929
and professors, because
it's very risky.

00:20:58.929 --> 00:21:00.970
Either they are happy that
you play the concerts,

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.590
or they say you
shouldn't study if you

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.110
want to do your career now.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.750
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.770
ANTON JABLOKOV: So it was a real
struggle for all these years.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.170
I had to organize and
write letters to the school

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.470
to let me go for a month
there, for a month there.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.380
SPEAKER 1: And were
most of your professors

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.300
forthcoming and happy with
you to go and perform?

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.340
Or did you have some who
were a bit more strict?

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.730
ANTON JABLOKOV: They were all
happy, actually, because--

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.330
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: The last
school was very good, but--

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.390
ANTON JABLOKOV:
The last school--

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.732
it's not even the professors.

00:21:24.732 --> 00:21:26.690
I mean, your violin
professor, they don't care.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.120
They are happy to play concerts.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.500
It's more about the
headmaster of the school

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.470
and music theory
teachers and this.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.060
SPEAKER 1: And so you've got
the balancing all the family

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.670
life, the touring,
performing, and then

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.710
marketing and promoting as well.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.107
But you're running a
small business, really,

00:21:45.107 --> 00:21:45.940
so what's that like?

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.370
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: It is,
sort of, a small business.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.130
So it can be very hard.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:55.600
And in the relationship, it
can be quite difficult as well.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.980
Like in the last three weeks,
I've seen my wife and kids

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.540
for a total of 20 minutes.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.200
And for a week, they actually
had to get out of the house,

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.870
and they went for a holiday.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:07.190
SPEAKER 1: Just leave you alone.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.510
[CHUCKLES]

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.765
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:22:07.765 --> 00:22:09.350
I mean, it is
really much that you

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.891
start working at
7:00 in the morning,

00:22:10.891 --> 00:22:12.370
and you finish at 1:00 AM.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.710
And you just have to go
with it, because that's

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.940
what you are doing.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.440
At the moment, I like to do--

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.380
and it's a bit of
my own fault. I

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.850
like to be in charge of
too many things, maybe.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:22.720
So I promote.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.040
I do stage managing.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:24.960
I do library.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.970
And I do--

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.630
I mean, everything for the
music, and the promotions,

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.080
and then production-wise,
and so on.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.417
But obviously, as I
said, we're highlighting

00:22:34.417 --> 00:22:35.500
different people for that.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.560
So I can be hoping to actually
become a violinist, which

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.750
is only about 10% of my--

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.590
or 20%--

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.010
SPEAKER 1: Job these days.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.120
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Job these days.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.495
And I still need to spend
about four hours a day with it.

00:22:45.495 --> 00:22:47.740
So that would be--

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.740
SPEAKER 1: There you go.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.790
And we're going to go
to audience questions

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.270
in a little while, so have a
think about something you'd

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.010
like to ask the guys.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.419
I was chatting to Hugo, one
of our volunteers, yesterday,

00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:01.460
and I got some questions.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:06.820
He was wondering, could you
describe your most memorable

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.030
performance, good or bad?

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:10.924
Most memorable.

00:23:10.924 --> 00:23:13.465
ANTON JABLOKOV: I would say,
BBC [INAUDIBLE] because of the--

00:23:13.465 --> 00:23:13.750
SPEAKER 1: Yeah?

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:14.405
Last year?

00:23:14.405 --> 00:23:15.370
Was that last year?

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.135
ANTON JABLOKOV: A
year and a half ago.

00:23:16.135 --> 00:23:16.665
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:23:16.665 --> 00:23:18.706
ANTON JABLOKOV: It was
just a really big concert,

00:23:18.706 --> 00:23:21.260
because there were
12,000 people.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.100
And it was very special for us--

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:23.956
a big surprise.

00:23:23.956 --> 00:23:25.580
SPEAKER 1: That was
in Belfast, was it?

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:25.770
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:26.436
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:23:26.436 --> 00:23:28.000
And what did you perform?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.250
ANTON JABLOKOV: About six--

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.208
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: I
don't remember which show,

00:23:31.208 --> 00:23:33.280
but I only remember
that because we

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.740
were the only one being
broadcasted to the main BBC TV,

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.444
or whatever.

00:23:38.444 --> 00:23:39.360
There was [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:39.860
It was big.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.490
It was on the Russian
[INAUDIBLE],, so that went well.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:44.710
ANTON JABLOKOV: It went well.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.665
Only the interview-- actually,
we spoke after we played.

00:23:47.665 --> 00:23:49.444
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:49.444 --> 00:23:51.360
ANTON JABLOKOV: I so
concentrated on the music

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.600
that the moderator--
the presenter--

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.720
she was asking
something, and I totally

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.875
forgot to listen to her.

00:23:56.875 --> 00:23:57.770
So I was like [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:58.660
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: And
we were live there.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.420
And she asked him something,
and he looked at her like,

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.422
did you ask me anything?

00:24:02.422 --> 00:24:02.730
You know?

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:02.884
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:02.884 --> 00:24:03.810
ANTON JABLOKOV: Of
course, I really

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:04.550
didn't hear the question.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:05.530
And I was like, excuse me?

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:06.260
Then she repeated.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.120
I didn't hear what she repeated.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:07.682
SPEAKER 1: Oh, no.

00:24:07.682 --> 00:24:07.870
[LAUGHS]

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.286
ANTON JABLOKOV:
It was a disaster.

00:24:09.286 --> 00:24:10.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:11.070
ANTON JABLOKOV: Oh,
that's fair enough.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.280
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yeah, you
need to focus on two things.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.515
ANTON JABLOKOV: Now it wouldn't
happen on your [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:15.515 --> 00:24:15.940
SPEAKER 1: Oh, that's good.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.898
ANTON JABLOKOV: I hope.

00:24:16.898 --> 00:24:19.782
SPEAKER 1: [LAUGHS]
You're doing good, so far.

00:24:19.782 --> 00:24:20.740
Is it the same for you?

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.290
Is that your most memorable
performance, Vladimir?

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.030
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Well, with
the two of us, probably, yes.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:25.738
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hm.

00:24:25.738 --> 00:24:27.900
And as a solo artist?

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.010
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Solo artist--

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.620
a bad way what I
remember, generally,

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.460
if you get the flu or
something during the--

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.790
which it used to
happen to me before I

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.640
run the series of
Christmas concerts

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.470
where I bring more
family members.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.930
And I used to do,
like, 15 concerts

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.790
in December, one after another.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:51.620
And it was about two or
three-- maybe three years ago.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.252
I felt really terrible,
like I'm not managing it.

00:24:54.252 --> 00:24:57.135
And I don't know
what's happening,

00:24:57.135 --> 00:24:59.260
but I was just sleeping
through the days, whatever.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.480
I couldn't speak properly,
and I was actually

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.950
presenting those
shows and leading

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:07.630
the orchestra, no conductor,
and all those things.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.560
And I remember, I
just didn't know--

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.590
one concert was
I didn't remember

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.840
how I walked on the stage
and how I got off the stage.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.000
But I mean, the next year,
we still sold the tickets,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.572
so I guess I did
something right.

00:25:18.572 --> 00:25:20.530
SPEAKER 1: Or it was
entertaining in some form.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:21.110
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
And then, we finished

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.930
about the 21st of December.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.760
And we were doing one event
in [INAUDIBLE] on the 29th,

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.040
I think, or something
like that, of December.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.854
And my wife was
saying, you know,

00:25:30.854 --> 00:25:32.520
you should go and
check with the doctor.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.130
And I said, I'm completely fine.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.190
There is nothing wrong
with me, like I feel great.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.970
And she was pushing at me
so much that I said, OK, I'm

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.330
going to go to the GP.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:45.720
And she put this whatever on my
finger, checking the oxygens,

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.220
whatever.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.880
She looked at me like,
how I was standing.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.130
And I had really
strong pneumonia.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.562
I had everything else together.

00:25:52.562 --> 00:25:54.270
And I played those
concerts [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.770
And I was actually
going to be fine.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:57.110
That was fine.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.230
But you cannot be sick.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:01.260
That's one difficult
thing about musicians,

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.980
that you just have
to keep going.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.210
So those would be the ones.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.534
But you have to learn then how
to not be run down too much.

00:26:07.534 --> 00:26:08.200
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.220
Yeah, Because the
show must go on.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.220
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.150
And now, I didn't get sick for
the last three years or so.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.620
Since then, I never got
sick for the concert.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.700
And also, I know when we finish
something like a big tour,

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.850
I need 24 hours off-- no
e-mails, no phone calls,

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:22.660
nothing.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.940
Just sort of sit back in
the garden, or in the room,

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.540
or something, not
to talk to anyone.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:26.940
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.400
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
And then, I can--

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.407
I wasn't sick for Christmas.

00:26:29.407 --> 00:26:29.990
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.907
So you're managing it.

00:26:30.907 --> 00:26:32.406
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:32.406 --> 00:26:33.749
And before, it was seven years.

00:26:33.749 --> 00:26:35.290
You know, Christmas
day, and I went--

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:36.511
[CHOKING SOUND]

00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:38.574
But after the concerts,
generally, and then once

00:26:38.574 --> 00:26:39.490
it hit me [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.410
SPEAKER 1: OK, we're
glad you're managing it.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:42.190
So that's good.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.450
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: So that's
the most memorable thing,

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:44.325
I got sick, you know?

00:26:44.325 --> 00:26:47.230
But back then, when I was in
on the streets, [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.320
brought me to
Carnegie Hall once.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.340
That was, I think,
2006 or something.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.196
I don't know now.

00:26:52.196 --> 00:26:54.320
That was many, many years
ago, so I don't remember.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.842
That was a huge occasion
for me back then.

00:26:56.842 --> 00:26:58.050
It would be for any musician.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:58.580
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
for any musician.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.865
Yeah.

00:26:59.865 --> 00:27:01.460
Very impressive.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.720
So anyone in the audience
with a burning question?

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.090
We have a question over here.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:06.565
AUDIENCE: Very nice to meet you.

00:27:06.565 --> 00:27:08.340
And thank you for
coming in today.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.720
I wanted to know if--
you've performed presumably

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.440
with many artists
over the years.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.470
Do you find a
different connection

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.400
when you're playing
with each other?

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.510
And does that make
the music more magic?

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.650
Do you find it easier to perform
with each other, as opposed

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:28.201
to performing with somebody
who's not a relative?

00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:30.200
ANTON JABLOKOV: It depends
who you perform with.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.950
You know, if you are
with a super musician,

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.460
it's very easy to play,
even without rehearsal.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.640
But of course, when we
play for so many years,

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.720
we know how we move, we
know how to show things,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.390
so it works much easier.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:46.134
Because everyone has his
body language, for example.

00:27:46.134 --> 00:27:47.550
So if you don't
know the language,

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:49.780
it's sometimes hard
to be together.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.280
And that's the most
important thing,

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.140
if you play music, to
be together in time.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.522
Otherwise it
doesn't sound right.

00:27:55.522 --> 00:27:57.730
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: There is
some other body language,

00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:58.230
as he said.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.951
Like, we know when we
look at each other,

00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:03.564
sometimes, we don't have to say
what bar we are trying from,

00:28:03.564 --> 00:28:05.480
because we already know
where was the mistake.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.515
As if it were other musician,
he would actually not even say

00:28:08.515 --> 00:28:09.640
that there was any mistake.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.764
He would not-- it was fine.

00:28:10.764 --> 00:28:11.544
Oh, If it was--

00:28:11.544 --> 00:28:13.210
him, we would just
have to try it again.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:16.580
So it is much quicker progress.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.062
And as we spoke before,
it has to do also

00:28:19.062 --> 00:28:21.270
with being able to criticize
each other [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.540
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah, because
if you are with someone

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.498
you see for the first
time, you can't tell him,

00:28:24.498 --> 00:28:26.230
you are out of tune,
you are not good.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.240
Because they will just
go away or hate you.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:28.770
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: And
never work with you again.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:29.270
Yeah.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.022
Yeah.

00:28:30.022 --> 00:28:31.730
ANTON JABLOKOV: So
it's so nice with him.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.164
I can tell him
anything, I think.

00:28:34.164 --> 00:28:35.330
SPEAKER 1: OK, that's great.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.008
Thanks, [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:37.008 --> 00:28:39.322
Any other questions in the room?

00:28:39.322 --> 00:28:42.974
AUDIENCE: I had a little
question about your childhood.

00:28:42.974 --> 00:28:45.960
Do you think that, if you didn't
grow up in a musical family,

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.017
you would still be
where you are today?

00:28:50.017 --> 00:28:51.600
ANTON JABLOKOV: It's
very hard to say.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.060
I wanted to be a football
player, actually,

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.900
when I was nine, 10.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.660
My father said to me,
OK, you can do it.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.420
But he was not happy, I knew it.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.775
And he also took my violin.

00:29:01.775 --> 00:29:04.191
He said, OK, you don't want
to play violin, so don't play.

00:29:04.191 --> 00:29:07.830
And after a week, I came
back that I wanted my violin.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.510
I always play
football, you know, so

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.994
for the villages,
but as a hobby.

00:29:11.994 --> 00:29:12.660
So I don't know.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:15.630
Maybe I would do some other
job, but sport or music

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.487
would be the preference.

00:29:17.487 --> 00:29:18.486
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:29:18.486 --> 00:29:21.470
On that note,
actually-- so Vladimir,

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.990
if you had left your violin in
Slovakia all those years ago,

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.190
what would you have done?

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.550
If you hadn't called
Dad, and stuck it out--

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.930
ANTON JABLOKOV: Cab driver.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.972
SPEAKER 1: Yeah?

00:29:32.972 --> 00:29:34.680
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: I
always loved nature.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.810
But also to do
something with nature--

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.620
I always wanted to
do business as well.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.130
So I was even
thinking I would go

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.050
and try to do something--
a fisherman business

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.450
or something like that.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.080
It could easily go in that
direction a little bit.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:54.630
But when I look at it now, I
would still get a violin here

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.540
for 100 years, to
get by for some time,

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:01.310
and then obviously, probably,
fly and take my own violin.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:07.554
But if we didn't grow up
in the musical family,

00:30:07.554 --> 00:30:08.470
it's very hard to say.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.320
Because you
generally, I think, I

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.050
feel, in this sort of--
whether it's a business,

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:16.440
whether it's a sport,
or whether it's music,

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.340
some of those professions
would be passed on

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.430
from the generations.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.140
And there is generally one black
sheep going somewhere sideways,

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.730
which I was nearly there.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:28.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.510
SPEAKER 1: You bore that
cross for the others.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:31.301
That's good of you.

00:30:31.301 --> 00:30:33.837
Lots of other questions,
I think, in the--

00:30:33.837 --> 00:30:34.420
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.034
The program you played at
[INAUDIBLE] was quite eclectic.

00:30:37.034 --> 00:30:38.950
And I never thought I'd
hear [INAUDIBLE] being

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.570
sung by the audience at
the national concert hall.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.819
But then what songs
did you try to arrange

00:30:43.819 --> 00:30:46.110
and just rejected because
you didn't think they worked?

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:48.120
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
There was from ABBA.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.495
ANTON JABLOKOV:
There were a few.

00:30:49.495 --> 00:30:52.020
We did a very unknown
song by-- who was it?

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.020
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: ABBA.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:53.811
ANTON JABLOKOV: No.

00:30:53.811 --> 00:30:56.387
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Oh, which one?

00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:57.720
ANTON JABLOKOV: OK, I forgot it.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.344
Well, we can talk
about the other ones.

00:30:59.344 --> 00:31:02.130
We did Saint-Saens,
"Dance Macabre" last year,

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:03.400
and we loved the music.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.650
And we played it on the shows.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.550
But people were
clapping, somehow,

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.270
not really enthusiastic.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:13.330
So we decided to keep
the piece for the future.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.891
And then--

00:31:14.891 --> 00:31:16.390
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Now, was it the--

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:16.650
ANTON JABLOKOV: ABBA?

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:16.995
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Yeah, "Marionette."

00:31:16.995 --> 00:31:17.480
ANTON JABLOKOV: "Marionette."

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.750
There was a song by ABBA.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.884
We loved it, and
it was so modern.

00:31:20.884 --> 00:31:23.050
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: There
were a lot of different bar

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:23.970
counts and [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.178
ANTON JABLOKOV: Jazzy things.

00:31:25.178 --> 00:31:27.090
But again, people were
not really reacting,

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.269
so we recorded it.

00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:29.060
We have it at home.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:29.893
We can listen to it.

00:31:29.893 --> 00:31:31.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.130
SPEAKER 1: So there were
ones that you actually

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.845
brought right to the
stage to perform,

00:31:36.845 --> 00:31:38.736
and then decided, oops.

00:31:38.736 --> 00:31:39.610
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.485
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: No,
it is OK when you have

00:31:41.485 --> 00:31:43.670
20, 22 songs during one show.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.440
So you can throw
in a few new ones

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.710
and see how people are
going to react to this.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:49.980
So you do test every time.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.950
ANTON JABLOKOV: It's sometimes
also hard for us musicians,

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.470
because we heard so
much music and so much

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.870
contemporary music
that, somehow, we

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:01.030
don't know sometimes what's
contemporary for people.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:04.470
So what we thought was
actually really understandable

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:08.940
was not understandable
for the majority.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.994
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I play viola,

00:32:11.994 --> 00:32:13.644
and I have a string quartet.

00:32:13.644 --> 00:32:15.036
And we do a ton of weddings.

00:32:15.036 --> 00:32:16.926
And there are always
a few things we get

00:32:16.926 --> 00:32:19.553
asked to play that we
just hate, and a few

00:32:19.553 --> 00:32:20.594
which are really unusual.

00:32:20.594 --> 00:32:23.100
So we were asked to play
Radiohead's "No Surprises,"

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.890
down the aisle for one bride.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:26.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.140
I was just wondering,
are there any pieces

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.832
you guys just
really hate playing,

00:32:29.832 --> 00:32:33.302
but you know that you have to
do them because they're popular?

00:32:33.302 --> 00:32:34.760
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
During the show,

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.790
I don't think we
do any of those.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:36.660
ANTON JABLOKOV: Now, we
didn't have any more.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.060
Before, when I played his
shows as a second violin--

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.200
--I always had two or
three pieces I liked.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.880
The rest, I was just
suffering there.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.330
And now, I actually
don't have anything

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.372
I don't like in the show.

00:32:49.372 --> 00:32:51.288
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: No,
we do filter everything

00:32:51.288 --> 00:32:52.600
that we actually enjoy.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.891
But the only thing sometimes
happens, that the audience

00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:56.296
doesn't enjoy it.

00:32:56.296 --> 00:33:00.090
But we have to eliminate
those and find something else

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:00.780
that we like.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.190
And also the way you put
the tunes in the order,

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.222
sometimes something
can really work well

00:33:07.222 --> 00:33:08.180
and everybody loves it.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.645
But if that tune went
after the different song,

00:33:10.645 --> 00:33:12.004
it just wouldn't work at all.

00:33:12.004 --> 00:33:13.795
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, the
energy's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:13.795 --> 00:33:14.970
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: But
then I used to play also

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:16.320
weddings in Ireland.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.570
And that was the biggest
suffer, I think, for us both.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.903
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah, because
we played the same program

00:33:20.903 --> 00:33:21.760
every week, and--

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.310
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Or
three or four times a week.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.460
ANTON JABLOKOV:
We shouldn't even

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.501
say what we hate, because
most of the people they

00:33:25.501 --> 00:33:26.250
love these songs.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.090
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: No,
we shouldn't say it.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.006
ANTON JABLOKOV: No,
we can't say it.

00:33:29.006 --> 00:33:30.422
SPEAKER 1: But
with weddings, it's

00:33:30.422 --> 00:33:32.322
the same songs
every single week.

00:33:32.322 --> 00:33:33.780
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
I did overdo it.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.110
Like, I used to do over 200
events a year in Ireland.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.860
SPEAKER 1: Oh, OK.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:37.800
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
So I actually did

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.990
reach the top of what
you could possibly

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.130
do in the country of 4
and 1/2 million people.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:42.796
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:33:42.796 --> 00:33:43.853
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:43.853 --> 00:33:45.370
He's played at
everyone's wedding.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.370
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Well,
you would be surprised,

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:48.356
but yeah, I did.

00:33:48.356 --> 00:33:48.856
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:48.856 --> 00:33:50.740
SPEAKER 1: Did you play
at your own wedding?

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.010
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Me?

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:51.345
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:33:51.345 --> 00:33:51.860
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: No, he did.

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:52.080
ANTON JABLOKOV: I played.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:52.996
SPEAKER 1: You played.

00:33:52.996 --> 00:33:54.490
And did you play then for--

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.031
ANTON JABLOKOV: No,
I didn't ask him.

00:33:56.031 --> 00:33:56.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.655
No, because I had a
very small wedding.

00:33:58.655 --> 00:34:00.280
Nobody was playing,
nobody was singing.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.740
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: He didn't
allow anyone to have speeches.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.160
ANTON JABLOKOV: And
nobody was dancing.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:02.400
SPEAKER 1: No?

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.345
No speeches or anything?

00:34:03.345 --> 00:34:03.570
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: No speeches.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.210
ANTON JABLOKOV:
This was my wife.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:05.170
She didn't want any speeches.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:06.540
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
No, he didn't want.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:07.664
ANTON JABLOKOV: Me neither.

00:34:07.664 --> 00:34:08.952
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:08.952 --> 00:34:10.100
SPEAKER 1: Fair enough.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.790
I'll have you play
at my wedding.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:12.989
So I'll book you in now.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:14.530
I'll give you
[INAUDIBLE] eventually.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:15.090
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
We only do about five

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.320
or six weddings a year now.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.739
SPEAKER 1: OK, that's fine.

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:18.090
I can fit in there.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.520
ANTON JABLOKOV: He
will have a new one.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.020
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Only one, yeah?

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:21.970
SPEAKER 1: Only one.

00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:22.925
Only one wedding.

00:34:22.925 --> 00:34:25.233
Yeah, that's the plan anyway.

00:34:25.233 --> 00:34:29.430
[LAUGHS] I have another
audience question?

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:30.929
Right at the other
side of the room.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:32.637
AUDIENCE: Myself, I
started playing piano

00:34:32.637 --> 00:34:34.190
at the age of eight.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:37.659
I come from-- be it not quite
as musical as your family,

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.362
but between the
five of us, there

00:34:39.362 --> 00:34:42.150
was also some 13
instruments going around.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.645
And my parents really pushed
for me to pick up an instrument.

00:34:45.645 --> 00:34:47.056
And we had a piano at home.

00:34:47.056 --> 00:34:48.389
And I started playing the piano.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:52.150
But probably also because
of sheer lack of talent

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:56.280
that, after seven or eight years
of intensive piano playing,

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.730
I kind of gave up on it.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:03.400
And in retrospect, it took
me about another 15 years

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.925
to now start missing it.

00:35:04.925 --> 00:35:05.800
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.370
AUDIENCE: And I figure that
if I started missing it

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:10.849
a little bit sooner,
I would have probably

00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:11.640
picked it up again.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.780
So when you look at your future
and potential kids and whatnot,

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.390
do you have any
advice of how you

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:23.212
would keep your kids motivated
in playing music and picking up

00:35:23.212 --> 00:35:24.230
an instrument and such?

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.980
ANTON JABLOKOV: I think
the first thing is

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.890
that they have to--

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.700
like, if they have
musical lessons,

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.070
it should be a treat,
not a punishment.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:32.760
You know?

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.100
So I wouldn't start too soon.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.250
Because if they start
at five, if they're not

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.410
from musical families, sometimes
they are really happy for one

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:41.910
month.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:46.310
And then they just get bored,
and they don't like it anymore.

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.070
For example, I have a son,
and he wanted to play guitar.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.310
But he was waiting for a year,
for one year, to have lessons.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:54.520
And now, he has lessons.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.650
And he thinks it's a
special thing for him,

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.782
that he has paid lessons and
he's enjoying it so much.

00:36:00.782 --> 00:36:02.490
He doesn't practice
too much, and I'm not

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.840
pushing on him because,
otherwise, again,

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.580
he could think it's work
and not a nice thing.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.940
So now, he's practicing
only when he wants.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.570
And maybe after one
year, I can tell

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.570
him, look, if you practice,
you will enjoy more,

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:16.450
because you can play more songs.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.777
And that way, probably
he will stay motivated.

00:36:19.777 --> 00:36:21.360
SPEAKER 1: Vladimir,
did your daughter

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.104
sing at one of your concerts?

00:36:23.104 --> 00:36:24.645
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
She did last year.

00:36:24.645 --> 00:36:24.810
Yeah.

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:26.643
SPEAKER 1: At the
Christmas concert, was it?

00:36:26.643 --> 00:36:27.780
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.290
She liked to be
part of the gang.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.220
It's my oldest daughter.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.150
And since she was maybe
three years of age,

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.090
she said, like, I
want to go with you.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.220
So I brought her to one
of the local concerts.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.800
And it was in [INAUDIBLE],,
like about 500 people.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.150
And she had no problem
coming in and singing,

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:46.010
I think, "Jingle Bells,"
or something like that.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:47.820
And actually, now,
after many years,

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:51.290
she composed her own
version of "Jingle Bells."

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.700
Like, there was
a proper rap song

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.470
in the middle of "Jingle Bell"--

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:56.140
she's 11.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.509
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:57.509 --> 00:36:59.300
SPEAKER 1: She's gonna
take over the world.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:36:59.880
That's amazing.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.330
[LAUGHS]

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:01.570
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
She did her own words,

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:02.528
everything, the melody.

00:37:02.528 --> 00:37:04.759
And she had a proper chorus
going there with everyone

00:37:04.759 --> 00:37:05.550
with her, you know?

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:06.966
SPEAKER 1: Actions
and everything.

00:37:06.966 --> 00:37:07.747
Wow.

00:37:07.747 --> 00:37:10.080
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: But she
played piano for a few years,

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.121
and now she wants to
actually pick up the violin.

00:37:12.121 --> 00:37:13.650
I'm also not pushing
because I feel

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:16.470
that if she wants to
really-- like with a violin,

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.020
it's really the latest
age she could possibly

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.730
start to actually
become a violinist,

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:23.500
because it's a very
unnatural position to play.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.507
So if you start when
you're fully adult,

00:37:25.507 --> 00:37:27.090
it's very unlikely
that they are going

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.160
to be an actual player
because your muscles are

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.270
all a different way.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.145
SPEAKER 1: Oh, wow.

00:37:31.145 --> 00:37:32.770
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
But now, she's still

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:33.940
at the age where she could.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:34.940
And she really loves it.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:40.005
And I taught violin for about
six months, or about a year

00:37:40.005 --> 00:37:41.160
in Ireland.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.990
I just thought I want to
try this as an experience.

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:48.120
I suffered quite a lot,
and so I'm not teaching.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.460
But she did the
progress in one month,

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.720
more than most of the
students they had in a year.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.790
So I think she
could do something.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.990
But again, it's
completely up to her.

00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:01.680
And she has to see if she
likes the life of what I do

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.549
and sometimes the way
there is no time at all.

00:38:04.549 --> 00:38:07.090
For example, for a month, I try
to be with them all the time.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.990
But she can see that.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.840
ANTON JABLOKOV: On the
other side, sometimes,

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.010
we have loads of time.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:11.350
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:12.030
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.960
ANTON JABLOKOV: Now, I'm
at home for four weeks.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.130
But then, I'm there
for a few weeks,

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.740
and I'm 24 hours at home.

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.950
So I like it, actually.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:20.305
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:38:20.305 --> 00:38:20.846
That's great.

00:38:20.846 --> 00:38:23.430
That's a good question.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:26.812
Another question here at
the front of the room.

00:38:26.812 --> 00:38:27.437
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:27.437 --> 00:38:29.220
[INAUDIBLE],, I also
play the viola.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.719
ANTON JABLOKOV: Oh,
fellow musicians.

00:38:31.719 --> 00:38:35.890
AUDIENCE: I'm 16, so
I do play at concerts.

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.130
I'm actually [INAUDIBLE],,
because I picked it up

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:40.835
when I actually really
wanted to learn it.

00:38:40.835 --> 00:38:43.999
So it's amazing and
inspiring to see all this.

00:38:43.999 --> 00:38:45.915
So my question is first
like a quick question.

00:38:45.915 --> 00:38:48.248
I was curious, like why did
you choose to go to Ireland?

00:38:48.248 --> 00:38:52.304
Like what was it that kind
of drew you to Ireland?

00:38:52.304 --> 00:38:53.304
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:38:53.304 --> 00:38:56.420
It was a real coincidence.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.360
One of my cousins was
here for the summer,

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.859
and she actually was somewhere
in [INAUDIBLE],, or somewhere

00:39:00.859 --> 00:39:02.270
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:04.396
So I don't even
remember where it was.

00:39:04.396 --> 00:39:05.770
And she showed me
a few pictures.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:07.350
And I said, oh, that looks cool.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:09.770
I took a backpack with
fishing gear out and tent,

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:11.970
and I arrived to see
the central Dublin.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:16.489 --> 00:39:18.530
AUDIENCE: My other question
is, like for example,

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:22.320
if you think Nietzsche
as a philosopher--

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.700
he looks at Wagner, as kind
of dismissing his music as

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.352
in numb the nerves of society.

00:39:29.352 --> 00:39:31.353
So I was kind of interested
in your philosophy

00:39:31.353 --> 00:39:34.040
of what music brings
to people's lives

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:38.243
and what the meaning
is of music for you.

00:39:38.243 --> 00:39:40.300
ANTON JABLOKOV: Mm-hm.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.460
Like with Wagner,
I used to hate him,

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.960
because he was very arrogant.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.680
And so but now, after I
played a few of his pieces

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.230
in the orchestra,
he was a genius.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.942
So he was really good.

00:39:52.942 --> 00:39:55.620
And only after years
of playing with him--

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.820
so now, I actually
understand that it's

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.028
really nice when you play
concerts that people react.

00:40:00.028 --> 00:40:03.137
They are happy, and they
can cry in the concert.

00:40:03.137 --> 00:40:03.970
It's like in Greece.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.790
They say it was like
a cure, medical cure,

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.500
if you went to
drama, to theater.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:14.185
So you could leave your emotions
without doing anything wrong.

00:40:14.185 --> 00:40:16.077
And you can cry without--

00:40:16.077 --> 00:40:17.410
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Being judged.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:18.680
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.820
SPEAKER 1: It's not
me, it's the musician.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:20.800
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
You can be happy.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.716
ANTON JABLOKOV: Or you
can laugh without being

00:40:22.716 --> 00:40:24.160
drunk, or anything.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.750
SPEAKER 1: Hey, that's great.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.800
That just brings me
onto another question.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.600
Yesterday, you
played "Sunflower."

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.790
Is it called "Sunflower?"

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:36.830
It's from the
movie, "Sunflower."

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:37.095
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:37.095 --> 00:40:37.761
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:40:37.761 --> 00:40:39.245
That's a very emotive piece.

00:40:39.245 --> 00:40:40.120
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.369
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:41.369 --> 00:40:44.380
SPEAKER 1: Do you
have a favorite movie

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.880
score, either of you?

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.474
Or is that an area that you'd
like to delve into sometime?

00:40:49.474 --> 00:40:51.390
ANTON JABLOKOV: Actually,
when I watch movies,

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.750
or I'm looking
sometimes for movies,

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:56.536
I just put on the movie, and
I listen to the soundtrack.

00:40:56.536 --> 00:40:58.660
And if the soundtrack is
good, probably the movie's

00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.540
going to be good.

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.830
It's always all connected.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:01.390
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: It is.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.640
ANTON JABLOKOV: So all
the big movies have real--

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.450
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Because the big

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.158
movies will have really
good soundtracks.

00:41:04.158 --> 00:41:06.415
And there will be real
composers working on it.

00:41:06.415 --> 00:41:10.477
And if you put them, you hear
something very different.

00:41:10.477 --> 00:41:11.560
You know that this movie--

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.405
OK.

00:41:12.405 --> 00:41:13.780
ANTON JABLOKOV:
Also, I mean, you

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.140
have the "Godfather" soundtrack.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:15.710
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
"Godfather" [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:17.210
ANTON JABLOKOV:
"Schindler's List"--

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.565
you have so many
movies which have

00:41:19.565 --> 00:41:21.940
great soundtracks, which are
played also at the concerts.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.399
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:41:23.399 --> 00:41:24.940
So do you think
you'll start bringing

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.412
in more songs like "Sunflower"
into your concerts?

00:41:27.412 --> 00:41:28.370
ANTON JABLOKOV: We may.

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:29.160
We already used to play--

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.340
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: We
mainly also did also--

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.620
like, my favorite would
be "Godfather," just even

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.600
the way they connected the
movie with the soundtrack.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.140
I know it's a very old
movie now, at this stage.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.959
But this sort of
thing, musically,

00:41:40.959 --> 00:41:42.750
and you see the scenes
and everything else,

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.734
it really reflects
the whole scene.

00:41:45.734 --> 00:41:46.400
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.480
[INAUDIBLE] So
yeah, good question.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.759
We only have time for one
more audience question.

00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:52.384
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:55.781
I have a question about, like,
the awkward relationships

00:41:55.781 --> 00:41:58.070
you've encountered in
the music business.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:00.827
So like when you decided to
leave your last booking agent,

00:42:00.827 --> 00:42:02.660
or say if you are
approached by a songwriter

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.480
and you don't want to
write with that person,

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.070
has it ever become
really awkward?

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:08.770
Do you have any juicy
stories about it?

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:10.186
ANTON JABLOKOV:
He's actually very

00:42:10.186 --> 00:42:12.256
good in social relationships.

00:42:12.256 --> 00:42:15.440
I sometimes am
much more emotive,

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.640
so I would like to argue
or prove someone wrong.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.180
But he'll always
say, no, leave it.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.184
You can't burn the bridges
and all these things.

00:42:23.184 --> 00:42:23.850
So we actually--

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.433
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV: I never burn
bridges with anyone, directly.

00:42:26.433 --> 00:42:28.207
So I deal with the outside.

00:42:28.207 --> 00:42:29.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:30.769
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:30.769 --> 00:42:32.435
ANTON JABLOKOV:
Actually, all the people

00:42:32.435 --> 00:42:35.090
we worked with, we have a
good relationship, still.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.670
And there are no
problems at all.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.990
SPEAKER 1: So we're
almost out of time.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:42.590
So I'd like to ask
you one more question,

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:46.417
and then we might close
with a little performance.

00:42:46.417 --> 00:42:48.875
I've taken this question from
"The Producer's Perspective."

00:42:48.875 --> 00:42:50.180
I adapted it from there.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.846
It's a great podcast
that I enjoy.

00:42:52.846 --> 00:42:54.390
And I'll ask both of you.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:59.680
So if you could be
granted one wish,

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.500
what would your
wish be to change

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.430
the classical musical scene?

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:11.000
What would you want
to fix or to improve?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.930
Yeah.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.624
Or even, say, the
life of a musician--

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:15.540
if you could have one
wish, something that you

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:15.670
could change there.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:17.378
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
It's very hard to say,

00:43:17.378 --> 00:43:19.566
because it's not
that straightforward.

00:43:19.566 --> 00:43:21.190
For example, classical
music was really

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:25.010
supported back in the day in
the Soviet Union and so on.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:30.070
But again, whether that's a very
correct way, you cannot say.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.660
In this side of the world,
it's actually very commercial.

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.484
You either sell, or
you don't, you know?

00:43:34.484 --> 00:43:35.192
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hm.

00:43:35.192 --> 00:43:36.550
So for it to be more supported.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.090
ANTON JABLOKOV:
[INAUDIBLE],, you know?

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:39.155
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
Both of them have, you

00:43:39.155 --> 00:43:41.660
know-- so it's very hard to
say what we would change.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.981
I think people could
be brought up--

00:43:43.981 --> 00:43:45.980
and that's what we are
trying to do and change--

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:49.130
that we use really
accessible themes

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:53.810
and try to create valuable
classical pieces, or not

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.330
fully classical, but using
the classical technique.

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:58.074
So I think that's what--

00:43:58.074 --> 00:43:59.990
ANTON JABLOKOV: I would
say less competitions,

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.570
like the-- because
classical musicians

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:03.830
they have competitions.

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.350
And I think that's
what destroyed

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:06.710
a little bit the music.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:07.530
VLADIMIR JABLOKOV:
And [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:08.810
ANTON JABLOKOV: When
you play competition,

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:09.605
you have to be perfect.

00:44:09.605 --> 00:44:10.220
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.761
ANTON JABLOKOV: And
it doesn't matter

00:44:11.761 --> 00:44:14.810
if you are musical, sometimes,
or if you are original.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:17.230
Also, my professor, he always
used to say to me, well,

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.230
how you play, I love it.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.730
It's great.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.229
But if you go to a
competition, they

00:44:20.229 --> 00:44:22.000
will kick you from
the first round.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.767
And I don't like this,
because it should

00:44:23.767 --> 00:44:24.850
be interesting for people.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:25.850
It shouldn't be perfect.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.384
We can have robots who
can play it perfectly.

00:44:28.384 --> 00:44:29.550
SPEAKER 1: OK, that's great.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.258
ANTON JABLOKOV: That
would be one thing--

00:44:31.258 --> 00:44:33.380
that people would have
more space to create

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.427
their own interpretation.

00:44:34.427 --> 00:44:35.010
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:35.718
That's brilliant.

00:44:35.718 --> 00:44:36.260
Lovely.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.240
Thank you both, so
much, for being here.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:38.450
ANTON JABLOKOV: Thank you.

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:40.070
SPEAKER 1: And you're
going to play a--

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:41.935
what are you going to
play a little bit for us?

00:44:41.935 --> 00:44:41.953
ANTON JABLOKOV: Yeah.

00:44:41.953 --> 00:44:43.700
Just a very small song by Pink.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.115
This was one of the
trials for the America.

00:44:46.115 --> 00:44:46.990
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:47.489
[LAUGHTER]
