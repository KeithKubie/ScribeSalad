00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.299
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the U.S. Air Force.

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:08.770
A satellite landed a probe on a COMET today,
but it was launched 10 years ago.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:17.680
Why did it take so long to get there?

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.220
The comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is heading
into the inner solar system on its trip around

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.220
the sun.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.140
67P flies around the sun and then out past
Jupiter every 6.45 years.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.629
It was discovered in 1969, and selected for
the Rosetta mission in the early 2000s.

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.069
Rosetta's plan is to learn about the structure
and behavior of comets, but Rosetta was launched

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:46.269
in 2004, and 67P is still out past Mars…

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.670
It’s, at most, a year to get to Mars…
so why launch it so early?

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.670
Because gravity.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.859
When a rocket reaches space, it has to escape
Earth's gravity: the escape velocity from

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.680
Earth's surface is 11.2 km/s -- Mach 33.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.920
Yeah, it's fast.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.390
Once in space, Rosetta will have to travel
at least that fast to begin its massive, parabolic

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.159
orbit on the way to catch a comet.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:20.950
The thing is, even at 11.2 km/s it needs more
power! 67P is traveling at 37.5 km/s!

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.420
As the mass of the fuel increases on Earth,
it is exponentially more difficult to lift

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.619
a rocket to escape velocity…

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.140
So, the most fuel-efficient solution to accelerate
to that speed, as of now, is to perform gravity

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.179
assist maneuvers once in space.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.170
To fling a craft around a planet and take
advantage of its gravity.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.960
So you're flying toward Earth, and gravity
is pulling you down, you're speeding up!!

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.579
You get closer, and closer, and then ZOOM
PAST THE PLANET at astronomical speeds!

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:52.579
YAY!

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.420
But then, the same gravity is pulling… pulling…
pulling… slowing you down...

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.539
Like a biker going downhill and then back
up a hill of the same size!

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.049
The net change at the end of the day would
be zero!!

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.650
But, there's more to it than just the craft
and the gravity.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.050
There's the movement of the whole planet.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.050
The flinging of a craft around a massive celestial
body at JUST the right angle, speeds up the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.690
craft by stealing a bit of energy from the
planet.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.640
For example, when Voyager 2 was flung toward
Saturn in 1979, Jupiter SLOWED by 10 to the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.750
negative 24th km/s... but Voyager GAINED 10
km/s!

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.830
A HUGE gain for Voyager, a tiny imperceptible
loss for Jupiter.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.830
We call it a slingshot.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.210
Rosetta left Earth in 2004, on a regular orbit
until it encountered Earth again almost EXACTLY

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.560
one year later.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.140
Using Earth's gravity, Rosetta flung itself
around Earth and headed for Mars.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.800
In early 2007, Mars' gravity slapped it on
again, on another path toward Earth, where

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.650
our gravity gave it a good smack later in
the same year.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.640
Finally, after a MUCH longer orbit and third
Earth flyby in 2009…

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.140
It settled into giant orbit which brought
us to November of 2014…

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.370
When it FINALLY caught up with 67P.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.990
These gravity assists took a long time, but
allowed the craft to accelerate to 55,000

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.510
km/hour, using only the gravity of planets
and a bit of fuel to make tiny course corrections.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.590
It's not the most direct solution, but it's
efficient, and allowed it to fly past a few

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.590
asteroids on the way.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.840
Now, thanks to the mission team, Rosetta is
orbiting a body with a gravitational pull

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.370
several hundred thousand times weaker than
on Earth.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.460
It's moving at about 1 m/s relative to the
asteroid, or at the speed of walk.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.180
In the end, Rosetta stole energy from two
planets and flung itself around the sun five

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.700
times in the last ten years, but now, thanks
to all that physics and LOTS of math, we landed

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.650
on a comet this morning for the first time
ever in human history.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.350
Stories like this make me think, damn, trying
to land a spacecraft on a moving comet seems

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.350
impossible.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.870
But somehow science is making it happen.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.930
You know who else is good at achieving the
impossible?

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.220
The brave men and women in the United States
Air Force!

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.690
Whether it’s overcoming poverty to become
a nurse and officer or becoming the first

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.930
female Thunderbird pilot, these Airmen are
doing what others once thought was impossible.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.630
So, a big shout out to the U.S. Air Force
for supporting DNews.
