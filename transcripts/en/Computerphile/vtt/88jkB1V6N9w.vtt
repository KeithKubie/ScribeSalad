00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
[Sean]: What steps have you taken to find out about this?

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.300
[Mike]: I, I ran it. On my machine.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.900
Actually that's not quite true.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.360
I ran it on a virtual machine.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.320
So I installed a virtual XP machine, unpatched, from this current patch

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.940
it wasn't connected to the internet, I downloaded

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.500
the WannaCry.exe

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.000
and ran it

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.900
and my files are encrypted

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.480
and it popped up the warning message.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.860
[Sean]: This isn't something the peeps should try at home right?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.900
[Mike]: No I, I would advise against it right.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.680
So there isn't anything inherently scary about the software

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.020
in the sense that if it's not connected to the net, it won't propagate.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.740
And if you don't have anything valuable on your machine

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.220
you aren't gonna lose any files.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.400
But on the other hand,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.920
I'm not running it here

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.860
on the university network

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.560
because I don't want to be the first person to introduce it to Nottingham (laughs)

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.260
So, you know, just on the off chance, right?

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.360
Let's not, let's not open that door.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.040
So where do we start on this mess?

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.320
(laughs)

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.500
[Sean]: What, what is it?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.040
Okay first of all, what's it called?

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.280
[Mike]: So I called it WannaDecryptor

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.720
or Wanna Cryptor

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.660
[Sean]: So WannaCry WannaCryptor...?

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.500
[Mike]: WannaCry WannaCryptor WannaDecryptor WannaDecryptor Two

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.160
As far as I can tell, the source code has Wanna Decryptor in it

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.000
A lot of people shortened this to WannaCry

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.540
And there's a sort of WNCRY extension that it uses for its encrypted files...

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.020
which are, which kinda spell WannaCry so yeah okay

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.720
I'm calling it WannaCryptor

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.720
but I may not mention it by name again

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.700
cause we all know what we're talking about.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.440
It's ransomware right?

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.080
So ransomware is any trojan or worm or virus

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.240
that, in essence, encrypts your files and then try to charge you money to reverse that process.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.940
Without giving it too much credit, for obvious reasons,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.960
it's a fairly smart way of performing crime.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.500
because, if an antivirus is not immediately on the ball,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.400
then, the damage is already done.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.820
And a lot of the time, you won't get the key back unless you pay.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.440
And so you have to then either restore from backup,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.780
which a lot of people don't have,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.200
and... or you have to accept that your files are gone

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.340
or you have to pay.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.240
And so, it's no surprise that the biggest stuff in the news recently

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.520
in terms of attacks

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.300
have been ransomware,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.820
because of the immediate impact it has on standard users.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.040
There are lots and lots of other kinds of malwares

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.720
you know: banking fraud malware and key loggers and things

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.160
and, bot net code, which is also a really big problem

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.660
but perhaps it sees less news

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.340
because it doesn't attack the NHS.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.760
For those of you that don't live in England [UK really]

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.420
you might, you know, not know a huge amount about the NHS.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.340
The National Health Services is our taxpayer funded health service

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.600
right so we pay taxes, then those taxes contributed to health services

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.220
and we all get healthcare.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.640
Perhaps we all need to calm the rhetoric down slightly

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.540
you know, the NHS itself is not under attack,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.560
the nice thing for the media is if

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.640
is if you can have your headline say

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.940
"Attack on health service"

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.360
then you're gonna get a lot of hits.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.120
So that's the first thing thats happened.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.220
In fact, actually only a small subset of healthcare machines have been taken down by this ransomware,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.140
and a lot of it has been precautionary.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.660
So bring down the server, just on the off chance [the ransomware] gets it,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.100
until we can be sure, that nothing the same network has the trojan or the worm on it.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.220
So yeah, it's a big deal.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.900
And it's infected a lot of machines.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.160
But there are a lot of big ransomware out there, right?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.720
like Cryptowall had made millions of dollars for its developers, for example

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.700
so, this isn't the only one, it's not the first, and regrettably, probably won't be the last.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.920
Let's talk a bit about what happened, alright?

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.220
So on Friday,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.120
various machines started being infected by this.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.620
Now, the exact nature of the initial infection, I don't think is known right now

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.060
It might be by the time this video goes out, right, so

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.940
maybe I'll be out of date already, but

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.880
probably, emails, right?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.280
Which makes it essentially a trojan.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.880
Because an email goes out with a spear phising attack, or a phishing attack

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.500
that sort of says "You should click this" for whatever reasons

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.640
and tricks a user into doing it.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.700
Now you don't have to trick many users to get returns on your investment, in some sense,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.560
because once it got infected, that's a lot of money.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.720
This um, trojan, or this worm is a little bit unusual, in that it actually carries a self-replicating payload.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.080
Most ransomware doesn't do this.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.660
Most ransomware, the idea is to email as many people as possible,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.760
some of them, some small subset of them will be tricked into clicking it,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.800
they will be the ones you hope will pay the ransom.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.480
That's the logic of it.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.460
This one, uses an exploit that was first found by the NSA, an exploit of Windows.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.960
So this vulnerability has existed in Windows for quite a while,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.220
it existed in Windows XP, that was around in 2001 and so on.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.900
And it seems to have disappeared sometime around Windows 10, so it was patched in March,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.380
So, we don't know if...

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.960
I think the vulnerability doesn't exist in Windows 10.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.360
[Sean]: So it's patched in March in Windows 7?

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.820
[Mike]: Yes. So for any operating system that Microsoft is currently rolling out patches for

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.280
which is to say Windows 7, I don't think Windows Vista anymore.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.760
There are plenty of copies of Windows rightly or wrongly that still have this vulnerability.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.980
Now this is a vulnerability in the SMB protocol

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.220
which is mainly used for filesharing across networks.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.220
Very common, because you imagine large organisations like to share files

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.700
from a central server to all their smaller machines

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.700
rather than having everyone store all the files all the time.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.500
So, what happens when this worm lands?

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.720
So this worm would start, with an email probably,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.820
or someone would deliver it by a USB, that seems less likely,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.400
but, probably an email.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.620
You only need one person on a network to click on it,

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.320
and they get the ransomware, and then it starts to sniff out on port 445, for other unpatched installations.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.000
So this is a directed exploit, which would be able to run this same code, on the targeted machines,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.580
and then they spread and so on.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.920
And that's why it spread so quickly

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.380
This vulnerability, which was discovered by the NSA, quite a while ago.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.740
5 or 6 years ago, we think. We don't know exactly because they don't tell us.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.500
And rather to tell Microsoft about this exploit, they decided to sit on it,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.720
with the idea, uh, with the idea that they can then use it in their own exploits.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.600
So their exploit kit became EternalBlue.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.680
That's the codename for this particular exploit.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.380
In some sense, no more was heard about it, right?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.440
For a while.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.560
It probably got used,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.140
by government agencies to perform their counter terrorism tasks and so on,

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.820
until they were themselves, hacked, by another group,

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.360
called the Shadow Brokers

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.880
who decided to try and sell some of these tools, and then just released it on the Internet.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.460
So Microsoft patched this vulnerability in March,

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.480
and then in April, the Shadow Brokers released EternalBlue, the code of it, onto the net.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.460
It's only a matter of time before someone put this onto a self-replicating piece of ransomware.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.840
Because the quicker you do it, the more people who are still unpatched that you get and then damage ensues.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.860
The key difference, really, with this, from this ransomware, to the previous ransomware we've seen

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.980
is the fact that it can self-propagate
right?

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.180
Sometimes these things get built into, uh, self-replicating programs

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:57.420
but, in this one, um, this EternalBlue exploit, essentially means that your machine, if it's not patched,

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.840
you don't have to click yes, alright?

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.700
Another machine will upload the payload to it, and it will run it, no questions asked.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.200
And it might, if you're running a server, which has shadow volume copies and things, 
and backups and restores

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.040
it might ask you for a yes-or-no response later in the process

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.860
but, a bit late, you know, after a lot of things have already been encrypted.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:26.680
So, most trojans, if you're very very vigilant about running email attachments, you'll never get them

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.180
because you'd just see "Oh it's a trojan" or "I don't wanna go to that website, it looks malicious"

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.120
And so you don't get them even if you don't have an antivirus.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.920
But if you haven't got this update, you can still get [the ransomware], despite the fact that you haven't done anything.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.080
Apart for perhaps being a bit lazy about your updates...

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.880
Some time over the weekend, obviously lots of researchers are looking into this,

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.840
not... um so I was looking into it and running it purely for interest, right, so I don't, um

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.300
I'm not writing any tools to get rid of it or anything clever.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.380
But there are a lot of researchers, and what they'll do is

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:02.100
they will run this in a virtual machine or a special sort of sandbox where it is isolated, find out what it does,

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.380
and try and work out how they can stop it,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.560
try and work out how they can take the role of the command and control server, for example,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.340
and tell it just to stop, or something like this.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.040
Now, a researcher, MalwareTech,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.840
whose blog is really interesting and we'll link to it in the bottom,

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.340
they basically stumbled upon a killswitch for this

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.780
because they were looking at what it did

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:29.500
and it polled this, it checked for the existence of this unregistered internet address.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:35.820
So it basically says, it did a DNS lookup and says "Who is this? Who has got this internet address?" and no one had it.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.700
So their first response was "So if we registered that internet address,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.480
we'd then get communications from all the installations of this,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.640
and we could sort of track how many people have got this.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.060
It's interesting from a researcher's point of view, we can see how it's spread."

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.300
But in fact, what actually happened within the code was

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.680
if this web address existed, [the ransomware] just stops running.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.580
The hypothesis is that

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.360
it's doing a kind of Volkswagen emissions situation,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.240
where it realises it's running in some kind of lab environment and shuts down.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.960
But, basically, as soon as they registered this web address,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.800
all future installations of WannaCryptor, WannaDecryptor

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.680
shut down immediately upon starting up.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.700
Which obviously was quite a good news.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.380
So inadvertently they saved a lot of people

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.120
a lot of time and effort, and maybe money.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.960
[Sean]: That isn't the end of this story, presumably...

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.140
people have seen that that...
[Mike]: Yeah...

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.860
So there have been multiple versions of this with tweaked settings

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.360
where they ba... probably remov...

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.900
I think they've essentially tried to hex edit out the killswitch, and run it again.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.300
And yes, that's not unexpected, MalwareTech said this was gonna come,

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.780
it's very uh... it's to be expected, because

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.320
the code is not difficult to change to avoid the whole killswitch 
right?

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.100
Obviously their attempt at circumventing some of these researchers' abilities has failed

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.760
and it has inadvertently reduced the impact of the virus, or the worm.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.200
So, they'll just release it again.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.140
And they'll send out another huge bunch of emails.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.740
Now hopefully people are now aware that this exists and people are aggressively updating their systems,

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.160
and it will have its impact.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.600
But some people are bound to get it again, I think China is being hit pretty hard today

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.380
it's going through China at the moment.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.440
So it tends to hit networks and spread about,

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.700
until people realise what's going on and put a stop to it.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.040
Not everyone's got this, alright?
I haven't got it.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.120
You haven't got it,
no one in [University of] Nottingham, as far as we know, have got it.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.660
And that's because these SMB ports are blocked internally by our firewall.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.200
As they're coming in, they're blocked.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.760
So, you...
an infected NHS machine

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.500
can't target a University of Nottingham computer,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.420
because the ports are blocked.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.540
Many of the networks that have been compromised

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.440
are networks where a machine inside the network has been compromised

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.600
and it's spread around the internals of the network.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.060
And the majority of ransomware is a trojan

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.720
in the sense that it masquerades as something else,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.580
and appears on your computer usually through an email attachment.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.180
This one is both a trojan in that sense because that's probably what happened here,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.100
but it's also a worm, in the sense that it can propagate itself out using that exploit.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.360
So this EternalBlue exploit,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.980
already exists, and was known by the NSA for some time,

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.220
it's already been patched, but a lot of people aren't,

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.640
installing updates as vigorously as they should be,

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.260
and also, Microsoft aren't routinely putting out updates for Windows XP

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.540
so, anyone running Windows XP and/or now also Windows Vista and so on

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.480
won't have that update

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.020
because that's not what happens.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.160
Now in an unusual move, Microsoft has pushed an update for Windows XP

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.220
because of the severity of this.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.600
But that's unusual.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.160
If you're running XP, the first thing you should do is turn off your machine

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.400
because you've got no business running XP.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.480
But, you aren't gonna get many updates

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.160
because that's not what Microsoft are doing.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.320
[Sean]: This is like a car that nobody makes parts for anymore...

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.020
[Mike]: It's exactly like that.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.760
In fact, a good analogy I think is...

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.040
So people have been blaming Microsoft for this,

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.300
there's a lot of blame to go around,

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.520
Microsoft shares some of the blame,

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.520
but, in some ways, what's happening is we're all driving around in 1940s Fords,

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.480
and then when we have an accident we're complaining that the airbag didn't go off

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.720
well, there isn't an airbag IN those 1940s Fords, that's why, right?

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.740
So unless you take it to the garage and have one installed, you know?

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.560
It's that kind of principle, so.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.400
Yes, Microsoft wrote an operating system with a bug in, right?

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.180
All operating systems have bugs in, all softwares have bugs in.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.260
They patched it quickly,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.820
they found it, they patched it in March, it's not

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.160
in Windows 10 anyway,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.160
and they've aggressively put out patches for legacy operating systems to try and combat it.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.620
So they've at least taken all the steps they can,

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.620
to solve this.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.500
The problem is that,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.040
big organisations like the NHS,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.120
have legacy softwares, let's say like drivers for scanners,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.360
and you know, MRI machines and so on,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.600
that maybe they bought 10, 20 years ago,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.460
that are still running XP because the software isn't compatible with the modern versions of Windows.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:56.400
That's a whole political issue that I don't, you know, that I don't have all the answers for.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.680
So the CIA leaks, a few months ago,

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.100
showed that the CIA also has, this sort of, shall we say

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.820
a back catalogue of exploits that they keep a hold of.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.900
So the NSA and the CIA will disclose some problems they find,

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.160
but if they find a bug,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.960
a normal security researcher will privately disclose it to the company

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.800
for them to release a patch,

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.480
and then will publicise it later.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.940
Partly for the media purposes, and partly because then it encourages people to install the update.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.300
The NSA and other government agencies don't operate this policy all the time,

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:32.200
because they view some of these exploits as useful for combating terrorism and other criminal activities.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.840
Now that may or may not be the case.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.800
But what's happening in this case,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.920
is, they've allowed themselves to be hacked,

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.880
by another group,

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.660
who has had no ethical concerns in just releasing all of it.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:48.120
So, this actually goes back to our end-to-end encryption talk,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.180
because what I said about introducing a backdoor,

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.060
is introducing a very big point of failure,

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.340
well that's exactly what happened here, alright?

00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:00.560
The NSA didn't tell anyone about this because they  felt they could privately use it for the good of their country,

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.820
and that may have been the case.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.600
But it's not the case anymore, because someone hacked them and released it.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.880
So that's a huge problem when that sort of thing happens.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.900
So, there're already people, I mean Microsoft themselves in their blog,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.360
have mentioned this already,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.100
And Ross Anderson mentioned it in his blog,

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.840
and we'll link both of those in the bottom,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.820
that,

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.320
you know, you can't, they can't wipe their hands of this entirely

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.280
they can, you know, they can say "Well we're doing this to counter terrorism."

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.380
but in some ways, this is also their fault, because it was their exploit being used.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.020
The headline today all said it's a wakeup call.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:38.100
Really, people like Ross Anderson and other security experts have been saying this for years.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.120
This isn't the first time we've noticed that old machines are vulnerable to attacks.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.920
So yeah, maybe it's a wakeup call, but people need to be aggressively installing the latest operating systems

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.020
and updating.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.780
As far as I know, you can't turn off updates on Windows 10.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.500
And, that strikes me as quite a good idea,

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.020
because people WILL turn them off.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.080
"Ah I don't want it to update right now, I'll turn it off and I'll resume it later."

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.180
And that's when they get hit by a piece of ransomware.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.540
So in the future,

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:11.240
the robot chauffeur which will actually drive you to work while you're sitting there, hacking some code.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:18.200
And so, you've then got the technical problems and the business problems of how do you produce software upgrades...
