00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.660
Now, when we're discussing two possible alleles. We realized

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.880
in the last exercise that we can get three

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.710
possible allele combinations. In this case two sydacines, a

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.100
sydacine and a thymine, or two thymine. We might

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.130
just say CC, CT, or TT. Now in genetics

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.610
there's a more traditional way of writing this kind

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.240
of information. Because each allele is technically on a

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.740
different chromosome. We actually separate the two alleles with

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.780
a slash. Because sometimes when we're discussing genetic information,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.170
among geneticists. There's always the need to distinguish, okay

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.550
are we talking about information on the same chromosome,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.100
or on different chromosomes? So as a common way of

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.020
distinguishing this, the practice arose to put a slash

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.750
here. And so that's how we are going to actually

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.010
refer to two different alleles from here on in,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.270
in our class, C/C although I'll probably just CC. Okay

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.830
now there are two very important patterns that have just

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.210
emerged that are really important for us to define. Because

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.200
we are going to keep coming back to them throughout the

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.170
whole of the course. Although we have three possible combinations of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.210
the alleles, there are two specific types of combinations. We

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.720
have the homozygous combination. Meaning that we have the same

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.120
alleles in the pair. So in this case we have

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.770
two cytosines or two thymines. These would be the homozygous conditions.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.820
And we have the heterozygous combination, meaning

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.270
different alleles in the combination. So in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.030
this case, we have one heterozygous option,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.370
the cytosine-thymine pair. So having two alleles

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.990
allows three allelic combinations. Where two of

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.170
them are homozygous and one of them

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.470
is a heterozygous combination. But let's imagine

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.840
for a second just completely hypothetically that there

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.160
was a third allele at this same genetic

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.340
position. Where there's now a guanine or a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.570
G instead of a cytosine or a thymine.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.200
Of all the possible allele combinations that we

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.670
could get out of these three alleles I

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.520
want you to tell me which allelic combinations

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.190
would be considered heterozygous? Go ahead and check

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.010
any and all boxes that you think apply.
