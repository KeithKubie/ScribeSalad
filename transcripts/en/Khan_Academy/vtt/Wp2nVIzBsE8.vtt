00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.150
Here's the second problem
from CK12.org's AP

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.390
statistics FlexBook.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.570
It's an open source
textbook, essentially.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.310
I'm using it essentially to
get some practice on some

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.330
statistics problems.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.770
So here, number 2.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.070
The grades on a statistics
midterm for a high school are

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.420
normally distributed with a
mean of 81 and a standard

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.370
deviation of 6.3.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.220
All right.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.520
Calculate the z-scores for each
of the following exam grades.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.480
Draw and label a sketch
for each example.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.300
We can probably do it all
on the same example.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.310
But the first thing we'd
have to do is just remember

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.750
what is a z-score.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.110
What is a z-score?

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.120
A z-score is literally just
measuring how many standard

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.265
deviations away from the mean?

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.670
Just like that.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.260
So we literally just have to
calculate how many standard

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.040
deviations each of these guys
are from the mean, and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.270
that's their z-scores.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.280
So let me do part a.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.210
So we have 65.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.570
So first we can just figure out
how far is 65 from the mean.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.980
Let me just draw one chart
here that we can use

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.900
the entire time.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.135
So it's just our distribution.

00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:20.030
Let's see.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.050
We have a mean of 81.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.030
That's our mean.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.940
And then a standard
deviation of 6.3.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.550
So our distribution, they're
telling us that it's

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.630
normally distributed.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.670
So I can draw a nice
bell curve here.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.630
They're saying it's normally
distributed, so that's as

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.500
good of a bell curve as
I'm capable of drawing.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.060
This is the mean
right there at 81.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.700
And the standard
deviation is 6.3.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.140
So one standard deviation above
and below is going to be

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.950
6.3 away from that mean.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.400
So if we go 6.3 in the positive
direction, that value right

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.620
there is going to be 87.3.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.680
If we go 6.3 in the
negative direction,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.140
where does that get us?

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.970
What, 74.7?

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.190
Right, if we add 6, it'll
get us to 80.7, and then

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.680
0.3 will get us to 81.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.920
So that's one standard
deviation below and above the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.560
mean, and then you'd add
another 6.3 to go 2 standard

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.590
deviations, so on and so forth.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.890
So that's a drawing of
the distribution itself.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.640
So let's figure out
the z-scores for each

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.110
of these grades.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.400
65 is how far?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.760
65 is maybe going to
be here someplace.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.430
So we first want to say,
well how far is it

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.680
just from our mean?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.140
So the distance is, you just
want to positive number here.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.050
Well actually, you want
a negative number.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.560
Because you want your z-score
to be positive or negative.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.170
Negative would mean to the left
of the mean and positive would

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.090
mean to the right of the mean.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.690
So we say 65 minus 81.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.000
So that's literally
how far away we are.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.750
But we want that in terms
of standard deviations.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.120
So we divide that by the length
or the magnitude of our

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.290
standard deviation.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.290
So 65 minus 81.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.260
Let's see, 81 minus 65 is what?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.480
It is 5 plus 11.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.230
It's 16.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.065
So this is going to be
minus 16 over 6.3.

00:03:26.065 --> 00:03:28.900
We'll take our calculator out.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.060
And let's see, if we have
minus 16 divided by 6.3,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.980
you get minus 2 point--
oh, it's like 54.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.940
Approximately equal
to minus 2.54.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.010
That's the z-score
for a grade of 65.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.840
Pretty straightforward.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.120
Let's do a couple more.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.340
Let's do all of them.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.940
83.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.520
So how is it away
from the mean?

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.040
Well, it's 83 minus 81.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.220
It's two grades above the mean.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.320
But we want it in terms
of standard deviations.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.960
How many standard deviations.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.960
So this was part A.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.310
A was right here.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.300
We were 2.5 standard
deviations below the mean.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.120
So this is part A.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.650
1, 2, and then 0.5.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.830
So this was A right there, 65.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.770
And then part B, 83, 83 is
going to be right here.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.560
A little bit higher,
but right here.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.610
And the z-score here, 83 minus
81 divided by 6.3 will get us--

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.340
let's see, clear
the calculator.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.420
So we have 83 minus 81
is 2 divided by 6.3.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.280
It's 0.32, roughly.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.770
So here we get 0.32.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.520
So 83 is 0.32 standard
deviations above the mean.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.860
And so it would be roughly 1/3
third of the standard deviation

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.685
along the way, right?

00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:57.710
Because this as one whole
standard deviation.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.260
So we're 0.3 of a standard
deviation above the mean.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.900
Choice number C.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.910
Or not choice, part C, I
guess I should call it.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.350
93.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.750
Well, we do the same exercise.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.670
93 is how much above the mean?

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.735
Well, it's 93 minus 81 is 12.

00:05:16.735 --> 00:05:19.170
But we want it in terms
of standard deviations.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.090
So 12 is how many standard
deviations above the mean?

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.230
Well, it's going
to be almost 2.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.680
Let's take the calculator out.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.680
So we get 12 divided by 6.3.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.790
It's 1.9 standard deviations.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.510
Its z-score is 1.9.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.020
Which means it's 1.9 standard
deviations above the mean.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.660
So the mean is 81, we go one
whole standard deviation, and

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.900
then 0.9 standard deviations,
and that's where a score of

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.840
93 would lie, right there.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.450
Its z-score is 1.9.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.450
And all that means is
1.9 standard deviations

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.170
above the mean.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.800
Let's do the last one.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.990
I'll do it in magenta.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.670
D, part D.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.700
A score of 100.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.470
We don't even need
the problem anymore.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.220
A score of 100.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.920
Well, same thing.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.190
We figure out how far is 100
above the mean-- remember, the

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.200
mean was 81-- and we divide
that by the length or the size

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.260
or the magnitude of our
standard deviation.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.600
So 100 minus 81 is
equal to 19 over 6.3.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.140
So it's going to be a little
over 3 standard deviations.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.200
And in the next problem we'll
see what does that imply in

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.940
terms of the probability of
that actually occurring.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.750
But if we just want to figure
out the z-score, 19 divided

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.670
by 6.3 is equal to 3.01.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.290
So it's very close.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.690
3.02, really, if
I were to round.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.040
So it's very close to 3.02.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.500
Its z-score is 3.02, or a grade
of 100 is 3.02 standard

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.830
deviations above the mean.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.800
So remember, this was the
mean right here at 81.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.870
We go 1 standard deviation
above the mean, 2 standard

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.030
deviations above the mean, the
third standard deviation above

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.030
the mean is right there.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.980
So we're sitting right
there on our chart.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.980
A little bit above that, 3.02
standard deviations above

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.860
the mean, that's where
a score of 100 will be.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.560
And you can see the
probability, the height of

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.390
this-- that's what the chart
tells us-- it's actually a

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.500
very low probability.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.830
Actually, not just a very
low probability of getting

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.000
something higher than that.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.460
Because as we learned before,
in a probably density function,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.730
if this is a continuous, not a
discreet, the probability of

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.650
getting exactly that is 0,
if this wasn't discrete.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.050
But since this is scores
on a test, we know that

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.010
it's actually a discrete
probability function.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.850
But the probability is low of
getting higher than that,

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.760
because you can see where
we sit on the bell curve.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.300
Well anyway, hopefully this at
least clarified how to solve

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.635
for z-scores, which is pretty
straightforward mathematically.

00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:44.440
And in the next video,
we'll interpret z-scores

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.190
and probabilities
a little bit more.
