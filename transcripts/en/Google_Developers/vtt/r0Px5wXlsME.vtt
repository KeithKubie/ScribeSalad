TIMOTHY JORDAN: Menu items.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.930
When you insert a timeline card
for the user, you can

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.250
also add menu items.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.210
Now, these menu items can be
system actions such as reply

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.140
or read aloud, and they can also
be custom, which can be

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.020
whatever you want.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.670
You get to name them and
choose what they do.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.700
Now, it looks a little
bit like this encode.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.130
When you do an insert post
request for the timeline card,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.470
you'll include your text,
your HTML, or whatever.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.860
And then you'll also add
these menu items.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.340
Now, what I have here
is a system menu

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.230
item for read aloud.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.070
All you've got to do is name it,
and that item is going to

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.900
show up on the user's
timeline.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.970
And when they tap on that
option, they'll get the text

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.720
read aloud to them.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.250
If you want to do a custom menu
item, you have to add a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.000
little bit more information.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.540
In this case, I've got a custom
menu item for love.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.370
I've included a display name
of love, and I've also

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.920
included an icon URL.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.940
Now, when the user sees this
menu item, they're going to

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.300
tap on it, of course, because
who doesn't love love?

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.160
And then you're going to get a
notification saying that the

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.310
user has selected
this menu item.
