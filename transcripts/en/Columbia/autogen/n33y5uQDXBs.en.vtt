in the American context it's taken for

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030
in the American context it's taken for
 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.610
in the American context it's taken for
granted that that line should exist in

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620
granted that that line should exist in
 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.470

other countries it may not be so and it

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480
other countries it may not be so and it
 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.870
other countries it may not be so and it
may actually be changing here too and so

may actually be changing here too and so
I hope we can talk about what some of

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860
I hope we can talk about what some of
 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.270

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720
trade about the equity and they found
 

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.180
trade about the equity and they found
that there was a lot of validity in it

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:12.190
that there was a lot of validity in it
 

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.329
that there was a lot of validity in it
and so that in a way that protest

00:39:15.329 --> 00:39:15.339
and so that in a way that protest
 

00:39:15.339 --> 00:39:17.309
and so that in a way that protest
movement I thought was very effective

00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:17.319
movement I thought was very effective
 

00:39:17.319 --> 00:39:18.930
movement I thought was very effective
because

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:18.940
because
 

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:23.099
because
it brought to a general consciousness an

00:39:23.099 --> 00:39:23.109
it brought to a general consciousness an
 

00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:26.040
it brought to a general consciousness an
awareness that something was wrong with

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:26.050
awareness that something was wrong with
 

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.630
awareness that something was wrong with
the way our political leaders were

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640
the way our political leaders were
 

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.839
the way our political leaders were
managing the globalization process and

00:39:32.839 --> 00:39:32.849
managing the globalization process and
 

00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:42.200
managing the globalization process and
over the ensuing 1213 years many of the

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:42.210
over the ensuing 1213 years many of the
 

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:46.319
over the ensuing 1213 years many of the
complaints have not only been validated

00:39:46.319 --> 00:39:46.329
complaints have not only been validated
 

00:39:46.329 --> 00:39:48.510
complaints have not only been validated
but there have actually been in some

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520
but there have actually been in some
 

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.609
but there have actually been in some
areas change less than you would have

00:39:50.609 --> 00:39:50.619
areas change less than you would have
 

00:39:50.619 --> 00:39:52.770
areas change less than you would have
hope but at least some areas let me just

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:52.780
hope but at least some areas let me just
 

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:58.130
hope but at least some areas let me just
give you a couple examples one of the

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:58.140
give you a couple examples one of the
 

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:03.210
give you a couple examples one of the
strands of the protest movement was the

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:03.220
strands of the protest movement was the
 

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.829
strands of the protest movement was the
anti-globalization was that the trade

00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839
anti-globalization was that the trade
 

00:40:04.839 --> 00:40:07.290
anti-globalization was that the trade
agreements were unfair to developing

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:07.300
agreements were unfair to developing
 

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:13.170
agreements were unfair to developing
countries and so the eventual next round

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:13.180
countries and so the eventual next round
 

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.620
countries and so the eventual next round
a trade agreement nothing came out of

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:16.630
a trade agreement nothing came out of
 

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:20.900
a trade agreement nothing came out of
the Seattle meeting in in December of 2

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:20.910
the Seattle meeting in in December of 2
 

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:30.150
the Seattle meeting in in December of 2
2000 1999 but after the 911 there was a

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160
2000 1999 but after the 911 there was a
 

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:35.790
2000 1999 but after the 911 there was a
moment of a global solidarity Mike say

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:35.800
moment of a global solidarity Mike say
 

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.900
moment of a global solidarity Mike say
and a new round of trade talks was begun

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:39.910
and a new round of trade talks was begun
 

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:44.339
and a new round of trade talks was begun
in November of 2011 and that round was

00:40:44.339 --> 00:40:44.349
in November of 2011 and that round was
 

00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:46.950
in November of 2011 and that round was
called a development or around to try to

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960
called a development or around to try to
 

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.410
called a development or around to try to
rectify the imbalances of the previous

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:49.420
rectify the imbalances of the previous
 

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.599
rectify the imbalances of the previous
one in that in a sense the the protest

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:51.609
one in that in a sense the the protest
 

00:40:51.609 --> 00:40:54.900
one in that in a sense the the protest
movement had one in early victory it was

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:54.910
movement had one in early victory it was
 

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:57.180
movement had one in early victory it was
a half victory because in ensuing 10

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:57.190
a half victory because in ensuing 10
 

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:00.390
a half victory because in ensuing 10
years nothing was done but at least the

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400
years nothing was done but at least the
 

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.510
years nothing was done but at least the
the notion had been recognized that

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520
the notion had been recognized that
 

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.829
the notion had been recognized that
previous trade agreements have been

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839
previous trade agreements have been
 

00:41:04.839 --> 00:41:08.670
previous trade agreements have been
unfair and and and so I think that was a

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680
unfair and and and so I think that was a
 

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:14.240
unfair and and and so I think that was a
real victory for that protest movement

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:14.250
 
 

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:19.079
 
other issues that were raised were that

00:41:19.079 --> 00:41:19.089
other issues that were raised were that
 

00:41:19.089 --> 00:41:23.220
other issues that were raised were that
the global governance system was flawed

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:23.230
the global governance system was flawed
 

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:28.890
the global governance system was flawed
and that issue

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:28.900
and that issue
 

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:37.290
and that issue
got crystallized in a way in November of

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:37.300
got crystallized in a way in November of
 

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:42.030
got crystallized in a way in November of
2008 in the midst of the recession of

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040
2008 in the midst of the recession of
 

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.970
2008 in the midst of the recession of
2008 after Lehman Brothers collapsed and

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:44.980
2008 after Lehman Brothers collapsed and
 

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:49.050
2008 after Lehman Brothers collapsed and
the world went from the g8 to the g20

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:49.060
the world went from the g8 to the g20
 

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.100
the world went from the g8 to the g20
recognizing that you could not have

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:51.110
recognizing that you could not have
 

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.270
recognizing that you could not have
global decision-making without

global decision-making without
 

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.260
global decision-making without
representatives from the emerging

representatives from the emerging
 

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.690
representatives from the emerging
markets at least the larger merging

meetings there was an agreement to

meetings there was an agreement to
 

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:09.340
meetings there was an agreement to
change the governance of the World Bank

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:09.350
change the governance of the World Bank
 

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:13.300
change the governance of the World Bank
and IMF there was an agreement we

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:13.310
and IMF there was an agreement we
 

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:16.120
and IMF there was an agreement we
thought that the next leader the IMF and

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:16.130
thought that the next leader the IMF and
 

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.760
thought that the next leader the IMF and
the World Bank would be chosen in a

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:18.770
the World Bank would be chosen in a
 

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.670
the World Bank would be chosen in a
maritime meritocratic way and almost

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680
maritime meritocratic way and almost
 

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.280
maritime meritocratic way and almost
surely not be from the United States in

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:24.290
surely not be from the United States in
 

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:27.640
surely not be from the United States in
Europe well the United States agreed to

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:27.650
Europe well the United States agreed to
 

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.720
Europe well the United States agreed to
it but then reneged on that agreement as

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:30.730
it but then reneged on that agreement as
 

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:34.510
it but then reneged on that agreement as
reneged on the development round

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:34.520
reneged on the development round
 

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.120
reneged on the development round
agreement and right now there's a lot of

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:37.130
agreement and right now there's a lot of
 

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:38.710
agreement and right now there's a lot of
discussion about who will be the next

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720
discussion about who will be the next
 

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.500
discussion about who will be the next
head of the World Bank and whether the

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:41.510
head of the World Bank and whether the
 

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:43.540
head of the World Bank and whether the
United States is going to again insists

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:43.550
United States is going to again insists
 

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:48.310
United States is going to again insists
that it to be an American so but I think

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:48.320
that it to be an American so but I think
 

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.470
that it to be an American so but I think
the the the point I want to make is the

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480
the the the point I want to make is the
 

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.140
the the the point I want to make is the
Proteas protest movements that that

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:53.150
Proteas protest movements that that
 

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:57.330
Proteas protest movements that that
protest movement was very successful in

00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:57.340
protest movement was very successful in
 

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:02.170
protest movement was very successful in
bringing consciousness of a serious a

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:02.180
bringing consciousness of a serious a
 

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.640
bringing consciousness of a serious a
set of things that was wrong with

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:03.650
set of things that was wrong with
 

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:06.160
set of things that was wrong with
globalization and really has begun a

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:06.170
globalization and really has begun a
 

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:09.070
globalization and really has begun a
process of reform that's slow but I

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:09.080
process of reform that's slow but I
 

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.800
process of reform that's slow but I
think is in many ways almost surely

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:11.810
think is in many ways almost surely
 

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:19.530
think is in many ways almost surely
irreversible well the protest movements

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:19.540
irreversible well the protest movements
 

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:25.300
irreversible well the protest movements
protest movement that began with the

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:25.310
protest movement that began with the
 

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.300
protest movement that began with the
protests the Arab Spring the pros test

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:28.310
protests the Arab Spring the pros test
 

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:37.460
protests the Arab Spring the pros test
in Tunisia then Egypt and then

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:37.470
in Tunisia then Egypt and then
 

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:41.839
in Tunisia then Egypt and then
that moved all around the world I think

00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:41.849
that moved all around the world I think
 

00:43:41.849 --> 00:43:47.050
that moved all around the world I think
it has similarly been criticized for not

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:47.060
it has similarly been criticized for not
 

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:52.960
it has similarly been criticized for not
having an agenda but I think it has

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:52.970
having an agenda but I think it has
 

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:59.089
having an agenda but I think it has
succeeded in bringing to the fore an

00:43:59.089 --> 00:43:59.099
succeeded in bringing to the fore an
 

00:43:59.099 --> 00:44:03.220
succeeded in bringing to the fore an
awareness that some things are wrong and

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:03.230
awareness that some things are wrong and
 

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:06.440
awareness that some things are wrong and
that I think is really the function of

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:06.450
that I think is really the function of
 

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:08.870
that I think is really the function of
these protest movements I think the

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880
these protest movements I think the
 

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.859
these protest movements I think the
press coverage in a way has not been as

00:44:12.859 --> 00:44:12.869
press coverage in a way has not been as
 

00:44:12.869 --> 00:44:15.099
press coverage in a way has not been as
quite as good as it was during the

00:44:15.099 --> 00:44:15.109
quite as good as it was during the
 

00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:18.530
quite as good as it was during the
globalization protest a decade ago and

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.540
globalization protest a decade ago and
 

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:24.109
globalization protest a decade ago and
I'll explain what I mean by that the in

00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119
I'll explain what I mean by that the in
 

00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:27.560
I'll explain what I mean by that the in
the case of the the globalization

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:27.570
the case of the the globalization
 

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.109
the case of the the globalization
protests as I said before there were a

00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119
protests as I said before there were a
 

00:44:30.119 --> 00:44:33.140
protests as I said before there were a
large number of allegations about what

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:33.150
large number of allegations about what
 

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:35.150
large number of allegations about what
was wrong with globalization and the

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160
was wrong with globalization and the
 

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.310
was wrong with globalization and the
press looked at those allegation and out

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:37.320
press looked at those allegation and out
 

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.500
press looked at those allegation and out
of that there came a broad consensus

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:39.510
of that there came a broad consensus
 

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.020
of that there came a broad consensus
about a number of things that were wrong

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:42.030
about a number of things that were wrong
 

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.770
about a number of things that were wrong
and those are things that have since

have been that that have been felt have
 

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.540
have been that that have been felt have
been long-standing and then why do they

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:05.550
been long-standing and then why do they
 

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:09.620
been long-standing and then why do they
emerge at that particular time and

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:09.630
emerge at that particular time and
 

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:13.800

of the Western countries seemed in many
ways similar to some of the protests in

Spring so let me just very briefly

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:43.890
Spring so let me just very briefly
 

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:48.360
Spring so let me just very briefly
suggest a couple of the answers to these

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:48.370
suggest a couple of the answers to these
 

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:53.100
suggest a couple of the answers to these
questions and I think or perhaps they

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:53.110
questions and I think or perhaps they
 

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.710
questions and I think or perhaps they
haven't gotten as much attention in the

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:55.720
haven't gotten as much attention in the
 

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.640
haven't gotten as much attention in the
press they should have first I think

00:46:59.640 --> 00:46:59.650
press they should have first I think
 

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:03.380
press they should have first I think
they're one of the reasons that the

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:03.390
they're one of the reasons that the
 

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:07.350
they're one of the reasons that the
protests have emerged in Western

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:07.360
protests have emerged in Western
 

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.500

democracies why kinetic stakes in Spain
 

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:13.380
democracies why kinetic stakes in Spain

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:13.390
is that originally there was hope that
 

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:16.590
is that originally there was hope that
the political system was respond to the

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:16.600
the political system was respond to the
 

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.120
the political system was respond to the
economic problems but they didn't and

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:20.130
economic problems but they didn't and
 

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:22.980
economic problems but they didn't and
there was a sense that of

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:22.990
there was a sense that of
 

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:25.950
there was a sense that of
disillusionment to a little bit not as

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:25.960
disillusionment to a little bit not as
 

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.260
disillusionment to a little bit not as
bad perhaps as in the caucuses but still

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:28.270
bad perhaps as in the caucuses but still
 

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:31.020
bad perhaps as in the caucuses but still
a sense of disillusionment at the

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:31.030
a sense of disillusionment at the
 

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:34.710
a sense of disillusionment at the
political system that the bankers in the

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720
political system that the bankers in the
 

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.450
political system that the bankers in the
United States have brought on the crisis

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:36.460
United States have brought on the crisis
 

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.980
United States have brought on the crisis
and yet they were the only ones who were

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:37.990
and yet they were the only ones who were
 

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:41.130
and yet they were the only ones who were
doing well three-fourths of Americans

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:41.140
doing well three-fourths of Americans
 

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:45.270
doing well three-fourths of Americans
wanted more profound banking regulation

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280
wanted more profound banking regulation
 

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:49.320
wanted more profound banking regulation
reform than we got and we sort of had a

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:49.330
reform than we got and we sort of had a
 

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:51.750
reform than we got and we sort of had a
balance between ten banks and 200

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760
balance between ten banks and 200
 

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.910
balance between ten banks and 200
million Americans and that was an even

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920
million Americans and that was an even
 

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.220
million Americans and that was an even
balance between the 10 and the 200

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:56.230
balance between the 10 and the 200
 

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:59.400
balance between the 10 and the 200
million so there was a sense in an

00:47:59.400 --> 00:47:59.410
million so there was a sense in an
 

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.109
million so there was a sense in an
understandable sinks

00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119
understandable sinks
 

00:48:01.119 --> 00:48:05.730
understandable sinks
that that the political system had

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:05.740
that that the political system had
 

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:08.579
that that the political system had
failed not obviously as badly as in

failed not obviously as badly as in
 

00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:13.789
failed not obviously as badly as in
Tunisia or Egypt but still it had failed

00:48:13.789 --> 00:48:13.799
 
 

00:48:13.799 --> 00:48:19.620
 
secondly one of the things i think that

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:19.630
secondly one of the things i think that
 

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:24.059
secondly one of the things i think that

was not covered as a clearly say in the
 

00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:26.609

been a lot of economic problems their
 

00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:31.499
been a lot of economic problems their
economic problems of many other

00:48:31.499 --> 00:48:31.509
economic problems of many other
 

00:48:31.509 --> 00:48:33.420
economic problems of many other
countries around the world but there was

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:33.430
countries around the world but there was
 

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:35.309
countries around the world but there was
a sense that the there was something

00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:35.319
a sense that the there was something
 

00:48:35.319 --> 00:48:39.180
a sense that the there was something
deeply unfair about the way society and

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:39.190
deeply unfair about the way society and
 

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:42.960
deeply unfair about the way society and
the economy were functioning it wasn't

the economy were functioning it wasn't
 

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:44.220
the economy were functioning it wasn't
just that there were twenty-five

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:44.230
just that there were twenty-five
 

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:46.079
just that there were twenty-five
twenty-five thirty percent unemployment

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:46.089
twenty-five thirty percent unemployment
 

00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:49.079
twenty-five thirty percent unemployment
or even higher among the youth but those

00:48:49.079 --> 00:48:49.089
or even higher among the youth but those
 

00:48:49.089 --> 00:48:52.019
or even higher among the youth but those
who got jobs were those who were

00:48:52.019 --> 00:48:52.029
who got jobs were those who were
 

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:53.549
who got jobs were those who were
politically connected and politically

00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559
politically connected and politically
 

00:48:53.559 --> 00:48:55.230

connected to a very corrupt political
 

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.730
connected to a very corrupt political
system so those who work tired played by

00:48:59.730 --> 00:48:59.740

who got the jobs and this notion of
 

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.890
who got the jobs and this notion of
fairness is I think a very deeply seated

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:16.900
fairness is I think a very deeply seated
 

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.259
fairness is I think a very deeply seated
notion and a lot of research in

00:49:19.259 --> 00:49:19.269
notion and a lot of research in
 

00:49:19.269 --> 00:49:21.450
notion and a lot of research in
economics that have supported the view

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:21.460
economics that have supported the view
 

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.609
economics that have supported the view
that this is a people feel very strongly

00:49:23.609 --> 00:49:23.619
that this is a people feel very strongly
 

00:49:23.619 --> 00:49:25.410
that this is a people feel very strongly

about fairness anybody who has children
 

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.630
about fairness anybody who has children
know that they that something they care

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640
know that they that something they care
 

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.739
know that they that something they care
about very very intensely and it was the

00:49:31.739 --> 00:49:31.749
about very very intensely and it was the
 

00:49:31.749 --> 00:49:35.549
about very very intensely and it was the
failure of the system to be fair that

00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559
failure of the system to be fair that
 

00:49:35.559 --> 00:49:38.910
failure of the system to be fair that
really brought out the protest in

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:38.920
really brought out the protest in
 

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.989
really brought out the protest in
Tunisia it wasn't true in all the

00:49:42.989 --> 00:49:42.999
Tunisia it wasn't true in all the
 

00:49:42.999 --> 00:49:44.910
Tunisia it wasn't true in all the
countries but I think it was that

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920
countries but I think it was that
 

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.499
countries but I think it was that
element that was very strong in the

protesters in Moscow
 

00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:52.980
protesters in Moscow
well I would just say a couple things

00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:52.990
well I would just say a couple things
 

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:57.570
well I would just say a couple things
first of all I think that the role the

00:58:57.570 --> 00:58:57.580
first of all I think that the role the
 

00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.010
first of all I think that the role the
role of the journalism covering descent

00:58:59.010 --> 00:58:59.020
role of the journalism covering descent
 

00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.210
role of the journalism covering descent
is markedly different if you are a

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:00.220
is markedly different if you are a
 

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.210
is markedly different if you are a
domestic journalist like my fellow

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:03.220
domestic journalist like my fellow
 

00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.410
domestic journalist like my fellow
panelist or if your foreign

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:04.420
panelist or if your foreign
 

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:07.500
panelist or if your foreign
correspondent like I was the domestic

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:07.510
correspondent like I was the domestic
 

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:09.720
correspondent like I was the domestic
reporters of course are part of the very

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:09.730
reporters of course are part of the very
 

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:11.790
reporters of course are part of the very
fabric of what they're covering they've

00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:11.800
fabric of what they're covering they've
 

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.460
fabric of what they're covering they've
experienced it they may have come under

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:14.470
experienced it they may have come under
 

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:17.160
experienced it they may have come under
pressure whether it's intense pressure

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:17.170
pressure whether it's intense pressure
 

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:19.920
pressure whether it's intense pressure
or kind of a softer pressure as I have

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:19.930
or kind of a softer pressure as I have
 

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:23.490
or kind of a softer pressure as I have
often in Russia and so their

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:23.500
often in Russia and so their
 

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:26.130
often in Russia and so their
relationship to these topics is I think

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:26.140
relationship to these topics is I think
 

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:28.530
relationship to these topics is I think
much different than what we were writing

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:28.540
much different than what we were writing
 

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.090
much different than what we were writing
about them and I think a lot of the

00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:30.100
about them and I think a lot of the
 

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.330
about them and I think a lot of the
grievances that were aired in the last

00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:33.340
grievances that were aired in the last
 

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.850
grievances that were aired in the last
few months in Russia since the December

00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:35.860
few months in Russia since the December
 

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.770
few months in Russia since the December
parliamentary elections were things that

parliamentary elections were things that

he reported on those topics I don't
 

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:49.860
he reported on those topics I don't
think those issues were foreign pardon

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:49.870
