1
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.740
Okay,
I'd like to begin welcome back.
It is good to see you all.
Uh,

2
00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:10.630
if a bit startling.
I don't know where those two weeks went.
Um,
so tell me,

3
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.660
I asked you to read blood Meridian over break.
Um,

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.050
was this a happy spring break task for you?

5
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.540
Was it good beach reading as I promised?
No,
no.

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.310
Um,
I'd like,

7
00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:28.690
before I begin my lecture today just to hear a little bit from you,

8
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.720
just so that I know what you're thinking about as I,

9
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.740
as I talked to you about this book,
um,
who liked this novel.

10
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.220
Okay,
good.
Maybe a half of you.
Um,
someone tell me why they liked it.

11
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.063
Someone,
someone somewhere.

12
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.810
<v 1>Tell me why they liked it.</v>

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.730
<v 0>Okay.
Now you're getting all quiet.
Tell cause someone can,</v>

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.520
can tell me one sentence why you like this novel.

15
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.810
<v 1>Yes,
thank you.
Judges.</v>

16
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.390
<v 0>You like how creepy the judges.
It is impressive how creepy he is.
Yes.</v>

17
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.980
Okay,
why else?
Yes,

18
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.840
<v 1>I should like how quickly some of the atrocities happening in this passage where</v>

19
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:15.810
it is [inaudible]

20
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.690
<v 0>and you liked that.
That was good.
Yeah,</v>

21
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.170
it certainly is a kind of virtuosic a representation of violence.

22
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.970
Yes,
absolutely.
What did it remind you of?
Well,
yes.
Yeah,

23
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.710
<v 1>yeah.</v>

24
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.130
<v 0>Yeah.
The ending is very strange and we'll talk about that.</v>

25
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.990
<v 1>Well,
we'll talk about that.
What else?
Yes,
I liked it.</v>

26
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.240
<v 0>It read like a nightmare.
What does that</v>

27
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.860
<v 1>me taking it.
It felt like a magnum.
Jerry's sort of jumble.</v>

28
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:48.160
Then you can very sensory.

29
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.640
<v 0>Yeah.
It is very sensory.
You know,</v>

30
00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:56.080
this prose concentrate so much on the material of the world.

31
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.830
Absolutely.
And it does have that,
um,

32
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.550
feeling of drawing you into its world very completely.

33
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.500
I think also that sense of nightmarish snus is heightened by the fact that the

34
00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:12.280
plot is not very strong in this novel.

35
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.540
That's not what's driving this novel.
You're laughing.
Why do you laugh?

36
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.460
What is,
why do you laugh

37
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.120
<v 1>about that?
About the plot?
Yes.</v>

38
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.830
<v 0>You're still smiling from the laughter.
So I'm gonna ask you,</v>

39
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.110
<v 2>um,
just because like,
yes,
that is true,</v>

40
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:33.800
that part of the reason that I found it difficult to continue reading.
Uh Huh.

41
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.513
You know,

42
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.180
just maybe you'd be interested by the,

43
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.210
I guess the drive,
sort of emotionless way of presenting violence.
Do you know,

44
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.300
it's sort of interesting,
but the fact that there wasn't,

45
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.990
they didn't seem to be like a point or like a place that they're going,

46
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.960
it made it really hard to not just like be like,
oh,

47
00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:59.060
this is going to be disgusting.
Like switch.

48
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.790
<v 0>Yeah,
it does.
It can,
it can produce this,</v>

49
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.850
this aversion in the,
in readers.
How many had,

50
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.980
were averse to this novelty?
Okay.
A few of you at least.
Yeah.

51
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:16.360
I think when I first tried to read this novel,
I failed twice.

52
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.410
I'm a sensitive soul.
Um,

53
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.540
so I failed twice to read this novel because of its violence and then I

54
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.433
persevered.

55
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.310
But it can get actually kind of boring sometimes I think because of the plot.

56
00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:33.311
Lessness so unless you're really interested in how the story's being told in

57
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:37.800
that language,
it can be repetitive and,

58
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.240
and can numb you as a reader.

59
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:45.241
I think these are all aspects of the novel that I will try to account for over

60
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:50.800
the course of my two lectures.
Uh,
today and on Wednesday.

61
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.020
Um,
there are two other things I'm going to do in these two lectures.

62
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.560
One is today to think hard about what it means to track illusions in a novel.

63
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.930
So that's going to be one thing that I do today.

64
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.730
I Ellucian's appear in most of the things that we read.
Dare I say all of them,

65
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.900
but one never quite knows what to do with them once you have identified them.

66
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.281
Now,

67
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:26.281
the sense of literature as an art with a history depends on our being able to do

68
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.120
something without allusions or to have something to say about them.

69
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.240
What does it mean that one novel speaks to a,

70
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.200
a novel or a poem or another kind of writing from the past?

71
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.240
How are we to make sense of that in the evolution of the art form?

72
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.290
This is a foundation of what English literary study looks like pretty much at

73
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:55.270
any university,
at any university.
If you're an English major,

74
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:59.020
you're asked to study a historical range of texts.

75
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.160
You're asked to master in some portion or to some extent,

76
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.520
the literary tradition in English.

77
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.520
What does it mean that we're asked to do that?

78
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.910
Mccarthy Cormac Mccarthy's novel gives us the opportunity to take a case study.

79
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.000
What does it mean in this day,

80
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.110
in this time for this writer to be writing in a tradition.

81
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.231
So I'll,

82
00:05:25.231 --> 00:05:29.710
illusion is one thing I'll focus on that's of general interest in literary

83
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:30.544
studies.

84
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.100
The second thing in the second lecture that I will focus on is what to do with

85
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:36.934
detail,

86
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.330
what to do with that odd detail that you notice in the novel.

87
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.860
It could be anything.

88
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.060
Is there a way of making an argument that will radiate out from that detail into

89
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:56.750
some more holistic understanding of a novel?
My second lecture,

90
00:05:56.751 --> 00:06:01.250
it will a demonstration of that and an argument for that as a literary technique

91
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.840
and I hope that this will be useful to you in writing the next paper,

92
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:08.720
which will be coming up fairly shortly.

93
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.780
So I want to begin then with this quotation from Cormac McCarthy.

94
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:18.590
This was his first interview,
1992.
Um,

95
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.420
many of you probably know,
he's gotten a lot,

96
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.180
a lot more press since Oprah's book club.
Chose his latest novel the road.

97
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.110
Um,
he's,
he's sort of been out and about.
He gave her an interview.
Uh,

98
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.810
he's given an interview,
uh,
since then for a magazine before that.

99
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:40.811
He was a very reclusive writer and he had been writing since the late sixties

100
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:45.650
and by 1992 up until that point,
he had refused all interviews.

101
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.790
He usually refused readings even when he had zero money.

102
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:54.380
He lived out of hotel rooms.
Uh,
even when he was married and had a son,

103
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.090
uh,
when he was a young man,
he's on his third marriage now.
Um,

104
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.810
he would,

105
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.590
he would turn down invitations to read even when they were down to like their

106
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:08.150
last dollar.
His Ex wife tells some amusing stories about this.
Uh,
they'd,

107
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.980
he'd get an invitation to read.

108
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.180
He turned it down and they'd eat beans for another night.
So that's her,

109
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.450
her take on what that life was like.
Um,

110
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.030
he says in this interview,

111
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:24.140
the ugly fact is books are made out of books.

112
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.120
The novel depends for its life on the novels that have been written.

113
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.150
So this is my invitation to take seriously illusion in blood meridian.

114
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.240
Did anybody,
uh,

115
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.420
on their own recognize some of the sources of blood meridian?

116
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.020
Did you notice any illusions?
Yes.

117
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.433
<v 1>Uh Huh.</v>

118
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.990
<v 0>Yes.
Absolutely.
Yeah.</v>

119
00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:00.620
The oral tradition is very powerful and McCarthy's writing the sound of the

120
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:03.830
prose is very important to him.
Yeah.
What else?
Yes.

121
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.720
<v 1>Coming up,
we're going down.
There's a lot of value with the Odyssey.</v>

122
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.200
<v 0>Yeah.
A lot of that cosmic imagery.</v>

123
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:21.830
I think he does take from the great epics of our language.
Yes.

124
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.560
What else?
What else did you notice?

125
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.353
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

126
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.880
<v 0>yeah,
absolutely.</v>

127
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:38.390
The Bible is peppered throughout this and I'm going to have a lot to say about

128
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:42.560
that,
uh,
some to say about it today,
but I have a whole argument about that,

129
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.800
that I'll get to on Wednesday.
Yeah,
absolutely.
What else?

130
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:49.400
Anything else you noticed?
Well,

131
00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:53.450
I'm going to start actually a little bit more,
uh,

132
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.670
a little bit closer to home in the American tradition.

133
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.440
I'm going to start with Moby Dick.

134
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:02.940
This is my lineup of texts that I'm going to use today to talk about blood

135
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:05.310
Meridian.
So I want to start with Moby Dick.

136
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.520
This is probably the single most important book for Mccarthy beside the Bible as

137
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.560
a source for both language,
uh,

138
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.530
character ideas,
moral questions,
all kinds of things come from Moby Dick.

139
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.130
And if you want to begin in the,
in the easiest way,

140
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.320
the first thing is to think about a hub.

141
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.030
A hub is known for his motto,
Maniacal Evil,

142
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.160
his evil quest to take on the white whale

143
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.890
as a character who is loquacious,

144
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.310
charismatic,
threatening,
violent.

145
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.320
He's very much a model for judge Holden.
So in that simple,

146
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.520
general way,
McCarthy owes a debt to Moby Dick.

147
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.040
There are many specific ways that this novel,
Oh,
is a debt,

148
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.080
um,
to Moby Dick.

149
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:09.270
One that I'll just point out is from the prophet chapter in Moby Dick.

150
00:10:09.271 --> 00:10:12.480
That's chapter 19.
If you've read the novel,
uh,

151
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:17.481
you can recall that before ish my l and quick wig get on the p Quad.

152
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.080
They are accosted by a beggar in the street and his name is Elijah.

153
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.400
And he warns them and very cryptic language about what they've actually signed

154
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:37.941
away when they signed the papers to board the p Quad and he suggested what

155
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:40.980
they've signed away,
his,
their souls,

156
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.820
not just the couple of years of their life.

157
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.290
The version that we get in blood Meridian,
uh,

158
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.270
can be found on page 40 and 41

159
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.290
so he starts on 39.

160
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.393
<v 3>Okay.</v>

161
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:12.490
<v 0>The kid has joined up with captain white's gang of filibusters and they are in a</v>

162
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:18.590
bar
and there are,

163
00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:23.591
they find this is on 39 and old disordered Mennonite in this place.

164
00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:27.890
And he turns to study them,
a thin man in the leather West Kit,

165
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.340
a black and straight brim hat set,
square on his head,

166
00:11:31.341 --> 00:11:36.320
a thin rim of whiskers.
And if you look at the Moby Dick version,

167
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.380
I just want to point out how closely he's following the cues here.

168
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.570
We kept Craig and I had just left the p Quad and we're sauntering away from the

169
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:52.860
water for the moment,
each occupied with his own thoughts.
When above the word,

170
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.040
the above words,
uh,
were put to us by a stranger.
This is shipmates.

171
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.000
Have you shipped in that ship,
uh,

172
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.720
put to us by a stranger who pausing before us leveled his massive finger at the

173
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:06.400
vessel in question he was,

174
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:11.401
but shabbily appareled in faded jacket and patch trousers or rag of black

175
00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:13.810
handkerchief investing his neck.

176
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.380
Just the way that description,

177
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.120
the very brief description of his outfit,

178
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.670
what he's wearing around his neck,
his hat,

179
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.480
they match up in these two little paragraphs.

180
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.260
The Mennonite,
however,

181
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.040
is much more dire,

182
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.780
much less playful than uh,
then Melville's uh,

183
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.760
Alijah he says to the,
uh,

184
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.060
to the assembled,
uh,
uh,
man.

185
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:50.843
<v 3>Okay,</v>

186
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.100
<v 0>they'll Jlu to a man.
This is on 40.</v>

187
00:12:55.101 --> 00:12:58.280
Who Will the United States army general worth the hell.

188
00:12:58.281 --> 00:13:02.180
They will pray that they will.
He looks at his comrades.

189
00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:05.930
He leans toward the Mennonite.
What does that mean old man?

190
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.640
Do he cross that river with Yon Filibuster armed.

191
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.320
You'll not cross it back.
Don't aim to cross it back.
We go into Sonora.

192
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.030
What's it to you?
Old Man.

193
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.060
The Mennonite watches the in shadow dark before them as it is reflected to him

194
00:13:23.061 --> 00:13:26.600
in the mirror over the bar.
He turns to them.
His eyes are wet.

195
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:31.100
He speaks slowly.
The wrath of God lies sleeping.

196
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.010
It was hit a million years before man were,

197
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.900
and only men have the power to wake it.
Hell ain't half full here.

198
00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:42.860
Me,
you carry war of a madman's making into a foreign land.

199
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.200
You awake more than the dogs.

200
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:50.350
But they berated the old man and swore at him until he moved off down the bar

201
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.030
muttering and how else could it be,

202
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:58.810
how these things end in confusion and curses and blood.

203
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.600
They drank on and the wind blew in the streets and the stars that had been

204
00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:07.160
overhead lay low in the west.
And these young men fell afoul of others.

205
00:14:07.161 --> 00:14:10.780
And words were said that could not be put right again.
And in the Dawn,

206
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.690
the kid and the second corporal knelt over the boy from Missouri who had been

207
00:14:14.691 --> 00:14:18.470
named Earl,
and they spoke his name,
but he never spoke back.

208
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.430
He lay on his side and the dust of the courtyard,
the men were gone.

209
00:14:22.431 --> 00:14:26.660
The whores are gone and old man's swept the clay floor within the Cantina.

210
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.400
The boy lay with his skull broken in a pool of blood.
None knew by whom.

211
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:36.440
A third one came to be with them in the courtyard.
It was the Mennonite,

212
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.700
a warm wind was blowing in the east hell.
The gray light,

213
00:14:40.701 --> 00:14:45.230
the fouls roosting along the grape vines had begun to stir and call.

214
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.950
There is no such joy in the tavern is Baja as upon the road there too,

215
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.950
said the Mennonite.

216
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.930
He had been holding his hat in his hands and now he set it upon his head again

217
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.880
and turned and went out the gate.

218
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:04.810
He offers them these poor tentious sayings like this last little epigram about,

219
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.160
uh,
the tavern and the road there too.
And he uses this archaic language.

220
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.020
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

221
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.640
<v 0>Moby Dick's Mennonite,</v>

222
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.710
I mean Moby Dick's prophet who occupies the same structural spot.

223
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:26.660
A costing the main characters as they go out on their journey is much more

224
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:29.270
playful.
He is,
ah,

225
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:34.300
berated by Ishmael for pretending to have a big secret for speaking as if he had

226
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:38.240
a secret to tell but not telling it.

227
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:44.110
So McCarthy takes the model and transforms it slightly,

228
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:51.010
brings it into a realm where sincerity and depth and fear

229
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:59.740
replace the inklings of fear around a core of goodwill,

230
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.710
irony,
playfulness.

231
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.940
The reason there's that difference I think is that McCarthy has decided not to

232
00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:12.350
give us an Ishmael.

233
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.580
Ishmael is an incredibly charming narrator.

234
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.300
He is thoughtful.
He's funny.

235
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.880
He is a little self mocking.
He can wax,

236
00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.780
uh,
both grand and silly.

237
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.600
He can recognize his own silliness.

238
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.870
There's a vast interior of Ishmael's mind that we see in this narrative.

239
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.400
We never see the light of this from the kid.
Never.

240
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.880
This is one way in which McCarthy has revised Melville.

241
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.090
So this is one of those observations I'm going to sort of put up on the shelf.

242
00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.990
What does it mean that this is the way he revised Melville?

243
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.820
This is one of the questions that my two lectures together,
we'll answer.

244
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.180
What does that revision mean?

245
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.040
Another specific scene in which McCarthy is revising Melville comes when

246
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.840
Toadvine almost kills the judge.
Do you remember the scene?

247
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.400
The judge has been dangling.
The little Indian boy on his knee,

248
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.730
the man around the campfire are delighted.

249
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.180
They laugh in the morning.

250
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:39.690
The judge has killed the boy and scalped it and is wiping his hands on his pants

251
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.480
and Toadvine puts his revolver to the judge's head and the judge judge says,

252
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.940
shoot that thing or put it away and Toadvine puts it away.

253
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:57.050
This is the direct echo of a moment when Starbuck stands outside.

254
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.480
Ahab's cabin Ahab's maniacal quest for the whale has been made apparent to the

255
00:18:04.921 --> 00:18:05.754
whole ship.

256
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:11.300
Starbuck that wise and deliberative man understands that the fate of the whole

257
00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:14.790
ship is now.

258
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:20.650
Ben Has now been recruited to Ahab's maniacal cause he knows that if he takes

259
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:27.270
the Moscot and shoots Ahab in his bed,

260
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:32.400
he will save the whole ship of men.
He does not do it.

261
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.200
<v 3>Okay,</v>

262
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.400
<v 0>so both Toadvine and Starbuck are presented with a moral problem.</v>

263
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:43.670
Do you murder the leader of an immoral ill fated violent quest?

264
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.840
Both men decide not to.

265
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.280
This is a scene I'll come back to next time on Wednesday and I'll have more to

266
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.920
say about it.
But for now,

267
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.150
one thing that we can say about it is,
once again,

268
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:07.800
the lack of interiority for these characters makes a crucial difference.

269
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.410
It's a crucial point of revision.

270
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.490
Starbuck we know is deliberative.

271
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:16.350
We know he is a wise man.

272
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.560
He gives counsel to Ahab over the whole course of the novel to abandon his quest

273
00:19:23.341 --> 00:19:27.600
to go home to his wife at the very end of the novel and a crucial moment.

274
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.600
Starbuck gives an impassioned plea to Ahab,

275
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.470
reminds him of his wife and child and says,
you know,

276
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.950
leave off chasing that whale.
Um,

277
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.140
let us live and go home.

278
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.260
We have no such history for Toadvine.
Well,
what do we know about Toadvine?
Well,

279
00:19:46.261 --> 00:19:49.380
he wears a scapular of ears that he's cut off.

280
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.810
He has tattoos from his criminal past on his face.

281
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.333
<v 3>Okay.</v>

282
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.050
<v 0>He wears the evidence of a criminal life,</v>

283
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.440
not the furrowed brow of Starbucks.
Thought.

284
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:06.690
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

285
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.880
<v 0>he is a very different kind of character.</v>

286
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:14.150
And that leads us to wonder how we need to understand his failure to shoot the

287
00:20:16.771 --> 00:20:17.604
judge.

288
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.960
Is it that moral complexity yields lack of decisiveness,

289
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.080
as we might say for Starbuck,

290
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.820
that moral complexity is presented as a kind of weakness or is that far too much

291
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:42.561
to say about Toadvine is turned vine or morally complex character?

292
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.260
Do we have any basis upon which to say such a thing?

293
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.260
So this is another kind of question we want to ask now I'm going to move to my

294
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.590
second in line here and that's paradise lost.

295
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.700
Mccarthy rings the changes on the great voices of American literature,

296
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.510
but also of of world literature in English.
Uh,

297
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.570
you were talking about the Iliad and the epic tradition.
Um,

298
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.690
in this case he is entering the great a realm of poetry.

299
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:22.260
Now he gives a specific revision of paradise lost in,

300
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.400
uh,
in blood meridian.
If you recall,

301
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.300
how many of you have taken a Milton class or have read Milton in class?
Okay.

302
00:21:31.301 --> 00:21:33.550
Okay.
Good number of you.
So,
uh,

303
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:38.790
probably a bunch of you realize this when the judge makes gunpowder.

304
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.910
Do you remember this scene?
The men are out of gunpowder.

305
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.540
They find the judge in the desert.
They're being hounded by the Indians.

306
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:54.250
They've been chasing all this time.
They're at their mercy.

307
00:21:54.251 --> 00:21:55.840
They know they're going to be massacred.

308
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.080
They find the judge sitting on a rock in the middle of the desert.

309
00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:03.460
Who knows how he got there.
Glanton takes him up,

310
00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:09.450
he rides with them and he takes them to a volcanic cone,

311
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.350
a dead cone.
And there he instructs them how to make gunpowder.

312
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.990
He takes brimstone from the room of the cone.

313
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.550
He mixes it with charcoal and other things.

314
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.390
And then he has them piss on it.
And from this,

315
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:30.160
he makes gunpowder and they use that gunpowder to defeat the Indians who come

316
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:34.690
after them.
Well,
this is taken directly from paradise lost.

317
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.890
Um,
Satan instructs his fiends and how,

318
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:42.850
how to make gun powder.
And I'm going to read you a little bit from books.

319
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.530
Six of paradise lost.

320
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.270
So the fees are down in hell,

321
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:54.300
strategizing somewhat in despair over their chances against God's angels.

322
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.680
The fallen angels are standing around Satan in they're taking turns making

323
00:22:59.681 --> 00:23:04.681
speeches and they've just heard a speech from a fallen angel who says,

324
00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:06.551
you know,

325
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:10.810
we really need a better weapon otherwise we're never going to win this war.

326
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.410
And uh,
here's what Satan has to has to say.

327
00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.820
We're to,
we look composed.
Satan replied,

328
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.260
not uninvented that which thou right beliefs.

329
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:28.261
So main to our success I bring which of us who beholds the bright surface of

330
00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:32.290
this ether is mold,
where on we stand,

331
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:37.390
this continent of spacious heaven adorned with plant fruit,
flower,

332
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.370
ambrosial gems and gold who's ISO superficially surveys.

333
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.500
These things as not to mind from whence they grow.

334
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:47.740
Deep underground materials,

335
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.760
dark and crude of spiritists and fiery spume till touched with Heaven's Ray and

336
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:57.680
tempered.
They shoot forth.
So beauteous opening to the ambient light,

337
00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.930
these in their Dark Nativity,

338
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:03.980
the deep shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame,

339
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.800
which into hollow engines long and round,

340
00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:11.300
thick round at the other bore with a touch of fire,
dilated and infuriate.

341
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.080
That's very much a McCarthy word in fury.

342
00:24:14.081 --> 00:24:19.040
It infuriated shall send forth from far with thundering noise.

343
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:19.880
Among our foes,

344
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.900
such implements of mischief as shell dashed to pieces and overwhelm.

345
00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:27.620
Whatever stands a verse that they shall fear.

346
00:24:27.621 --> 00:24:31.490
We have disarmed the thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.

347
00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.250
So they're Satan saying,
look at the world.
You look at all these plants,

348
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.880
the chemicals we need are in this earth.

349
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.120
So this is what the judge says.
Um,

350
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.380
for his part in like circumstance.

351
00:24:47.381 --> 00:24:52.381
This is on one 29 one 30 and this remember is told by Tobin,

352
00:24:53.171 --> 00:24:54.310
the ex priest,

353
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:07.890
<v 3>okay.
In</v>

354
00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:12.090
<v 0>all of this time,
as they were riding across the plane without gun gunpowder,</v>

355
00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:16.560
nor this time,
the judge had spoke hardly a word.
So dawn,

356
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.050
we were on the edge of avast.

357
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:23.070
Malpais and his honor takes up a position on some lava rocks there and he

358
00:25:23.071 --> 00:25:25.410
commences to give us an address.
See,

359
00:25:25.411 --> 00:25:30.180
there's that same structural position the judge occupies,

360
00:25:30.181 --> 00:25:34.830
the place that Satan does in paradise lost and gives a speech.

361
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.320
It was like a sermon,

362
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.950
but it was no such sermon as any man of us had ever heard before.

363
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.950
Beyond the Malpais Hayes was a volcanic peak.

364
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.050
And in the sunrise it was many colors.

365
00:25:46.051 --> 00:25:50.220
And there was dark little birds crossing down the wind and the wind was flapping

366
00:25:50.221 --> 00:25:52.050
the judges,
old Benjamin about him.

367
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.850
And he pointed to that stark and solitary mountain and delivered himself of an

368
00:25:56.851 --> 00:25:59.940
oration to what end?
I know,
not then or now.

369
00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:05.130
And he concluded with the telling us that our mother earth was,

370
00:26:05.131 --> 00:26:10.050
as he said,
was round like an egg and contained all good things within her.

371
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:11.940
Then he turned and led the horse.

372
00:26:11.941 --> 00:26:15.360
He had been riding across that terrain of black and glassy slag,

373
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.660
treacherous to man and beast alike and us behind him,

374
00:26:18.661 --> 00:26:21.000
like the disciples of a new faith.

375
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.790
So the oration urging them to see in the earth,

376
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.600
all the things they need exactly out of paradise lost.

377
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.400
And then a little further down the page,
you see that,
um,

378
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:40.230
Tobin speculates about the,
the um,
the volcanic terrain,

379
00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:45.231
they're crossing a four a where for OT man knows lies the locality of hell.

380
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.170
Even speculate that this is where hell's entrance might be.

381
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:56.060
So what does more Carthy do when he invites us to see the judge as the parallel

382
00:26:56.971 --> 00:26:57.804
of Satan?

383
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.620
I think this is one of the most powerful illusions in driving readings of this

384
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:05.454
novel.

385
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:11.420
Lots of readers have taken judge Holden as heroic evil on the model of Milton.

386
00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:13.584
Satan.

387
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.680
Remember the famous problem about paradise lost is that here was Milton writing

388
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:25.431
it to justify the ways of God to men justifying how good God was.

389
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.710
And yet Satan is this incredibly compelling character.

390
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.300
Milton Rights Satan to be irresistible.

391
00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:45.160
And in particular he is rhetorical,
Lee,

392
00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.330
incredibly gifted.

393
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:52.630
And so he makes all these wonderful speeches that Milton rights for him that we

394
00:27:52.631 --> 00:27:53.560
get to listen to.

395
00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.650
So McCarthy sets up a similar problem in blood meridian.

396
00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.330
Here's the judge.

397
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.890
He has this compelling language that we want to listen to.

398
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:11.770
It's very sonorous.
There's that debt to the oral tradition.

399
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:13.930
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

400
00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.240
<v 0>And yet he is this incredibly evil,
ma'am.</v>

401
00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:22.090
So there's a problem here of moral valence.

402
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:27.870
Can we condemn or does the book condemn this figure?

403
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.950
It's the problem in paradise lost.
It's the problem also in blood meridian.

404
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.790
If you find the via violence in blood meridian,

405
00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.590
simply gratuitous,

406
00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.970
then you've answered that in a certain way by saying no,

407
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:48.010
the characters not so compelling that I can put up with the graphic

408
00:28:48.011 --> 00:28:50.770
representation of violence.
It doesn't make it worth it,

409
00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:56.890
but there's another school of thought that says the aesthetics of the violence,

410
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.770
the aesthetics of the judge do make it worth it.

411
00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.730
So that is a kind of debt.

412
00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:08.850
The other way this sheds light on the novel is to say that the novel is

413
00:29:10.481 --> 00:29:15.481
concerned like Paradise lost with the great cosmic structures of the world.

414
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.860
Now this is another element too of its use of the Bible,

415
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.300
and we'll talk about that in a minute,

416
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.800
but it gives for the novel certain kind of weight.

417
00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.560
It makes us read it.

418
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:36.430
Looking for those big cosmic structures and statements about those big cosmic

419
00:29:37.611 --> 00:29:39.530
structures,
it lends it wait,

420
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:45.040
unleavened by the kinds of delightful playfulness that we see from Ishmael.

421
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.530
Melville's full of the Bible and full of pretentiousness too,

422
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:54.700
but always Ishmael's voice is they're charming us.

423
00:29:55.750 --> 00:30:00.010
What we have here instead is sheer pretentiousness.

424
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.400
Some say pretentiousness weighing on every sentence.

425
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:11.130
The Ao allusions to paradise lost are part of that pretentiousness.

426
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.920
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

427
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.170
<v 0>no.
Let me move to something smaller.</v>

428
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.520
Moving a little later in the poetic tradition,

429
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:24.840
Wordsworth in the opening lines of this novel,

430
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.130
we see the line,

431
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.833
<v 3>yeah.</v>

432
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:32.920
<v 0>On page three,
all history present in that visit,
the face of the kid,</v>

433
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.810
the child,
the father of the man,
that phrase,
the child,

434
00:30:37.811 --> 00:30:42.400
the father of the man comes from a short little poem by William Wordsworth.

435
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.630
It's called my heart leaps up when I behold

436
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.030
my heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky.

437
00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:56.890
So it was when my life began.
So it is now,
I am a man.

438
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:01.240
So be it.
When I grow shall grow old or let me die.

439
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:06.660
The child is the father of the man and I could wish my days to be bound each to

440
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:09.550
each by natural piety.

441
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.200
So this is a lovely little s little snippet of a poem.

442
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:20.260
The point of it is to say that the child delighted by the Rainbow

443
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:25.450
gives you the man delighted by the Rainbow.
And he says,
uh,

444
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:30.630
let me die if I'm no longer delighted if I get to be so old that that child like

445
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:35.500
delight in the rainbow was gone.

446
00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:40.690
The rainbow comes freighted with its own biblical,
uh,

447
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.240
literary history.
That is,

448
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:47.050
it's the sign of God's promise to the world,

449
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:52.080
to humankind that God will no longer send a flood to wipe out the human race as

450
00:31:54.521 --> 00:31:56.050
he did in the days of Noah.

451
00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:01.980
So it is a hopeful sign for the fate of humankind and it reflects well on God's

452
00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:06.580
intentions towards us.

453
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.860
Mccarthy's child,

454
00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:17.060
father of the man is a very different sort.

455
00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.900
Just read that sentence right prior to the Ellucian,

456
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:27.060
he can neither read nor write and in him broods already a taste for mindless

457
00:32:27.061 --> 00:32:27.894
violence.

458
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:34.490
What McCarthy announces here in his revision of Wordsworth is that although to

459
00:32:37.681 --> 00:32:42.681
invoke Milton is already to project us into the realm of romantic figures,

460
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:51.010
he is rejecting the later romanticism of the early 19th century,

461
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.220
which found in humankind,

462
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:59.660
especially in the child as the epitome of pure humankind,

463
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.200
a kind of great hopefulness.

464
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.270
This is not what McCarthy sees and humankind.

465
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.060
This is not what the kid gives to us.

466
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:15.950
Even though even though we are told a little later on,

467
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.360
on page four,

468
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:25.250
the child's face is curiously untouched behind the scars,

469
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.750
the eyes oddly innocent.
What does that innocence mean?

470
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:35.760
Is it here an innocence like Wordsworth's child who can be hold the rainbow with

471
00:33:36.201 --> 00:33:41.000
joy and a pure relation to the world and to a caring God?

472
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.860
Is it that kind of innocence?

473
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.430
Is that the innocent simply of not knowing something?

474
00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.870
Is it that kind of innocence?
Is it an absence of guilt?

475
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.770
Is that what the innocence is?
These are questions.
Again,

476
00:33:56.771 --> 00:34:01.750
I'm going to put up on the side what is the quality of the kids' innocence.

477
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.710
This is something I'm going to answer on Wednesday,

478
00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.240
but I want you to think about it.

479
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:12.490
The allusion to Wordsworth causes us to ask that kind of question.

480
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:17.140
The revision tells us we are in a much darker world.

481
00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:19.503
Now.

482
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:25.330
I'm actually going to skip over some of the biblical illusion and and trust you

483
00:34:25.331 --> 00:34:29.230
to read in the first couple of pages.
Just in that first section.

484
00:34:29.231 --> 00:34:34.231
I'd like you to reread it and think about how the Bible is woven in there.

485
00:34:35.291 --> 00:34:39.650
You see lots of garden of Eden imagery there.
Um,

486
00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:43.630
you see,
uh,
a parasite,

487
00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.730
the image of the murdered father.

488
00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:50.650
There's an echo there of Canaan evil,
even though they are brothers.

489
00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:55.750
There's a sense that this is a world in which violence and murder has already

490
00:34:55.751 --> 00:34:58.750
entered.
So you can think about that.

491
00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.040
I want to go now to my last,
um,

492
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.270
in the pile of books.

493
00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:10.080
This is an historical source called my confession and it is by a man named

494
00:35:11.801 --> 00:35:12.940
Samuel Chamberlain.

495
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.300
Chamberlain fought for the u s in the Mexican war and after the war was over,

496
00:35:22.451 --> 00:35:25.270
he joined up with the Glanton gain.

497
00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:30.400
The Glanton gang is a historical fact as far as we know.

498
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:35.470
It was a gang of scalp hunters that operated around the border right after the

499
00:35:35.471 --> 00:35:39.060
Mexican war in the 1840s and 50s.

500
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.370
Sam Chamberlain,
I want to show you,
he was quite a remarkable guy.

501
00:35:44.371 --> 00:35:47.280
He was from Boston,
born in New Hampshire.
Um,

502
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.270
grew up in Boston at 16.

503
00:35:51.271 --> 00:35:55.350
He left Boston and went out west,

504
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.660
taking a sort of circuitous route.

505
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.070
He went to find his fortune and to find adventure,

506
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.740
but he also

507
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:12.890
went with a box of paints and he produced these amazing watercolors everywhere

508
00:36:14.461 --> 00:36:18.720
he went and he wrote a,
this testimony of his,

509
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:23.910
his adventures called my confession.
It reads like a picaresque.
It's full of,

510
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.980
uh,
his own heroism.

511
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.340
All the senior Rita's that he romances all the great battles he fights in,

512
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.990
but he really gives us an amazing,
um,

513
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:41.160
set of,
of paintings.
You can just see these,

514
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:42.990
I'm going to show you a couple.

515
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.863
<v 3>Hello.</v>

516
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.430
<v 0>Well,
I'm waiting for this to come up.</v>

517
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:55.590
I'm going to show you something you can't see on this website.

518
00:36:55.591 --> 00:37:00.310
This is the Texas state historical society where these documents are kept.
Um,

519
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:04.500
the pages are written.
I don't know if you can see this.

520
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.210
This is a reproduction.
See,

521
00:37:09.211 --> 00:37:14.211
he writes in this gorgeous hand and he embellishes all the pages with little

522
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:20.690
drawings and this is hundreds of pages long with hundreds of watercolors in it.

523
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:27.080
My bet is that Mccarthy actually saw this manuscript in the Texas state

524
00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:30.810
historical society.
That's where he lives.

525
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:33.540
That's where he was living when he wrote this book.
Um,

526
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:38.790
and it just is amazingly visual and gorgeous.

527
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.050
He ended up making three copies of this with all its paintings.

528
00:37:43.051 --> 00:37:46.500
When he got back to New England,
he married and he had three daughters,

529
00:37:46.501 --> 00:37:51.180
which he named after various senior reaches that he had romanced and he made a

530
00:37:51.181 --> 00:37:54.120
copy of,
um,
of the,

531
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:58.830
of my confession for each.
So there are three of them.

532
00:37:58.831 --> 00:38:02.010
One is at Annapolis,
one is at the Texas state historical society.

533
00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:04.080
And I think one is with the family.
All right,

534
00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:07.200
so this isn't giving me the paintings that I want and I'm going to,

535
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:13.230
these are two that I took up.
Um,
this one on the right.
Well,

536
00:38:13.231 --> 00:38:14.250
we'll do the little one on the left.

537
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:19.430
The one on the left is his drawing of the Grand Canyon and he claims that it was

538
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:23.970
the first ever painting of the Grand Canyon.
I think this is probably false.
Um,

539
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.840
that's them,
uh,
crossing through the game.

540
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:31.080
This is judge Holden here.

541
00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:34.960
Discoursing on evolution in a very judge Holden Li Wei.

542
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.990
So we actually hear about this,

543
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:41.500
a sermon on evolution in the novel.
Well,

544
00:38:41.501 --> 00:38:43.900
here it is in Chamberlain's confession.

545
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.840
Now I want to read to you a little bit from the confession.

546
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.240
The second in command now left in charge of the camp was a man of gigantic size

547
00:38:58.511 --> 00:39:02.620
who rejoiced in the name of Holden called Judge Holden of Texas.

548
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.440
Who or what he was,
no one knew,

549
00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.070
but a more cool blooded villain never went on home.

550
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.750
He stood six foot six in his moccasins,
had a large,
fleshy frame,

551
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.720
adult tallow,
colored face,
destitute of hair,

552
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:20.020
and all expression always cool and collected.

553
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.930
But when a quarrel took place and bloodshed,

554
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:28.110
his hog like eyes would gleam with a solid ferocity worthy of the countenance of

555
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:32.260
a themed.
I'm gonna skip a little bit.
Um,

556
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.980
terrible stories were circulated in camp of horrid crimes committed by him when

557
00:39:37.981 --> 00:39:40.650
bearing another name and the Cherokee nation and Texas.

558
00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.980
And before we love Fronterra is a little girl of 10 years,

559
00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:45.740
was found in the shop role foul.

560
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:49.710
He violated and murdered the mark of a huge hand on her little throat.

561
00:39:49.711 --> 00:39:54.180
Pointed out him as the ravager as no other man had such a hand.

562
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.470
But though all suspected no one charged him with a crime.

563
00:39:59.340 --> 00:39:59.670
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

564
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:03.990
<v 0>he was by far the best educated man in northern Mexico.</v>

565
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.540
He conversed with all in their own language,

566
00:40:06.541 --> 00:40:09.810
spoke in several Indian lingos out of Fandango,

567
00:40:09.811 --> 00:40:14.220
would take the harp or guitar from the hands of the musicians and charm all with

568
00:40:14.221 --> 00:40:16.180
his wonderful performance out waltz,

569
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:21.200
any Poblano of the ball plum center with rife rifle or revolver at Deering

570
00:40:21.661 --> 00:40:24.960
horseman acquainted with the nature of all the strange plants and their

571
00:40:24.961 --> 00:40:26.070
botanical names.

572
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:31.310
Great in geology and mineralogy with all an errant coward,

573
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:36.360
but not that he possessed enough courage to fight Indians and Mexicans or anyone

574
00:40:36.361 --> 00:40:38.880
where he had the advantage in strength,
skill and weapons,

575
00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:42.300
but where the combat would be equal,
he would avoid it if possible.

576
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:45.990
I hated him at first sight and he knew it.

577
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.910
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

578
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:51.990
<v 0>the intellectual beast saw fit to patronize me in the most insulting manner,</v>

579
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.950
lecturing me on the immorality of my conduct in drinking and gambling.

580
00:40:56.370 --> 00:41:00.630
This was shortly after the murder of the MOOC Chacha and when I made an angry

581
00:41:00.631 --> 00:41:04.710
reply,
he said,
Come Jack,
don't bear ill.
We'll shake hands and makeup.

582
00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.940
I replied,
no,
I thank you.
Your hand is too large and powerful.

583
00:41:08.941 --> 00:41:12.600
It leaves its mark hold and gave me a look out from his cold,

584
00:41:12.601 --> 00:41:16.860
cruel eyes and quietly said,
you are there.
Are You well,

585
00:41:16.861 --> 00:41:20.430
look out where my hand may squeeze the life out of you yet my young Bantam,

586
00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.420
I felt like trying my revolver on his huge carcass,

587
00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:28.590
but prudence forbid bringing matters to a deadly issue at present.

588
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.890
There's that same Toadvine Starbuck moment.

589
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:37.070
It's right in my confession as is that particular strange description of judge

590
00:41:39.201 --> 00:41:43.970
Holden as huge and hairless.
Now in the 19th century,

591
00:41:43.971 --> 00:41:46.760
hairless just meant that he didn't have a beard.

592
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:53.140
But Mccarthy takes that and makes it into this really freakish character.

593
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.640
It's almost like he's a giant infant.

594
00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:04.290
What does it mean that McCarthy gets the most powerful character in the novel,

595
00:42:07.121 --> 00:42:11.620
so directly from this source?
That's one question.

596
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.650
Second question is,

597
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:19.920
what does it mean that he's actually taking and historical fact the Glanton gang

598
00:42:22.571 --> 00:42:27.490
and their adventures and using these as the kernel of his novel?

599
00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.510
When as my little pile of books here has demonstrated

600
00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:37.990
he's totally absorbed in the novels relationship to literary history.

601
00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:44.040
So what's he doing by doubling the literary history with an American history,

602
00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:51.370
he's pursuing two sets of links back through time.

603
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:55.750
One in the realm of art,
one in the realm of history.

604
00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:57.790
What's the relationship between the two?

605
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.820
When I first read this,
I will say I was extremely surprised.

606
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:09.770
Are you surprised too,

607
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:15.170
to see that it takes so directly from chamberlains manuscript?

608
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:19.340
The problem is the problem of originality.

609
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:25.420
This is a problem that I think Mccarthy's quotation that I wrote up on the board

610
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.860
points towards.

611
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.490
<v 3>Okay.</v>

612
00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:32.470
<v 0>The ugly fact is</v>

613
00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:38.290
<v 3>that books are made out of books.</v>

614
00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:42.120
<v 0>Why is that an ugly fact?
What's ugly about that?</v>

615
00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:48.790
The novel depends for its life on the novels that have been written.

616
00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:52.560
Is it ugly?

617
00:43:52.561 --> 00:43:57.561
Because it calls into question the very principle of originality.

618
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:01.500
This is what someone,
a reader like Harold bloom might say,

619
00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:04.830
Harold Bloom argues that,
uh,

620
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:10.250
it is the anxiety of influence that shapes many writers in the tradition as they

621
00:44:10.561 --> 00:44:12.840
take on the great writers of the past.

622
00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.720
They feel that they are ever be deleted,

623
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:20.880
that there is no room yet in the world to push the art form further.

624
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.030
Is that why it's an ugly fact?

625
00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:28.530
Is its ugliness or the way that word is used in this quotation?

626
00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:33.890
Is it registering McCarthy's about his own belatedness can he really be

627
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:36.354
original?

628
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.090
<v 3>Okay.</v>

629
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:44.090
<v 0>Can he really answer the poor tentious cosmic aura that he invokes over and over</v>

630
00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:53.340
again in the very style of this novel,

631
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.890
the style keeps telling you come and look for a deeper meaning.

632
00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.580
I want to point out one last thing for you.
Uh,

633
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:06.180
since I do have just the couple minutes that I will need.

634
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.630
This is on four and five,
um,

635
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.680
at the top of four.

636
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.720
As the kid moves from Tennessee down to New Orleans and then out to the west,

637
00:45:22.051 --> 00:45:24.990
he moves through the south.
He sees

638
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:31.050
blacks in the fields,
lank and stooped their fingers.
Spider,

639
00:45:31.051 --> 00:45:35.430
like among the bowls of cotton,
a shadowed agony in the garden.

640
00:45:35.431 --> 00:45:39.240
There's some of that Eden imagery I was gonna point out to you at more length

641
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:45.570
against the suns declining figures moving in the slower dusk across a paper

642
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.680
skyline.

643
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.840
The landscape itself is already an artifact.
It's paper.

644
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.920
It's as if it's of Mccarthy's own construction.

645
00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.090
But if you look just across the page on five,

646
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:05.460
this is a tiny thing and probably it didn't register to you at all.

647
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.340
A week on,
he's on the move.
Again,

648
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:12.450
a few dollars in his purse that he's earned walking the sand roads of the

649
00:46:12.451 --> 00:46:13.590
southern night alone.

650
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:18.360
His hands balled in the cotton pockets of his cheap coat.

651
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.990
Do you notice the way the words are repeating their spider like among the bowls

652
00:46:25.111 --> 00:46:29.760
of cotton,
his hands balled in the cotton pockets of his coat.

653
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:35.220
It's a tiny little thing.
I would argue,
however,

654
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:40.370
that what we're seeing here is the way the very style and tone perpetuates

655
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:42.030
itself out of itself.

656
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:48.710
So I want to add a final layer in my excavation of illusion and hearsay that

657
00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:53.460
he's out alluding to himself,

658
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.720
that there is a constant re layering

659
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:05.990
that takes the language and the repetitiousness of that language builds within

660
00:47:07.201 --> 00:47:08.034
the text.

661
00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:13.120
<v 3>Okay.</v>

662
00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:18.120
<v 0>There is a lot of anxiety about origin right here in these couple pages were</v>

663
00:47:19.151 --> 00:47:21.790
told only now is it as he goes to Texas,

664
00:47:21.791 --> 00:47:26.590
only now is the child finally divested of all he has been

665
00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:33.780
and note at the beginning that he is and his folk are known for hewers of wood

666
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:36.340
and drawers of water.

667
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:40.390
These are the traditional adjectives given to the sons of ham,

668
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:45.670
the hewers of wood and drawers of water,
Hams,
crime against his father.

669
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:49.930
Noah was that he saw his father,
no one naked in his tent.

670
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.810
Noah planted a vineyard,

671
00:47:52.811 --> 00:47:57.520
got drunk and I guess he was naked in his tech tanned while he was passed out.

672
00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.780
Ham happened to peep in and saw his father naked.

673
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:06.730
His two brothers covered the father.

674
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:11.830
The two brothers are there.
Blessed Ham is cursed.
Why?

675
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.900
Why is this a a curse worthy action?
Why is this a curse word?
The mistake.

676
00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.660
I think it's because in seeing the father naked,

677
00:48:19.661 --> 00:48:21.250
you see the mystery of your origin

678
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:28.820
and so the kid is likened to someone cursed for looking upon their origin.

679
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:35.700
There's a sense in which he can almost understand it.

680
00:48:35.701 --> 00:48:40.200
This is meant to be mystery and yet by looking somehow he is closer to it then

681
00:48:40.201 --> 00:48:41.034
he should be.

682
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:45.780
The problem for the kid is to divest himself of origin to forget it.

683
00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:51.860
So if ham is cursed because he saw his origin,

684
00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:57.890
the kids curse lies in part in the divestiture of all origin.

685
00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.680
He forgets it.
It's not that he sees it,
he forgets it

686
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.360
and then you can get a sentence like this.

687
00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:13.220
His origins are become remote as is his destiny and not again in all the world's

688
00:49:15.061 --> 00:49:20.061
turning will there be terrains so wild and barbarous to try whether the stuff of

689
00:49:20.551 --> 00:49:25.320
creation may be shaped to man's will or whether his own heart is not another

690
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:26.460
kind of clay.

691
00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:32.380
Will you to read that sentence several times before Wednesday and ask yourself

692
00:49:32.581 --> 00:49:36.000
if you can figure out what it means fully.
All of it.

693
00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.760
Parts of it are more clear than others.

694
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:44.390
Think about the balance between the rhythm of that sentence and it's content.

695
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:51.690
The tone,
what its tone says to you,
what it's diction says to you,

696
00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.660
and what the sentence itself actually says to you.

697
00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.600
So that's what I'd like you to think about.

698
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:02.000
And on Wednesday I'm going to take this discussion about illusion and I'm going

699
00:50:02.001 --> 00:50:05.340
to sort of ball it up and it'll become part of another argument.

700
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:10.200
And that'll stem from one tiny detail I'm going to take out of the novel.

701
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.820
So that's where I'm going.
