00:00:00.254 --> 00:00:01.839
- [Instructor] So we have
an infinite series here,

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:03.590
and the goal of this video is to try

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.520
to figure out the interval of convergence

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.004
for this series.

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:10.260
And that's another way of
saying for what x values,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.263
what range of x values,

00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:14.994
is this series going to converge?

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:16.779
And like always pause this video

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.230
and see if you can figure it out.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.545
When you look at this series,

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:22.509
it doesn't fit cleanly into something

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.521
like a geometric series
or an alternating series.

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:27.014
When I see something like this,

00:00:27.014 --> 00:00:28.742
I think about the ratio test,

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:31.227
because it tends to be pretty general.

00:00:31.227 --> 00:00:33.252
To apply the ratio test,

00:00:33.252 --> 00:00:36.275
we want to think about the limit,

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:39.108
the limit as n approaches infinity

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.564
of the n plus oneth term,

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:46.244
divided by the nth term

00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:48.761
and the absolute value of that.

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:51.344
If this thing is less than one,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.260
so when this thing is less than one,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.760
then we are going to converge.

00:01:00.214 --> 00:01:04.254
And the x values that make
this thing greater than one,

00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:06.711
we are going to diverge.

00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:10.042
And the x values that
make this equal to one,

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:12.022
well then we're going to be inconclusive

00:01:12.022 --> 00:01:14.030
and so we're going to have
to use other techniques

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.739
to think about whether we're
going to converge or diverge.

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:21.491
So let's just think about
this, let's just evaluate this,

00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:22.527
so let's do that.

00:01:22.527 --> 00:01:23.360
Limit

00:01:24.243 --> 00:01:26.243
as n approaches infinity

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:31.320
of the absolute value of a sub-n plus one

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.020
well that's going to
be x to the n plus one.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.547
Let me color code this, just
so we know what we're doing.

00:01:36.547 --> 00:01:40.505
So this thing right over
here is going to be x

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:41.922
to the n plus one

00:01:42.778 --> 00:01:44.028
over n plus one

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:47.803
times five to the n plus one.

00:01:48.788 --> 00:01:51.283
We're going to divide that by

00:01:51.283 --> 00:01:52.516
the nth term.

00:01:52.516 --> 00:01:54.058
We're going to divide
that by the nth term.

00:01:54.058 --> 00:01:57.067
And that's just going to be x to the n

00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:59.317
over n times five to the n.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.526
We're going to take the absolute
value of this whole thing.

00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:05.800
Now let me simplify this.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.252
I'll simplify it down here.

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:09.174
So this is the same thing as

00:02:09.174 --> 00:02:11.174
x to the n plus one over

00:02:12.463 --> 00:02:15.796
n plus one times five to the n plus one,

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.482
times the reciprocal of this.

00:02:19.482 --> 00:02:21.273
So it's going to be n

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.507
times five to the n,

00:02:23.507 --> 00:02:25.265
over x to the n.

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:26.565
And we could simplify this.

00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:29.035
This is going to be equal to,

00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:31.011
let's see, you divide
numerator and denominator

00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:32.317
by x to the n,

00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:34.469
you're left with just an x.

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.304
Then divide numerator and denominator

00:02:36.304 --> 00:02:37.933
by five to the n.

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:40.541
That is going to be,
that's a one, this is a one

00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:42.045
and then this is just going to be,

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:44.028
five to the n plus one
divided by five to the n,

00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:46.017
that's just going to be a five.

00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:47.147
And so what do we have?

00:02:47.147 --> 00:02:49.476
We have x times n.

00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:50.309
x times n,

00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:54.778
over, distribute the five,

00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:55.611
five n,

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:58.262
five n plus one.

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:00.771
Oh, let me be careful there.

00:03:00.771 --> 00:03:01.791
Let me distribute the five.

00:03:01.791 --> 00:03:03.208
Five n plus five,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.948
five times n, five times one.

00:03:05.948 --> 00:03:07.448
Five n plus one.

00:03:07.448 --> 00:03:09.506
Five n plus five (chuckles).

00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:12.333
All right, so let me just rewrite that.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:14.745
This is going to be equal to

00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:15.578
the limit

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:19.363
as n approaches infinity

00:03:19.363 --> 00:03:22.863
of the absolute value of this thing.

00:03:22.863 --> 00:03:24.509
And actually to help us with this limit,

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:26.021
let me rewrite it a little bit.

00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:28.487
Let me divide the numerator
and the denominator both by n.

00:03:28.487 --> 00:03:30.012
I'm not changing the value,
I'm doing the same thing

00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:31.543
to the numerator and the denominator.

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:33.007
I'm dividing it by the same value.

00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:35.508
So if I divide the numerator
and the denominator by n,

00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:38.758
this is going to be the same thing as x

00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:40.604
over

00:03:41.446 --> 00:03:42.932
five

00:03:42.932 --> 00:03:44.515
plus five to the n.

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:47.826
So when you divided the numerator
and the denominator by n,

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:50.742
it becomes very clear what
happens as n approaches infinity,

00:03:50.742 --> 00:03:52.998
As n approaches infinity,
x doesn't change,

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:54.051
five doesn't change,

00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:56.755
but five over n goes to zero.

00:03:56.755 --> 00:04:00.922
And so this limit is going
to be equal to x over five.

00:04:02.155 --> 00:04:04.707
So that's a pretty neat, clean thing.

00:04:04.707 --> 00:04:06.533
Now we can use this to think about,

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:07.502
and actually let me write this.

00:04:07.502 --> 00:04:11.538
This is going to be the
absolute value of x over five.

00:04:11.538 --> 00:04:13.493
Now we can think about
under which conditions

00:04:13.493 --> 00:04:15.311
is the absolute value of x over five

00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:16.554
going to be less than one

00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:18.286
and we're definitely gonna converge?

00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:19.560
Under what conditions are we going to be

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.603
greater than one and definitely diverge?

00:04:21.603 --> 00:04:24.666
And then under what
conditions is it inconclusive?

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:27.388
So let's just see when
we know we can converge.

00:04:27.388 --> 00:04:30.728
So the absolute value of x over five

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:32.662
is less than one.

00:04:32.662 --> 00:04:34.745
This is our convergence situation.

00:04:34.745 --> 00:04:36.489
Well, that's the same thing as saying

00:04:36.489 --> 00:04:38.322
that x negative one

00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:41.798
is less than x over five,

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:45.376
which is less than one.

00:04:47.235 --> 00:04:49.511
And you multiply all the sides by five.

00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:51.906
This is the same thing as negative five

00:04:51.906 --> 00:04:53.696
is less than x,

00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:55.239
which is less than five.

00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:57.022
So if we know that this is true,

00:04:57.022 --> 00:04:58.446
this is definitely going to be part

00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:00.652
of the interval of convergence.

00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:02.984
We know that if x meets these constraints,

00:05:02.984 --> 00:05:05.504
then our series is going to converge.

00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:06.554
But we're not done yet.

00:05:06.554 --> 00:05:09.951
We have to think about
the inconclusive case.

00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:11.190
So let's think about the scenario

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.805
where the absolute value of x over five,

00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:18.537
absolute value of x over
five is equal to one.

00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:20.778
Or another way of thinking about this,

00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:22.750
that means x over five is equal to one

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.643
or x over five is equal to negative one.

00:05:26.643 --> 00:05:29.752
And this means that x is equal to five

00:05:29.752 --> 00:05:32.585
or x is equal to negative five.

00:05:34.047 --> 00:05:36.040
So these are the two inconclusive cases

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.514
using the ratio test.

00:05:37.514 --> 00:05:39.048
So let's test them out individually

00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:40.531
by looking back at the series

00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:42.300
and just substituting x equals five

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.048
or x equals negative five.

00:05:44.048 --> 00:05:45.781
So in the first scenario,

00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:49.755
let me find a new color
here, let me use red.

00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:51.996
So the first scenario of x equals five,

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:53.053
let's go to our series.

00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:56.220
Then the series is going to be the sum

00:05:57.198 --> 00:05:59.615
from n equals one to infinity

00:06:00.475 --> 00:06:02.392
of five to the n over n

00:06:04.733 --> 00:06:06.400
times five to the n.

00:06:07.358 --> 00:06:10.782
Well, this is just going
to be equal to the sum

00:06:10.782 --> 00:06:12.799
n equals one to infinity

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:13.966
of one over n.

00:06:15.011 --> 00:06:16.477
This is a harmonic series.

00:06:16.477 --> 00:06:20.989
This is the p-series
where p is equal to one.

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:23.517
And we know our p-series
of p is equal to one.

00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:25.994
That's going to diverge.

00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:28.001
And we know the harmonic series
we've done in other videos,

00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:30.042
this definitely diverges.

00:06:30.042 --> 00:06:31.510
So this diverges.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.314
You could do that by
p-series convergence test.

00:06:34.314 --> 00:06:36.798
If the p for a p-series is one,

00:06:36.798 --> 00:06:38.492
well you're gonna diverge.

00:06:38.492 --> 00:06:39.558
So now let's think about,

00:06:39.558 --> 00:06:41.053
so five is definitely not part

00:06:41.053 --> 00:06:44.159
of our interval of convergence.

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:46.151
Now let's think about
x equals negative five.

00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:48.780
When x equals negative five,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.587
let me get a another color going here.

00:06:51.587 --> 00:06:54.509
When x is equal to negative five,

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:57.265
then this thing is going to be equal to

00:06:57.265 --> 00:07:00.058
the sum from n equals one

00:07:00.058 --> 00:07:03.225
to infinity of negative five to the n.

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:06.232
Actually let me just write that as,

00:07:06.232 --> 00:07:09.290
I'll write it out negative five to the n

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.540
over n times five to the n.

00:07:12.414 --> 00:07:15.017
This is the same thing as the sum

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:18.023
from n equals one to infinity.

00:07:18.023 --> 00:07:20.813
We could write this as
negative one to the n

00:07:20.813 --> 00:07:22.313
times five to the,

00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:24.614
times

00:07:26.006 --> 00:07:27.995
five to the n,

00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:30.245
over n times five to the n.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.570
And now this thing,

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.269
this is an alternating harmonic series.

00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:37.044
And so you could actually use the,

00:07:37.044 --> 00:07:38.810
you might already know
that that converges,

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.025
or you could use the
alternating series test.

00:07:42.025 --> 00:07:43.319
The alternating series test,

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:46.050
it might be a little bit
clearer if I write it like this.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.954
That this is an alternating series.

00:07:48.954 --> 00:07:51.704
So in an alternating series test,

00:07:53.237 --> 00:07:57.541
if we see that this thing
is monotonically decreasing

00:07:57.541 --> 00:08:00.492
and the limit as n
approaches infinity is zero,

00:08:00.492 --> 00:08:01.506
this thing converges.

00:08:01.506 --> 00:08:04.256
The alternating harmonic
series actually converges.

00:08:04.256 --> 00:08:05.756
So this converges.

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:08.562
So given that this converges,

00:08:08.562 --> 00:08:10.317
you could view this as this boundary here.

00:08:10.317 --> 00:08:13.215
We would include that in
our interval of convergence.

00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:14.641
So x doesn't just have to be

00:08:14.641 --> 00:08:16.168
strictly greater than negative five,

00:08:16.168 --> 00:08:18.521
it could be greater than
or equal to negative five,

00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:20.515
but it has to be less than five.

00:08:20.515 --> 00:08:23.932
This is our true interval of convergence.
