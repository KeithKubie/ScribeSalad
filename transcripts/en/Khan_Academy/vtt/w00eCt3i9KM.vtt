00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.300
- [Instructor] What we have here

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.400
is a graph of y is equal to f of x,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.160
and these numbers are the
areas of these shaded regions,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.530
these regions between
our curve and the x-axis.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.890
What we're going to do in
this video is do some examples

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.970
of evaluating definite
integrals using this information

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.670
and some knowledge of
definite integral properties.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.300
So let's start with an example.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.650
Let's say we want to evaluate
the definite integral

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.650
going from negative four
to negative two of f of x

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.360
d of x plus the definite
integral going from

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.760
negative two to zero of f of x dx.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.090
Pause this video, and see if you can

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.993
evaluate this entire expression.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.470
So this first part of our expression,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.880
the definite integral from negative four

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.020
to negative two of f of x dx,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.590
we're going from x equals negative four

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.660
to x equals negative two.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.820
And so this would evaluate as

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.960
this area

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.360
between our curve and our x-axis,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.330
but it would be the negative of that area

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.630
because our curve is below the x-axis.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.040
And we could try to estimate it

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.520
based on the information they've given us,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.890
but they haven't given
us exactly that value.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.180
But we also need to figure
out this right over here.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.630
And here we're going from x
equals negative two to zero

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.623
of f of x d of x, so that's
going to be this area.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.690
So if you're looking at the sum of these

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.970
two definite integrals, and
notice the upper bound here

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.400
is the lower bound here,
you're really thinking about,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.260
this is really going to
be the same thing as,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.600
this is equal to the definite integral

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.830
going from x equals negative four

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.640
all the way to x equals zero of f of x dx.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.480
And this is indeed one of
our integration properties.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.500
If our upper bound here is the
same as our lower bound here

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.100
and we are integrating the same thing,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.800
well, then you can merge these two

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.350
definite integrals in this way.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.710
And this is just going
to be this entire area.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.060
But because we are below the x-axis

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.070
and above our curve here,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.800
it would be the negative of that area.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.670
So this is going to be
equal to negative seven.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.880
Let's do another example.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.590
Let's say someone were to ask you,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.260
walk up you on the street and say, quick,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.700
here's a graph, what is
the value of the expression

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.700
that I'm about to write down,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.360
the definite integral going
from zero to four of f of x dx

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.530
plus the definite integral
going from four to six

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.280
of f of x dx?

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.020
Pause this video, and see
if you can figure that out.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.690
Well, once again, this
first part right over here,

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.150
going from zero to four,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.360
so what would be is it would be this area.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.960
It would be this five right over here,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.410
but then we would need
to subtract this area

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.790
because this area is below our
x-axis and above our curve.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.700
We don't know exactly what this is.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.080
But luckily we also need,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.760
we need to take the sum of
everything I just showed,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.400
but plus,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.190
plus this right over here.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.060
And this, we're going from four to six,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.913
so it's going to be this area.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.360
Well, once again, when
you look at it this way,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.670
you can see that this expression

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.700
is going to be equivalent to
taking the definite integral

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.210
all the way from zero to six,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.820
zero to six of f of x dx.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.950
And once again, even if
you didn't see the graph,

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.530
you would know that
because, in both cases,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.400
you're getting the definite
integral of f of x dx.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.660
And our upper bound here
is our lower bound here.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.680
So once again, we're able
to merge the integrals.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.280
And what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.680
Well, we have this area
here, which is five.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.960
And then we have this area, which is six.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.270
That was given to us.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.200
But since it's below the
x-axis and above our curve,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.010
when we evaluate it as
a definite integral,

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.660
it would evaluate as a negative six.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.910
So this is going to be
five plus negative six,

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.120
which is equal to negative one.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.953
And we're done.
