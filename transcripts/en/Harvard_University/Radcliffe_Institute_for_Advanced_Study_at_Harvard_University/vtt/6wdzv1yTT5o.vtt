[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.390
- This is in no way going
to encompass my practice.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.150
This is going to
talk specifically

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.475
about this one sort
of large-scale project

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:15.350
I'm in the middle of.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.345
And yeah, let's go.

00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:24.470
OK, so negative space, so I want
to talk a little bit about what

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.260
I mean when I say that word.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.430
Negative space, as it's
typically understood,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.980
is a formal or art term
that is the space between,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.500
under, around, inside an
object or subject of interest.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.640
It is the atmosphere, unseen
matter, the non-event.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.580
Positive space is
the subject object,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.420
the thing around which we orient
our understanding of what is,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.490
and thereby, what isn't.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.810
So this sets up a kind of binary
that I find really problematic,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.680
where you have this sort
of shapeless absence

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.460
as the negative,
and the occupation,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.907
or defined space,
as the positive.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.560
As with any binary, I'm
interested in removing

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.180
the primary.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.640
I don't think binaries are
inherently problematic.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.770
It's the imbalance of
power within a binary

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.680
that I am always kind of
interested in undoing.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.520
So my reading on negative space
is that it has its own agency,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.570
that it is unfixed.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.240
It's dynamic, changeable,
and ultimately,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.460
free to form and reform.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.500
So I find negative space
to be really exciting.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.390
Because the positive
space is kind of stuck.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.160
And the negative space
is the thing that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.930
has the most potential, really.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.010
So this is the reason
it's very hard for me

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.840
to talk about this
work in under an hour.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.100
This is a diagram of
some kind of order

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.295
I tried to give to this project.

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:06.170
I'm not even trying to
get into that for you.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.630
But to clarify
that a little bit,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.730
if you look at the top row, you
see body, land, water, power,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.830
void.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.130
Those sort of became subjects
that helped me organize this

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.070
into something--

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.590
to five chapters.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.456
And so this is becoming
a series of five sort

00:02:28.456 --> 00:02:29.580
of large-scale video works.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.140
And then there's kind of a
trickle down of other output

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.690
that's wall works and sculptures
that kind of can fit anywhere

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.150
within this.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.040
They're kind of
responding to, I would

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.410
say, their material
output in relation

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.690
to ideas in the videos.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.737
But they're not objects
that are strictly fixed,

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:48.820
any one of these chapters.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.650
So currently, I completed the
sun or power chapter, "A Smeary

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.020
Spot."

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.540
I just completed
"Living Room," which

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.050
is the piece that's at
the New Museum, which

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.450
is the chapter on the body.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.100
And I'm partway into
"Leave No Trace,"

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.780
which is the land chapter.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.940
And what you'll see in
the gallery next door

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.400
is an audio project
that's actually

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.230
the soundtrack for that work.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.280
So having an experiment in which
I tried to make the soundtrack

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.407
before I made the work--

00:03:29.407 --> 00:03:30.740
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.580
But we'll find out.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.380
So I started with the
premise that I wanted

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.160
to make a science fiction.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.650
And my reason for being
interested in science fiction

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.180
is I wanted to work between
fantasy and politics.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.270
I also am interested in
both utopia and dystopia.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.190
So for me, utopia is,
what's possible is

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.810
what you can imagine.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.520
And dystopia is,
what's happening

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.140
is worse than you can imagine.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.610
So I'm kind of flux between
those two worlds in this work.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.230
That means that there
are times when--

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.070
well, let me just say that I
think that utopia is important,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.390
in terms of I believe all
political change stems

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.620
from utopic visions.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.110
You have to think much bigger
than what you can accomplish.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.180
And that's the beginning step
to like moving progressively

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.480
in kind of any
break with what we

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.840
know is the sort of form
of politics or society

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.616
at any point.

00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:36.990
And for me, the
dystopic is a way

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.290
to reflect on all
of the crap that's

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.670
going on at the same time
that I'm making this work.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.210
Speculative present--
so this work

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.170
is set in what I call
a speculative present.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.470
That means that I'm really
interested in the now.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.500
I'm interested in
the idea that the now

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:05.650
is always becoming both the past
and the future simultaneously.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.962
So it's a highly active space.

00:05:08.962 --> 00:05:10.920
Also, I think if you want
to change the future,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.620
you have to change the now.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.980
So aesthetically, the way this
is set up is it doesn't have--

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.730
it's a science
fiction that doesn't--

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.730
it's not a 2001 Odyssey.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:30.180
We don't have slick, futuristic
machines, and spaceships,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.620
and things like that.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.340
I'm interested in like
that the future is--

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.190
I like to think of the
future like a iPhone

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.830
with a cracked face.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.660
You have technology,
but you don't

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.700
have enough money to fix it.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.578
OK?

00:05:46.578 --> 00:05:48.470
It seems a lot more practical.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.900
All right, acting agents, this
is another principle for me,

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.970
is that the performers
in this work

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:02.420
are not performing subjects,
or characters, or nouns even.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.390
They might be nouns,
actually, sometimes.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.640
But the performer's
actually actions.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.800
They're phenomena.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.030
They're agents of change.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.030
They're symbolizing various
sort of metaphysical aspects

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.009
of the world.

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:26.550
And I'll explain
them more when I get

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.475
to the different acting agents.

00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:30.600
But that also means that
I don't see the performers

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.900
as protagonists.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.360
So it's an inversion of
thinking, cinematic thinking.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.510
I actually see the
site, or the stage,

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.110
or whatever location I'm
working in as the protagonist.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.950
So in the first film, that's
the desert, or the black box

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.460
theater.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.680
In the second one, it's
this building in which

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.390
the whole piece is set.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.030
And the last thing I want
to talk about to preface

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.080
this is, matter is what does.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:05.910
So that is, a thinking in
which all matter is animate.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.050
It's an idea of acknowledging
that all matter is constantly

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.170
changing.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.080
There's nothing
consistent about matter.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.390
And so if we start to look kind
of fundamentally at the tiniest

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:30.640
parts of our being as
constantly changing,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.610
the things that we see as
fixed are really just ways

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.050
that we organize the world.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.370
And so this is a little
bit about entering

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.660
an alternate space of accepting
that the order of things

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.640
is not as we perceive
them inherently.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.940
Oh, and queer--

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.170
OK, one more.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.170
So queer, for me, is
something that I would

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.329
like to sort of divorce from.

00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:03.120
I don't want to divorce
it from its history

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.220
as a word from the homosexual
movement and narrative.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.470
I think it's important that
it hold onto that history.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.640
But I think it's
not really useful.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.840
That's not a useful
anchor in its meaning now

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.230
or in the future.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.380
And by that, I mean I
have friends who are--

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.580
a trans woman and
a trans man dating.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.630
Are they homosexuals?

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.667
No, but they're queer.

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:38.500
There's a lot of other
examples I could use.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.679
But I think that
what I want to think

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:45.630
about queer as is a
space of what I'm calling

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.220
un-assimilated difference.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.200
And then it also
becomes, maybe, a space

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.720
for a more kind of
intersectional thinking

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.780
about what a queer body
is, and that it's not

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.330
fixed to your sexual
orientation inherently.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.000
And there's a lot of
un-assimilated bodies

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.790
in the world--

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.900
and that we might
advocate for that,

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.050
or champion that as a
better way of moving

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.730
through the world instead
of assimilation, which

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.080
is how most things work.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.310
OK, "A Smeary Spot," here we go.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:24.162
So the installation
is a four-channel.

00:09:24.162 --> 00:09:25.620
There's three large
channels, which

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.330
are like 7 foot screens,
7 by 12 foot screens.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.740
And then there's a small monitor
at the end, which you can see.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.960
And that cycles
through the credits.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.750
The credits are kept
separate, so that the film

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.810
can run as a seamless loop.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:51.632
And also because the credits
are not just everyone

00:09:51.632 --> 00:09:52.590
who worked on the film.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.390
But they also carry
some like kind

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.330
of footnotes that maybe give
you some of the information

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.530
that I was just giving.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.220
It's different than the
information I just gave you,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.890
but there's a lot
of clues about how

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.730
to read the work that is in the
way that I wrote the credits.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.220
So I'm treating the credits
kind of as their own piece.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:11.989
This is similar.

00:10:11.989 --> 00:10:13.530
I just brightened
this one up, so you

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.550
can see it a little better.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.980
But also, the three
screams are installed

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:25.830
at like a 10 degree angle in the
space, so that they actually--

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.440
this is a very long space
that was installed in,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.600
sort of narrow corridor.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.620
That angle in the wall
makes the work kind

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.830
of hold the space
in a way that's

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.696
very different than when
projections happen on a wall

00:10:43.696 --> 00:10:44.570
or on a flat surface.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.141
They become sort of bodies
or presences of their own.

00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:49.640
And I'm really
interested in the way

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.270
video is and can be sculptural.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:58.370
Also, the seating
is an office chairs.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.710
Part of that is there's
office chairs that

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.130
show up in the video.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.310
But also, I'm interested
in this like--

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.200
they kind of imply
labor, but labor that

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.450
happens while you're seated.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.002
And I want you to be
a very active viewer.

00:11:12.002 --> 00:11:13.460
There's also six
channels of sound.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:18.467
And the sound moves from screen
to screen, or brackets you.

00:11:18.467 --> 00:11:19.175
It's very active.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:28.110
I actually hope that someone is
motivated to move with the work

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.235
to a certain degree, even if
it's just their attention.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.990
In this installation,
there's also--

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.990
I've installed it twice.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.156
And there's been two different
sculptures like this.

00:11:40.156 --> 00:11:41.050
And so this is one.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.300
It's a process that I've
been using for a while, where

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.740
I've been casting sand.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.429
So that's sand that
I dyed that's black.

00:11:47.429 --> 00:11:48.970
Those are the
sandbags, that are also

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.400
cast into it-- the white bits.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.120
And then the top
chunk is concrete.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.520
So it's got this
kind of strange kind

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.260
of strata sort of cavernous
natural form meeting

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:11.140
this industrial sort
of building bit--

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.890
industrial building bit, yes.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.710
And ensconced in that is what--
may be hard to see-- but it

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.200
you can see kind of the
spine of the office chair.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.330
So I was sort of interested in--

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.110
the chair is this object
of mobility, or movement,

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.900
or fluidity in
the room, and then

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:44.720
this kind of fossilizing of that
object in this sort of Earth

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.599
monument piece.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.140
And those are the
wheels sticking out

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.700
of the top of the work.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.980
This is another
version of this, which

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.590
is the chair has been taken
apart a little bit more.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.050
And it's displayed
on pedestals that

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.200
are made out of
the packing boxes

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.760
that the chairs were shipped in.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.030
And then the work is
actually cast inside the box.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.870
So the shape of the work is--

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.310
you can see some of the relief,
I think, of the cardboard

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.215
in the sand casting.

00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:20.590
All right, the other thing
that's on display in this work

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:25.470
is this poster, which is
the script for the work.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:31.590
And part of the reason I gave
the script is because what I've

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.730
done is collected a
lot of texts that I

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.450
was reading that influenced
the making of this work.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.810
And I wove the text together.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.750
But also, they're being
recited in the work

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.850
by different acting agents.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.030
One thing I had an issue
with is some of the texts

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.350
were coming from
like theory texts.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:05.380
And so they're terribly dull
to listen to someone recite.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.590
So I took some liberties to
change some of the language

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.880
to make it, let's say,
readable, reciteable,

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.560
without changing the
meaning too much.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.610
And then the other
thing that was

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.070
important to me, is a lot of
theory texts and other texts,

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.900
when they refer to humans, they
usually use the word he, right?

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.670
So it's often gendered.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.560
So in any place where
gender shows up,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.560
I've gone in and
made it first person.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.210
So you can see it says, like, "I
became" in that line up there.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.790
But it was important to me, that
if I'm taking other people's

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.581
words, and especially
if I'm altering them,

00:14:38.581 --> 00:14:43.260
that it was revealed in some
way in the installation.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.140
This work is set
in two locations.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:52.510
One part of it takes place
in a black box theater.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:57.670
The theater is something I came
to after being in the desert.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.830
And I was thinking a
lot about the desert

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:05.020
as a kind of negative
space, thinking a lot

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.270
about the fullness
of that absence

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.210
that you feel when you're
in a space that big.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:15.092
Also, and a lot of ideas about
the chapter that I will develop

00:15:15.092 --> 00:15:17.050
about the void started
to come into play, where

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:21.180
I was thinking, in
this site of absences

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.350
is, again, like sort
of the most potential.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.840
And the theater became a
really good analogy for that.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.410
Because one, on film,
the black box theater

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.635
dissipates into sort of nothing.

00:15:31.635 --> 00:15:33.010
Because you can
give the illusion

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:37.300
of emerging from nothing.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.300
And also that the theater is
a space of constant becoming.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.130
It's always making
and unmaking itself.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:51.880
And the other thing that's
central in the theater space

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.750
is this waste pile.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.100
So this waste pile was inspired
by a quote by Jack Smith.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.710
Jack Smith was a filmmaker
and performance artist

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:06.010
prominent in the '50s and '60s,
a queer icon of sorts, for me,

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:06.700
certainly.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.740
So he imagined a
society where the dump

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.400
is the central site of economic
and intellectual exchange.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.100
So this is really a
homage to that idea.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.190
And everything that happens
in the theater is built from

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.440
or goes back into this pile.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.310
And then the desert--

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.920
so I can't give you
the whole background

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.410
story of getting to the desert.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:40.520
But let's just say, I fell
in love with the Utah desert.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.800
And while I was there,
one of the big things

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.560
that emerged for me
was I found myself

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.820
on a lot of public lands.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.175
And this also became a
kind of foundational thing

00:16:52.175 --> 00:16:54.050
for how I was going to
think about this work.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.960
I guess maybe I should
give a little background

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.609
on public lands.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:06.190
People know what
public lands are?

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.790
Yes, no?

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.109
Yes.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.557
Do we have time for that?

00:17:10.557 --> 00:17:12.890
How about this, research
public lands if you don't know.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.348
I probably don't have enough
time to tell you all about it.

00:17:15.348 --> 00:17:16.640
I'm so sorry.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.740
Anyway, so public
lands, in a brief,

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.240
though, is a site
where you can--

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.750
it's an unlike private
property, or reservation land,

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.740
or national forests.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.400
There's not really a sign of
when you enter or you exit it.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.100
The rules are not obvious.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.140
It's protected by the
Bureau of Land Management

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.100
et cetera, et cetera.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:44.740
So you can kind of exist there.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.230
It's kind of what I like to
think of as a socialist anomaly

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.011
in our capitalist society.

00:17:52.011 --> 00:17:53.510
And while it has a
lot of problems--

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.718
I'm not going to get into
the real political problems

00:17:55.718 --> 00:17:57.380
of public lands--

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.510
it proposed for me one of
the utopic ideas for me,

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.980
which is, if we unfix
ourselves from property,

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.310
what kind of society or what
kind of body emerges from that?

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.630
And quickly, this
is the map of Utah.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.360
Everything that is
yellow is public lands.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.260
So 70% of Utah is public lands.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.035
So there's massive
swaths of space.

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:26.120
Also, when you're
in public lands,

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.411
it's really like feels endless.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.990
Another thing I ran into while
I was out there is Lake Powell.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.629
Lake Powell-- I think this
is kind of obvious just

00:18:39.629 --> 00:18:40.670
by looking at this image.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.110
But it's very surreal looking.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.230
And of course, I was
attracted to the surrealism

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.180
of much of the
landscape there, which

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:52.130
is why I started to stage
this science fiction there.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:59.810
But I, later on, discovered
that it was a damned canyon.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.850
And so the reason it
looks the way that it does

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.400
is because it's essentially
like a full glass of water.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.650
There's no real
edge to this water.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.159
There's no particulation.

00:19:08.159 --> 00:19:09.950
It's just these sort
of rocks emerging out.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.140
And then when you dive
into the water, of course,

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.112
it's this canyon
that's down there.

00:19:14.112 --> 00:19:16.070
And so when I discovered
this, it became like--

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.340
well, it's deeply sad.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.820
You have to imagine,
then, that there's

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.040
this tremendous world
under there that's

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.780
been submerged by this decision
for intervention into the land.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.790
So that has actually--

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.140
I'm diverging from this
project for a second here,

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.920
which is, that led me to
doing a series of works

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.940
that you're actually going
to see in the Radcliffe show.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.460
And these were taken
by Todd Nichols.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.547
The black and white photos were
taken by Todd Nichols in 1956.

00:19:50.547 --> 00:19:51.380
He's a photographer.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.600
He went to Glen Canyon,
which was the name of it

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.500
it became Lake Powell.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.530
And that's the Colorado River
that runs through Glen Canyon.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:05.005
And he went and documented
and archived that landscape.

00:20:05.005 --> 00:20:07.130
And so I made these works
where I ripped images out

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:12.410
of his catalog, and made these
sort of liquid interventions

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.440
of either kind of
tracing what would

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.100
seem like the new line of
water, and what has disappeared.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.140
Or sometimes, it's just
more aggressive kind

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.380
of ejaculations on the page.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:30.280
But this sort of
notion of obscuring,

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.900
or a mark of that
kind of loss of what's

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.474
happened to that landscape.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.810
I'm going to play a
clip just quickly.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.094
This is going to be a
scene that moves us.

00:20:44.094 --> 00:20:45.510
Part of why I'm
playing this scene

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:51.240
is it starts with Matana
Roberts on saxophone.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.000
It will move to
Mother Flawless, who

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.640
plays a clairvoyant psyche--

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.492
and by that, I mean mind.

00:20:58.492 --> 00:21:00.908
So again, we're talking about
the metaphysical character--

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:09.780
and who is reciting a
quote from Karen Barad's,

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.670
"What is the measure of

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.470

important to this work,

be inside the work.

That's the obsurveyer.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.660
So I was thinking
a lot about land

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:54.240
surveying as a first stage in
kind of monetizing or dividing

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.440
up land.

But this character spends their
time in the desert observing.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.320
And they also kind of perform
being the camera in a way.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.100
Because they're always
holding the camera.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.240
And as you noticed, like, the
camera on the other screen

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.860
is being adjusted.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.341
It's sort of more alive
than the landscape

00:26:17.341 --> 00:26:18.340
in a way at that moment.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.610
The other thing that
occurs in the desert

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:30.240
is we follow two, what
I call, free radicals.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:35.430
And that is a pun on both the
electron-seeking molecule--

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:40.110
like an unstable molecule
that's useful for modes

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:43.260
of combustion and other
things that free radicals are

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.140
good at--

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:51.120
and also, kind of a radicalized
body, or a agent of protest,

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.822
like somebody who's
embodying that.

00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:56.280
And I like this
idea that something

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.640
could be both like kind
of human and molecule.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:10.080
So they spend a lot of their
time collecting material waste.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.910
The waste that exists in a kind
of focused way in the black box

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.300
theater kind of exist
on their bodies.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.060
They are kind of always
collecting, and loading up,

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.180
and unloading as they move
through the landscape.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.820
Here they're collecting
water from a leaky pipe.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.124
And water becomes also--

00:27:31.124 --> 00:27:32.790
I mentioned this
before about the water.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.706
But one of the big things
for me about the dam

00:27:34.706 --> 00:27:39.000
was [SIGHS] just thinking
about water that flows

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.550
and water that's controlled,
and things that flows

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.204
and things that are controlled.

00:27:43.204 --> 00:27:45.120
And so then the leak
becomes really important.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.560
Because it's this place where,
even when we try and control

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.730
things, things escape.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:28:01.660
And this is sort
of a dance sequence

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.160
that, for me, is
like a kind of take

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.750
on flagging, which is
part of queer culture--

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:12.460
is historically used to identify
that someone, one, was queer,

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.095
and two, what they
might want from you,

00:28:16.095 --> 00:28:17.470
or what you might
want from them.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.970

with me, Niv Acosta, and Jen

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.260
Rosenblit, to the desert.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:32.280
And you might
actually be flagging

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.070
like the sun, and the
water, and the atmosphere--

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:39.460
like, that the
fighting might occur

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:44.510
not as a human interaction,
but as a kind of way

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:50.090
of visibility or engagement
with an environment.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.850
There's also a sequence
in which they measure.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:55.410
It's kind of a dance
sequence also--

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:56.737
a little more abstract--

00:28:56.737 --> 00:28:58.820

moving through the landscape

and measuring the
space with their body.

And then, in the theater,
what's happening in the theater,

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.480
most often, is these
series of recitations

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.831

hold the work together.

But the idea was important.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.380
It was real.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:16.000
Like all walls, it was
ambiguous, two-faced

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.860
What was inside and what
was outside depended

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.220

- So I extracted that from the
three channels, by the way.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.890
So there's other
channels that are active.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:15.550

the cinematic scale, a feel,

so once we move

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:25.750

are all wearing

means a black T-shirt, jeans,

00:32:38.105 --> 00:32:39.730
any time there's a
recitation going on,

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.960
it's kind of really focused
on a single activity,

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.780
or gesture, and the language.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:53.320

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.880
It continues on throughout.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.790

like, the material
of our contemporary,

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.290
like the commerce
around nomad-ism

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:30.010
in contemporary culture.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.620
And this is another scene.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:37.260
Jen Rosenblit does this
incredible job of caking--

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.790
it starts out kind of
like a light mud mask,

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:42.490
and quickly turns
into this kind of--

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.670
she becomes completely
ensconced in the mud,

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.999
and actually, sort of
becomes the landscape.

00:33:51.999 --> 00:33:53.790
And this becomes an
important thing for me,

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:56.700
is looking for ways in which
the work in the theater

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.200
can move us back
into the desert.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.250
Because at one point when
I was working on this work,

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.500
I was really like, oh, my god.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.680
I have like this stark black
and the brightness of--

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.100
everything felt really
binary all of the sudden

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.840
between these two worlds.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.010
And so I started to develop some
of this visual material that

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:17.190
helped move me between
these two worlds.

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.040
This is the shapeshifter.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.290
So this is her in her natural
state of perpetual becoming.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:26.880
So she's getting ready always.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:32.460
Played by [? Marcelo ?]
[? Gutierrez. ?] And one of her

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:36.473
tasks is taking care of
this Chelsea Manning jacket,

00:34:36.473 --> 00:34:38.639
which she does kind of in
a loving and fetish-y kind

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:40.889
of way, like stroking
and caring for it.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:44.520
And Chelsea Manning's jacket
shows up in the second piece

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.760
as well.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.780
But what I'm kind of
interested in with Chelsea--

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.290
and this is kind of
this way that the now

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.880
shows up in this work.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.620
So there's always
a kind of layer

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.740
of real political event
merging with this kind

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.550
of strange fantastical space.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:05.490
But Manning, for me, is
another kind of leak, right?

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:13.890
So it's not only the information
leaks, but also a leaky body,

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:20.140
a body that's not fitting, or
is transitioning, et cetera.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:30.180
So the shapeshifter, when
she's not in her natural state,

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.040
becomes other things.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:37.050
In this case, this is kind of
a remake of a famous painting,

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.530
for anyone who's not
familiar with art history--

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.180

ever saying that right--

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.380
"Screwball Asses."

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.420
So it's kind of taking this
vision of the prostitute

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.420
through Marcelo's body.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:14.440
And the text kind of speaks
of the virtues of womanhood

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.054
through a vision of
the lesbian body.

00:36:18.054 --> 00:36:19.720
Anyway, you can imagine
where that goes.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.170
OK, so the other.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.490
Character is Aunt Be/e.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:28.000
This is Aunt Be/e.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.190
This is a shapeshifter
as Aunt Be/e.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:38.752
So Aunt Be/e, that's B-E
slash E, as in being, or a--

00:36:38.752 --> 00:36:40.138
OK, you get it.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:48.010
And that's because this
character is also--

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:53.010
so Aunt Be/e is performing
as reproductive labor.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.130
And this is what
a little insight

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:02.000
in how I develop the character,
is I was thinking about bees.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.740
Because that's a really
obvious idea about labor.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.210
And I found this
fantastic photo of a bee.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:15.830
And that got me to creating the
yellow dust on [? Neyland ?]

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:17.637
for this scene.

00:37:17.637 --> 00:37:19.220
Now I'm not interested
in, when people

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.850
watch my work, that they,
like, get all of that.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:26.390
I'm interested in you
having an experience,

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.100
and that there's
something kind of--

00:37:31.505 --> 00:37:35.420
I'm into manipulating
people, actually.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.550
I want to seduce you with
a certain amount of image

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.589
and sound, so that
you kind of believe me

00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:40.880
whatever I put in front of you.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.450
And so you could unpack this
work with that level of detail.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:47.780
But I'm sort of more
interested in that you just

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.044
become kind of absorbed
in the sort of world

00:37:50.044 --> 00:37:50.960
that I create for you.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:56.480
And anyway, so
reproductive labor

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.750
is set with the
task of operating

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:03.130
a Xerox machine and a juicer.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:11.890
The juicer I'm
interested in, because it

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:16.600
changes a solid to a liquid.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.640
It also has kind of
a component of waste

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.220
that happens that's really
beautiful, and then also

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.080
for the aesthetic reasons.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.192
So this also allowed me to
create the scene in which we

00:38:26.192 --> 00:38:28.150
get something that's very
similar to the strata

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.050
in the desert.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:33.369
And it also became like
a way to segue into--

00:38:33.369 --> 00:38:34.910
and I was also
interested in this one

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:39.050
with the sort of overflow
excess that occurs.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:44.810
So the exhibition "Shabby But
Thriving" at the New Museum

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:47.960
is the second in the series.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.690
It's the video that's
based around the body.

00:38:53.826 --> 00:38:55.700
A lot of the way this
work is being developed

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.220
is sort of with the resources
I can glean to make it.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.527
So through the
residency at the museum,

00:39:01.527 --> 00:39:03.110
they offer you to
work in the building

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.510
next door to the New Museum,
which is this old Bowery

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.580
building that's dilapidated.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:11.517
And they're actually going
to be rent renovating it

00:39:11.517 --> 00:39:12.350
into the New Museum.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.330
But that's a future story.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:17.160
So what I started to
think, I was, like, OK,

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.420
how am I going from the
desert to the theater?

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.190
Does it make sense
to be in a building?

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.929
Does that even make
sense to be in a city?

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:26.720
So then I got really
interested in the idea

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.920
that the building
was its own body,

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.670
and that we could do this whole
piece sort of hermetically

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:33.607
sealed in this building.

00:39:33.607 --> 00:39:34.940
We would never leave this space.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.640
And it would be this
sort of internal world,

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.490
and bodies within
antibodies that would occur.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.630
So the insulation
is set up with what

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.220
is a kind of quasi-living room.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.650
There's a carpet that's
pretty filthy at this point,

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.150
because it's a light
colored carpet.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:56.330
So it attracts everyone
who walks through it.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:40:02.210
There's this couch, which
is kind of excerpted.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:03.410
I'll go to this scene.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:06.110
So there's a scene--

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:11.250
there's three children that
occupy couches with underglow.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.780
They're kind of
like planets, right?

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:22.720
And so this object in the
room is a gutted couch.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.030
There's a scene in which
the couches become gutted,

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.440
ultimately.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:32.930
And then it's propped up on
these cast dirt bags of soil.

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:36.952
And that's developed from
one of the scenes which

00:40:36.952 --> 00:40:38.035
you can kind of see here--

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.450
this couch on the
left, actually--

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:48.220
which was built around the idea
that each one of the children

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:53.560
is a different celestial
body, AKA a dwarf planet.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.630
So that's Pluto.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.790
And the dirt bags
are kind of, for me,

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:03.270
reminiscent of the narrative
behind the name of Pluto,

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.310
which is, one, the
god of the underworld.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.080
But more importantly,
it can be also seen

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:14.440
as like a mineral, resources,
and the keeper of the earth,

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.580
and soil, and stuff like that.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.360
Anyway, so the
seats of the couch

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.070
have been replaced with
these bags of dirt.

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:25.810
And so that's where
this sculpture

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:32.810
object skeleton thing developed
from that's in the room.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:36.680
And also, what you see
here is you've got--

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.240
I'm going to go to
this one again--

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.210
a false wall that
was built. So you've

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:43.290
got it sort of raw,
drywall, false wall.

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:46.100
I was interested in the sort
of exposed architecture.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.290
And then what the
second screen is

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:49.790
a actually a piece
of drywall that's

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.244
been leaned against the wall.

00:41:52.244 --> 00:41:53.660
So you have these
kind of elements

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.840
of a building being built
within this environment

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.130
of the installation.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:02.780
All right, so there are these
children, which I have already

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.780
explained are--

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:10.520
they occupy what is
the living room space.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.440
And the living room is
also called the psyche.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.360
These are things that are
also noted in the credits,

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.734
like they were in
the last piece.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.550
And I got interested in
the idea of dwarf planets,

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.860
not only because the
children are small--

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.990
I like really easy connections.

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:29.341
I'm really interested
in easy connections.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:39.510
But there's something about the
dwarf planet, especially Pluto,

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:43.470
which you know was kicked
out of the solar system.

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:46.940
I'm interested in this idea
of what's an acceptable--

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:47.940
when are you a planet?

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:48.981
When are you on a planet?

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:53.440
It's the kind of
othering situation

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.090
I think is fascinating.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.600
And then the children
all have jumpsuits

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.270
that match their couches.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:08.730
And so the couches are, of
course, bodies unto themselves.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.210
They're hosts for bodies.

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:13.010
That's how we hang out
with them, in general.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:15.110
But I think, in this
case, the children

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:18.755
kind of operate in a quasi-space
of they are of the couch.

00:43:22.729 --> 00:43:24.770
And I was also interest
in working with children,

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:33.430
because I was interested in sort
of a state of pre-definition.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:36.550
Kids also sit somewhere
between reality and fantasy

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.260
very easily.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.231
And so what they perform--

00:43:40.231 --> 00:43:41.980
at one point, this
child who's taking care

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:46.030
of a fish tank and a fish--

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:50.410
which also, for me, symbolizes
the desert in this work.

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:52.840
You can see the tank is kind
of like half full of water.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.790
And there's this big red rock.

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:58.164
And there's a lot of
focus on this tank.

00:43:58.164 --> 00:43:59.830
So I like that the
desert could show up,

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:03.812
but it would be in the
kind of innermost space

00:44:03.812 --> 00:44:04.520
within this work.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:14.370
This child ends up performing,
caring for the fish,

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:16.860
but also becoming the fish,
and plays a fish out of water,

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:21.990
kind of called convulsing
at some point on the floor.

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:27.882
This one, [? Erris, ?] is set
with the task of fly swatting.

00:44:27.882 --> 00:44:29.340
I was thinking a
lot about violence

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.530
throughout the whole
making of this piece.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:35.580
And I'm really interested
in micro-violence,

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.880
or the small things, the things
that we overlook as violence,

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.530
like killing a fly.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.930
Most of us don't think
twice about that.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:48.930
So I'm interested in kind of
amplifying small things often.

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:52.440
In this case, the room starts
sort of speaking to the child.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:58.110
And it's not clear if the child
is chasing a fly or the room

00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.600
itself also.

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:05.400
And then this one, Pluto.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:11.460
Pluto ends up performing
like a bird of prey,

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.290
and does its beautiful
scene of like kind

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:15.780
of squawking as a
bird in relation

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.590
to this fish in the tank.

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:27.130
And that's another scene just
showing the bags of soil.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.860
So the Manning jacket
shows up again here,

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:36.370
and is worn by Keyon Gaskin,
another dancer performer--

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:40.420
and again, to bring the
weight of the leaky body

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:46.255
into this scene, which
takes place in a stairwell.

00:45:46.255 --> 00:45:47.630
So another one of
the scenes that

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:51.020
moves throughout the whole
work is we move from the top

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.900
to the bottom of the building
through this stairwell

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.090
throughout the whole work.

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:57.500
And in that process,
there's kind

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:02.810
of just this movement of
the destructed couches,

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:05.250
and all this sort of-- so
the garbage, again, shows up.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:07.970
Waste shows up again
as a kind of movement

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:09.620
from and through the building.

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:12.560
And it's also very
much like a descent.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:18.860
The whole thing is moving
downwards in the building.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:21.140
So I think of that as kind
of a movement of mouth

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.920
to anus, or like a process of
moving through the entire body.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.880
Because it's a
two-screen piece, you

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.700
see this descent
happening simultaneously.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.340
Ms. Manning is one
of the characters.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.680
And the pregnant
backpacker is the other.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.346
So this, for me,
was this feeling.

00:46:42.346 --> 00:46:44.720
When I was thinking about all
of this like weight bearing

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:53.540
and bodies that hold
symbolically and in reality

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:59.510
social and political
weight, I thought of--

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.159
with the pregnant
body, that's already

00:47:01.159 --> 00:47:02.450
like a physical kind of weight.

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:05.030
And then I was like, OK, we'll
throw a backpack on that,

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:06.860
and make it just
like this kind of

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:10.086
counter weighted
impossibility on top

00:47:10.086 --> 00:47:11.960
of the weight of everything
else that's going

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.280
to be taken down the stairwell.

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.049
And that's entering
the basement,

00:47:19.049 --> 00:47:20.340
which we'll get to in a minute.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:26.760
But then there's
another scene, which

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.710
I'm just going to do
this, so you can actually

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:37.630
see both characters,
Keyon and [? Steiner. ?]

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:40.190
This is the bathroom,
or the kidneys.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.360
This is the detox tub talks.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:49.870
And they spend their time
in the bathroom discussing--

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.930
mostly, they're discussing
language, and words,

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:59.976
and whether or how words are
functional or non functional.

00:47:59.976 --> 00:48:01.600
And then that leads
into a conversation

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:08.470
about needing to name a
new party, a lesbian party.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.720
Turns out it's a
lesbian dance party.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.640
It could be any party, though.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.210
And in the end, the
result is that they

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:18.085
get to calling the party lies.

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:25.150
But this is maybe the
most humorous section.

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:30.540
Everything's a little dark.

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:34.374
But this is, maybe, the lighter
part of the work in that way.

00:48:34.374 --> 00:48:35.790
The other thing I
want to say here

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:42.750
is that this scene is a
remake of Death of Marat.

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:47.880
Again, I'm interested in
co-opting the canon here.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:52.050
And what I was interested
in the story of Murat

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:57.901
is that he was working as--

00:48:57.901 --> 00:49:00.150
most of you probably already
know the story of Murat--

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:03.180
but was part of the
French Revolution,

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:07.170
and was a writer, activist,
as you would call it,

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:09.060
and was killed.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.980
The scene that you see
there in the painting

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:16.170
was killed by a woman
from the Bourgeois class.

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:20.132
So I didn't want
anyone to kill anyone.

00:49:20.132 --> 00:49:21.840
Or I was interested
in the way that death

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.530
could happen that was not
obvious forms of violence,

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:27.570
like guns, and
knives, and things.

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:30.210
Again, but talking about
violence on the body.

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:36.680
So both of them are suffering
from different ailments

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.650
that are not really
considered ailments.

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:42.440
So we have Keyon,
who's suffering

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.750
from persistent
microaggressions, which

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:46.226
is the case of the band-aids.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.670
And [? Steiner ?] is suffering
from economic toxicity,

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:58.840
which ultimately, will
lead to her demise

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.340
through a bloody nose.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.590
And then we have
the painting scene.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:10.250
And I will end on
this high note.

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:17.710
So the film ends
in the basement.

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:20.450
And this scene was built around
a couple of different ideas.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:23.230
First of all, I was thinking of
the basement as the place where

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.790
the furnace is, where
there's the source of heat,

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:28.300
this sort of generative
space of the basement--

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.700
or that the basement is one
of the more generative spaces

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.980
within a building, or
within the body, then--

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:43.870
and that, as a source of power,
let's say, within the building,

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:46.660
I wanted to introduce
synchronized dancing

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:47.480
into that space.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:52.300
So I was thinking both as
the way bodies are organized

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:55.270
through synchronized dancing--

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:58.390
and that can be both an
analogy of like a machine

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:00.030
or in a kind of protest, right?

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.210
But the kind of choreography,
I worked with the great,

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:09.190
wonderful, young dancer,
[? Nick ?] [? Kaye, ?]

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:12.640
to choreograph this scene.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.440
But the whole thing
was shot in the dark,

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.290
was only illuminated
by headlamps.

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:21.520
So also, all lighting kind
of moves with the bodies.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.430
And then these
T-shirts, which were all

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:28.660
extracted from the
current, or most recent,

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:29.770
political campaigns.

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:32.620
So they're the last words
in everyone's campaign.

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.740
So "her," "again,"
or "bust," and then

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.209
the "no," which
is just something

00:51:37.209 --> 00:51:38.500
I've been thinking a lot about.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:38.998

00:51:39.623 --> 00:51:43.978
Give me that word.

00:51:43.978 --> 00:51:47.962
Give me that word.

00:51:47.962 --> 00:51:50.452
That word.

00:51:50.452 --> 00:52:00.412
Give me that word
Give me that word.

00:52:11.368 --> 00:52:13.858
Give me those lies.

00:52:25.808 --> 00:52:26.308
Lies.

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.790
Lies.

00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:42.742
Lies.

00:52:46.226 --> 00:52:46.726
Lies.

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:13.618

is now liberated.
