00:00:01.683 --> 00:00:04.266
(bright music)

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.980
- James Peebles is one of the
world's foremost cosmologists.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.370
For over 40 years, his research
and foresight have helped

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
to transform cosmology into a focused

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.730
and rapidly-advancing science.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.960
Peebles laid the foundation

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.180
for many modern
cosmological investigations

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.080
by predicting the existence of
cosmic background radiation,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.480
popularizing the notion of
dark matter in the universe,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.640
and developing a theory

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.870
of how the universe evolved into galaxies.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.720
He also pioneered statistical tests

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.690
to track and quantify the
motions of matter in the cosmos.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.610
These tests necessitated the creation

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.070
of new computer-based simulations

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.680
to compare the competing
theoretical models

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.970
of Peebles and others.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.300
Peebles continues to
study the related issues

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.890
of cosmological tests,
the nature of dark matter,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.113
and the origin of the galaxies.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.430
Peebles received his BS in 1958

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.530
from the University of Manitoba

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.530
and his PhD in physics from
Princeton University in 1962

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.190
and after spending three years
as a postdoctoral fellow,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.640
he joined the faculty of the
Princeton Physics Department.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.110
Peebles joined the Physics Department

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.740
where he's remained throughout his career.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.850
In 1984, he became the
Albert Einstein Professor

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.710
of Science at Princeton.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.350
Peebles retired from teaching in 2000

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.560
and continues to research the workings

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.813
of the universe as an emeritus professor.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.910
Peebles' profound
contributions to astrophysics

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.980
and cosmology have been
recognized with numerous honors

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.183
including the Shaw Prize in Astronomy,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.790
the Cosmology Prize of the
Peter Gruber Foundation,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.120
the Gold Medal of the
Royal Astronomical Society,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.290
and the Jansky Prize

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.010
of the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.045
Please join me in welcoming
Professor James Peebles.

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:31.045
(audience applauds)

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.900
- Thank you, a true pleasure to be here,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.483
a place that I've always enjoyed visiting.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.150
If you are of a certain age,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.450
the odds are you're
recalling the stir caused

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.930
by the release of the first images

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.610
of Planet Earth from outer space.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.840
A little surprising, perhaps,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.260
that people should be stirred by it.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.623
We knew then that the Earth is round,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.850
clouds are white, the oceans are blue.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.790
Yet knowing is different from
seeing and the experience

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.740
of seeing the Planet
Earth had a big effect,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.910
I think, on our appreciation of the fact

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.330
that we live on a definitely
finite island universe

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.130
and it'd move us to take a
little bit better care of it.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.860
So I propose to use the
tendency of so many of us

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.780
to be fascinated by images as
a vehicle in describing to you

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.380
what we know about the
universe in the large.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.100
So let's get to work and remind ourselves

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.610
that the next planet out, Mars,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.560
is not as photogenic as Planet Earth,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.960
but certainly is a fascinating object.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.920
We know that, for example, by
the work of Percival Lowell.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.150
I introduce him because he'll
play an important part later

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.540
in my story this afternoon.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.110
Perhaps you know the verse,

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.260
now we are in Boston, the
home of the bean and the cod,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.980
where the Lowells speak only to Cabots

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.793
and the Cabots speak only to God.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.213
This Percival was a Cabot.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.300
He augmented his personal fortune

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.100
by work in the financial markets,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.170
then indulged in his great
interest in many things.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.830
First the Far East, then astronomy.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.630
He's honored by astronomers
for his decision

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.360
to place his observatory in
an excellent site in Arizona

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.580
and to hire first-rate astronomers

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.840
to build instruments for it and use it.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.740
Led to capital discoveries,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.100
one of which I'll be mentioning later.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.520
He tended to get a little
over-interested in Mars.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.160
He thought he could see
all kinds of things on it.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.770
In fact, he thought he could see evidence

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.520
of an active civilization
shaping the planet.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.460
Well, he was a little
misled but he was right

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.010
in the general notion.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.930
Surely if you looked at
Mars with a little care,

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.590
you'd see fascinating
new things, and indeed,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.430
here is a close-up image
of the surface of Mars,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.140
a river long since dried up

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.310
but won't it be fascinating
when we have a view

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.323
of what's left on the
sides of this old river?

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.100
The next planet out, Jupiter,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.170
has the composition of the sun,

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.390
about 3/4 hydrogen, 1/4 helium,

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.480
and trace amounts of the
stuff out of which Mars

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.230
and the Earth are made.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.393
It has weather.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.320
The Great Red Spot has been there

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.120
for a couple hundred years,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.120
a tropical storm of the sort
you see on the Weather Channel.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.483
Now, we're not alone in our solar system.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.260
Here is a tribute to Professor
Sarah Lee Lippincott,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.113
based not far from Princeton,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.010
an authority from the last
generation of the nearby stars,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.730
and here are the models she made

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.830
showing the relative
positions of these stars

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.740
and their relative sizes and colors.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.310
To my deep regret, I missed the chance

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.370
to take a photograph of this model

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.600
but we have a new generation
that are adept with computers

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.230
and they show us this picture

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.270
of the relative distributions
of the nearby stars.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.500
Here's the sun.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.920
The relative sizes are in proportion.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.610
The relative position's in proportion,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.660
but of course, the sizes of
the star is greatly magnified.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.020
You see that there are
stars bigger than the sun.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.460
Sirius here has twice the mass of the sun

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.820
and it's kinda hotter.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.490
It has a companion that's quite faint

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.240
but very massive, a white dwarf,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.950
the remnant of an exploding star

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.383
that's lost most of its nuclear fuel.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.700
You notice that most of
the stars are less massive

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.480
than the sun, redder, a lot less luminous.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.163
On a star-by-star basis,
the sun is pretty big.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.270
The grid you may be able
to see is kinda cute.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.790
For example, I can go to the right

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.430
along the plane of the board.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.150
Go into the board and down
and I get Epsilon Eridani

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.930
which attracts our attention a little bit

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.040
because, according to a local expert

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.730
carrying on from Professor
Sarah Lee Lippincott,

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.940
Geoff Marcy on the left assures us

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.180
that that star I was just pointing to

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.270
very likely has a real planet,

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.680
another Jupiter, another solar system.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.170
We're not alone, there are
other planetary systems.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.180
It's gonna be fun to explore them.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.800
Some stars reach the end of
their supply of nuclear fuel

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.470
on the edge of the universe, explode.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.310
This is one mode of explosion.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.040
It just blows itself apart in a supernova.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.570
It scatters about the products
of the nuclear burning

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.570
of fuel to make energy to
shine, to radiate starlight.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.540
This nuclear waste collects in clouds

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.000
and makes the clouds of hydrogen mostly,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.430
polluted heavily with grains.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.590
The grains make the clouds dark.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.960
New stars form out of these gas clouds.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.660
You can see that in this example,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.520
the bright young stars are
on the far side of the cloud.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.120
You can see the light
from the star is glinting

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.450
off the gas clouds but you
can't see the stars directly.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.460
There's too much dust, it
blocks out the starlight.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.000
That's an important effect in looking

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.750
at our galaxy of stars as a whole.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.160
Here's a picture of the whole sky.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.420
Many photographs, taken at night always,

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.730
of course, as we move around the sun,

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.200
and then the results stitched together

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.350
to make a map of the whole sky,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.570
distorted on the edges greatly, of course,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.800
because we're taking a sphere
and projecting it onto a plane

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.470
but you can see the general idea.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.210
A band of light running
across the sky, the Milky Way.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.640
You see rifts running through the band.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.690
That's not absence of
stars but rather presence

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.390
of this absorbing dust,
and what we are seeing

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.640
is that we live in a disc of stars.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.010
There are stars out of the disc

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.060
but most of them are in this disc

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.210
and we're seeing the
integrated light of the stars

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.530
running across the sky
from this disc of stars.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.230
It looks from this picture as
if we're close to the center

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.820
of the disc because there
are about as many stars

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.780
in each direction seen,
but that's an artifact

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.290
of the absorption by dust.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.890
This is a better image of
where we are in our galaxy.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.800
Again, an all-sky picture but now taken

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.900
at wavelengths slightly
longer than what we can see.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.910
At longer wavelengths, the
dust is much less absorbing

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.090
and so we get a much clearer picture

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.780
of where the stars are
in this Milky Way galaxy.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.280
You see several important things.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.300
You see the disc of stars,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.800
you see a bulge near
the center of old stars,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.760
and then you see that we are
distinctly in the suburbs

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.493
of this island universe.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.190
We are not alone.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.260
There are other galaxies of stars.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.130
Here's one very much like
our Milky Way galaxy.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.900
You see a bulge of old
stars, a disc of stars.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.710
You see rifts running through
the disc, that's gas again,

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.360
polluted by heavy elements
that blocks the starlight.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.920
There are several varieties
of these galaxies of stars.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.920
Here is another one with a
much bigger bulge of old stars

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.130
and just a trace of
relatively young stars,

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.243
gas and dust in this disc.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.060
A beautiful image from the
Hubble Space Telescope,

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.060
a magnificent instrument whose
existence depends these days

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.020
upon support from people like you

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.160
who let their congresspeople
know they would be ridiculous

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.020
to turn off this magnificent instrument

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.323
that gives us these gorgeous
images of the world around us.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.393
I hope you agree.

00:10:52.809 --> 00:10:55.270
(audience applauds)

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.740
(James laughs)

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.293
Don't applaud me, applaud
your congresspeople.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.083
Other galaxies have no
disc, they're all bulge.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.670
These galaxies don't sit in isolation.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.490
They tend to appear in groups.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.130
On the left, you see a
picture of three galaxies.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.750
It's a negative so where
there is starlight, it's dark,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.830
a big disc and then two smaller

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.550
and more irregularly-shaped galaxies.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.460
There's a lot of hydrogen in
this concentration of galaxies.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.160
The hydrogen emits radio radiation

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.153
at 21 centimeters wavelength.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.570
A radio telescope can
detect that radiation

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.470
and give us a picture of this system

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.090
at a different wavelength giving
us a different impression.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.220
If you had eyes sensitive
to 21 centimeters,

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.830
and you have very good eyes,

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.640
you would see the right-hand image

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.510
and you would ask yourself,
now, wait, is this one galaxy?

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.160
Notice the swirl of spiral arms running

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.423
from one to the other.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.563
The definition galaxy is a
touch arbitrary, I would submit.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.820
You see another example
of that in the next image.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.010
Here is a plot of the galaxies
in one region of the sky

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.800
and at one range of distances from us.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.490
You notice a tight concentration
of galaxies in the center

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.900
and then dribbling off to
lower and lower densities.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.350
It's just like the distribution of stars

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.420
in that galaxy I showed
you that is all bulge,

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.253
a cusp in the center

00:12:19.253 --> 00:12:22.720
and then the distribution
flaring out on the sides.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.253
It's a galaxy of galaxies, which is neat.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.810
Here is a picture of
that galaxy of galaxies.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.320
It's dead in the center of this plot.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.470
This shows the distribution
across about 100 degrees

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.220
of the sky looking up away
from the disk of our galaxy

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.500
where obscuration by dust
is not too important,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.853
showing you the texture of our universe.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.930
That's the large-scale
nature of our universe.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.240
Here is the astronomer Donald Shane

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.010
who took the data to make that image.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.620
These are then graduate students Jim Fry,

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.450
Ray Soneira, Mike Seldner,
and Bernie was offscreen,

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.920
maybe he wasn't even in my office

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.780
when this photograph was taken,

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.700
who took Donald Shane's data
and turned them into a map.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.960
Shane with his colleague Carl Wirtanen

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.410
counted the galaxies one by one

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.940
with a traveling microscope in the 1950s.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.660
It took them a decade,

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.910
one by one with a traveling microscope,

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.600
picking out the galaxies,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.260
making a pile of data sheets shown here.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.170
This is a set of copies in my office.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.610
Think of them, think of the effort,

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.770
and then think of the
fact that in those days,

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.453
there's not a lot you can
do with a million numbers.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.343
High-speed computers came along.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.880
We could take his data, which
was taken with such care.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.490
Then we could make this
image and show it to him

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.553
and asked him, so, is
this what you were seeing?

00:14:01.553 --> 00:14:02.940
(audience laughs)

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.170
And have the pleasure
of him laughing at us

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.403
and saying, I was looking at
this one galaxy at a time.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.390
This is the texture of
our universe in the large,

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.480
but we can go to bigger scales.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.983
Let's not hesitate to
step back another step.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.940
Oh, I should've remembered
to tell you that,

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.250
of course, data improves.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.780
This is a modern version
of what you've just seen

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.860
called the 2MASS Survey,
Tom Jarrett and colleagues.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.440
Again, photographed the whole
sky, but now used computers

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.380
to identify the galaxies and plot 'em up.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.190
It's at about the same limiting distance

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:42.752
and you see the same texture.

00:14:42.752 --> 00:14:44.800
This is the texture of our universe.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.260
You see running through this image

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.690
of the whole sky a darkish band.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.650
That's dust in our galaxy
and and in this projection

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.480
of the whole sky, the
plane of the Milky Way

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.520
is running in this S-shaped curve.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.410
You should ignore that and
you should trust the rest.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:00.653
This is the way we look.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.060
But let's look at still further,

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.130
let's look on a still larger scale

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:10.010
and we can do that by
noticing that some galaxies

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.300
such as this one have
in the center, in fact,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.330
all the big galaxies have in their center

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.120
a massive compact object

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.750
that the odds are very
strong is a big black hole.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.720
The main operative thing
about a big black hole

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.480
is the strong gravity as you get close

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.933
and it tends to squeeze
things as they fall in.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.640
It makes an explosion of this sort.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.670
That is the center of that galaxy

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:36.050
and this Hubble Space Telescope
image shows you a lovely jet

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.540
of light running away from the center.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.080
What's happening in very
rough terms is illustrated

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.530
by the consideration, what
happens if you take a tube

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.470
of toothpaste in your
hand and hold it firmly

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.070
and then you're startled,
very much startled,

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.790
you squeeze impulsively
that tube of toothpaste

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.170
and you make a jet, where is it?

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.000
Here it is, an experimental
demonstration of a jet

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.993
produced by compacting,
strongly compressing material.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.800
In galaxies, this compression
is sometimes so violent

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.070
that it makes a jet of material

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.240
that is very much bigger than the galaxy

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.070
and that it produces radio radiation.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.880
Here, an image from the Very Large Array

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.340
in Socorro, New Mexico, an
array of radio telescopes

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.780
with superb image-making qualities.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.350
Isn't it a delight to see this?

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.953
Eyes that are as big as, well,
a couple of miles across,

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.440
sensitive to light, seven
centimeters wavelength,

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.913
and what do you see?

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.623
A jet riding on one side.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.910
Alternately, I think,
one side or the other,

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:52.530
great blobs of plasma,
wisps of dense plasma nearby

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.540
and hotspots on the end.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.670
A really wonderful thing.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.730
An exploding galaxy left us this marker.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.530
This doesn't happen very often in galaxies

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.880
and when it happens, it can
be seen at great distance,

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.410
and so by mapping out the
distribution of these galaxies,

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.060
we can get a really large-scale picture

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.930
of what's going on in the
universe and this is what you see.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.730
This is a distribution across half the sky

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.690
of those exploding
galaxies, the brightest,

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.780
the nearest 20,000 or so, give or take.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.800
Now, you should be careful.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.260
The hole in the center is just,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.640
the instrument couldn't point up there

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.703
and the hole down here, it's
in the interference by the sun.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.090
The plane of the Milky Way in this map

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.010
runs along here like so.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.830
This is a very bright
source in the Milky Way.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.290
It's not another galaxy,
but it's bright enough

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.430
to confuse the instruments

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.670
so you should ignore, please, this region.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.080
You should ignore the concentrations

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.663
of sources along here, and
ask yourself, what do you see?

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.130
Well, it's even duller than Mars.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.400
You don't see anything, and
isn't that a remarkable thing?

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.010
You pause to consider
that in physical science,

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.430
we study sections from a
hierarchy of structures.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.670
There are cells that contain atoms.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.130
The cells are made into arms and legs.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.580
Arms and legs are made into people

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.140
who are made into communities
that live on the Planet Earth

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.410
that's part of the solar system
that's part of the galaxy

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.240
that is part of a
supercluster of galaxies.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.940
Level upon level of
structure and then it stops.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.870
Isn't that remarkable?

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.820
And of course, this remarkable effect

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.520
is what makes possible for us to say

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.240
we're making a theory of the
structure of the universe.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.960
We're not just taking a section

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.810
of a hierarchy of things
within things within things.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.710
We've come to the end of the hierarchy

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.690
and we can study the behavior
of this end of the hierarchy

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.803
because, as you see,
it's wonderfully simple.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.680
Quite an advance, quite
a conceptual advance

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.583
to see the end of structure.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.220
You understand that within this map,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.880
there is all that clustering of things

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.260
that you've seen illustrated earlier,

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.700
but because the objects here are so rare

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.160
and we are looking over
such a range of distances,

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.750
we lose all that clustering.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.070
We see only the large-scale pattern

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.350
and what we see is uniformity.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.653
That is the first law of cosmology.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.560
Let's go on to the second law.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.240
Oh no, I forgot to say,

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.960
it's fun to look at the telescopes

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.280
that produce some of these images.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.510
This is the great 300-foot telescope

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.810
in West Virginia on which
those data were taken

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.202
and this is the great 300-foot telescope

00:19:36.202 --> 00:19:39.680
in West Virginia as the
project was completed.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.075
It fell down.

00:19:41.075 --> 00:19:42.890
(audience laughs)

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.650
It's all right, no one was hurt,

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.990
and the senior senator from West Virginia

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.930
was not about to see the
great state of West Virginia

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.150
lose a major scientific instrument

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:59.670
and so somehow funds were found
to build this elegant, new,

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.963
much more powerful Robert
C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope

00:20:03.963 --> 00:20:06.380
(audience member laughs)
based in West Virginia.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.950
I don't quite know what to think of this

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.740
but I come up with the conclusion

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.316
that it's only pork if
you're not at the trough.

00:20:14.316 --> 00:20:16.010
(audience laughs)

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.580
It's a magnificent instrument for science.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.823
How can I complain?

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.533
As a taxpayer.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.160
There it is now, to emphasize it.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.830
We have something simple

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.863
that even a scientist can deal with.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.240
And I come back to Percival
Lowell who, as I said,

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.110
earned the deep respect of astronomers

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.240
by his decision to do great science

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.970
by hiring great astronomers to do it.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:50.910
One of them, Slipher, built the instrument

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.160
and used it to detect
the spectrum of light,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.430
intensity of light at each
wavelength coming from a galaxy,

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.690
showing first that the light

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.860
from galaxies is just
starlight, bunch of stars,

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.990
and second, that in distant galaxies,

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.840
the light is shifted towards the red.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.370
The effect, proposed then and
now we know to be the case,

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.270
is the Doppler shift which
you're all familiar with

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.780
if you've stood by the side of the road

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.540
and noticed the noise
coming from a passing car.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.770
The noise of the motor says bu-room.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.060
The pitch of the motor isn't
changing as the car roars by,

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.670
but as the car is approaching you,

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.490
the wavelength of light
is pushed together.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.100
That makes the pitch go up.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.010
As the car is moving away from you,

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.880
the motion stretches the wavelength.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.200
The pitch goes down, bu-room.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.633
So it is with light.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.380
He, Slipher, demonstrated that the light

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.370
from distant galaxies is
shifted toward the red

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.210
as if they were moving away from us.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.250
We now interpret that, I
believe, entirely correctly

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.600
as the effect of the expansion
of this uniform universe.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.590
It was a deep puzzle
at the time he found it

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.330
and this person, Georges
Lemaitre, Belgian,

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.800
in 1923, shown here,
a few years later gave

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.113
the now accepted explanation,
the expanding universe.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.730
In this year, he discovered
not only a great love of God.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.270
He's Roman Catholic, was,

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.640
but also of general relativity theory,

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.770
the theory Einstein had invented

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.100
for a better theory of gravity,

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.900
one that is now very thoroughly tested.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.840
In those days it was just a theory,

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.800
but people were looking
very hard for applications

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.680
and Lemaitre found one.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.150
Here are some key players in
the next part of the story.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.960
Einstein, as I said, invented
general relativity theory

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.343
that Lemaitre was soon to use.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:50.150
This person, Dutch, Willem
de Sitter, will appear

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.630
in a moment but try to remember his face.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:57.410
The hair is moved from
here to here, and finally,

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:01.210
the professor of astronomy
at Cambridge University

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:05.410
in England, Arthur Stanley Eddington.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.780
Lemaitre decided to expand his knowledge

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:13.590
of general relativity by
studying first at Cambridge

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.620
and here we have evidence of it

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.500
from a letter from Eddington.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.650
I certify that Abbe George Lemaitre

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:24.900
has been attending my lectures
and pursuing his studies

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.070
and investigations to
my entire satisfaction

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.600
during the academic year 1923, 1924.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.710
From there, Lemaitre went
to MIT, the other Cambridge,

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.640
Cambridge, Massachusetts,
where he continued his studies

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.230
in general relativity theory
and he attended a talk

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.020
by this astronomer, Edwin Hubble.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.900
I'll talk later today and again tomorrow

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.370
about this instrument and about
this person, Richard Talman.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.880
He heard from Hubble
about Hubble's studies

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.550
of Slipher's effect and
about the curious pattern

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.500
that Hubble was finding that
the more distant the galaxy,

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.910
the more rapid the red shift,

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.773
the more rapid the recession
velocity of the galaxy.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.600
It was that lecture by
Hubble that inspired Lemaitre

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.213
to invent the theory of
the expanding universe.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.410
Here again, I don't remember
why I showed you twice

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.951
but here is, we have evidence,

00:24:19.951 --> 00:24:23.840
so now let me tell you the story

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.000
because it is somewhat educational.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.820
Lemaitre wrote his paper on
the expanding universe in 1927

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.000
but he published it in
Dutch in a Belgian journal

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.230
that the in crowd did not read.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.150
He waited patiently for a
response from the in crowd,

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:44.680
what do you think of my idea?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.580
Got none.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.233
He wrote to Eddington, whoops,

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.560
reminded him of his acquaintance

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.270
and said what do you think of my work?

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:59.270
No response, not until a second
letter several years later,

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.350
but was it a response?

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.663
And it was not a very vigorous one.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.940
Eddington wrote to de Sitter.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.970
Here again is de Sitter
and here is the letter

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.980
Eddington wrote to de Sitter.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.200
Here is the date, 1930,

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.640
and here is an interesting message first.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.283
Lemaitre's address in Leuven in Belgium.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.640
Then a comment, a research student,

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.230
George McVittie and I had
been worrying at the problem

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.480
and made considerable progress,

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.560
so it was a blow to us to find
it done much more completely

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.530
by Lemaitre, a blow softened
as far as I am concerned

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:45.333
by the fact that Lemaitre
was a student of mine.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.680
Well, you learn from this first

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.240
that if you do something
great, you will win friends,

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.490
but we have to admire Eddington
for his decision immediately

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:00.200
to arrange to have
Lemaitre's article reprinted

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.580
in a prominent journal of astronomy.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.280
He made Lemaitre famous.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.920
You can tell he was famous
because here is de Sitter,

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.920
a caricature in, following
an interview by him, of him,

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.060
published in a prominent
newspaper in the Netherlands.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.910
The bottom part of the figure,

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.230
I will be discussing tomorrow.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.450
The top part, I hope you will agree,

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.860
is a pretty good caricature

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.590
of the great Professor
Dr. Willem de Sitter

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:34.200
and here is an analog showing
de Sitter's explanation

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.890
to the newspaper of what
Lemaitre had in mind

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:39.170
by this notion of expanding universe.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:43.450
Pretend that you live not in
three dimensions but in two.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.030
Pretend that you're an ant that may crawl

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:48.430
along the surface of this balloon.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.100
You notice it's kind
of a neat arrangement.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.440
This world the ant lives in is finite.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.420
The ant may start in a given direction

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.440
and move in a straight line.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.960
It'll end up back where it started from,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.190
no boundaries to this universe,
no edge, it's homogenous,

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.033
uniform everywhere, but it's finite.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.120
You might ask me, so, what about the space

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.200
off the balloon inside and outside?

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.340
I tell you, don't ask that question.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.450
You live in two dimensions,

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:15.690
you live on the surface of that balloon.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.350
One other cautionary
note, stars and galaxies

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:23.150
are more or less sketched on this balloon.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:24.860
The stars and galaxies aren't expanding.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.520
You have to think of those as
little pieces of paper perhaps

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.730
attached to the balloon in one spot.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.340
But now the really neat thing.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.670
You are living on one of these
galaxies and you look around

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.410
and what do you see as
the balloon is blown up?

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.080
You see the nearby galaxies
moving away from you

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.260
and you see further galaxies
moving away from you fast.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.260
That's just the pattern that
Hubble had been discovering

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.910
for an expanding universe.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.800
That was a great connection

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.653
that made everyone so excited in 1930.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.520
Now, of course it's one thing to say

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.090
this fits the observations,
uniformity, the redshift,

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.790
the apparent Doppler shift,
an expanding universe,

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.270
but how do I know that's
the way it really is?

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.630
You know that the way, you test that

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.720
by finding other effects, other checks,

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.900
other experimental
conditions that are required

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.530
to fit by the same theory
of an expanding universe.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.600
It was Lemaitre, in fact, who realized

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.850
that there ought to be further evidence

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.020
of this expanding universe theory,

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.560
that if the universe did start expanding

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.100
in this very different state,

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.763
surely it left fossil evidence
of the very different state.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.940
He writes in this photograph,

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.480
this is a photograph of Einstein.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.700
He writes, the evolution of
the world can be compared

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.370
to a display of fireworks
that has just ended.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.000
Some few red wisps, sashes and smoke

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.790
standing on a well-chilled cinder.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.350
We see the slow fadings of the suns

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.680
and we will try to recall
the vanished brilliance

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.253
of the origin of the worlds.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.980
Let's find the vanished brilliance.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.870
Let's find fossils of that time

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:01.000
when the universe was so very different.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.680
The person who showed us

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.470
how to interpret the fossil we
have found is Richard Talman,

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:12.120
professor of physics
at Caltech in Pasadena

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.050
who developed the theory of heat radiation

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:17.770
in an expanding universe.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.980
Heat radiation, you've all experienced.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.870
Stand by a fire and put out your hand.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:25.020
You're feeling radiation,
that's heat radiation.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.203
It has an important
property in a closed vessel.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.420
If I keep the walls at
a definite temperature

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.210
and let things relax to equilibrium,

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:38.210
then the vessel will be
filled with radiation,

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.580
black-body radiation, often
called thermal radiation,

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.570
with the property that you
tell me the temperature

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.720
and I'll tell you the intensity

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.350
of that radiation at each wavelength.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.730
What Talman shows is in
an expanding universe,

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:51.430
this radiation doesn't go away.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.300
There's no place for it to go,

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.560
but it is cooled by the
expansion of the universe

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.860
and the really important thing

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.150
is it maintains its
thermal black-body spectrum

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.600
and so a fossil from this early time,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.230
if the universe was hot to begin with,

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.870
would be the remnant thermal radiation

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.370
and we would know it's
thermal by its spectrum.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.550
This was used after the
end of the Second World War

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:16.670
by George Gamow, a great
astronomer of a previous generation

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:19.180
with his student, Ralph
Alpher, and a few others

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.550
to make a theory of the
origin of the elements.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.470
In fact, it is now our standard theory

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.090
for the origin of helium.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.960
Most of it was cooked in the hot Big Bang.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.570
I won't get into that detail today,

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.650
but just to remind you of this photograph,

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:34.360
maybe some of you remember living

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.700
under the threat of nuclear war

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.110
and this Herblock image of, well,

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:44.960
this of the hydrogen bomb and
the caption, five minutes, eh?

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.130
For scientists says world
was created in five minutes.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.400
Well, that's the first five minutes

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.863
of the expanding universe.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:56.680
Here is a photograph of a
temporary building at MIT

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.460
built during the Second
World War for war research.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.540
Here is a professor of
astronomy at MIT, Ray Weiss,

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.800
pointing toward this temporary building

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.610
built during the war,
torn down only recently,

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.120
and, to my mind, a sad event.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.890
There ought to be things
preserved from old times,

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:17.780
but here is a photograph of
my thesis advisor, Bob Dicke,

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.950
on top of that rooftop
with one of his inventions,

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:22.793
a microwave radiometer.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.350
I'll explain now what
this radiometer does.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:30.450
Here is a sketch of the skyline

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.810
of Cambridge from that rooftop.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.210
In those days, Cambridge had factories.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.690
Some of the factories had chimneys

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:39.050
and some of the chimneys were warm.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.950
Up above is a chart recorder
showing the response

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.640
of his microwave radiometer
as it was swung across the sky

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.750
and swung past those chimneys.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.450
You see what's happening.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:52.730
As the different lines or different angles

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.740
down from the vertical,

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.570
as the radiometer is
swung across the horizon,

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:02.260
it shows a deflection
at each warm chimney.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.003
This is just the device to
detect thermal radiation.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:10.020
This is a photograph of Bob Dicke

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.563
about 25 year later on the left,

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.060
Jer Yu, my first graduate student

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.840
whose role will appear
in tomorrow's lecture,

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.520
and David Wilkinson, a long-time friend

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.600
and close colleague of
Princeton University.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.390
Slightly before this photograph,

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:30.320
Bob had the idea that one ought to look

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.950
for this fossil radiation
from a hot early universe

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.550
and he persuaded David Wilkinson

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:38.880
to build a Dicke
radiometer for the purpose

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.810
of looking for this radiation.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.700
Here is Dave in working clothes.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.860
He's holding, if you
can see, a screwdriver.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.280
Behind here is his colleague,
perhaps you can see the sleeve

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.040
of his plaid shirt, Peter Roll.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.150
They build this radiometer to look

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.880
for that thermal radiation
that would be present

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.180
if the universe started hot and expanded

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.790
from a dense hot state.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:04.870
Here is a telescope at Bell Labs,

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:06.750
a mere 30 miles or so from Princeton,

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.430
that was used in early experiments

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.230
with satellite communication.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.550
First, bouncing signals off a big balloon

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.850
in orbit back down to Earth.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:18.740
Then later, a satellite that would receive

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.680
television signals from the ground,

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.650
transmit them back down to the ground.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:26.040
Early efforts in long-range communication.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.490
This telescope had a curious problem

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:31.587
that vexed very much Bob
Wilson and Arno Penzias

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.290
who wanted to use this
telescope for radio astronomy.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.760
It was detecting too much radiation.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.480
They were at their wits' end

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.890
with this curious feature
of this radiometer

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:47.210
when Bernie Burke, here in the center,

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.930
who knew both groups, told the
two groups to get together,

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:53.550
the one looking for the radiation,

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.170
the other with the radiation

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:56.670
but not knowing what to do with it.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:58.470
(audience laughs)

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:02.340
Bernie was at MIT, it's curious
how these things happen.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.680
1925, Lemaitre is at MIT.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.220
1945, Bob Dicke is at
MIT building a radiometer

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.777
while Lemaitre's country
is being torn apart

00:34:11.777 --> 00:34:14.060
by the Second World War.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:18.760
1965, he's bringing, at MIT,
the two groups together.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.240
Things work in curious ways.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.743
Here is the situation.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.610
Penzias and Wilson at seven
centimeters wavelength

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:29.780
had radiation coming in from
all directions equally strong

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.800
that they didn't know what to do with.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:35.020
Here, shortly after the two groups met,

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.880
the Princeton experiment was completed.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.320
It detected radiation here.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.590
This is the curve of
intensity at each wavelength

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.090
you would expect if this
radiation is thermal,

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.060
black-body, left over
from the early universe,

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.290
if it's a fossil, and you see,

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:51.570
it already looked pretty good.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.870
The story of much of cosmology
for the next several decades

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:59.010
was the work in filling
in this part of the curve

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.470
and checking does this
radiation really follow

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:04.050
the prediction you would expect

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.500
if this is thermal radiation left over

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.450
from the hot early universe?

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:12.230
A lot of work was done in that direction

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:15.060
but I will immediately
go to the experiment

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.210
that solved the problem.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:18.980
It had to be done above
the Earth's atmosphere

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.440
because at wavelengths near the peak,

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.260
the atmosphere is strongly
absorbing and emitting.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.340
It just totally makes the
experiment impossible.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.420
You have to get above the atmosphere.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:36.200
Here is a proposal to NASA for a satellite

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.830
that became known as COBE,
Cosmic Background Explorer.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:44.550
The proposal was made by John Mather.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.833
Here's Dave Wilkinson.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.130
One of the PIs was Mike Hauser

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.340
who made this image I showed earlier.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:56.883
The other was George Smoot who
I will be roasting tomorrow.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.210
It's interesting that Mather
was, at the time, a postdoc

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:05.270
and he was proposing to bet his career

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:10.030
on a satellite whose design
started in the mid '70s

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.550
and was flown in 1990.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:16.470
Imagine it, the work required,
and during that time,

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.920
he was not accumulating a
track record of research.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.130
He was concentrating on
one big basket of eggs

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:26.723
that could, on launch, break.

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.080
He is made of stern stuff

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:35.750
for which he earned this year's
Nobel Prize in connection

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.780
with another person who
will be discussed tomorrow.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.530
Here is a photograph of the COBE group.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:46.530
Here you see George Smoot,
you see Mike Hauser,

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.040
Mike Hauser who made that
beautiful picture of our galaxy,

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.040
here you see David Wilkinson,
and here, John Mather,

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:00.800
and here, the result of this experiment.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.550
I gotta explain this in a little detail

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:03.680
'cause it's kinda confusing.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.860
The thin line is the theory.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.660
This is what it oughta look like.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:11.070
The thick line is the measurement

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.470
under which is the theory, of course.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.050
The other symbols are
discrete measurements made

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:18.960
by other groups and you see something

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.053
that is absolutely gorgeous,

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:26.140
a dead close fit of
theory and observation.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.020
This is the smoking gun.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.040
This radiation could not be produced

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.700
in the universe as it is now.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.070
We know that because the
universe is transparent.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.620
It's not a black body.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.180
We know it's transparent
because we can see

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.260
those distant radio galaxies
that I was describing earlier.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.680
This radiation is traveling
freely from where?

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.210
From the early stages of the hot universe.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.840
Here is tangible evidence,

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.150
just like dinosaur footprints convince us

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.560
those improbable looking
creatures did walk the face

00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.190
of the Earth, so this tells us

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:04.820
that our universe did expand
from a hot, dense state.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.143
What an advance, truly amazing.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.610
Well, I can't let this moment
pass without reminding you

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:16.610
that there is a competition
in any measurement in science.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:22.010
Here is Herb Gush who during
the time from the mid '70s

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.480
to 1990 was working on his own experiment,

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.290
this one to be a rocket rather
than satellite experiment,

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:30.923
to measure this radiation.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.360
It's not a very good picture

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.240
but I think you can see
this guy exudes confidence.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.490
He is a solid person.

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:43.090
Here are his two associates
in the experiment that worked,

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.570
Mark Halpern on the left,
Ed Wishnow on the right.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.160
You can see it's a terrible reproduction

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.190
but it's one of my favorite
images from astronomy.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:56.810
I just love it because you
look at that, I ask myself,

00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:00.630
if I didn't know these guys
had done something great,

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.830
if I only had this image to judge them by,

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.498
would this image inspire confidence?

00:39:06.498 --> 00:39:08.750
(audience laughs)

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:12.320
I just can't resist another verse,

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.090
you see that I'm a very poetical person,

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:17.160
another verse about Barbara Frietchie

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.850
who you remember during the
Revolutionary War saying,

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.880
shoot if you must this old gray head,

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.970
but spare your country's flag,

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:29.970
and then I have in mind Ogden
Nash's take on the situation.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:33.370
I always admired Barbara Frietchie.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.743
I bet she scratched when she was itchy.

00:39:37.563 --> 00:39:40.480
(audience laughs)

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.640
Great science is done by
committed, capable people

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.230
like these two, but first of all,

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.710
great science is done
by people who scratch

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.660
when they're itchy like the rest of us.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.440
Well, here it is, tangible evidence

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.260
that our universe is
understandable, in a way.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.460
It has an evolution, it has a
history, and a surprising one.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.760
It began hot and dense and expanded

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.960
to the present time leaving a fossil.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.900
Like any other fossil, this plot one

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.470
has interesting clues built into it

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.730
that I will be discussing tomorrow,

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:18.360
but I think this is a good
place to start winding down

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.680
and I've decided that because
there are some questions

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.430
that I receive time after
time giving this talk,

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:25.850
I thought I would review them now

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:27.940
ahead of general discussion.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.710
So here is my list of the four

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.710
most frequently-asked questions

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.220
in my experience on this subject.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.330
So, the first question.

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:41.440
You claim our universe expanded
from some dense hot state.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.573
So what was our universe
like before the Big Bang?

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.470
Well, of course, people
have worried about this.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.670
There are very attractive ideas

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:53.500
on what the universe was
doing before it was expanding

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.480
but the solid part of our subject,

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.590
where we have the experimental evidence

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:01.010
is in the evolution from the
dense state to the present.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.510
Don't ask us to do everything.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:05.020
We're gonna leave some science
for the next generation.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.270
The part that is solid is at expansion

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.413
from high density to the present.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.720
So, next question.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.400
So can you at least say
where this Big Bang happened?

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.313
Can you point to the place in the sky?

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:20.867
Hello.

00:41:20.867 --> 00:41:21.700
(audience laughs)

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.650
Didn't you see that map
of the radio galaxies?

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:26.660
Didn't you see how uniform it is?

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.850
There's no edge that we
can see to the universe.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:32.350
The universe is everywhere
and it's expanding everywhere.

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:33.313
There's no center.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.323
Why do you keep avoiding
the term Big Bang?

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:42.473
Because it's so misleading.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.010
A bang to me connotes an event,

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.880
but I just tried to tell you,

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.733
we don't have a theory for that event,

00:41:50.733 --> 00:41:53.110
what happened as the
universe started expanding.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.060
What we know, and have
tested well, I think,

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.860
as I'll describe in more detail tomorrow,

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.330
is that the universe has
expanded from this dense state,

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:01.493
hot, to the present.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.320
What is more, a bang connotes a location.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.680
It exploded right, there's
where the bomb was,

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.980
but there's no location
in the expanding universe.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.140
It's everywhere, expanding

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.053
at almost the same rate everywhere.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.529
If you're so smart,

00:42:19.529 --> 00:42:22.362
(audience laughs)

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.585
this is something I've often asked myself.

00:42:27.585 --> 00:42:30.300
(audience laughs)

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.850
In the connection of
research and cosmology,

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.850
my answer is we're pretty smart.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:37.840
We've made some striking advances.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.160
I've shown you one, I'm gonna
describe some more tomorrow.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.680
We're not all that smart because
there are lots of questions

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.700
you can ask me that I can't answer.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.100
Tomorrow I'm going to describe
some of these deep puzzles

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.590
which I am going to put
a very positive spin on,

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:53.500
saying we're leaving lots of work,

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:57.200
lots of fascinating work to be
done by the next generation.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.870
We're not that smart, but
we are making progress.

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:00.769
Thank you.

00:43:00.769 --> 00:43:03.769
(audience applauds)

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.040
- [William] Professor
Peebles has agreed to respond

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.110
to questions from the audience.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:18.063
Are there any?

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:21.540
- [Man] Thank you for the four questions

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:26.540
and part of that is some
of the data that you have

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:30.540
and put in two-dimensional play comes back

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:35.230
and with the redshift indicates
that it's three-dimensional.

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:38.130
My question is has anybody made a model

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:41.800
of what the universe was like

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:46.800
when those earliest
photons first reached us,

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:50.210
or on the opposite side,

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:53.150
now that they've traveled
all those billions of years,

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:58.150
where are they now projected to be now

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.413
when we finally get the information?

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.690
- This gets complicated, doesn't it?

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:07.523
- [Man] Yes.

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:11.290
- The galaxies are moving away from us

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:14.600
as if we were at the
center of the Big Bang,

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.960
isn't that right?

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.040
But yet, in this theory, if
you go to a distant galaxy,

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.580
you will see the galaxies
around you moving away.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.820
You'll even see us moving away from you

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.520
as if you were at the
center of the explosion.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.960
The central thesis of this
first law of cosmology

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:36.380
is that the universe is
uniform, the same everywhere,

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.930
aside from local deviations,
local clustering.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:44.360
You may say this radiation
that is streaming toward us

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.053
came from somewhere.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.780
Indeed, it did, but it wasn't aimed at us.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:54.650
Go to a different place, you'll
see radiation hitting you.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:57.533
Wherever you are, the
radiation is streaming by.

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:03.980
One could ask where is
that radiation going?

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.600
It's traveling through the universe.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:06.760
It's not being lost.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.600
Each photon is conserved,

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.223
apart from the few that
hit dust and get absorbed.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.150
They rearrange themselves,

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.900
keeping uniform or close to uniform

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.853
in this expanding
universe without an edge.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:24.750
I don't know if that's comfort

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:27.813
but the best I can do.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:34.610
- [Man] Well, I've a very simple question.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:38.020
I'd like to know, in your
opinion, if the universe,

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:42.697
like a balloon, is bounded,
unbounded and finite,

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.033
or is it unbounded and infinite?

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.360
- I'll be discussing some
aspects of this tomorrow.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.990
The evidence is that the balloon model

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:56.220
is a little misleading.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.400
The evidence is that space is not curved

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.980
in the nature of a balloon

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:05.960
but rather flat in our
three spatial dimensions.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.600
Space time is curved to be sure,

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:13.600
but a space section is flat,
not curved inward or outward.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.650
I use the balloon analogy
because to me, it's visual.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.903
I can see it, if you see what I mean,

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:24.060
but the evidence, as I
say, is that space is flat.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.910
I can't tell you that space is infinite

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:31.910
because the universe is only
about 14,000 million years old.

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.600
During that time, light has
traveled a finite distance.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.470
We can't see beyond that.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:41.820
We can't check that the universe extends

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:46.180
arbitrarily far beyond the
section we can see, and in fact,

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.630
popular ideas about what
the universe was doing

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:51.110
before it was expanding would project

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:53.090
that we're in a section of universe

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.200
that's enormous but finite,

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.760
outside of which there's a terrible mess

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.100
that we won't think about.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.740
- [Man] Is there any independent evidence

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:14.020
aside from redshift that
would give a signature showing

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:18.440
that the early universe was
more compact, more dense,

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.400
such as, let's say, gamma ray burst.

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.340
Is there some signature,
some empiric evidence to show

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:28.100
that with increasing
deep time observation,

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.440
there's a higher compaction
of the superclusters

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.440
and clusters of galaxies?

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.350
- Yes, excellent question,
give me more evidence.

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:40.223
I promise tomorrow to
offer some more evidence.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.750
The more pieces of evidence
we have, of course,

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.980
the tighter the story, the
better the cross-checks,

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.730
the more believable is the picture.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:53.820
I feel confident now that we
have the tangible evidence.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.090
It always is indirect, of course.

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:59.310
We can't travel in a time
machine back in time.

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:01.250
We can instead only look at the clues

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:05.150
that nature offers us and
interpret them and find,

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:06.680
once we have an interpretation,

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:10.040
whether new clues as they come
in fit the interpretation.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.370
The more clues that fit,
the more confident we are.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:15.840
I'll describe tomorrow some of the clues

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.670
that convince me that
we're on the right track

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:21.993
while at the same time leaving
open some very deep puzzles.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.070
- [Man] You told us some
very interesting history

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.570
about one paper that got hidden in Dutch.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:34.440
Could you tell us a little
bit about what happened

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.780
with Gamow's paper, why people
didn't know much about it?

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.930
- (laughs) That is another
very interesting story.

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:45.800
Gamow had many of the
ideas of the now standard

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.770
hot Big Bang, if I may use
that phrase, back in the 1940s

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:53.580
including a now well-tested theory

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.530
for the origin of the light
elements, deuterium and helium,

00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:01.900
including the hot radiation
that should be detectable now

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.810
by instruments we have.

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.850
That was written at about the same time

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.070
that Bob Dicke invented the radiometer

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.440
that I showed you illustrated

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.420
and that was capable of
detecting that radiation.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.990
The two groups never got together

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:18.900
and by the time Bob Dicke

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:23.100
in the mid 1960s persuaded
David Wilkinson and Peter Roll

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.550
to build one of his radiometers
to look for this radiation,

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:29.630
that paper of Gamow, that
set of papers of Gamow

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:33.180
had been pretty well lost to sight.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:38.180
When I started working in this
field in 1964 approximately,

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.130
I knew nothing of Gamow.

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:42.710
I knew nothing of that early work.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:44.770
I discovered that much of my early work

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:49.173
was in fact reinventing Gamow's wheel.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:55.000
We got together, we got the
whole story by about 1970

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.700
but there was a time of great confusion

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.350
when we didn't realize
what had been done earlier

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:00.453
and what hadn't.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.393
Maybe you're aware that
that left Gamow very better.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.210
He felt he wasn't thoroughly recognized

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:10.850
for his accomplishments
and that might've been so.

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:13.750
I hope we got the record
straight before his death though.

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:25.350
- [Man] The most popular
model for the evolution

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:28.500
of the universe has it
proceeding from a singularity

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.410
and going through an era of inflation.

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:34.430
Another model has a collision of membranes

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:38.990
in a hyperspatial matrix,
so my first question is

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:40.540
are you gonna be discussing that tomorrow

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:42.630
and if you're not, could you
briefly discuss it today?

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:44.380
My second question is you seem

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:46.340
to be a very optimistic fellow--

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.500
- So sorry?

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.660
- [Man] You seem to be
a very optimistic fellow

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:54.160
and the rapid evolution
of cosmological knowledge

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.830
over the last 100 years has
indeed been a model of optimism

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:00.540
and the progress of knowledge.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.370
Does the cosmological
community feel a dampening

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:06.863
of that optimism with the onflux

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.420
of information regarding
the possible termination

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:15.240
of civilization due to global warming?

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.620
So I have a technical

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.337
and a sociological question, thank you.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:25.460
I will not discuss inflation
or brane collisions as models

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.860
for what happened before
the universe was expanding,

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:30.930
described by the theory I've mentioned.

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:33.300
That's for another set of lectures,

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:37.910
and what is more, it is
pretty controversial.

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:41.070
These are new ideas and new
ideas always are speculative,

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:43.110
controversial, to be checked.

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:46.290
The checks are not yet in
to the extent that we have

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:49.640
for the idea of the universe
is expanding and cooling.

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.974
On that point, I was until recently

00:51:51.974 --> 00:51:53.940
a pretty pessimistic fellow.

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:57.620
I was skeptical that we had
all of the pieces in place

00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:01.080
but I'm gonna describe
tomorrow why I was driven

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:04.300
to accept that we do
understand an outline,

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:08.220
what the universe has been doing
since it was dense and hot.

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:13.220
As for the future, well, I
hope we will devote resources

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:18.440
to saving this island universe
we live on, the Planet Earth.

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.330
I hope we'll also devote a little time

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:22.510
to curiosity and continue to study

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:24.180
the large-scale nature of the universe.

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:26.180
It has lots of secrets to show us still.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.270
I am very optimistic about the prospects

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:33.300
for future research in pure science.

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.440
I'm optimistic about the
payoff of some aspects

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:40.250
to be determined of pure
research in better civilization,

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:41.650
if only we'll pay attention.

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:44.240
Am I optimistic about the human race?

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.842
Well, I don't know.

00:52:46.842 --> 00:52:49.090
(audience laughs)

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:51.790
- Please join me in
thanking Professor Peebles

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:53.906
for a very interesting presentation.

00:52:53.906 --> 00:52:55.739
(audience applauds)

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:58.822
(bright synth music)
