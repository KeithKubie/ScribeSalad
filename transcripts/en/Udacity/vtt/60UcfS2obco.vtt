00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Over 2,000 years ago, Archimedes was obsessed with this simple question--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
How can I lift a 100 kg mass to a height of 1 m?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Okay so this might not have been exactly how we phrase the question, but this captures the essence

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of what Archimedes was thinking when he invented many of these simple machines.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Naively, we might think the only way to answer these question of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
how to get this, let's say 100 kg rock unto this 1 m table.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It is well, to pick it up and put it on the table.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Archimedes, however, realized there's better way to solve this problem.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
One way is to use an incline plane and we analyzed the incline plane

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a little bit in the previous problem set.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When we use an incline plane, we reduced the force we have to push with the one in expense.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We have to push over longer distance before we have to lift 1 m

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but now we have to push a distance that's greater than 1 m.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Another option is to use a system of pulleys.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Pulleys actually have the same trade off that incline planes do.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We may not have to pull quite as hard but we'll have to pull over a greater distance.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Once again we see this force and distance trade off popping up.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Another simple machine that can help us out is the lever.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If we use the lever, we can exert a smaller force than we would have to if we we're just picking it up

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but once again we'll have to exert it over a greater distance just to lift this rock 1 m.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is very interesting, let's dig dipper into some of this simple machines

00:01:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and see if can quantify what's going on.
