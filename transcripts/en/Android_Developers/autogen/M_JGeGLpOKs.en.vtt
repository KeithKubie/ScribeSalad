00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870
opportunity to touch base with them so
 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.229
opportunity to touch base with them so
I'll be talking about the Android print

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239
I'll be talking about the Android print
 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.420
I'll be talking about the Android print
api's but before diving into that I want

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430
api's but before diving into that I want
 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.069
api's but before diving into that I want
to give you a very very brief view of

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079
to give you a very very brief view of
 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.449
to give you a very very brief view of
the Android print architecture so in in

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459
the Android print architecture so in in
 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.060
the Android print architecture so in in
mobile the question of what printers do

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070
mobile the question of what printers do
 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.860
mobile the question of what printers do
you have doesn't really make much sense

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870
you have doesn't really make much sense
 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.319
you have doesn't really make much sense
the real question is how many printers

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329
the real question is how many printers
 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.479
the real question is how many printers
can you find in my current context in my

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489
can you find in my current context in my
 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.610
can you find in my current context in my
current environment so the way undred

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620
current environment so the way undred
 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.110
current environment so the way undred
printing works is that you have

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120
printing works is that you have
 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.729
printing works is that you have
applications that want to print which is

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739
applications that want to print which is
 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.430
applications that want to print which is
what you guys work on that use the print

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440
what you guys work on that use the print
 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.640
what you guys work on that use the print
API you have print services so these are

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650
API you have print services so these are
 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.029
API you have print services so these are
the drivers if you want to think of them

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039
the drivers if you want to think of them
 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.219
the drivers if you want to think of them
as drivers so this is what our friends

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229
as drivers so this is what our friends
 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.060
as drivers so this is what our friends
from oprea

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070
from oprea
 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.210
from oprea
are working on and you have the system

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220
are working on and you have the system
 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.950
are working on and you have the system
which is the print manager that's the

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960
which is the print manager that's the
 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.410
which is the print manager that's the
main centralized brain that connects all

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420
main centralized brain that connects all
 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.480
main centralized brain that connects all
the dots and you have the print spooler

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490
the dots and you have the print spooler
 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.040
the dots and you have the print spooler
the print spooler is just a part that

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050
the print spooler is just a part that
 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.760
the print spooler is just a part that
shows the UI shows notifications shows

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770
shows the UI shows notifications shows
 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.510
shows the UI shows notifications shows
you the current print jobs and and

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520
you the current print jobs and and
 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.890
you the current print jobs and and
manages the current print jobs so that's

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900
manages the current print jobs so that's
 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.240
manages the current print jobs so that's
a high-level architecture of Android

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250
a high-level architecture of Android
 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.850
a high-level architecture of Android
without going too much details I'll go

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860
without going too much details I'll go
 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.890
without going too much details I'll go
straight to the ATIS the main thing I

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900
straight to the ATIS the main thing I
 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.570
straight to the ATIS the main thing I
want to show is how easy it is to print

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580
want to show is how easy it is to print
 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.470
want to show is how easy it is to print
from your app so how do you print from

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480
from your app so how do you print from
 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.050
from your app so how do you print from
application the first continue need to

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060
application the first continue need to
 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.700
application the first continue need to
do is to get a hold of the print manager

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710
do is to get a hold of the print manager
 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.550
do is to get a hold of the print manager
so there's our entry point for the print

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560
so there's our entry point for the print
 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.530
so there's our entry point for the print
framework it's very similar to how you

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540
framework it's very similar to how you
 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.390
framework it's very similar to how you
get the package manager activity manager

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400
get the package manager activity manager
 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.160
get the package manager activity manager
is very standard way of getting an

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170
is very standard way of getting an
 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.520
is very standard way of getting an
android standard service once you get

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530
android standard service once you get
 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.280
android standard service once you get
the print manager all you have to do is

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290
the print manager all you have to do is
 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.710
the print manager all you have to do is
call the print method you pass the print

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720
call the print method you pass the print
 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.660
call the print method you pass the print
job name and you pass a print document

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670
job name and you pass a print document
 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.660
job name and you pass a print document
adapter so the print document adapter is

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670
adapter so the print document adapter is
 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.340
adapter so the print document adapter is
the important part here so that's a

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350
the important part here so that's a
 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.550
the important part here so that's a
piece of the piece of software that

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560
piece of the piece of software that
 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.430
piece of the piece of software that
generates PDF based on what user is

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440
generates PDF based on what user is
 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.490
generates PDF based on what user is
selected in the UI such that it can

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500
selected in the UI such that it can
 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:47.830
selected in the UI such that it can
produce the printed content so before

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840
produce the printed content so before
 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.140
produce the printed content so before
actually before I go into the details

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150
actually before I go into the details
 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.240
actually before I go into the details
how you write the print document adapter

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250
how you write the print document adapter
 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.360
how you write the print document adapter
I want to briefly explain how was the

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370
I want to briefly explain how was the
 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.390
I want to briefly explain how was the
philosophy of printing on Android so

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400
philosophy of printing on Android so
 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.550
philosophy of printing on Android so
when you print we the application calls

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560
when you print we the application calls
 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.590
when you print we the application calls
into the system and says hey I want to

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600
into the system and says hey I want to
 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.780
into the system and says hey I want to
print and this is where a collaborative

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790
print and this is where a collaborative
 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.640
print and this is where a collaborative
process starts between the system and

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650
process starts between the system and
 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.890
process starts between the system and
the application to generate the content

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900
the application to generate the content
 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.410
the application to generate the content
based on the user constraints so what I

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420
based on the user constraints so what I
 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.540
based on the user constraints so what I
mean by that is for example user changes

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550
mean by that is for example user changes
 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.660
mean by that is for example user changes
the paper size so if the paper size is

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.670
the paper size so if the paper size is
 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.180
the paper size so if the paper size is
different maybe your application one

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190
different maybe your application one
 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.190
different maybe your application one
wants to do a layout of two columns

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200
wants to do a layout of two columns
 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.660
wants to do a layout of two columns
instead of one column because you have

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670
instead of one column because you have
 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.920
instead of one column because you have
more space basically we want to

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930
more space basically we want to
 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.240
more space basically we want to
propagate all the constraints everything

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250
propagate all the constraints everything
 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.310
propagate all the constraints everything
the user has selected to the to the

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320
the user has selected to the to the
 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.110
the user has selected to the to the
applications so the application is in

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120
applications so the application is in
 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.790
applications so the application is in
the best position to lay out the content

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800
the best position to lay out the content
 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.600
the best position to lay out the content
the right way and render it I don't

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610
the right way and render it I don't
 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.800
the right way and render it I don't
think we changed was how we separated

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810
think we changed was how we separated
 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.320
think we changed was how we separated
layout

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330
layout
 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.140
layout
from rendering so layout is figuring out

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150
from rendering so layout is figuring out
 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.450
from rendering so layout is figuring out
how many pages you're going to have how

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460
how many pages you're going to have how
 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.089
how many pages you're going to have how
the content is going to be placed on the

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099
the content is going to be placed on the
 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.249
the content is going to be placed on the
pages and rendering is actually

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259
pages and rendering is actually
 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.570
pages and rendering is actually
producing the pixels from the layout the

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580
producing the pixels from the layout the
 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.189
producing the pixels from the layout the
reason we did this for example is if you

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199
reason we did this for example is if you
 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.439
reason we did this for example is if you
have a thousand page document you really

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:00.449
have a thousand page document you really
 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:02.179
have a thousand page document you really
need to lay out the whole content to

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:02.189
need to lay out the whole content to
 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.850
need to lay out the whole content to
know how many pages you have and what is

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860
know how many pages you have and what is
 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.969
know how many pages you have and what is
on page seven but if the user is looking

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979
on page seven but if the user is looking
 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.950
on page seven but if the user is looking
at page six and seven in the print

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960
at page six and seven in the print
 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.659
at page six and seven in the print
preview you don't want to render a

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669
preview you don't want to render a
 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:13.309
preview you don't want to render a
thousand pages because all you care is

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319
thousand pages because all you care is
 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:14.809
thousand pages because all you care is
rendering the two pages that the user

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:14.819
rendering the two pages that the user
 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:17.659
rendering the two pages that the user
can see so this is why we have two

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:17.669
can see so this is why we have two
 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:20.089
can see so this is why we have two
separate concepts of performing layout

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:20.099
separate concepts of performing layout
 

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:25.850
separate concepts of performing layout
and and rendering so so this is how the

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860
and and rendering so so this is how the
 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.309
and and rendering so so this is how the
layout callback looks on print document

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319
layout callback looks on print document
 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.450
layout callback looks on print document
adapter so it it provides you the print

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460
adapter so it it provides you the print
 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.249
adapter so it it provides you the print
attributes which is what the user has

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:34.259
attributes which is what the user has
 

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:37.249
attributes which is what the user has
selected in the UI and gives you a call

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:37.259
selected in the UI and gives you a call
 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:39.409
selected in the UI and gives you a call
back to tell us when you're ready it's

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419
back to tell us when you're ready it's
 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.600
back to tell us when you're ready it's
completely synchronous it is call it

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610
completely synchronous it is call it
 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.390
completely synchronous it is call it
this API you can do any you can take any

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400
this API you can do any you can take any
 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.800
this API you can do any you can take any
amount of work but the shorter it takes

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:45.810
amount of work but the shorter it takes
 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.330
amount of work but the shorter it takes
the better because this literally

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340
the better because this literally
 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.200
the better because this literally
affects the UX and when once you're

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.210
affects the UX and when once you're
 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.959
affects the UX and when once you're
ready you can call back and say hey I'm

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:53.969
ready you can call back and say hey I'm
 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:56.089
ready you can call back and say hey I'm
done I'm finished so here is information

00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099
done I'm finished so here is information
 

00:07:56.099 --> 00:07:57.559
done I'm finished so here is information
about the document it has this many

00:07:57.559 --> 00:07:57.569
about the document it has this many
 

00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:00.260
about the document it has this many
pages and it's this type you can also

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:00.270
pages and it's this type you can also
 

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.779
pages and it's this type you can also
say hey I failed because of this reason

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:02.789
say hey I failed because of this reason
 

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:06.379
say hey I failed because of this reason
and the reason Citra the reason string

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:06.389
and the reason Citra the reason string
 

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:09.740
and the reason Citra the reason string
goes into DUI so the user knows what

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:09.750
goes into DUI so the user knows what
 

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.649
goes into DUI so the user knows what
happened and also another callback word

00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:12.659
happened and also another callback word
 

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:16.339
happened and also another callback word
on the another callback is on Castle so

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:16.349
on the another callback is on Castle so
 

00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:18.950
on the another callback is on Castle so
the castle tis if you notice the on

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960
the castle tis if you notice the on
 

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.680
the castle tis if you notice the on
layout method takes a cancellation

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:21.690
layout method takes a cancellation
 

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.779
layout method takes a cancellation
signal and this is a way for the system

00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:23.789
signal and this is a way for the system
 

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:26.480
signal and this is a way for the system
to nicely tell you hey please stop what

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:26.490
to nicely tell you hey please stop what
 

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.850
to nicely tell you hey please stop what
you're doing because things changed and

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:28.860
you're doing because things changed and
 

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.579
you're doing because things changed and
what you're doing is irrelevant so for

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:31.589
what you're doing is irrelevant so for
 

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:34.399
what you're doing is irrelevant so for
example if the user selects a page a

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:34.409
example if the user selects a page a
 

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.709
example if the user selects a page a
page size a4 and you start doing a

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719
page size a4 and you start doing a
 

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.810
page size a4 and you start doing a
layout and the user changes in the

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820
layout and the user changes in the
 

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.269
layout and the user changes in the
meantime the page size again we're

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279
meantime the page size again we're
 

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:42.949
meantime the page size again we're
literally gonna ask me hey please stop

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959
literally gonna ask me hey please stop
 

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:43.939
literally gonna ask me hey please stop
what you're doing because there is

00:08:43.939 --> 00:08:43.949
what you're doing because there is
 

00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:46.009
what you're doing because there is
different page size and you have to do

00:08:46.009 --> 00:08:46.019
different page size and you have to do
 

00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:48.019
different page size and you have to do
the work again so the more responsive

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:48.029
the work again so the more responsive
 

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:49.970
the work again so the more responsive
you are the better the user experiences

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980
you are the better the user experiences
 

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.330
you are the better the user experiences
is so very similar to

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:55.340
is so very similar to
 

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.450
is so very similar to
lay out writing is very similar this is

00:08:59.450 --> 00:08:59.460
lay out writing is very similar this is
 

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.040
lay out writing is very similar this is
very similar work in a very similar way

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.050
very similar work in a very similar way
 

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.860
very similar work in a very similar way
so we're telling you hey please render

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:03.870
so we're telling you hey please render
 

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.270
so we're telling you hey please render
these pages and we'll give you a page

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:05.280
these pages and we'll give you a page
 

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.820
these pages and we'll give you a page
range and we provide your destination so

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:07.830
range and we provide your destination so
 

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.970
range and we provide your destination so
write these pages in PDF format to this

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980
write these pages in PDF format to this
 

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.180
write these pages in PDF format to this
file descriptor once you're ready you

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.190
file descriptor once you're ready you
 

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.430
file descriptor once you're ready you
again you get a callback and you can use

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440
again you get a callback and you can use
 

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.610
again you get a callback and you can use
the callback to tell us hey I'm finished

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:19.620
the callback to tell us hey I'm finished
 

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.310
the callback to tell us hey I'm finished
and these are the pages that I that I've

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320
and these are the pages that I that I've
 

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.190
and these are the pages that I that I've
written or you can say I fell because of

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200
written or you can say I fell because of
 

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.690
written or you can say I fell because of
this reason which showed it we showed

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700
this reason which showed it we showed
 

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.250
this reason which showed it we showed
this in the UI or you can say I was

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260
this in the UI or you can say I was
 

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.600
this in the UI or you can say I was
cancelled so now now at this point

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:32.610
cancelled so now now at this point
 

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.490
cancelled so now now at this point
you're probably already saying wow this

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:34.500
you're probably already saying wow this
 

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.080
you're probably already saying wow this
is super complicated I don't want to

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.090
is super complicated I don't want to
 

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.520
is super complicated I don't want to
deal with all these callbacks this is

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:37.530
deal with all these callbacks this is
 

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.680
deal with all these callbacks this is
just all I want to do is print a photo

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:39.690
just all I want to do is print a photo
 

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.840
just all I want to do is print a photo
it should be very simple very easy I

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:41.850
it should be very simple very easy I
 

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.910
it should be very simple very easy I
don't need to do it all deal with all

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920
don't need to do it all deal with all
 

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.180
don't need to do it all deal with all
these people complicated machinery and

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:46.190
these people complicated machinery and
 

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.550
these people complicated machinery and
and also you also think hey I don't know

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560
and also you also think hey I don't know
 

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.560
and also you also think hey I don't know
anything about PDF I'm actually the same

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:51.570
anything about PDF I'm actually the same
 

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.590
anything about PDF I'm actually the same
I know almost nothing and I want to be

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600
I know almost nothing and I want to be
 

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.690
I know almost nothing and I want to be
able to generate PDF content I don't

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:56.700
able to generate PDF content I don't
 

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.580
able to generate PDF content I don't
want to learn a PDF rendering library in

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:58.590
want to learn a PDF rendering library in
 

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.460
want to learn a PDF rendering library in
order to print very simple things and we

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:01.470
order to print very simple things and we
 

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.570
order to print very simple things and we
got you covered so we have a very simple

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580
got you covered so we have a very simple
 

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.620
got you covered so we have a very simple
class that allows you to generate PDF

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:09.630
class that allows you to generate PDF
 

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.800
class that allows you to generate PDF
from from and from using standard

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:12.810
from from and from using standard
 

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.260
from from and from using standard
Android rendering commands so we realize

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:15.270
Android rendering commands so we realize
 

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.490
Android rendering commands so we realize
that you probably already know how to

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.500
that you probably already know how to
 

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.010
that you probably already know how to
put pixels on the screen and if you know

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:19.020
put pixels on the screen and if you know
 

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.810
put pixels on the screen and if you know
how to use the Android rendering API so

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:20.820
how to use the Android rendering API so
 

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.180
how to use the Android rendering API so
you can use the same approach to

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:23.190
you can use the same approach to
 

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.540
you can use the same approach to
generate PDF content and so the PDF

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:26.550
generate PDF content and so the PDF
 

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.150
generate PDF content and so the PDF
document class is the helper that does

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160
document class is the helper that does
 

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.580
document class is the helper that does
that and the way it works is you create

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:31.590
that and the way it works is you create
 

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.420
that and the way it works is you create
a new PDF document you create a page

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:35.430
a new PDF document you create a page
 

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.510
a new PDF document you create a page
specification and you start the page

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:38.520
specification and you start the page
 

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.150
specification and you start the page
once you have the page this is where

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160
once you have the page this is where
 

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.310
once you have the page this is where
there is interesting parties you can

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320
there is interesting parties you can
 

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.350
there is interesting parties you can
literally get the canvas of the page and

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360
literally get the canvas of the page and
 

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.600
literally get the canvas of the page and
you can render anything you like so in

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:47.610
you can render anything you like so in
 

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.130
you can render anything you like so in
this case I'm just getting a content

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140
this case I'm just getting a content
 

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.260
this case I'm just getting a content
view which is just some view and asking

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:51.270
view which is just some view and asking
 

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.030
view which is just some view and asking
the view to draw itself on the canvas

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040
the view to draw itself on the canvas
 

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.660
the view to draw itself on the canvas
and once you finish the rendering you're

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:56.670
and once you finish the rendering you're
 

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.670
and once you finish the rendering you're
saying hey finish the page and write the

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680
saying hey finish the page and write the
 

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.830
saying hey finish the page and write the
document to this stream and that's it

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:00.840
document to this stream and that's it
 

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.530
document to this stream and that's it
you just generated PDF representation of

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540
you just generated PDF representation of
 

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.350
you just generated PDF representation of
whatever rendering commands you issued

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360
whatever rendering commands you issued
 

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.570
whatever rendering commands you issued
so it's pretty pretty easy

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:08.580
so it's pretty pretty easy
 

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:13.170
so it's pretty pretty easy
another another very useful facility we

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:13.180
another another very useful facility we
 

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.329
another another very useful facility we
have is being able to print bitmaps for

00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:15.339
have is being able to print bitmaps for
 

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:17.460
have is being able to print bitmaps for
example is how you have a photo all you

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:17.470
example is how you have a photo all you
 

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.290
example is how you have a photo all you
want to do is put this photo to this

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:19.300
want to do is put this photo to this
 

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.620
want to do is put this photo to this
printer in few lines of code and the way

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:22.630
printer in few lines of code and the way
 

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.050
printer in few lines of code and the way
to do this is using the print helper

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:25.060
to do this is using the print helper
 

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.430
to do this is using the print helper
from the support library which is

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440
from the support library which is
 

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.880
from the support library which is
dedicated for printing bitmaps to in a

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:29.890
dedicated for printing bitmaps to in a
 

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.699
dedicated for printing bitmaps to in a
backwards compatible fashion and the way

how the framework should work to this

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:09.490
how the framework should work to this
 

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.510
how the framework should work to this
and I don't see I use it already but

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:12.520
and I don't see I use it already but
 

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.910

with proper proprietary protocols to
print I wonder if there is any plan to

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:17.230
print I wonder if there is any plan to
 

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.840
print I wonder if there is any plan to
incorporate this in the framework so

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:18.850
incorporate this in the framework so
 

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.450
incorporate this in the framework so
that we have we can use the same

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:20.460
that we have we can use the same
 

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.190
that we have we can use the same
extractor and platform to print and

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:30.940
 

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.919
right so actually a very good question

00:26:32.919 --> 00:26:32.929
right so actually a very good question
 

00:26:32.929 --> 00:26:36.909
right so actually a very good question
again it's really to the vendor who

additional is the paper size right so

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:43.850
additional is the paper size right so
 

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.399
additional is the paper size right so
it's a special paper right but the

00:26:45.399 --> 00:26:45.409
it's a special paper right but the
 

00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:47.230
it's a special paper right but the

probably the announcement of the api's
 

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.980
probably the announcement of the api's

question is what about support for

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:51.500
question is what about support for
 

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.570
question is what about support for
before API 19 which is use the old cloud

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:55.580
before API 19 which is use the old cloud
 

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:02.740
before API 19 which is use the old cloud
print or well I can answer I can say

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:02.750
print or well I can answer I can say
 

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.919
print or well I can answer I can say
that before API 19 where it's the same

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:05.929
that before API 19 where it's the same
 

00:28:05.929 --> 00:28:09.669
that before API 19 where it's the same
same yeah before I mean the API is

00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679
same yeah before I mean the API is
 

00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:11.680
same yeah before I mean the API is
reintroduced in KitKat so you know if

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:11.690
reintroduced in KitKat so you know if
 

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.110
reintroduced in KitKat so you know if
you want to add print into your app for

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:14.120
you want to add print into your app for
 

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.659
you want to add print into your app for
backwards compatibility you

00:28:15.659 --> 00:28:15.669
backwards compatibility you
 

00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:17.740
backwards compatibility you
unfortunately have to fall back to the

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:17.750
unfortunately have to fall back to the
 

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.210
unfortunately have to fall back to the
old approach you just check the API

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:19.220
old approach you just check the API
 

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.070
old approach you just check the API
level of device you're running in okay

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080
level of device you're running in okay
 

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.840
level of device you're running in okay
and then fall back to the throw over the

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:22.850
and then fall back to the throw over the
 

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.250
and then fall back to the throw over the
wall approach where you just use the

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:24.260
wall approach where you just use the
 

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.009
wall approach where you just use the
share intent unfortunately that's the

00:28:27.009 --> 00:28:27.019
share intent unfortunately that's the
 

00:28:27.019 --> 00:28:30.879
share intent unfortunately that's the
only way we we looped into back part in

00:28:30.879 --> 00:28:30.889
only way we we looped into back part in
 

00:28:30.889 --> 00:28:32.350
only way we we looped into back part in
the premium work but it just doesn't

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360
the premium work but it just doesn't
 

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:38.510
the premium work but it just doesn't
it's not feasible to all devices

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520
 

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.670
I have a question does this framework

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:40.680
I have a question does this framework
 

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.220
I have a question does this framework
extend to Chrome OS as well and are you

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:43.230
extend to Chrome OS as well and are you
 

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:49.010
extend to Chrome OS as well and are you
writing Chrome apps as these drivers so

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:49.020
writing Chrome apps as these drivers so
 

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.600
writing Chrome apps as these drivers so
we're working with them and it's not all

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:50.610
we're working with them and it's not all
 

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.400
we're working with them and it's not all
completely finalized how we're gonna do

bringing printing to Chrome OS and as

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:56.430
bringing printing to Chrome OS and as
 

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.380
bringing printing to Chrome OS and as
good as possible and also bringing

good as possible and also bringing
 

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.910
good as possible and also bringing
Android on Chrome OS apps they should

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:01.920
Android on Chrome OS apps they should
 

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.680
Android on Chrome OS apps they should
print too and you're gonna make this

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:03.690
print too and you're gonna make this
 

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:09.890
print too and you're gonna make this
work of course Thanks yeah just to build

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:09.900
work of course Thanks yeah just to build
 

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.230
work of course Thanks yeah just to build
on that a little bit so chrome actually

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240
on that a little bit so chrome actually
 

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.930
on that a little bit so chrome actually
has print api's they're not the same as

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940
has print api's they're not the same as
 

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.810
has print api's they're not the same as
are in Android but they are available

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820
are in Android but they are available
 

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.730
are in Android but they are available
and they have a similar life cycle where

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:19.740
and they have a similar life cycle where
 

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.040
and they have a similar life cycle where
the user selects file print you get an

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:22.050
the user selects file print you get an
 

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.990
the user selects file print you get an
event you can then respond to that with

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000
event you can then respond to that with
 

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.750
event you can then respond to that with
the printers that your chrome app

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760
the printers that your chrome app
 

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.240
the printers that your chrome app
supports and you can run discovery and

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:29.250
supports and you can run discovery and
 

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.410
supports and you can run discovery and
do whatever you need to do there it

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:30.420
do whatever you need to do there it
 

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.880
do whatever you need to do there it
could be standardized it's using the

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:31.890
could be standardized it's using the
 

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.550
could be standardized it's using the
same things that we're using here and

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:34.560
same things that we're using here and
 

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.490
same things that we're using here and
then beyond that is getting capabilities

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:36.500
then beyond that is getting capabilities
 

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.500
then beyond that is getting capabilities
the accepting the print content and then

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:39.510
the accepting the print content and then
 

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:40.490
the accepting the print content and then
tracking status

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500
tracking status
 

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.320
tracking status
so all those api's and hooks are there

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:42.330
so all those api's and hooks are there
 

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:45.890
so all those api's and hooks are there
for a chrome app that you can build a

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:45.900
for a chrome app that you can build a
 

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.510
for a chrome app that you can build a
can tie into the native file print path

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520
can tie into the native file print path
 

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.920
can tie into the native file print path
a chrome printers are not cloud ready

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:51.930
a chrome printers are not cloud ready
 

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.950
a chrome printers are not cloud ready
and they they want to print directly

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960
and they they want to print directly
 

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.870
and they they want to print directly
through the driver instead of going

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880
through the driver instead of going
 

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.760
through the driver instead of going
through Google Cloud Print so for those

00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:58.770
through Google Cloud Print so for those
 

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:00.710
through Google Cloud Print so for those
use cases it will be useful to have a

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720
use cases it will be useful to have a
 

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.610
use cases it will be useful to have a
chrome app as absolutely and in fact

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620
chrome app as absolutely and in fact
 

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.080
chrome app as absolutely and in fact
that's kind of what I was referring to

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:06.090
that's kind of what I was referring to
 

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:07.880
that's kind of what I was referring to
the api's I'm talking about they don't

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:07.890
the api's I'm talking about they don't
 

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.330
the api's I'm talking about they don't
leverage the GCP path so you can do a

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:11.340
leverage the GCP path so you can do a
 

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.540
leverage the GCP path so you can do a
direct print and not go through Google

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:14.550
direct print and not go through Google
 

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.070
direct print and not go through Google
Cloud Print infrastructure using those

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080
Cloud Print infrastructure using those
 

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.680
Cloud Print infrastructure using those
API is that Chrome provided that they I

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:18.690
API is that Chrome provided that they I
 

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.720

think they were released last year

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:20.730
think they were released last year
 

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.730
think they were released last year
sometime so but they are there and I

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:24.740
sometime so but they are there and I
 

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.960
sometime so but they are there and I
guess if you have questions after I can

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:26.970
guess if you have questions after I can
 

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.570
guess if you have questions after I can
talk more about that actually there's a

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580
talk more about that actually there's a
 

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.340
talk more about that actually there's a
name for that API I think they just

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:31.350
name for that API I think they just
 

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.170
name for that API I think they just
released last year's called printer

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:33.180

printer companies to provide that and

00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:09.809
printer companies to provide that and
 

00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:12.020
printer companies to provide that and
then with that in place you don't need

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:12.030
then with that in place you don't need
 

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:15.350
then with that in place you don't need
the you don't need the GCP path you can

the you don't need the GCP path you can
 

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.330
the you don't need the GCP path you can
print through these plugins and it will

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:17.340
print through these plugins and it will
 

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.279
print through these plugins and it will
translate to what the printer needs and

00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:19.289
translate to what the printer needs and
 

00:31:19.289 --> 00:31:22.490
translate to what the printer needs and
there's also a map riah plugin which is
