00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.030
Socialism used to be a dirty word in the U.S.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.999
But now for many young Americans strapped
with debt, disenchanted with mainstream politics

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:12.139
and uncertain about their economic future,
socialist ideas might just be a breath of

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.139
fresh air.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.270
So what is this new political movement - and
have we seen it before?

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.970
So Zach, you joined the DSA when?

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.420
I joined the morning after the presidential
election in 2016 when Trump was elected

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.359
So you were scared socialist?

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.520
Why do you think so many young people like
yourself are joining the DSA?

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.950
We’ve seen what the system does to people
and how much people are struggling and things

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.800
aren't getting better for the 99%.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.370
Like, we’re just seeing rich people get
richer and richer.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.120
Lucie Macias is the co-chair of the Chicago
chapter of Democratic Socialists of America,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.350
a national organization that works on grassroots
campaigns, stages actions like confronting

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.800
the Homeland Security secretary during her
Mexican dinner, and helps to elect like-minded

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800
candidates.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.750
I think what's great about electoral work
is we can have our foot in the electoral door,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.490
but we also have a foot in other work.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.820
DSA is now approaching 50,000 members nationwide,
with 167 branches - a number that’s surged

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.280
since Bernie Sanders’ presidential run.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.530
And unlike in 2016, Democratic Socialist candidates
are winning.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.370
From national victories like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
and Rashida Tlaib, to races at all levels

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.370
of government.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.800
It’s enough to cause panic both in the GOP,
and within the Democratic Party.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.680
I’m here in the Logan Square area in Chicago
and I'm about to meet up with their councilman,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.850
who happens to be a Democratic Socialist.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.850
And guess what?

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.800
He’s only 28!

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.840
Did you just knock on doors and were like,
“Hey I’m a socialist”?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.140
I think that sometimes people get confused
by a label.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.130
So when I knocked on doors, I said I was going
to stand up to the big corporations that were

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.630
too powerful in city hall.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.180
I was going to make sure that our public dollars
benefit our public schools, benefited our

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.380
communities and invested in after-school programs,
job programs, mental health services.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.720
And it wasn’t until later, after I was elected,
that I came out and said, “I’m a

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.320
Democratic Socialist.”

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.280
If you’re a Democratic Socialist, why not
run on the Socialist Party ticket?

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.681
People that want to tax the rich, they want
to protect immigrants, they want to stand

00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:29.530
up for women’s rights, for workers' rights,
they’re already voting in large numbers

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.599
for the Democratic Party line.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.490
So let's actually give them what they want.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.970
Let’s give them Democratic Socialists on
that party line that are actually going to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.170
deliver the policies that the Democratic Party
should be standing for.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.660
Damn, this guy has got it together.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.490
And he doesn’t mince words when calling
out moderate Dems.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.069
I think here in the context of Chicago, I
learned that the Democratic Party is very

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.940
much tied to the establishment and the monied
interests.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.520
Do you think the moderate Democrats and the
establishment Democrats are afraid of

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.520
you guys?

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.520
Absolutely.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.810
We can see, when they begin to fight you,
that’s when you know they feel threatened

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.099
by you.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.709
All these inspiring young Socialists running
for office and winning.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.900
It feels unprecedented, but is it?

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.580
Let’s rewind.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.990
Socialism in America, and throughout the industrialized
world, first took root in trade unions and

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.120
in a movement to protect and advance the rights
of workers.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.810
Chicago was once the center of the Industrial
Revolution and, along with explosive growth

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.920
and profit, came a whole lot of exploitation.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.849
People were working 16 hours a day, living
in terrible conditions, this is just a fact.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:48.069
And a movement began, called the 8-hour day
movement - 8 hours for work, 8 hours for sleep,

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.070
8 hours for what you will.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.920
Meet Larry Spivak, the premiere labor history
tour guide of Chicago.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.710
You want labor history?

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.710
You go to Larry.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:04.239
So that monument there is the exact site where
the Haymarket Rally of May 4th, 1886 took

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.040
place, which was what some could argue was
one of the most important and influential

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.370
historical events of the last 150 years, in
the world!

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.659
The Haymarket Affair happened when a labor
protest in support of the 8-hour work day

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.439
turned violent, ultimately ending in the death
sentence of four activists.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:28.020
It was a tragedy in so many ways, for those
who were killed, and it set back the working

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.460
class movement for awhile.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.409
It was really the first “Red Scare.”

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:37.050
“Red Scare” tactics meant portraying socialist
ideas as somehow foreign and un-American.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.939
Back in the day, calling for free healthcare
would get you accused of being an agent of

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.029
the Soviet Union.

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.100
Today, you’ll be accused of wanting to turn
this country into Venezuela.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.639
One-third of Chicago was German-speaking at
that time.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.600
Today, it’s one-third Spanish-speaking.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.479
But the Germans were despised.

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:59.740
Basically, you could take today and go back
to 1886 and just substitute Latin American

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.389
or Mexican for German, and you’d get the
xenophobia and the “America first” and

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.639
the native-born hatred toward these German
immigrants.

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.849
But how foreign of a concept is socialism?

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.400
This is John Nichols, who wrote the book “The
S-Word, a Short History of an American Tradition,”

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.330
a history that's actually quite long

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.860
America’s always had a socialist or social
democratic presence, going back to the founding

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.050
of the country.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.710
In the very first years of the Republic, Tom
Paine wrote his pamphlet, “Agrarian Justice.”

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.030
That was in 1797.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:44.199
And so, even before the word “socialism”
was used, you had people advocating for solutions

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.279
to problems that involved a redistribution
of the wealth.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:53.430
What have been the economic conditions and
the conditions of the United States that have

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.330
led to these socialist movements?

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.199
In the 1890s, the start of the 1900s, first-off
you saw a great economic downturn in 1893.

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.050
But then you also saw the Gilded Age, this
incredible inequality in that period.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.960
In the 1930s, you saw a similar thing.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.159
A great depression of course, but also immense
wealth surrounded by great poverty.

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:17.909
And Roosevelt really started to talk about
that.

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:19.699
Others did as well.

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:25.779
So again and again throughout history, what
we have seen are moments where economic turbulence

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:31.080
and technological change - that combination
- has caused people to pause and say, “Hey,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.259
who’s got an idea here?

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.029
Who’s got a solution for the circumstance
we’re in?”

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.610
Because the wealth is not distributed appropriately.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.889
The power is not distributed appropriately.

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.130
We are oppressing some people while empowering
others.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:52.990
What moment are we in right now when it comes
to capitalism and exploitation and this entire

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.509
push and pull of history?

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:59.840
We are currently experiencing the equivalent
of three industrial revolutions at the

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.940
same time.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.460
And there's a real sense of lack of control
- that the great mass of people aren't making

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.229
the decisions about our technological changes.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.449
All this change is happening, but we don't
necessarily get a signal that things are getting

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:15.120
a lot better.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:22.720
And in a moment like that, it is incredibly
necessary to have new ideas.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.680
Time in to 2018, I’m back at another DSA
meeting.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.380
They seem to do a lot of this.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.440
You know, things are happening in this world
where people are hurting, people are not able

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.800
to have a place to live, people aren't able
to access healthcare.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.000
People are literally dying because their GoFundMe
to get insulin fell $50 short.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.089
Like, it really is sometimes life or death
for people, so this is why we believe so much

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:49.139
in what we do.

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:56.229
I do think that Democratic Socialism has historically
been about the meeting in a sweaty hall, late

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:57.229
at night.

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:03.039
It’s about going to the mom who's at the
drive-thru at Wendy’s or Burger King and

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:07.069
treating her as a human being and respecting
the struggles that she is facing economically

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.319
and trying to come up with answers for her.

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:13.369
And I do see in the contemporary movement
a lot of that.

00:08:13.369 --> 00:08:18.159
I see a lot of young activists going out and making very practical

00:08:18.159 --> 00:08:19.490
connections with people.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:25.740
If they continue to do it, my sense is that
this is a movement that will stick.
