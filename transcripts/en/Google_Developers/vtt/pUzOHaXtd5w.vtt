RAQUEL ROMANO: Thank you.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.320
So I recently learned that
the theory that people

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.560
are predominately left
brained or right brained

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.865
is actually a myth.

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:24.250
I think this was a study
published last year.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.960
And that was a big relief to me.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.180
I'm really glad I'm
using my entire brain.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.440
But for a long
time, ever since I

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.746
began having to think about
my career and my major,

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.370
and what am I going
to do with college,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.270
what am I going to
do after college?

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.700
I started feeling
pretty left brained.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.816
I studied math as an
undergrad at Harvard.

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:49.860
I got interested
in computer science

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.980
toward the end of
college, and ended up

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.510
getting my Masters and
Ph.D. In computer science.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.910
So I really felt like
this began to define me,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.860
living, eating, and breathing
math and technology.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.590
And then, at some point, I
started having these questions

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.500
that other people
have mentioned today.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.930
What's the big picture
of what my work will

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.310
be when I'm done
with my education?

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100
What's the impact?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.200
What do I want to be able
to do look at and say

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.280
this is what I'm working toward?

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.090
This greater goal.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.610
Unfortunately, this happened
during this agonizing two year

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.530
stretch during which I was
trying to finish my PhD thesis.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.180
And I was really touched that
this cartoonist understand

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.340
me so well to have actually
made an entire cartoon

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.520
strip about how you
feel when you have

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.310
this huge looming
project ahead of you,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.630
that you can't seem to finish.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.770
And you become completely
obsessed with something else.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.880
And that's how I was.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.060
Whenever I needed a break
from my Ph.D. Thesis,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.180
which was in machine vision,
I was looking all over the web

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.630
for any application
of technology

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.970
to sort of nonprofit ventures.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.740
And I really felt like, hm,
there's got to be away for this

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.126
to have an impact that I can
really put my passion behind.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.270
And, although I continued
with my career and I thought,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.890
yeah, I did finish my
Ph.D. And I did a post-doc,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.880
and ended up coming to Google
and doing a lot of work

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.560
on really interesting problems
in machine vision and machine

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.560
learning.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.490
Something that, kind
of, kept gnawing at me

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.200
and that I kept admiring about
people who had made a career of

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.080
is just looking at social
inequality, economic,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.872
wealth inequality, racial
inequality, and people

00:02:42.872 --> 00:02:44.080
who were making a difference.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.715
And I kept thinking,
well I admire that.

00:02:48.715 --> 00:02:50.487
That means a lot to me.

00:02:50.487 --> 00:02:52.570
I would love to be able
to make an impact on that.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.420
But I really like math
and computer science.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.950
That's what I'm good at.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.900
So I'm going to have
to make these two

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.050
separate parts of my life.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.169
But this idea, this
inequality, you

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.710
see it every day in
different places.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.020
I see it right here, today,
every morning, everywhere.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.554
I just couldn't help
but I think, someday I'd

00:03:11.554 --> 00:03:13.470
like to actually make
an impact in that world.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.890
And I'm still
working toward that.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.200
So while at Google,
I was working,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.690
as I said, doing really
interesting problems that I

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.010
felt lucky to do in
my area of expertise.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.520
And I've been here a few
years when a colleague I knew,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.590
actually through Google Women
Engineers group in New York,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.730
said that she-- this was in
2010-- that she had just joined

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.325
and new team.

00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:39.900
She used to work on Maps.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.670
She was very successful
in Google Maps.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.985
Oh, yeah, what's your new team?

00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:44.672
Because she was
visiting Mountain View.

00:03:44.672 --> 00:03:46.130
It's called Google
Crisis Response.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.963
And we're trying to
form a team of engineers

00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:52.260
to look at what happens
after a natural disaster as

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.730
far as people finding
information they need on

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.150
the internet, if
possible, when possible.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.464
I was like, that's really cool.

00:03:59.464 --> 00:04:00.930
I thought, hm,
that's really cool

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.500
that we have an engineering
team working on that.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.320
So this picture is actually of
Typhoon Yolanda the last year

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.640
hitting the Philippines.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.776
But I kind of kept
tabs on their work.

00:04:11.776 --> 00:04:13.900
They were trying to figure
out, what's our mission?

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.580
We know our mission, but
how are we going to do this?

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.040
And what role does
technology play?

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.550
And then later that
year I was actually

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.080
in the hospital recovering after
the birth of my third child.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.900
And, it's 2010, August, and
I don't watch TV at home,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.300
because we don't
have it plugged in.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.330
But in the hospital
room I put the TV on.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.520
And there were floods
in Pakistan that summer

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.810
that actually covered about
a fifth of the country.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.310
And I was literally in shock
to hear about these women who

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.100
were pregnant, and actually
had to stop as they were

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:59.800
on foot, evacuating, and giving
birth somewhere and continuing

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.690
to leave.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.540
One of these pictures is
someone who was actually

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.900
born during-- a mom
and her baby who

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.800
were born during that event.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.330
And what really struck me
about this, partly was just

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.080
identifying so strongly,
like, oh my gosh,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.080
I'm here in a hospital
in Silicon Valley.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.850
And we're so alike and yet,
have nothing in common as far as

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.140
how our experiences are going.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.480
And it really struck
me that, wow, you know,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.170
vulnerable people are
hit by natural disasters

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.580
so much harder than
people who have

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.140
privilege and wealth and
the means to handle things.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.620
So that really stuck with me.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.080
And women and children, women
in particular, children,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.890
sick, elderly, and women
who are taking care often

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.490
of the sick, and the
young, and the elderly,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.115
are really affected
disproportionately.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.550
So after this, I was
on maternity leave,

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.460
and a few other
things kept happening

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.350
that kept reminding
me about this team.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.810
So during maternity
leave, I just

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.476
suddenly-- I'm a very
indecisive person,

00:06:07.476 --> 00:06:10.390
I usually like to weigh the pros
and cons forever-- and I just,

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.670
one day, my baby was
only a few months old,

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.940
when I was like oh,
I'm switching teams.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.730
I absolutely have
to get on that team

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.890
and work on that when I
return from maternity leave.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.030
Usually returning
from maternity leave

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.931
is not the best time
to just join a new team

00:06:24.931 --> 00:06:26.430
and do something
complete different,

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.930
because it's a
little bit stressful.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.834
But I had absolutely no doubt,
which is very unlike me.

00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:33.250
So I want to tell
you a little bit

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.750
about what my team
does at Google.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.630
The first thing
that I want to say

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.546
is that we're still
working toward-- you know,

00:06:41.546 --> 00:06:43.750
when I told you something
that really gnaws at me

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.170
is this idea of
social inequality.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.586
And I don't think
we're there yet.

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:49.566
But I think there are many
opportunities for technology

00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:50.440
to make a difference.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.773
And I often question, like,
is technology just something

00:06:52.773 --> 00:06:55.650
that, like everything else,
empowers the privileged

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.170
and disempowers the
underprivileged.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.640
But there's another half of me
that thinks, no, it's powerful,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.790
and it's possible.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.010
And we have to keep
working on these problems.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.949
So here's the first
question, are people even

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:09.990
able to use the internet
after natural disasters?

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.430
Isn't everything
just dysfunctional?

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.390
And that is true sometimes.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:21.500
That was true, say, last year
after the Philippines Typhoon,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.710
that really very few people
were able to use phones

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.400
to do anything, to actually
connect to the internet.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.990
Not to mention that
in a lot of countries,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.500
even if people are
starting to have access

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.930
to smart phones they
may not have the ability

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.000
to be able to afford data plans.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.250
Or there may not be any
connectivity in their area eve

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.874
before a disaster hits.

00:07:41.874 --> 00:07:43.540
These are all pretty
important problems.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.081
And actually we have
a team at Google

00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:47.870
that's focused completely
on internet access

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.560
in parts of the worlds
that don't have access.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.030
And that's really
important work.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.080
On the other hand, we're
a tech company, Google.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.240
And when people do
have access, and they

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.910
have a phone that is charged
and the internet is available,

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.170
which it turns out can be true
in some situations-- these

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.570
are graphs of traffic to
Google from a location

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.810
directly after a
natural disaster.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.945
And you can see
in Haiti, clearly

00:08:21.945 --> 00:08:27.380
it took a few months to get
back to the previous traffic.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.090
But in other places, like in
Japan after the earthquake,

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.990
there was almost
no interruption.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.169
And in those cases,
you really should

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.860
be able to find what
you're looking for

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.830
and be able to get
information, if that's

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.454
one of the only means
of communication.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.170
In addition, as we saw,
these are both pictures

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.560
from the Philippines last year
where internet cafes spring up.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.190
There are lots of
telecom companies

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.500
who put up portable Internets.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.930
And there are places that
offer charging stations

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.500
and let people try to get
online and communicate and find

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.280
information.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.490
So what information?

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.910
What would you use your phone
for if this were happening

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:21.906
to you, and you had a working
phone, and something happened?

00:09:21.906 --> 00:09:23.530
So if you think about
where information

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.475
comes from these days,
it comes from a variety

00:09:26.475 --> 00:09:27.350
of different sources.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.924
And the burden's
on you to decide

00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:30.340
what you're going
to look at, what

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.770
you're going to
pay attention to.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.110
And maybe we can take
some of that burden off.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.190
So some of the places
information comes from

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.635
is just the people
that you know,

00:09:39.635 --> 00:09:42.120
and how you connect with them
on the internet, Twitter,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.130
Facebook, email, et cetera.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.100
So there's a lot
of chatter, there's

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.970
a lot of personal
information exchange.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:49.980
But there's also
a lot of rumors.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.229
And there's a lot of uncertainty
about what to believe

00:09:52.229 --> 00:09:54.631
and what's happening.

00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:56.380
So we have official
sources of information

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.150
that you might think, oh, yeah,
I need to go to those as well.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.140
Let me get the facts.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.390
So something like NOAH, or
the National Weather Service,

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.952
for instance in this country.

00:10:07.952 --> 00:10:10.160
And yes, you can get facts,
but sometimes those facts

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.660
are a little bit generic and
not specific to your situation.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.530
So if you get some information,
like, oh, during a flood

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.190
you should seek higher ground.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.630
That's a little bit frustrating
if you're in a flood.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.290
You know that.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.520
So that's not useful.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.590
But we have media.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.240
And, in addition,
I should say that

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.050
those official
organization maybe

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.430
don't have the most mobile
friendly sites, compared

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.450
to what you're used to.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.282
And maybe you can't even
load information from them.

00:10:39.282 --> 00:10:41.490
But media, media is really
great at presenting things

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.410
to you on your phone.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.410
And so they like to synthesize
information and provide

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.295
it maybe localized a little
bit to your situation.

00:10:49.295 --> 00:10:50.670
But that can also
be frustrating.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.290
So if you're searching
for information,

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.230
because you want to know
what to do during a flood,

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.620
you may not want to
hear, like a little story

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.322
about how, hm, this is going on.

00:11:00.322 --> 00:11:02.280
A story that's meant for
the rest of the world,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.140
for instance, that
interviews a few people

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.870
about how they're
dealing with it.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.900
I mean, you're not reading it
to browse it and get informed

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.810
and get an overview.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.605
You really need to
solve some problem.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.880
So let's walk through a
little bit what might happen,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.940
and some of the things that
we've built on our team.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.350
So one of the first
things that we realized

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.280
technology can do
to help you, is

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.210
to get you out of the
situation in the first place.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:35.620
So on the left you see back
in the day, before internet,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.960
and when it was only
broadcast network

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.129
TV, if there was
a tornado coming

00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:44.670
through your neighborhood, you
would get a warning like this.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.750
And it would interrupt
"Happy Days" for a while.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.490
And you'd be like,
oh, OK, so that's

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.300
something really bad
that's happening.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.800
We should go to the
basement, if you

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.210
live in the Midwest
of United States.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:12:00.710
Today, from the same
organization, National Weather

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.620
Service in this case,
you can get warnings

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.079
on your phone, that look like
what you have on the right.

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:07.370
Because you're not watching TV.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.910
You're probably-- your
phone maybe in your pocket.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.890
Or you're on the web.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.580
And if you go to, say a Google
search look for something,

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.980
and Google is able to tell
that you're in that location,

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.280
you might see this
kind of warning.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.067
Now to get to what you see on
the right takes a lot of time,

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:29.400
and a lot of resources, and
a lot of interesting problem

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.820
solving.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.550
First, we've had to
work with organizations

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.580
who publish this data.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.880
We're not the ones
who have this data.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.870
We don't want to
control the content.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.660
We just want that
content to be available

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.710
so that it can be
consumed, whether it's

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.850
by us and this product, or
any other product out there.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:52.880
Any application should be
able to take this information

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.890
and present it to people.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.370
So we worked with governments
who, they're really

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.590
resources constrained
as far as technology,

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.080
and don't have a whole slew
of developers out there.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.050
But we work with
agencies to help

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.920
them publish this
data in formats

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.210
that meet certain standards
that have been agreed upon,

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.190
so that we can build tools
against those standards

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.800
and APIs that can
pull in that data

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.835
and present it to
people in useful ways.

00:13:23.317 --> 00:13:25.650
The engineering behind it is
really interesting as well.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.049
You don't want to be telling
people something that

00:13:28.049 --> 00:13:28.840
happened yesterday.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.214
You don't want to
be telling them

00:13:30.214 --> 00:13:31.700
something that's
not very important

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.900
and is kind of spam-y,
because they'll turn it off.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.090
And then when something
really important happens

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.660
they're not using the service.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.660
So this is a very
interesting project.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.700
It's launching in more
and more countries

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.590
as we work closely with each
government and their set

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.110
of agencies, and
other intricacies,

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.110
and licensing issues.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.390
So you can be more
about it at that URL.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.990
So now let's say you're like,
oh, yeah, something's happening

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.110
and I need to leave.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.995
Well people probably
want to use products

00:14:02.995 --> 00:14:04.120
that they're familiar with.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.265
You don't want to
just go, hey let

00:14:05.265 --> 00:14:06.870
me go learn a
completely new tool,

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.640
because I'm totally panicked
and I need to get out of here.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.190
No, you would go to Maps.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.440
But Google Maps,
which is obviously

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.840
a pretty popular
mapping application,

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.870
are you sure that it's
going to be giving you

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:22.840
up to date information?

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.850
It can, for instance, here this
is last month, greater New York

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.180
area during a snowstorm.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.280
And I actually have never
seen black anywhere.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.510
It's worse than red, things
aren't moving at all.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.220
But is it telling you-- say
some thing were happening

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:46.420
that, a bridge was gone,
certain areas were impassable.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.510
The data that's there daily
is going to be different.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:54.052
And the sources of data that
emerge after a disaster are

00:14:54.052 --> 00:14:56.010
typically different from
what was there before,

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.750
which makes it a very
difficult problem

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.900
to build systems that just work
in a disaster, when suddenly

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.140
it's like, OK this is
where all our data comes

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.331
from for Maps and directions.

00:15:06.331 --> 00:15:08.330
And now something totally
different has happened

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.520
and this organization is
getting data about that,

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.644
and publishing it in this
totally different format.

00:15:12.644 --> 00:15:15.440
And you'd like to have that
show up directly in Maps.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.620
So this is an active
area of research

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.800
for us, and development,
really interesting.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.150
Also, you may have so
many other constraints

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.670
to want to be able
to see the same time.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.300
You have someone in your
family, an elderly person,

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.470
that you need to, if
you're going to evacuate,

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.700
may need to stop at
hospitals or pharmacies.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.320
Or resources that you'd want
to pick your path for how

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.440
to leave and have more
information overlaid.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.620
So these are
interesting problems.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.560
And then you probably
need to find the people

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:55.500
that you love, making contact
with people who are immediately

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.320
in your family, and
then more distantly.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.270
And this is also, turned out
after the Haiti earthquake

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.220
of 2010, there were
multiple places

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:10.150
where people could go
and search for or enter

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.970
that they were
missing loved ones.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.729
And that makes it
really hard for someone,

00:16:13.729 --> 00:16:15.520
if you have to go to
seven different places

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.520
every single day to
search for the person

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.050
that you need to locate.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:30.480
And so one of our engineers
helped write a specification

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.100
for how to store information
about missing people.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.194
And made this open,
and the engineers who

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:37.610
started Google Crisis Response
built an application on top

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.085
of it that's open source, called
Person Finder, Google Person

00:16:41.085 --> 00:16:49.460
Finder, to be able to have
different organizations

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.120
building and set
standards, share data.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.870
So that if I put information
in one place, someone searches

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:57.510
in another place, if
they're sharing data then

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:01.730
you'll be able to see that,
yes your aunt or uncle

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.240
has been found and they're fine.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.880
And you can stop searching.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.735
And every time, every
year, new technology

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:08.890
is built on this standard.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.319
It's really interesting.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:15.190
After Japan, people were
posting signs looking,

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.682
have seen this person?

00:17:16.682 --> 00:17:18.640
And people were taking
pictures of those signs,

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.329
posting them on the
web, and crowd sourcing

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:25.240
the transcriptions and using
the API for Person Finder

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:31.190
to enter them into
the same data store.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:35.100
After the floods in Uttarakhand
last year, government agencies

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.950
were going to relief
camps and writing down

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.230
by hand people who were there.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.090
And then those were
being posted on the web,

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.460
and transcribed, and entered in.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.550
People were building
apps, mobile apps,

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:51.710
and SMS interfaces to be able
to all exchange this data.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.310
So this was a really
good example--

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.860
if you want to learn more about
it go to this URL-- of how

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.040
standardizing data and building
open tools on open standards

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.950
can improve the experience
of people trying

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.190
to find information
after disasters.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.760
So those were just
some example questions

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.190
that you might have
after a disaster.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.920
I actually have never been
in that sort of situation.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.850
And I think a lot of us
who work in this space

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.200
don't have first
hand experience.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.250
And as a team, we realized this.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.980
And we decided, we really
need to go educate ourselves.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.390
We think we have these
cover solutions and answers.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.480
But do we really know
what people need?

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.720
So we worked with
an ethnographer

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.300
this summer to go
to New Orleans--

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.170
a place that has seen
hurricanes in the past,

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.020
will continue to
see them in future--

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.950
and do interviews of
people from all sorts

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.530
of different demographics.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.741
And this is a really, really
small subset, tiny subset,

00:18:57.741 --> 00:18:59.490
of the kinds of questions
that people ask.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.390
In green is questions people
are asking immediately

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.360
before a disaster's
about to happen,

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.910
if it's a kind of thing
where you have some notice.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.130
In blue, during a disaster, what
kinds of questions people ask.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.339
And in yellow,
immediately after,

00:19:15.339 --> 00:19:16.880
what are your most
pressing questions

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.470
that you really want answered.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.240
And in red is the questions
you have even long

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.250
after it's passed, even when
it's no longer in the news.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.150
But your life is still not OK.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:35.070
And these questions were
really looking into a,

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.350
there's so many we weren't
able to answer yet.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.470
And a lot of it is, well
who has those answers?

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.452
Where is that data?

00:19:40.452 --> 00:19:42.410
Even if it's available,
even if we can find it,

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.220
how can it be
published in a way that

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.650
can be incorporated
and sent back

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.230
to people in a way it's
useful, that people can just

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.177
quickly get that answer and
not a have to spent time

00:19:53.177 --> 00:19:55.510
searching through multiple
websites and getting confused

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:57.817
and ultimately just giving up?

00:19:57.817 --> 00:19:59.775
Or even assuming that
it's not possible to find

00:19:59.775 --> 00:20:03.970
an answer via the internet
on this, for this question.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.070
And on those that we know that,
hey, we do actually have data,

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.770
we have partnerships, or we
know people, organizations

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:14.070
that are working to provide
this sort of information,

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.780
then there comes interesting
engineering work about how

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.600
to actually ingest that
data, and deliver it back.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.484
An interesting UX problems
about when should you deliver,

00:20:22.484 --> 00:20:23.900
what sort of
information, and how.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.701
Also very interesting in
here is thinking about not

00:20:29.701 --> 00:20:31.200
all information is
good information.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.477
If it's stale, if
someone tells you,

00:20:34.477 --> 00:20:36.060
oh, there's a water
shortage, and this

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.060
is where you find water.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.780
But it just ran out of
water, and you go there,

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.050
and you drag all your children.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.360
That's really bad information
to have given someone.

00:20:47.806 --> 00:20:51.355
Knowing the source of the data
so that a person can evaluate

00:20:51.355 --> 00:20:53.290
whether you trust
it is important.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.920
And incorporating
people, the crowd,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.990
into helping annotate
that data, and say yeah,

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.840
I can vouch that as
of today, right now,

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.000
I was able to find ice here.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.440
Or hey, they just ran out,
so don't come here anymore.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.500
People have the ability
to help each other,

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.730
even if they don't know
each other, during a crisis.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.910
So we're working on
tools to enable--

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.460
how do you blend this, all
this official data, and data

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.450
from media, and
data from people,

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.160
and give to someone this one
little, pretty concise answer

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.340
to what they want to
know, and not drown them.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.420
We're also, some
of our work that

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.570
are ethnographer did
in New Orleans was very

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:38.360
interesting in trying to
kind of broadly understand

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.560
of how people are
using the internet.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.220
If they are or not, how
they're finding information.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.052
And she did this really
interesting thing

00:21:48.052 --> 00:21:49.260
of looking at different axes.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.045
For instance, some people
really want the raw data.

00:21:51.045 --> 00:21:52.961
They're like I don't
want you to synthesize it

00:21:52.961 --> 00:21:55.920
into some little story,
I just want the facts.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.030
I'll make up my own story.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.200
That was another axis,
story versus data.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.650
Another axis is
what's your reach?

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.620
When you learn something
do you tell other people?

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.040
Or do you just keep it
to yourself, your family,

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.512
and then move on?

00:22:10.512 --> 00:22:12.220
Not everyone's going
to Tweet everything.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.150
And not everyone's going to
pick a phone and call people.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.550
But some do and some don't.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:18.870
And it's very interesting to
think about those that do,

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:19.380
have reach.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.485
Those that do, kind of just
because of the personality

00:22:22.485 --> 00:22:26.500
or for whatever reason,
disseminate information.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.845
That's really powerful.

00:22:27.845 --> 00:22:29.290
They can reach a lot of people.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.980
People who may not
even be online.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.827
So let's understand what
they're doing during crises.

00:22:34.827 --> 00:22:37.160
And in a place like New Orleans
this is very interesting

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.450
because people do develop
patterns of behavior,

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.520
because this happens every year.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.716
And people need to
talk to each other.

00:22:45.716 --> 00:22:47.840
So you might think, oh,
there's a hurricane coming,

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.487
you just leave.

00:22:48.487 --> 00:22:49.320
what's there to ask?

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.060
Well you may not want to
be on a road with gridlock

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.887
when you have an elderly person.

00:22:54.887 --> 00:22:57.470
And you might lose your job, and
you don't have a credit card,

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.140
so you're not going to
be able to just charge

00:22:59.140 --> 00:22:59.810
things on hotels.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.990
And the last time you evaluated
it wasn't that severe,

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.073
and you did lose your job.

00:23:03.073 --> 00:23:04.620
There's so many
other things to do.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.910
And people need to talk to each
other to make these decisions.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.240
And the last axis, word
of mouth versus online.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.450
That's an interesting place
for us to think about.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.951
A lot of people, they're just
not going to be techie people.

00:23:15.951 --> 00:23:17.533
They're not going
to use the internet.

00:23:17.533 --> 00:23:18.340
But why is that?

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.860
Is that because right now
it's not serving their needs?

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.660
And if it did
server their needs,

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.380
they wouldn't feel like oh,
I'm not a gadget person.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.490
They would say that's
actually a useful way for me

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.160
to communicate with
the people that I

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.493
want to communicate with, and
get the information that I

00:23:32.493 --> 00:23:33.100
need.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.970
So lots of interesting
questions here.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.170
If you want to know more about
our team visit this site.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.325
And looking forward to
seeing this space grow.

00:23:43.325 --> 00:23:44.950
There are a lot of
problems to work on.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:49.540
And I do hope that at some
point we can make a difference,

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:54.580
and that technology can be
used to actually help people,

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.040
not only those who are
privileged enough to have

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.750
the best phones, and
the best data plans,

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.050
and live in the Silicon
Valleys of the world,

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.570
but those who don't.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:04.415
Thank you.

00:24:04.415 --> 00:24:19.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.970
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you, Raquel.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:26.260
It's great to hear stories when
you truly are impacting people.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.030
So thank you for that.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.000
So we are going to
break for lunch.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.830
How many people are hungry?

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:35.230
Or do you want to
hear more stories?

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:36.100
We can go on.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.610
We can bring
[INAUDIBLE] back on.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.317
OK, so do you want to do Q&amp;A?

00:24:42.317 --> 00:24:43.150
RAQUEL ROMANO: Sure.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:58.480
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Yes,
we do have time for Q&amp;A.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.685
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:24:59.685 --> 00:25:01.620
I'm interested in
how you protect

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.900
against personal information
when people don't want

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.730
to share their whereabouts,
or what have you,

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.640
even in a crisis situation.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.370
RAQUEL ROMANO: Good question.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:17.410
This has come up a lot with
what I talked about Google

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.350
Person Finder.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:22.990
So the way that that
application works

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:26.100
is that everything's public.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.440
You can go in and enter
that you've found someone,

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.150
or report yourself, I'm OK.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.660
And someone else can go
in and do the opposite.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.920
The way that we
have dealt with that

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:46.480
is instead of making it a
closed system and requiring-- it

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.790
really wouldn't meet
the purpose if we

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:53.300
said no, you have to login in
order to go search for someone.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.865
Not everyone is
going to do that.

00:25:54.865 --> 00:25:56.364
You just need to
get the information

00:25:56.364 --> 00:25:57.500
as fast as possible.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.090
So we put in a lot
of infrastructure

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.812
for spam detection in the back.

00:26:04.812 --> 00:26:05.770
Some of it's automatic.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.200
But a lot of it is manual.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.700
So we try to build systems for
people to quickly look through

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.700
and flag things
that maybe spam-y.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.050
And unfortunately, even
in times of crisis,

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:22.770
people do think that might be a
good time for a practical joke.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.310
But we're really clear up
front, that this is public

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:30.130
and there are actually
expiration dates

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.720
on every record ever entered,
and every post ever entered.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.170
It's part of the protocol,
it's part of the specification.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.230
And that's how
we've dealt with it.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.379
I think it's really
interesting to think

00:26:41.379 --> 00:26:42.920
about how those
problems will come up

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.253
with many of these other things.

00:26:44.253 --> 00:26:49.470
So for instance, you wouldn't
want to require someone

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:54.590
to sign in to Google just to get
an information, absolutely not.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.789
But if they are signed
in, you actually

00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:59.080
do want to give them something.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:26:59.930
If you know
something about them,

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.760
say you know their
circle of close friends,

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.474
you might want to
say here, here's

00:27:03.474 --> 00:27:04.640
some information about them.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.050
It's a very fine line to walk.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.730
And we're constantly
thinking about that

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.160
because this isn't a
money making venture.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.250
But privacy does matter,
and you can do damage.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.860
Thank you for the question.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.850
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
Tiffany, and I'm

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.690
a fellow for Code for America.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.840
And we're working
with local governments

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.940
to make technology better.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.050
And one of the things
that really resonated

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:32.730
with me is how you guys are
partnering with organizations

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.260
to get a bunch of data
from disparate places,

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:40.210
and try to filter it into
one clear, simplified message

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.310
for community members.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:46.180
And I'm curious, what is
your strategy for working

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.580
with all these organizations?

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.050
And how do you deal
with all the obstacles

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.570
of so many different
people trying

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.930
to filter into one message?

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:58.170
RAQUEL ROMANO: Yeah,
really hard question.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.086
And this was interesting
for me as an engineer

00:28:00.086 --> 00:28:02.810
to think that some of
the hardest problems

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.650
are actually
organizational and people.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.190
So what is our
strategy for trying

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.220
to get data from
different organizations?

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.470
We actually have a team
of partnership people

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:18.540
who work extremely hard,
and travel all the time,

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.590
to meet one on one
with people who

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.420
are working in organizations
that have data that we know

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.560
is useful, whether it's in
Columbia, or it's in Mexico,

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.650
or it's in East Asia.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.540
Wherever we can find
an opening and have

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.210
the time in the capacity
we open that dialogue.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.820
And it's a lot of
explaining to do.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.800
Because before we have
a launched product

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.300
that we can say, if
you were to invest

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.250
a little bit of
resources into publishing

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.060
the same data that you've
spent a lot of time and money

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.401
and effort to collect, if you
could publish it this way,

00:28:50.401 --> 00:28:52.150
we have to be able to
say what's the gain?

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:53.100
What would happen?

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.650
And we can show, oh,
then all your hard work

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.667
would be surfaced in this
way, on this mobile phone.

00:28:59.667 --> 00:29:01.750
So it's a little bit of
the chicken and egg, where

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.040
we typically try to find
people who are already

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.616
willing to work with us,
build products off those,

00:29:06.616 --> 00:29:08.990
and just as a lot of people
have said before me, iterate.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.781
We have to iterate.

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:11.312
We have to say,
OK did this work?

00:29:11.312 --> 00:29:12.020
What didn't work?

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.400
What was too specific to this?

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.957
What was too general?

00:29:14.957 --> 00:29:16.540
Then, when you go
to the next partner,

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.270
this is what we're
doing in Australia.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.132
Are you interested?

00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:20.090
Oh, you have this data.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.440
They see it at play.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.500
But you need that buy in.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.416
You have to show them.

00:29:24.416 --> 00:29:27.270
You can't just show a concept.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.810
They have real
problems to work on.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.393
They don't want to
do something that's

00:29:30.393 --> 00:29:35.900
cool and gets them the good
video on some tech show.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.230
No, they have real problems.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:42.130
So our strategy is really this
launch and iterate process.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.730
But it is a lot of work
and a lot of, really,

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:49.790
commitment to working with
the people technically.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:51.620
I think that we're
out of time now.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.330
So I'll be here for a few
more minutes, and thank you.
