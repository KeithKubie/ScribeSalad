00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:04.850
FRED SAUER: All right, the
next question from you.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.920
MANDY WAITE: OK.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.570
FRED SAUER: Any optimization
recommendations for e-commerce

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.215
website with 2 million visits
per month running on App

00:00:12.215 --> 00:00:13.550
Engine iPhone?

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:13.995
MANDY WAITE: Wow, OK.

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:16.930
How long have we got?

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.980
Optimization recommendations.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.379
I guess what we want to optimize
for is probably the

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:22.530
important thing here, and
we want to optimize the

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.490
performance of low for
latency, for cost.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.393
Cost is an important
consideration when it comes to

00:00:28.393 --> 00:00:30.750
cloud applications as well,
balancing cost and performance

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.790
is massively important.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.228
So I think what probably I'm
going to kind of step back on

00:00:36.228 --> 00:00:38.900
this one a little bit and say
the best thing to read the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.800
resources that are available
in the documentation.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.135
So we have a couple of really,
really good pages on the App

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:47.250
Engine documentation site.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.490
One is called Managing
Resources.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.250
FRED SAUER: Yes.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.175
My favorite one.

00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:52.090
MANDY WAITE: That's Fred's
favorite one.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.590
Whenever I ask him a question,
he says have you

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.555
read Managing Resources?

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:56.340
And I say uh.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.650
So I go off and read Managing
Resources, and I say, yeah, I

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.290
found the answer.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.150
So Managing Resources
is great.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.210
It tells you how to manage
your instances, manage

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.160
bandwidth, manage concurrency,
those kind of things.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.520
So that is an excellent
resource.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.465
There's also a
performance-related resource

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:12.490
on the same site.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.110
I think they're in the same
section, probably one leads

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.122
into the other.

00:01:16.122 --> 00:01:18.220
And that will give you hints
and performance.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.150
Often, optimization and
performance are kind of

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.500
related and very married
together in a lot ways.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.835
So you can take those tips as
one big set of tips, and

00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:31.810
you'll find really good
information about how to

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.720
optimize your application.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.850
If it's about cost, again, I
think I would say Managing

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.280
Resources also talks about how
to look at your quotas and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.490
such, and where you're
incurring your costs.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.220
And also, coming back to App
Stats as well, App Stats is

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.970
another really good essential
tool for looking at where

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.570
you're spending your time
in your application.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.845
So if you're concerned about
latency, taking too long to

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:55.000
respond to your users, then you
can do some analysis with

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.170
App Stats to find out where
you're spending your time and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.225
maybe tune your applications
to spend less

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:00.476
time doing those RPCs.

00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:00.922
FRED SAUER: OK.

00:02:00.922 --> 00:02:02.050
MANDY WAITE: Does
that sound good?

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.890
FRED SAUER: Yeah.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.390
Now, I love the Managing
Resources article.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.790
If you just do a web search
for "App Engine Managing

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.710
Resources," you'll probably hit
that article in our docs.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.190
And think of it as
a checklist.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.080
It doesn't tell you exactly
everything to do.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.450
But it's a checklist of think
about this, think about this.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.750
And you can go through
each one.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.620
And you know your application
best, how you can tune it.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.710
If you just want the "what's
the one thing I need to do

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.820
that I may not be doing that's
going to give me the biggest

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.250
benefit," say "turn on
Memcache." And some of you can

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.070
get that for free.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.360
If you're using, in Python, the
NDB API, or in Java, if

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.580
you're using Objectify, which
is a third-party ORM layer,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.700
they both have Memcache
built in.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.220
So any time you write or read
from the datastore, it's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.520
checking Memcache.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.950
It can save you a lot of
datastore operations, and it

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.950
won't cost you a single
line of code.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.844
MANDY WAITE: Wow, fantastic.

00:02:49.844 --> 00:02:51.460
So use Memcache.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.190
FRED SAUER: Use Memcache.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.804
If you're not using Memcache,
use Memcache.

00:02:53.804 --> 00:02:55.540
MANDY WAITE: I probably just
should have said use Memcache.
