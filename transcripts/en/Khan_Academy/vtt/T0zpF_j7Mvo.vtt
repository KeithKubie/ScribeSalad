00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.000
What I want to do in this video,
now that we have displacement

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.780
as a function of time,
given constant acceleration

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.410
and an initial velocity.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.530
I want to plot displacement,
final velocity,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.690
and acceleration, all of
those as functions of time.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.280
Just so we really
understand what's

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.870
happening as the ball is
going up and then down.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.790
So we know this is
our displacement

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.270
as a function of time.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.620
We know what our final
velocity is going to be,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.679
as a function of time.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.220
We talked about it
in the last video.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.000
Our final velocity is going
to be our initial velocity

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.540
plus our acceleration
times change in time.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.040
Right?

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.790
If we start at some initial
velocity, and then you

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.620
multiply the
acceleration times time.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.930
This part tells you how
much faster or slower

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.084
you're going to go than
your initial velocity.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.750
And that will be, I
guess you could say,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.150
your current velocity,
or the final velocity

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.820
at that point in time.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.550
And of course, our
acceleration, we know.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.220
Our acceleration is
pretty straightforward.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.040
The acceleration due
to gravity is just

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.330
going to be negative 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.200
Once again, negative
being the convention

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.970
that it is in the
downward direction.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.570
Our initial velocity
is going to be

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.370
in the upward direction,
19.6 meters per second.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.550
So let's plot these
out a little bit.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.650
Let's plot these out.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.810
So the first graph I want
to do, right over here,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.520
will be my displacement
versus time.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.350
So this axis right over
here is going to be time,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.315
or maybe I could call this
the change in time axis.

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:40.690
Actually, lets
just call it time.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.550
And then this axis, right over
here, I will call displacement.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.720
And let me put
some markers here.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.740
So let's say that this is
5 meters, 10 meters, 15

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.610
meters, and 20 meters.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.920
And then in the time, this is 0,
this is 1 this is 2, this is 3,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.950
and this is 4 seconds.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.460
So this is in
seconds right here.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.940
This is meters.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.986
5, 10, 5, 10, 15, 20.

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:17.985
So this is displacement.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.070
Displacement graph.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.020
And I want to, at the
same time as that,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.300
I want to do a velocity graph.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.170
So let me draw my
velocity graph like this.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.745
I'll do it a little
bit different.

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:36.810
So, this is because the velocity
will be going up and down.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.860
So we need to have positive
and negative values here.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.340
Time will only be positive.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.470
So once again, I care about 1
second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.870
and 4 seconds in time.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.670
And velocity, I'm
going to call this.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.190
This is going to be
10 meters per second.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.350
This is 20 meters per second.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.780
This will be negative
10 meters per second.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.380
And this will be negative
20 meters per second.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.490
And so all of this is
in meters per second.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.715
This right here is velocity.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.910
This axis right here is time.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.575
So this is my velocity graph.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.080
And why don't we just throw an
acceleration graph over here,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.490
although that's, to some
degree, the easiest of them all.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.382
So the acceleration
graph, and I'll

00:03:28.382 --> 00:03:29.840
just do this right
from the get go,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.390
because we're going to assume
that acceleration is constant.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.550
So this is 1 second,
2 seconds, 3 seconds,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.500
and 4 seconds into it.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.050
And then let's call
this negative 10.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.949
And all of this is in
meters per second squared.

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.740
And so we know our
acceleration is negative

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.730
9.8 meters per second squared.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.350
So the acceleration
the entire time

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.780
over the four seconds, the
acceleration over the four

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.384
seconds is going to be
that's about negative 9.8.

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:00.300
It's going to be that.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.520
It's going to be a constant
acceleration the entire time.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.560
But let's figure out
displacement and velocity.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.400
So let me draw a
little table here.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.980
So in one column, I
will do change in time.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.000
Or sometimes you
could do that as time.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.410
Let's figure out what
our final velocity is,

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.020
or I should really say our
current velocity, or velocity

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.410
at that time.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.460
And then in this
column, I'll figure out

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.200
what our displacement is.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.550
And I will do it for
times 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.510
Or change in time.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.780
So when 0 seconds have gone
by, when 1 second has gone by,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.820
when 2 seconds, 3 seconds,
and 4 seconds have gone by.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.470
Actually let, me call this
the change in time axis,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.200
because this is essentially
how many seconds have gone by.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.816
So this is my
change in time axis.

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:55.190
And let me make it clear that
this graph-- I didn't label

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.030
it here-- this is my
acceleration graph.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.260
And I'm going off of the screen.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.030
All right.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.110
So let's fill these things out.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.760
So at time 0, what is
our what is our velocity?

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.930
Well, if we use this expression
right here, time 0, or delta t

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.700
is equal to 0.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.130
This expression right
here, is going to be 0.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.230
And it's just going to
be our initial velocity.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.170
And in the last video, we
gave our initial velocity,

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.680
is going to be as 19.6
meters per second.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.760
So it is going to be
19.6 meters per second.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.690
And let me plot that over here.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.530
At time 0, it is going to
be 19.6 meters per second.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.890
What is our initial displacement
at time zero, or change

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.080
in time 0?

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.580
So you look at this up here.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.150
Well, our delta t is 0, so this
expression is going to be 0,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.730
and this expression
is going to be 0.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.800
So we haven't done
any displacement yet,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.830
when no time has gone by.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.610
So we have done no displacement.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.280
We are right over there.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.280
Now, what happens after
1 second has gone by?

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.280
What is now our velocity?

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.898
Well, our initial velocity,
right over here, is 19.6.

00:06:10.898 --> 00:06:14.460
19.6 meters per second,
that was a given.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.830
And our acceleration is negative
9.8 meters per second squared.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.490
So it's a negative,
right over there.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.892
And then you multiply that times
delta t in every situation.

00:06:24.892 --> 00:06:26.850
So in this situation
we're going to multiply it

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.460
by 1, because delta t is 1.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.790
So we get 19.6 minus
9.8, that gives us

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.429
exactly 9.8 meters per second.

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:39.720
And the units work out,
because you multiply this times

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.730
seconds, this gives
you meters per second.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.032
So 19.6 meters per second minus
9.8 meters per second-- one

00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:48.490
of these seconds goes away when
you multiply it by second--

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.740
gives you 9.8 meters per second.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.210
So after 1 second,
our velocity is now

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.250
half of what it was before.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.030
So we're now going
9.8 meters per second.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.790
Let me draw a line here.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.750
9.8 meters per second.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.330
Now what is our displacement?

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.800
So you look up here.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.220
And let me rewrite this
displacement formula,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.400
with all of the
information that we know.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.170
So we know that
displacement is going

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.747
to be equal to our initial
velocity, which is 19.6--

00:07:19.747 --> 00:07:21.330
and I won't write
the units here, just

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.220
for the sake of space--
times our change in time.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.610
I'll do it in that same
color, so you what's what.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.260
Times our change
in time plus 1/2.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.650
Now let me be clear, 1/2
times negative 9.8 meters

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.530
per second squared.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.830
So 1/2 times a is
going to be-- actually

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.480
I can rewrite this,
right over here--

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.770
because this is going to
be negative 9.8 meters

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:51.030
per second times 1/2, so this
is going to be negative 4.9.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.600
All I did, is I took 1/2
times negative 9.8 over here.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.700
1/2 times negative 9.8.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.760
And this is important.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.110
And this is why the vector
quantities start to matter.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.340
Because if you didn't, if
you put a positive here,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.720
you wouldn't have
the object actually

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.136
slowing down as it went up,
because you would have gravity

00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:07.970
somehow accelerating
it as it went up.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.560
But it's actually
slowing it down.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.567
It's accelerating it in
the downwards direction.

00:08:12.567 --> 00:08:15.150
So that's why you have to have
that negative right over there.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.130
That was our convention at the
beginning of the last video.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.280
Up is positive.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.400
Down is negative.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.120
So let's focus.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.290
So this part right over
here, negative 4.9 meters

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.240
per second squared
times delta t squared.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.840
And this will make it
a little bit easier,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.090
although we'll still-- let
me get the calculator out.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:41.830
So when one second has passed--
I'll get my trusty TI-85 out.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.220
When one second has passed, the
displacement is 19.6 times 1.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.900
Well, that's just 19.6.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.180
Minus 4.9 times 1 squared.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.700
So that's just minus 4.9.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:01.480
Gives us 14.7 meters.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.900
So after 1 second, the ball
has traveled 14.7 meters

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.370
in the air.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.430
So that's roughly over there.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.540
Now, what happens
after 2 seconds?

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.310
I'll do this in magenta.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:21.740
So after 2 seconds, our velocity
is 19.6 minus 9.8 times 2.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.110
2 seconds have gone by.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:28.950
Well, 9.8 meters per second
squared times 2 seconds

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.350
gives us 19.6 meters per second.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.770
So these just cancel out.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.420
So we get, our
velocity is now 0.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.475
So after 2 seconds,
our velocity is now 0.

00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:45.732
Actually, let me-- So let me
make it so it's-- this thing

00:09:45.732 --> 00:09:46.940
should look more like a line.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.130
I don't make you get a sense--
So this is-- So let me just

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.300
draw the line like this.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.790
Our velocity is now
0 after 2 seconds.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.620
What is our displacement?

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.670
So we're literally at the point
where the ball has no velocity.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.230
At exactly 2 seconds.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:08.520
So it's kind of gone up, and
for that exact moment in time,

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.930
it is stationary.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.490
And then what do we have
going on in our displacement?

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.452
We have 19.6-- let me get
the calculator out for this.

00:10:17.452 --> 00:10:19.910
I could do it by
hand, but for the sake

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:25.280
of quickness-- 19.6
times 2-- 19.6 times

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:32.280
2 seconds minus 4.9
times 2 seconds squared.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.950
This is 2 seconds squared.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.360
Oh, I lost the calculator.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.620
Times 2 seconds squared.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.410
So that's times 4.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.550
So that gives us 19.6 meters.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.430
So we're at 19-- let me
do that in magenta-- we

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.140
are at 19.6 meters.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:54.130
So after 2 seconds, we are
19.6 meters in the air.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.090
Now let's go to 3 seconds.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.850
So after 3 seconds,
our velocity is now--

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.980
I'll just get the-- it's
19.6 meters per second

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.465
minus 9.8 times 3.

00:11:07.465 --> 00:11:08.840
And we could do
that in our head,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.740
but just to verify it for us,
let me get the calculator out.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.880
It's 19.6 minus 9.8 times 3.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.910
That gives us negative
9.8 meters per second.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.080
So after 3 seconds,
our velocity is now

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.560
negative 9.8 meters per second.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.470
What does that mean?

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.610
It's now going in the
downward direction

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.080
at 9.8 meters per second.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.180
So this is our velocity graph.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.910
And then what is our
displacement at this point?

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.400
So once again, let's
get the calculator out.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.204
If you're getting
the hang of this.

00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:45.370
At any time, I encourage
you to pause it, and try it

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.770
for yourself.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.420
So now, what is-- now
this is a little, OK.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.540
So I'm looking at
my displacement,

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.540
I wrote right over here.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.100
So our displacement
where delta t

00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:04.340
is 3 seconds, 19.6 times 3
minus 4.9 times-- and this

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.260
is delta t, so
this is 3 seconds.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.610
We're talking about when delta
t, or our change in time,

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:09.530
is 3 seconds.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.920
So that squared.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.760
So times 9.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:18.500
And that gives us 14.7 meters.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.410
So after 3 seconds, we're
at 14.7 meters again.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.660
And so we're at the same
position we were at 1 second,

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.743
but the difference is, now
we're moving downwards.

00:12:26.743 --> 00:12:28.630
Over here we were
moving upwards.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.330
And then finally, what
happens after 4 seconds?

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.590
Well, what's our velocity?

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.860
Well let me just get
the calculator out,

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.480
although you might be able to
figure this out in your head.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:49.530
Our velocity is going to be
19.6 minus 9.8 times 4 seconds.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.050
Which is minus 19.6
meters per second.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.160
So our magnitude of our
velocity is the same

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.120
as when we initially threw
the ball, except now it's

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.500
going in the opposite direction.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.720
It's now going downwards.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.520
And what is our displacement?

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.660
Get the calculator out.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:16.840
So we have, our displacement
is 19.6 times 4-- 4 seconds

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.990
have gone by-- minus
4.9 times 4 squared--

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.490
which is 16-- so times
16, which is equal to 0.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.450
Our displacement is 0.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.500
We are back on the ground.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.890
We are back on the ground.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.520
So if you were to
plot its displacement

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.480
you would actually get a
parabola, a downward opening

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.760
parabola that looks
something like this.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.320
Doing my best to draw
it relatively neatly.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.160
Actually, I can do a
better job than that.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.076
I'll do a dotted line.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:49.215
Dotted lines are always
easier to adjust midstream.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.082
If you plot displacement
versus time,

00:13:55.082 --> 00:13:56.290
it looks something like this.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.180
Its velocity is just this
downward sloping line,

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.260
and then the
acceleration is constant.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.680
And the whole reason
why I wanted to do this,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.560
is I wanted to show you that
the velocity the whole time

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.610
is decreasing at
a constant pace.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.120
And that makes sense, because
the rate at which the velocity

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.790
increases or decreases
is the acceleration.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:19.350
And the acceleration, based on
our convention, is downwards.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.630
So that's why it's decreasing.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.710
We have a negative slope here.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:27.180
We have a negative slope
of negative 9.8 meters

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.890
per second squared.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.992
And so just to think
about what's happening

00:14:30.992 --> 00:14:32.450
for this ball, or
this rock-- and I

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.283
know this video is
getting long-- as it goes

00:14:34.283 --> 00:14:38.460
through the air, I'm going to
draw the vectors for velocity.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.750
And I'm going to
do that in orange,

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.600
or no, maybe I'll
do that in blue.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.210
So velocity in blue.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.150
So right when we start,
it has a positive velocity

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.340
of 19.6 meters per second.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.560
So I'll draw a big
vector like this,

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.980
19.6 meters per second,
that's its velocity.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.790
Then after 1 second, it's
9.8 meters per second.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.484
So it's half of that.

00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:01.150
Maybe it would look
something like this,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.060
9.8 meters per second.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.710
Then at this peak right over
here, it has a velocity of 0.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.580
Then as you go to 3 seconds,
the magnitude of its velocity

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.360
is 9.8 meters per second.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.150
But it is now downwards.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.770
It is now downwards,
so it looks like this.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.930
And then, finally, right when
it hits the ground, right

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.920
before it hits the ground,
it has a negative velocity

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.170
of 19.6 meters per second.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:32.850
So it would look like
this, roughly like this.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.070
If I use the same
scale over here.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.992
But what was the
acceleration the entire time?

00:15:37.992 --> 00:15:40.200
Well, the entire time, the
acceleration was negative.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.900
It was negative 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.250
And I'll do that in orange.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.810
So the acceleration,
over here, negative-- no,

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.750
I want to do that in
orange-- the acceleration was

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.580
negative 9.8 meters
per second squared.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.990
Acceleration, negative 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.960
Negative 9.8 meters
per second squared.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.610
The acceleration is
constant the entire time.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.520
This last one is negative 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.350
It does not change,
depending where

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.090
you are in the
curve, when you're

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.560
near the surface of the Earth.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.190
So hopefully that clarifies
things a little bit

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.606
and gives you a
good sense of what

00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:17.480
happens when you throw a
projectile into the air.
