00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:04.500
- So we have here 2 2/3 plus 8 3/4

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.073
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:08.848
and see if you can compute what this is.

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:10.246
So now let's work through this together

00:00:10.246 --> 00:00:12.503
and there's a bunch of ways
that you can tackle this.

00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:14.721
I'll do it in a couple of different ways.

00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:16.409
So one way that you might see

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.887
is to just rewrite this expression,

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:23.211
so just rewrite 2 2/3 plus,

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.220
plus 8 3/4.

00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:30.033
Plus 8 3/4 and you might be saying

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:32.064
why whould I rewrite it this way?

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:34.014
Well, when you rewrite it
this way, it's very clear

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:36.781
that these are the fraction
parts of the mixed numbers

00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:38.807
and these are the whole number
parts of the mixed numbers,

00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:40.630
and maybe we could add them separately,

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.899
but before we even start
adding the fraction parts

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.617
of the mixed numbers, we notice

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:46.323
that we have different denominators here.

00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:48.151
We have a three and we have a four,

00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:50.821
so it would be nice to
find a common denominator

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.719
and we've seen multiple times in the past,

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.157
when you're adding fractions
with unlike denominators,

00:00:55.157 --> 00:00:56.892
a good common denominator would be

00:00:56.892 --> 00:00:58.266
their least common multiple,

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.710
the least common multiple
of three and four.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.115
Well, what's that going to be?

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:04.314
Well, let's look at the multiples of four.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:07.947
Four is not perfectly divisible by three.

00:01:07.947 --> 00:01:10.443
Eight is not perfectly divisible by three.

00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:13.628
12 is, in fact, 12 is four times three,

00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:16.291
so I can rewrite both
of these fraction parts

00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.433
with 12 as their denominator.

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:20.757
So this is going to be equal to,

00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:22.425
let me just write it this way.

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:26.662
So I can rewrite it as two

00:01:26.662 --> 00:01:29.686
and something over 12.

00:01:29.686 --> 00:01:31.264
Now what would be that something over 12?

00:01:31.264 --> 00:01:33.133
To go from three to 12 in the denominator,

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.048
we multiply it by four,

00:01:35.048 --> 00:01:37.492
so we have to multiply the
numerator by four as well.

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:40.278
So two times four is eight.

00:01:40.278 --> 00:01:42.605
2/3 is the same thing as 8/12,

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:46.535
so 2 2/3 is the same thing as 2 8/12,

00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:48.316
and then we can do the
same thing down here.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.460
8 3/4 is gonna be the same thing as

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.707
eight and something over 12.

00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:56.235
Well, to go from four to
12 in the denominator,

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:57.703
you multiply it by three,

00:01:57.703 --> 00:02:00.019
so we have to multiply the
numerator by three as well.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:04.726
Three times three is
nine, and now, we can add.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.407
We can add, and what do we get?

00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:11.063
Well, we have 8/12 plus 9/12.

00:02:11.063 --> 00:02:14.294
That's going to be 17,

00:02:14.294 --> 00:02:16.737
17/12.

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:18.582
Well, you might recognize, 17/12,

00:02:18.582 --> 00:02:22.204
this is greater than or equal
to one, so we can actually,

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:24.781
this is an improper
fraction right over here,

00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:27.265
so we can actually rewrite this,

00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:29.081
we can rewrite this as a mixed number.

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:30.207
Let me make it clear.

00:02:30.207 --> 00:02:34.334
17/12, so, do it right over here.

00:02:34.334 --> 00:02:37.551
17/12 is the same thing

00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:40.053
as 1 5/12.

00:02:40.053 --> 00:02:41.341
How did I figure that out?

00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:45.971
12 goes into 17 one time,
and then I still 5 left over.

00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:48.633
17/12 is the same thing as 1 5/12.

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:51.564
So what I could do is, I
could write the 5/12 part

00:02:51.564 --> 00:02:54.802
in the fraction part of
our, or I guess, say,

00:02:54.802 --> 00:02:57.501
the fraction place on our numbers,

00:02:57.501 --> 00:02:59.293
and then I could regroup the one,

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:01.158
put it in the whole number column,

00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:03.681
and now I can just add the one plus two

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:07.159
is three, plus eight is 11.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.961
So we get 11 5/12,

00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:12.965
11 5/12.

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:16.057
Now there is other ways that
we could have tackled this.

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:18.808
What we could've done

00:03:18.808 --> 00:03:23.595
is gone from this place
right over here, the 2 8/12,

00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:26.637
and the 8 9/12, and we
could've converted these

00:03:26.637 --> 00:03:29.998
into improper fractions then
added those improper fractions,

00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:32.075
so we could've said, and
this is the same thing,

00:03:32.075 --> 00:03:33.990
let me rewrite it as, let's see,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.952
two is the same as 24/12 plus 8,

00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:39.775
is going to be 32/12,

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:43.141
so I could rewrite this top mixed number

00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:46.650
as 32/12,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.399
clearly an improper fraction,

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.574
and I could rewrite this bottom
mixed number as, let's see,

00:03:51.574 --> 00:03:53.867
eight is how many 12s?

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:57.973
That's going to be
96/12 plus another 9/12,

00:03:57.973 --> 00:04:00.057
is 105/12.

00:04:00.057 --> 00:04:01.637
105/12.

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:04.597
If what I just did looks
a little bit confusing,

00:04:04.597 --> 00:04:06.834
you should review the Khan Academy videos

00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:08.114
on converting mixed numbers

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.741
to improper fractions or vice versa,

00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:13.648
but now I could think
about adding these two,

00:04:13.648 --> 00:04:14.973
and what, what would I get out?

00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:18.762
32/12 plus 105/12, which would be, what,

00:04:18.762 --> 00:04:22.577
137,

00:04:22.577 --> 00:04:25.015
137/12,

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:29.495
and then if we wanted to
rewrite this as a mixed number,

00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:33.909
we could say, OK let's
see, 12 will go to 137,

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.608
11 times, so it goes 11 times.

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:39.214
11 times 12 is 132, so you
would have five left over,

00:04:39.214 --> 00:04:42.609
so it's 11 5/12.

00:04:42.609 --> 00:04:43.844
So you could've done it either way.

00:04:43.844 --> 00:04:44.957
I think this one,

00:04:44.957 --> 00:04:46.318
the way we did it the first time

00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:47.542
would've been a little bit easier

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:48.811
because you didn't have to deal with

00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:52.891
these really big numbers
like 137 and 105 and 32,

00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:54.689
and you just dealt with more
straightforward numbers.

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.664
Say, hey look, 8/12 plus 9/12 is 17/12,

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:00.770
which is the the same thing as 1 5/12,

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.736
and then you had 1 5/12
plus two plus eight,

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:06.520
is gonna give you 11 5/12.
