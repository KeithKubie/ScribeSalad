KIRK ROBINSON: Princeton
Racing Electric

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.630
is a student organization where
we are building, designing,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.130
and eventually will be
competing with an electric

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.630
high-performance vehicle.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.970
BEN SORKIN: The competition
has about a 200-page rule book

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.200
with very, very detailed rules.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.040
And when you get
to the competition,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.280
you have to pass an onsite
electrical inspection

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.650
and an onsite
technical inspection.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.700
And they go -- the inspectors
are very, very, very stringent

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.890
with these rules.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.020
And if you mess up one
little thing, you're out.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.050
You have time to fix it.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.720
But often, if something goes
wrong, it takes more time.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.200
Out of nearly 30
teams, only three teams

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.760
passed all inspections to
be able to run and compete.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.500
KIRK ROBINSON: We ended up
finishing, completing a car,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.200
and went to competition with it.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.040
We did not pass

BEN SORKIN: We have a couple
months until the competition.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.630
The things that drives the
entire team toward success

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.780
is the intersection between
passion and sustainability.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.050
We're doing research and
innovation for a sustainable

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.010

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.820
The car that we're
designing right now

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.860
is going to do zero to 60
in about 3 seconds, which

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.800
is on par with some of the
fastest production gas cars.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.030
So we're really showing
that sustainable research

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.650
is the future.

of getting the car up here

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.590
were -- well, it was eventful.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.200
At the end, it turned into
a bit of a sort of mad dash

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.540
where we had parts that
were basically lost in labs

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.150
and locked into labs that
we couldn't get access to.

Someone wants to investigate
the dangling wire,

Not all the wheels locked

push hard enough on the pedal,

Not in the front.

you can ask Sandy

to see whether or not
there is maybe time

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.630
to go over and do a couple
laps over on the endurance.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.730
Because you can stop.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.080
You can stop beautifully,
but you're not locking,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.330
so I can't give you a sticker.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:36.640

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.970

I’ll tell my team.

KIRK ROBINSON: You
know, you can reasonably

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.460
expect there were kind of just
sort of last minute disasters

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.710
that occurred.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.320
Overall, I was
very, very impressed

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.390
with how well we handled all
of them and all of the issues

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.540
that we faced from, you
know, the last minute,

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.150
we realized that we had
no front brakes at all

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.770
because our master
cylinder was stuck.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.290
We had all kinds of
electrical problems

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.430
that we were able to take
care of very quickly.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.810
Ben did a lap of the course.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.150
We got a lap in.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.260
BEN SORKIN: Actually getting in
the car that we built as a team

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.940
over the past two years,
being able to hit the startup

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.930
sequence, and at the
end of that sequence,

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.750
press that green button,
and hear the double-beep,

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.540
put my foot to
the pedal and just

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.670
take off under its own power
was an exhilarating feeling.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.560
The car really moved well.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.560
It handled better than
I could have expected.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.890
I was zigzagging in
and out of cones,

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.210
going through chicanes
doing hairpin turns.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.870
It was just an unbelievable
feeling, just so exhilarating.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.540
I got out of the
car, I was shaking

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:46.280
from almost fear, but
excitement and anxiety,

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.090
and, just, I felt
a lot of relief.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.910
We finally did it.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.790
We got to a place
where a lot of people

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.500
didn't think we could
get as such a small team.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.770
But we had the people who
were motivated, dedicated.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:58.570
And we did it.

Listen, fantastic job all year.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.330
Listen, it worked better than
it did last year, I think.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.780
Huge strides.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.450

like so much more to come.

it's been such a journey.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.170

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.020
And I don't know.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:25.890
I've learned so much.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.760
It's just, it's been
an incredible time.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.680
And I've loved
every minute of it.

TARIK DZANIC: To even get past
electrical, that was something

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.560
I wasn't expecting to happen.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.340
No one gets past electrical.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.680
Out of, what, the 32 teams that
are here, seven passed fully.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.210
We were the eighth team. We ended
up placing eighth in dynamic.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.210
So I mean, eight out of 32?

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.170
That's a result I'll take any day.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.870

amount of people

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.580
to thank, the list
is just immense.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.150
But certainly, none of this
would have been possible

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.330
without the support of the
Princeton community and all

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.640

engineering department,

the School of Engineering,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.560
the Keller Center,
Andlinger Center.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.190
There's all these different
organizations within Princeton

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:25.500
that have been helping us out,
both financially, with mentors,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.780
finding space, using the shop.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.560
It's such an
incredible opportunity.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.990
And we all learned so much.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.730
It's been a hell of a ride.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:40.630
It's been phenomenal.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.840
It's been a great experience.
