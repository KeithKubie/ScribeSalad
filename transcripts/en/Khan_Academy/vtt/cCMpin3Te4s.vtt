00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.580
J.T.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.320
subscribes to a cell phone
texting plan with three other

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.760
members of his family.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.160
Within any given month, they
cannot send more than 500 text

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.040
messages total.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.330
So they cannot send more than
500 text messages total.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.370
At the end of this month, J.T.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.500
had sent 25 more texts than
his older sister.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.310
Let me highlight.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.140
Let me do this in different
colors.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.540
So at the end of
the month, J.T.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.870
had sent 25 more texts than
his older sister, 50 fewer

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:41.860
texts than his younger
sister, and 125 more

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.010
texts than his mother.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.430
How may texts could J.T.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:55.130
have sent if they did not go
over the 500-text limit?

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.030
So let's just define some
variables over here.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790
Well, let's say o.s.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.120
o dot s is, well let's just say
o, o is for older sister.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.383
So this is number of texts
by older sister.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.420
Let's say that y is equal
to number of texts

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.670
by his younger sister.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.150
And then we'll use m is
equal to the number of

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.910
texts by his mother.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.540
And we'll use j for a number
of texts by J.T.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.400
So the total number of texts
that everyone sent cannot be

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.910
more than 500.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.140
So if we take the sum of J.T.'s
texts, plus his older

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.360
sister's texts, plus his younger
sister's texts, plus

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.580
his mother's texts, they all
have to be less than or equal

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.410
to 500 total texts.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.420
Right, it can't be more than
500, so the sum has to be less

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.230
than or equal to 500.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.290
Now, how can we express each
of these in terms of the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.410
number of texts J.T.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.790
sent?

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.060
Well, they give us some
information here.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.560
This first statement, J.T.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.910
had sent 24 more texts than
his older sister.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.570
So j is equal to 25 plus the
number of texts of his older

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.550
sister, which we say is o.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.640
It's not a 0, that's an
o for older sister.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.250
And they also tell
us that J.T.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.510
sent 50 fewer texts than his
younger sister, so j is also

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.130
equal to the younger sister
minus 50, right?

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.600
50 fewer texts than his
younger sister.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.880
And then finally, they say 125
more texts than his mother, so

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.410
j is equal to mother plus 125.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.250
Now, I want this equation all
in terms of j's, because we

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.430
want to say how many
texts could J.T.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.140
have sent.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.990
So I want all of these expressed
in j, so let's just

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.600
solve each of these for o in
terms of j, solve for y in

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.110
terms of j, solve for m in terms
of j, and then we can

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.910
substitute back over here.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.640
So if j is equal to 25 plus o,
if we subtract 25 from both

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.920
sides of this equation, we get
j minus 25 is equal to o.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.460
These are the same thing.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.090
If you just take this and
subtract 25 from both sides,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.490
you get that right there.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.160
Now here, if you add 50 to both
sides of this equation,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.000
if you add to 50 to both sides
of this equation, j plus 50 is

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.840
equal to the number of texts
that his younger sister sent.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.520
I just added 50 to both sides.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.490
And then over here, if you
subtract 125 from both sides

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.570
of this equation-- scroll over a
little bit-- if you subtract

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.130
125 from both sides, you get
j minus 125 is equal to the

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.210
number of texts sent
by his mother.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.370
And we could have gone
straight here.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.829
This first statement, J.T. has
sent 25 more texts than is

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.730
older sister.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.290
So if you take the number
of texts J.T.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.620
sent, subtracted 25, you'd get
the number of texts by his

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.430
older sister.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.320
That is an o, it is not a 0.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.720
o for older.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.600
Likewise, he sent 50 fewer texts
than his younger sister,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.150
so if you took the number of
texts he sent, add 50 to it,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.560
you're going to get how many his
younger sister had sent.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.545
And then finally, he sent 125
more than his mother, so if

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:42.010
you took J.T.'s texts, you take
out 125, then that's how

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.750
many his mother sent.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.180
So now that we have this, we
can substitute for each of

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.530
these variables into the
original equation.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.505
So you have J.T.'s texts, plus
his older sister's texts.

00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:56.790
But we know that o is the same
thing as J.T.'s texts minus

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.080
25, so we write J.T.'s
texts minus 25.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.920
And then you have plus his
younger sister's texts, but we

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.650
know that's J.T.'s
texts plus 50.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.540
And then you have his mother's
texts, but his mother's texts

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.680
are just J.T.'s texts minus
125, so plus j minus 125.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.560
And all of that has to be less
than or equal to 500.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.590
So let's add the j's.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.290
We have 1, 2, 3, 4 j's,
so you have 4 j's.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.880
And let's add the constants.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.520
You have a negative 25 plus
a 50, which is 25.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.140
And then you have 25 minus
125, so 25 minus 125 is

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.010
negative 100.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.120
So 4j minus 100-- I just added
all the constant terms-- has

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.610
to be less than or
equal to 500.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.810
And now this is a pretty
straightforward inequality.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:05.030
Add 100 to both sides and we get
4j-- these cancel out-- we

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.530
get 4j is less than
or equal to 600.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.640
Divide both sides by 4-- don't
have to worry about the

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.080
inequality since 4 is a positive
number-- and we get j

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.850
is less than or equal to 150.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.720
So J.T.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.560
had to send less than or equal,
he had to send 150 or

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.210
fewer texts in that month in
order for all the constraints

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.280
to match up and for the family
as a combined unit to send

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.630
less than 500.
