LYLA FUJIWARA: At
I/O go this year,

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.790
we introduced the Android App
Bundle and Dynamic Delivery.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.510
And if you don't know what those
are, check out the video below.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.820
By simply using this
new bundle format,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.490
you could see a substantial
size reduction in APK size

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.760
for your users.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.690
But additionally, the App
Bundle enables modular apps

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.290
to download code on demand via
a feature called Dynamic Feature

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.620
Modules that's currently
released in beta.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.120
So let's say that I have a chat
app that supports both video

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.560
and text chatting.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.987
If some of my audience
never uses video chatting,

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.820
I can take out all of
the code and resources

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.910
for video chatting and put
them in a separate module.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.920
Then in Android
Studio in Gradle,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.070
I would configure this as
a Dynamic Feature Module.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.770
Google Play will take your
App Bundle with this module

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.390
and create an
additional split APK

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.290
for the module known as
a Dynamic Feature APK.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.570
Using the new Google
Play Core Client Library,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.070
you can specify
when your app should

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.020
request the feature from Play.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.230
Then Dynamic Delivery will
send the future APK on-demand

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.620
to devices running
Android L or higher.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.550
And for older devices,
you can decide

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.460
whether to install the APK with
or without the dynamic feature

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.720
included.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.360
The Google Play Core Library
enables a few delivery options

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.879
for dynamic features.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.420
For example, here's the code
for requesting a dynamic feature

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.350
online, typically in
response to user request.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.450
The Play Core Library
also provides listeners

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.120
for checking on and being
notified when a dynamic feature

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.560
is downloaded.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.390
Google Play Instant
and Dynamic Delivery

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.730
are built of the same
concepts of modularization

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.350
and on-demand code loading.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.080
So coming soon, you'll be able
to instant enable your App

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.330
Bundle, meaning that
your users can experience

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.190
your app or your
dynamic features

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.140
by simply tapping on a
link and without having

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.060
to install the app first.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.610
With the introduction of the
Android App Bundle and Dynamic

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.670
Delivery, we're allowing for
automatically smaller apps.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.030
And with dynamic features, we're
giving you the optional ability

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.520
to add dynamic code
loading to your apps.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.850
To get started, head over
to g.co/androidappbundle.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.730
And happy coding.
