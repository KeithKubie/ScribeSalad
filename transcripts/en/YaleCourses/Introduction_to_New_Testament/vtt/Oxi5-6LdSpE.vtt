1
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.570
One of the themes of the course.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.600
Maybe the main thing with the course is the diversity's of early Christianity.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.720
In fact,

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.720
a lot of scholars like to talk about not Christianity and the first 100 years,

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.300
but Christianity's,
this is one of the things also have Bart Ehrman's textbook.

6
00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:20.850
So you should have picked up on this.

7
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:23.280
There's lots of different kinds of Christianity's and we'd be talking about

8
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.660
those kinds.
Right?

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.740
Today we get to one of the most interesting differences to most people because

10
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.100
most modern people are not at all familiar with the gospel of Thomas.

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.770
And so this the gospel of Thomas,
not in our cannon,
uh,
uh,
for several reasons,

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.620
but we can talk about that at some point.
At the end of the lecture,

13
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:41.454
if you want to know,

14
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.820
the gospel of Thomas has become very famous though in the 20th cent last part of

15
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:53.001
the 20th century because it was rediscovered and published and created something

16
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:57.660
of a sensation
according to the tradition.

17
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.530
According to the gospel of Thomas,
Jesus had a twin brother

18
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.650
and his name was Didymus Judas Thomas.

19
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.060
Now did hummus is simply the Greek word for twin.

20
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.543
Uh,

21
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.780
it's also used as the Greek word for testicles for obvious reasons.

22
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.530
There are usually two of them.
So it did it miss is the Greek word for twin.

23
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.590
And Thomas is from a Semitic word,

24
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:30.000
either Hebrew or Aramaic are Syriac,
which are all three similar languages.

25
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.150
Uh,
Thomas would look like twin in those.
So the,

26
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.250
the guy's name is Judas,
the Hebrew version would be Judah.

27
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.460
The Greek word would be Judas.
And the English version is Jude.

28
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.630
So you sometimes see it in English translations,
[inaudible],
Jude Thomas,

29
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.550
but this the same word,
Judah or Judas.
So his real name is Judah are Judas.

30
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.420
And he did a mess.
And Thomas are his nickname's one Greek and one,
uh,

31
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.670
submitted or Aramaic.

32
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.220
He was the twin brother of Jesus according to early Christian tradition.

33
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.810
Now just one strand of early Christian tradition that is Thomasin Christianity,

34
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:10.350
the forms of Christianity popular especially in Syria and the east,

35
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.500
which traced their existence back to the apostle Thomas.

36
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.560
So there really was an apostle Thomas among the 12 of Jesus' disciples.
And,

37
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:21.900
and,
uh,
and,
and having that nickname twin,
uh,

38
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.310
traditional more traditional Orthodox Christians don't believe he was Jesus,

39
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.144
his twin brother.

40
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.460
They just believe that he had nicknamed nickname twin because he was somebody

41
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:32.310
else's twin brother.
But in Thomas,
in Christianity,

42
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.400
he was connected to Jesus himself as Jesus twin according to some forms of

43
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:41.430
eastern Christianity.
Therefore,
especially the early forms in Syria,

44
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.600
Mesopotamia and India.
And yes,
there was very,

45
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:49.980
very early forms of Christianity in the west coast of India.
They,

46
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160
and if you meet a or an Indian person who's from that part of India and who

47
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.530
considered themselves Christian and they'd been Christian for generations and

48
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:00.880
generations,
they will tell you yes.

49
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.900
Thomas was the apostle who brought the gospel to India the first time.

50
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.620
So there are ancient traditions about this and modern see Indian Christians,
uh,

51
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.260
still,
uh,
trace their,
their,
their church back to the apostle Thomas.

52
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.260
There are all kinds of Thomas literature from the ancient world.
It's,
it's,

53
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.320
it's not all like,

54
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.430
it doesn't all represent one kind of Christianity are one church or even one

55
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:27.400
region.
But among,
besides the gospel of Thomas,

56
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.990
we know of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas.
This is a wonderful document.

57
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:33.040
If you took my historical Jesus class,

58
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:36.670
you get to read the fragments of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas that we still
have.

59
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.300
And it shows you everybody wonders,
well,
what was Jesus like as a kid?
You know,

60
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:44.290
what games did you play?
Did he play cops and robbers?
Did he play with dolls?

61
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.770
You know,
what did you use to as a kid?
Will Thomas tells you,
it tells you,

62
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:52.360
for example,
that he made a bunch of clay pigeons.
And when this,
uh,

63
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.570
ju,
it's kind of an anti Jewish document,
this juke comes up and says,

64
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:57.010
you're not supposed to be doing that on the Sabbath.

65
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.790
So Jesus claps his hands and the pigeons all fly off the clay pigeons by off,

66
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.710
or I went to one of his buddies,
uh,
get he gets mad at his buddies.

67
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.690
So he,
uh,
strikes the kid dead and then it has to raise the kid up again.

68
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.380
Uh,
when one of his teeth,
when one of his teachers criticizes him,
he says,

69
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:14.930
what do you know?

70
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.210
You've Bimbo and strikes the teacher dumb and blind or something.

71
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.970
It was like Jesus has a little kid in the gospel of Thomas in the Infancy Gospel

72
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:25.660
of Thomas is kind of a little rat,
but um,

73
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.640
that's the way people imagined him as a child.

74
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.510
So there's the infancy gospel of Thomas.
There's the acts of Thomas,

75
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.500
which are very interesting.

76
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.770
Thomas comes across as very anti marriage antifamily there's the hymn of the

77
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.560
Pearl or the him is as,

78
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:43.810
it's also called the hymn of Jude Thomas,

79
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.500
the apostle in the country of the Indians.
Same document,

80
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.710
we tend to call it the hem of the Pearl.
There's a,

81
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:53.620
the book of Thomas The contender riding to the perfect.

82
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.030
So all of these different texts sprang up in early Christianity,

83
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.800
most of them in the second century.

84
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.330
The second century was a time of a lot of Christian literature arising in

85
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.900
different places that didn't make it into the Bible
before.

86
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:12.901
The discovery though of the non commodity codices you probably already know how

87
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:15.910
to spell nod commodity because you've seen it in your textbook.

88
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.480
It's just the name of a village in modern Egypt.

89
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.060
I don't remember how many eyes and D's and F's and D's.

90
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:29.620
It has something like that.
That's that right.
Dylan,

91
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.570
who is our,
one of our teaching assistants,

92
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:35.620
he's an expert on all this stuff so he can correct me.
Uh,

93
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.730
not commodity is a village in Egypt.
And in 1945,

94
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.850
while they were digging for some clay and that sort of thing,
uh,

95
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.860
son Egyptian peasant found a 13 large books.

96
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.790
Remember the word codecs or Codices I've talked about in the,
uh,

97
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.720
one of the early lectures means the kind of book that has,

98
00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:59.960
the pate has pages and on all sewn up on one side to distinguish it from a book

99
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:03.320
that's in a scroll form.
So this by this time you found these books,

100
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.820
they had been buried there probably some time in the fourth century,

101
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.020
so in the three hundreds and they'd probably been hidden there because that's

102
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:15.830
about the time that certain forms of Christianity we're being outlawed and

103
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:16.790
declared heretical.

104
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.960
There are 13 of these big books and Rod is rod along the Nile River and we call

105
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:28.940
these the nod commodity library or the not commodity corpus,

106
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.860
the knock body text.

107
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.490
That's just because the modern village near where they were found is not

108
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:39.491
commodity before this 1945 discovery and the gospel of Thomas is one of many,

109
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:44.540
many different texts that were discovered in this library of material.

110
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.920
Before this,

111
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.240
we knew that there was a gospel of Thomas because early Christian writers would

112
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:55.010
talk about it usually to condemn it and we did.
We had a few papayas fragments,

113
00:06:55.011 --> 00:07:00.011
three pirates fragments that had Greek versions of just parts of the gospel of

114
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:03.920
Thomas,
just pieces of it from oxy,
oxy,
Rinkus Egypt.

115
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.920
But the non commodity discovery was really a very,

116
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:11.450
very exciting because it greatly increased our knowledge of some forms of

117
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:16.370
Christianity that the only thing we had known about them was by Orthodox a

118
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:18.310
writers condemning it.
And you know,

119
00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:22.070
in Orthodox when one kind of writers condemning another,
a bunch of people,

120
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.520
you can't necessarily trust what they say.
Orthodox writers for example,

121
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.550
claim that Gnostics,
who they took to be the these heritage,
they were,

122
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.460
we would talk about gnosticism in this lecture.
They said,
oh,

123
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:34.520
they have these wild sex orgies and they,
uh,

124
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.600
they drink blood and they have cannibalism.
Well,
uh,

125
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.170
regular Christians were accused by their enemies of doing precisely the same

126
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.480
thing.
So we don't believe everything.

127
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.310
But when we found these non-commodity texts,

128
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.140
we had sort of firsthand texts from these people who understood Christianity

129
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.010
differently than what would come to be,
um,
Orthodox Christianity.

130
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.330
Now,
the modern study of Gnosticism,
uh,

131
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.230
therefore has been completely revolutionized by this study because it brought to

132
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:05.840
light a complete version of the gospel of Thomas,

133
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:08.120
although it was in Coptic translation of the Greek.

134
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.310
It was originally written in Greek,
translated into Coptic,

135
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:11.630
which is an ancient Egyptian language,

136
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.010
but it also brought to light all these other texts,
not all by the same people,

137
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:18.860
not all reflecting the same views.
Some of them,
for example,

138
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:22.580
are just pieces of Plato are parts of the Bible and that sort of thing.

139
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.680
These texts I said were the texts we actually have and not commodity.

140
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.770
Codices were,
were written around the time three 50.

141
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:35.270
And we know this because the cardboard that was used to bind these things was

142
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:39.080
made at a papyrus fragments and paper fragments.
They were older.
So by,

143
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.620
by dating some of the,

144
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.710
the pieces of paper that were used to make the cardboard that bound these

145
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:49.190
things,
we can tell when the,
at least these books were put together.
Um,

146
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.980
but we think that a lot of these texts were actually written in the second

147
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:53.270
century and the Gospel of Thomas,

148
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:56.100
most scholars would say is written the year 200.

149
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.700
Some scholars believe that the gospel of Thomas goes all the way back to the

150
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:04.701
first century and may even be as early as mark or Q or even earlier.

151
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.670
I think probably the majority of scholars don't believe that.

152
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.210
I think the majority of us believe that the gospel of Thomas was probably first

153
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:16.440
written in Greek,
uh,
in the first half of the second century.

154
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:20.340
So between 101 50,
but we don't really know.
It's a,

155
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.870
just a complete guess.
Some of the sayings in the gospel of Thomas,

156
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.670
um,
look,

157
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.130
actually older Bart Ehrman talks about why you would think a certain,
uh,

158
00:09:31.131 --> 00:09:34.840
saying in one form might be older than us saying in another form.
Uh,

159
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.970
and that's debatable,
but some of us,
if we just compare the same side by side,

160
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.040
those in the gospel of Thomas to some people would say,

161
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.330
well this looks actually like an older version of this saying or of Jesus or an

162
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:50.040
older version of a,
of a parable of Jesus that we find in Matthew our mark.

163
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.390
And so some people have said,

164
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.630
and even if the gospel of Thomas itself comes from the second century,

165
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.780
it may well contain what are more ancient versions of sayings of Jesus.

166
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.410
This is why when people do historical Jesus research that is trying to figure

167
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:06.480
out from the multiple gospels that we have,

168
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.980
what did the historical Jesus really say and really do historically determined.

169
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.490
People will use the gospel of Thomas sometimes to say,
well,

170
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.090
this is actually more likely what Jesus actually close to what Jesus actually

171
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:22.920
said.
And the Canonical Gospel writers have edited it up a bit.
So that's,

172
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.420
it's very debatable about that.

173
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.200
But that's a part of the value of the gospel of Thomas is that for a lot of

174
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:28.680
scholars,

175
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.450
we believe it takes us back at least a close to the time of Jesus in some of its

176
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:34.770
sayings,
but not necessarily in all of it.
Sings.

177
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.780
There are 114 sayings as you buy now knowing the gospel of commerce.

178
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.240
And as I said last time,

179
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:46.740
scholars like to use two bit words when one bit words would do just as well.

180
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.880
So instead of calling these sayings,
you will often see them called logia.

181
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.200
That's the plural Logue.
Aeon is the singular.

182
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.510
Logan is just Greek for a saying.
So logia is just great for sayings.

183
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.750
So often in scholarship in your textbooks,

184
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:10.170
sometimes it'll say loogie on one 14 from the gospel of Thomas and that just

185
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:15.171
means saying one 14 there are 114 of them and in fact they're introduced.

186
00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:17.760
The Gospel is introduced by just the words.

187
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:23.090
These are the obscure or the hidden sayings that the living Jesus uttered and

188
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:28.000
which did [inaudible] Jude Thomas wrote down.
So it gives you sort of,

189
00:11:28.001 --> 00:11:29.670
it's a little title right there.
At the beginning.

190
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.890
Notice there's no passion narrative.

191
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.720
There's no description of the death of Jesus.

192
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.280
There is no resurrection and actually most people would think that Jesus speaks

193
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.170
as if he's already been resurrected.

194
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.670
So does this author intend us to think that this is the post resurrection Jesus

195
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.290
or did he just assume that even before his death,
Jesus just talked to this way?

196
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.950
You have to use your imagination because the author doesn't really tell us.

197
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.560
Now comparisons with other gospels,
get out your text.

198
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.920
You're a gospel of Thomas and read with me through some of these things.

199
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:03.460
Look at logix on nine this is the parable of the sower.

200
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.650
Jesus said,
listen,
a sower came forth,
took a handful and cast.

201
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.580
Now some fell on from the pathway and the birds came and pick them out.

202
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.780
Others fell on a rock,

203
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.050
but they did not take root in the soil and did not send up years.

204
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.100
Others fell upon the thorns and they choke the seat and the grubs devoured them

205
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.360
and others fell upon good soil and it sent up good crops and you'll do 60 per

206
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:27.610
measure and 120 per measure.

207
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.980
That's actually an example of when you have a saying that sounds on more

208
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:35.260
primitive perhaps in this gospel,

209
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:40.210
because notice how that saying is shorter and a bit simpler than the same

210
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.500
parable would be in either Matthew or Luke.
An example of why some people say,

211
00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:47.440
well,
maybe it's more primitive.
That one sounds very,

212
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:49.900
very much like what you've got already in the canonical gospels.

213
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:51.370
So it should found,
sound familiar to you?

214
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.890
Look at the number eight right above that.

215
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:58.960
What human beings resemble is an intelligent fishermen who having cast his net

216
00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:02.770
into the sea,
pulled up the net out of the sea full of little fish,

217
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.680
the intelligent fishermen upon finding among them,
uh,

218
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.650
find large fish through all the little fish back into the sea,

219
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.610
choosing without any effort,
the big fish,
whoever has ears to hear should listen.

220
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.850
Now,
this translation I'm reading from Bentley Leighton's translation,

221
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:17.260
he's a professor in our department.

222
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.670
He's a very famous as one of the top cop technologists in the world.

223
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.550
And so I'm using his translation of this,
uh,

224
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.260
and but that whoever has ears to hear should listen even though the translation

225
00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:30.340
makes it sound slightly different.

226
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.560
That's just exactly the same thing as you see in the gospels.

227
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:37.180
Let Him who have ears to hear here late and just decided to translate it in a

228
00:13:37.181 --> 00:13:39.430
bit more colloquial English version.

229
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:45.100
So that's just like what you would find practically in the other gospels looking

230
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.650
30 saying 30
Jesus said,

231
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.550
where there are three divine beings,
they are divine.

232
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.270
Where there are two or one,
I myself dwell with that person.

233
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.140
That sounds of it more odd,
doesn't it?

234
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.430
It sounds a bit like a saying of Jesus in the gospels that says wherever two or

235
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:09.520
three are gathered together,
I am there in the midst of them.

236
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:14.050
But what does this about divine beings where there are three divine beings,

237
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:18.370
they are divine.
Where there are two or one,
I myself dwell with that person.

238
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.550
It's puzzle.
You can tell how it's similar,
but not exactly like this.

239
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.060
The synoptic gospels look at Verse 48.

240
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.770
Jesus said,
if to make peace with one another within a single house,

241
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.490
they will say to a mountain,
go elsewhere and it will go elsewhere.

242
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.210
Does it remind me what the synoptic version of that saying says,

243
00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.573
<v 1>anybody</v>

244
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.430
<v 0>know your Bible well enough?
Yes sir.</v>

245
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.163
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

246
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.400
<v 0>that's right.
If you have faith size of a mustard seed,</v>

247
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.540
the size of a mustard seed,

248
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.870
you can tell a mountain to remove yourself and I'll go.
So it's a,
it's in this,

249
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.830
this thing that,
um,
to making peace again,
uh,

250
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:04.460
with one another within a house so that it's the peacemaking making that seems

251
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:08.420
to give the power.
Um,
86.

252
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.513
<v 2>Okay.</v>

253
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.020
<v 0>Jesus said foxes have their dens and birds have their nests,</v>

254
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:25.910
but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head and gain repose.

255
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.350
Now that sounds funny.
Up until the last couple of words,

256
00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:32.450
it sounded just like the synoptic gospels,

257
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:37.451
but this at least lateness translated and then just say and get rest and rest.

258
00:15:37.461 --> 00:15:39.890
Lay his head in.
Rest.
Professor Layton,

259
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:44.270
his for some reason translated this to sound a bit odd and gain repose.

260
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.110
I think what that means is he's trying to signal that this,

261
00:15:48.111 --> 00:15:52.490
these last two words have some kind of special meaning for this author in this

262
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:53.150
text.

263
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:57.710
What kind of special meeting would that be and then one 13 these are just

264
00:15:57.711 --> 00:16:01.670
examples of sayings that looked very much like what we already have seen in the

265
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:04.790
Bible.
His disciples said to him,

266
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.830
when is the kingdom going to come?

267
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.010
Now we've got this in the gospels also in the Bible.

268
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.210
Jesus said it is not by being waited for that it's going to come.

269
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.650
They are not going to say,

270
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:19.730
here it is are there it is rather the kingdom of the father is spread out over

271
00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:21.680
the earth and people do not see it.

272
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.800
This is not the kingdom coming in the future as we've seen it in mark and

273
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:28.431
Matthew and Luke,

274
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:31.820
this is the kingdom is already here on the earth and if you don't know that it's

275
00:16:31.821 --> 00:16:34.220
just because you aren't recognizing it.

276
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.140
There are though really interesting peculiarities or the gospel of Thomas.

277
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:44.141
And let's look at some of those first look at 13 these are some sayings that

278
00:16:44.391 --> 00:16:48.080
look more odd to us.
Jesus said to his disciples,

279
00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:50.780
compare me to something and tell me what I resemble.

280
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.300
This starting off sounding like what we've seen already,
Simon Peter said,

281
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.120
hey,
just angel is whom you resemble.

282
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.800
Matthew said to him and intelligent philosopher is what you resemble.

283
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.840
Thomas said to him,
teacher,

284
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.550
my mouth utterly will not let me say what you resemble.
Jesus said,

285
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.540
I am not your teacher for you.
Now notice he lightens letting you know.

286
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.090
Are you using the same translation that I am?
That's right.

287
00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:19.550
I thought I gave you the same translation.
Leighton says,

288
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.760
let you know because you can't tell an English whether that your teacher is

289
00:17:22.761 --> 00:17:26.660
singular.
You are plural you.
And he tells you it's singular in the Coptic.

290
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.440
I am not your teacher.
So Jesus is directing this,
not to all the apostles,

291
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:33.590
but to Thomas in particular,
right here for you,

292
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:37.310
have drunk and become intoxicated from the bubbling wellspring that I have

293
00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:40.400
personally measured out.
Well,
what the hell does that mean?

294
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:45.920
And he took him that took Thomas with drew and said three things to him.

295
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.190
Now when Thomas came to his companions,
they asked him,
what did Jesus say to you?

296
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.820
Thomas said to them,
if I say to you,
plural,

297
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.710
one of the things that he said to me,

298
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.400
you will take stones and stone me and fire will come out of the stones and burn

299
00:17:59.401 --> 00:18:04.230
you up.
Sort of an ancient version of I'd tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

300
00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:05.973
<v 3>Okay,</v>

301
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.080
<v 0>look at 29</v>

302
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:12.461
Jesus said,

303
00:18:12.461 --> 00:18:17.461
it is amazing if it was for the spirit that flesh came into existence and it is

304
00:18:18.161 --> 00:18:21.730
amazing indeed,
if spirit came into existence for the sake of the body.

305
00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.991
But as for me,

306
00:18:22.991 --> 00:18:27.991
I am amazed at how this great wealth has come to dwell in this poverty.

307
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.810
What does that mean?
Look at the very last saying,

308
00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.880
I hope some of you noticed this when you're reading over this.

309
00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:37.840
Before he came to class,
Simon Peter said to them,
Mary should leave us.

310
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.370
He's talking about Mary Magdalen probably from females are not worthy of life.

311
00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.730
Jesus said,
see,

312
00:18:45.731 --> 00:18:50.590
I am going to attract her to make her mail so that she too might become a living

313
00:18:50.591 --> 00:18:52.420
spirit that resembles you.

314
00:18:52.421 --> 00:18:57.421
Males for every female that makes itself mail will enter the Kingdom of heaven.

315
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.260
<v 3>Oh,
okay.</v>

316
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.250
<v 0>Look at 24</v>

317
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.070
I'm just picking out some sayings that are rather mysterious.

318
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:15.170
His disciples said,
show us the place where you are for we must seek it.

319
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.900
He said to them,
whoever has ears should listen.

320
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.280
There is light existing within a person of light and it enlightens the whole

321
00:19:22.281 --> 00:19:25.580
world.
If it does not enlighten,
that person is darkness.

322
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.550
The previous saying had this duality of male and female that was somehow

323
00:19:31.551 --> 00:19:34.880
significant in some mysterious way.
This one shows us,
there's,

324
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:39.290
there's also a duality of concern to this author of light and darkness.

325
00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.520
So there's dualisms and especially a light darkness dualism,
male,

326
00:19:43.521 --> 00:19:47.960
female dualism and a soul body dualism.
We've already seen that.
Uh,

327
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:53.110
there's also this word that latent translates as the entirety and some modern

328
00:19:53.781 --> 00:19:54.920
translations will just leave it.

329
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.250
They'll just transliterate the Greek that it's from.
Pleroma.

330
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:03.260
Pleroma is a Greek word that comes in part and in some philosophy in the ancient

331
00:20:03.261 --> 00:20:06.230
world and some intellectual and it just means the all or the fullness,

332
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.440
but it comes,
it's an abstract where meaningful or fullness,

333
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.150
but it comes to be some kind of technical term that refers to,
I don't know,

334
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:18.890
all of existence or the fullness of being or like think of German philosophy

335
00:20:18.891 --> 00:20:23.480
with fullness,
with a cap being with a capital B,
our existence with a capital e.

336
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.780
So that word is often occurs here and when you see the word entirety and

337
00:20:29.781 --> 00:20:34.010
Leighton's translation,
he's translated that word play Roman.
Jesus said,

338
00:20:34.011 --> 00:20:39.011
and this is 67 if anyone should become acquainted with the entirety the pleroma

339
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.700
and should fall short and all that fought person fall short,

340
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.250
utterly several other places saying 77 another reference to that.

341
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.140
Notice we've already seen that this text does not take the Kingdom of God is

342
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:55.390
something existing in the future.
In fact,

343
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.240
this text is not at all eschatological.

344
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.610
Remember we encountered this word in previous lecture,

345
00:21:00.611 --> 00:21:04.120
which really just means something having to do with the end as gotten in Greek.

346
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:07.900
Meaning the end.
This author is not eschatological.

347
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.500
He doesn't think Christianity has had this.

348
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.120
Think Jesus's teachings are about the future at all.
They're about now,

349
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.420
there are about to present.
So there are several sayings in Thomas.

350
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.840
Unlike the sayings in the Gospels and the Canon that are not eschatological,

351
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.990
they've very much pointed the present.
There's also something else.

352
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.330
One of this,
this or this author is concerned about something like integration.

353
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:36.690
Look at saying 61 Jesus said to wil rose repos on a couch,

354
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:42.880
one will die,
one will live.
Salome said,
who are you?

355
00:21:42.881 --> 00:21:45.220
Oh man,
like a stranger.

356
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.250
You have gotten upon my couch and you have eaten from my table.

357
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.720
Jesus said to her,
it is I who come from that which is integrated.

358
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.850
I,
I come from that which is one.
I come from that which is not divided.

359
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.810
I was given some of the things that my father,
she apparently,

360
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.150
there's a lot of holes in the text where you see those.dot,

361
00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:08.320
dots and that's showing that there are lacunae that is just holes in the,

362
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.740
in the actual document that Layton that we get this from.

363
00:22:12.741 --> 00:22:17.410
So there are gaps in the text.
I am your female disciple.

364
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.310
She's used to say to him at some point,
and then eventually he seems to answer.

365
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.290
Therefore,
I say that such a person once integrated will become full of light,

366
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.310
but such a press person wants divided will become full of darkness.

367
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.170
So there's a divided integrated dualism that's going on in this text also.
Uh,

368
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.810
the kingdom is invisible.
I think I've already pointed this out.

369
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:40.420
The idea is that the kingdom is not something you say,
look,

370
00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:44.110
it's over there and look,
it's here.
Uh,
one 13.

371
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.710
I've already read that.
Uh,
the Kingdom of fathers spread it over the earth,

372
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.940
but most people don't see it.

373
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.890
And then look at saying three right at the very beginning,
Jesus said,

374
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:57.790
if those who lead you say to you,
see the kingdom is in heaven,

375
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.950
then the birds of Heaven will precede you.
If they say to you it is in the sea,

376
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.660
then the fish will proceed you.

377
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.520
But the kingdom is inside of you and it is outside of you.

378
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.880
When you become acquainted with yourself.
Now,

379
00:23:12.881 --> 00:23:17.800
the word acquainted here means when you become really knowledgeable and it comes

380
00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:21.910
from the Greek word here is gnosis where we get the term gnostics.

381
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.920
That Greek word means gnosis but it does,
it means gnosis in uh,
in,
uh,

382
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.500
in some kinds of technical way in these document,
which is,

383
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.100
it's not something you just know with your head.
It's something you really,

384
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.520
really know.
And so it,
to express that,
uh,

385
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:42.670
Professor Layton usually translates this word as acquaintance or becoming

386
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:46.220
acquainted with it.
When you become acquainted with yourselves,

387
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.230
then you will be recognized and you will understand that it is you who are

388
00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:55.790
children of the living father.
But if you do not become acquainted with yourself,

389
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.700
if you don't have gnosis of yourself,

390
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:03.680
then you are in poverty and it is you who are the poverty?

391
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.960
What is all this going on?

392
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:10.610
These things are things that sound a bit familiar and we might be able to figure

393
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:11.660
them out because these are themes.

394
00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:14.960
You can tell that there are things of light and darkness,
poor and riches,
uh,

395
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:19.250
inside and out,
soul and body,
spirit and body,
uh,
male and female.

396
00:24:19.251 --> 00:24:23.930
But there are some songs that are just really inscrutable.
Look at saying seven.

397
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.540
Jesus said bless.

398
00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:31.541
It is the lion that the human being will devour so that the lion becomes human

399
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:33.981
and curse.

400
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:38.981
It is the human being that the lion of devours and the lion will become human.

401
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.230
What does that mean?

402
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:49.290
I have no clue and that's really honest.

403
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.880
Look at 15

404
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.143
<v 3>okay.</v>

405
00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.890
<v 0>Jesus said,
when you and here's a plural,</v>

406
00:24:58.891 --> 00:25:03.891
you see one who has not been born of woman fall upon your faces and prostate,

407
00:25:04.321 --> 00:25:08.790
your prostrate yourselves before that one.
It is that one.
Who is your father?

408
00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.610
Someone not born of women.

409
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.480
Is Your father 97

410
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.450
<v 3>okay.</v>

411
00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.081
<v 0>Yeah.
You see,</v>

412
00:25:19.081 --> 00:25:22.440
aren't you glad that I didn't make you do an extra Jesus paper of these things?

413
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.470
Jesus said what the Kingdom of the father resembles is a woman who was conveying

414
00:25:28.471 --> 00:25:32.220
a jar full of meal when she had traveled far along the road,
the handle,

415
00:25:32.221 --> 00:25:35.280
the jar broke and the meal spilled out after her along the road.

416
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.970
She was not aware of the fact that she had not understood how to toil.

417
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.020
When she reached home.
She put down the jar and found it empty.

418
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.590
How profound.
Jesus,

419
00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:53.040
she lost her meal and she found her jar empty when she got home.

420
00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:59.220
Okay?
98 right below that,
Jesus said,

421
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:03.240
what the king or the father resembles is a man who wanted to assassinate a

422
00:26:03.241 --> 00:26:05.460
member of court at home.

423
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:09.420
He drew the dagger and stabbed it into the wall in order to know whether his

424
00:26:09.421 --> 00:26:12.840
hand would be from next.
He murdered the member of court.

425
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:19.560
That's what the kingdom is like.
Now you know exactly what the kingdom is like,

426
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:24.150
right?
One Oh five

427
00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.280
Jesus said whoever is acquainted with the father and the mother will be called

428
00:26:29.281 --> 00:26:30.930
the offspring of a prostitute.

429
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.373
<v 3>Great.</v>

430
00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:35.990
<v 0>All right.
What's going on here?</v>

431
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.200
This document has called and still causes all kinds of debate among scholars.

432
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.680
You could go online right now and you will see tons and tons and tons of stuff

433
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.250
written about the gospel of Thomas,

434
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.150
some by real scholars and intelligent wise people like me.

435
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.590
Although I've actually never written by the gospel of Thomas Cause I don't want

436
00:26:56.591 --> 00:26:57.840
to go that get in that mess.

437
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.900
But I have good scholarly friends who publish on the gospel of Thomas and argue

438
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:03.763
their theories,

439
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.370
others by just absolute Kooks who are using the gospel of Thomas for all kinds

440
00:27:08.371 --> 00:27:13.260
of experimental spirituality and religion and you know,
mind stuff.

441
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.890
I'm trying to watch my language.
So,
but then you'll also have,

442
00:27:19.891 --> 00:27:22.260
even if you took very reputable scholars,

443
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.040
you will have why differences of opinion and one of the big differences of

444
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:29.250
opinion right now when when the gospel comes first became published,

445
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.250
people sort of talking about it is,
oh,
this is a gnostic gospel.

446
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.730
It represents a form of GNOSTICISM,
which I'll explain in a moment.

447
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.400
Other people have said,
no,
it's not gnostic.

448
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.770
It doesn't have all the main things we look for.
In fact,

449
00:27:40.771 --> 00:27:44.190
they even said we shouldn't even use this term gnosticism anymore because it

450
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:46.860
doesn't refer to anything we can actually locate in the ancient world.

451
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.350
It refers to a whole bunch different things and nobody could come up with a good

452
00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:53.070
definition of gnosticism or the GNOSTIC church.

453
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.380
So scholars right now,
some scholars will say,

454
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.460
let's get rid of the term entirely and call it something else.
Whatever it is.

455
00:27:58.461 --> 00:28:03.461
This thing is others continued to use the term Bart Ehrman wrote your textbook

456
00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:04.500
if you'll notice,

457
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.180
he goes ahead and sort of takes the gospel of Thomas as representing some kind

458
00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:13.680
of gnosticism.
Um,
but maybe not all of them,
whatever we would call gnosticism.

459
00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.120
And he admits that there's a big debate.

460
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.480
Now I'm going to a little bit of terminology.
I've already told you what not.

461
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:24.510
The term gnostic comes from this word gnosis and the word gnostic cause was used

462
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:26.850
by some people in the ancient world to refer to themselves,

463
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.500
but they didn't necessarily mean by that,

464
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:31.650
that they were in some kind of sect called gnosticism.
For example,

465
00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:36.360
the Clement of Alexandria who wrote around the year 200,
a very famous,
uh,

466
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:39.840
early Christian scholar considered by later Christianity to be perfectly

467
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:44.160
orthodox.
He talked about gnostic Christians and thought he was himself a gnostic

468
00:28:44.161 --> 00:28:44.730
Christian.

469
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.160
And what he meant by that apparently was just that he was one of the more

470
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:47.790
knowledgeable,

471
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:51.510
he was one more why as Christians he was in the know and he seems also to have

472
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:54.000
had an idea that there were two kinds of Christian knowledge.

473
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.390
There's public knowledge that all Christians have and then there's special kind

474
00:28:57.391 --> 00:28:58.170
of hidden knowledge,

475
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.020
esoteric knowledge that only certain kinds of Christians have.

476
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.330
And so this idea that you have esoteric knowledge would be called a gnostic kind

477
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:06.960
of notion.

478
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.680
So there are even Orthodox Christians who might use the term gnostic in the

479
00:29:10.681 --> 00:29:15.360
second century to refer even to themselves.
So that's just what that word,

480
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:16.620
that word gnostic often meant.

481
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.020
It would've looked a bit weird to an ancient Greek speaker,

482
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.760
but it would have been,
uh,

483
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.880
it would have been understandable as simply unknowing person.

484
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.440
There are other terms though that I want to talk about.
I've already mentioned,

485
00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:31.680
I believe the term pro tow orthodox.

486
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:37.150
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

487
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.670
<v 0>The word Orthodox,
of course just means right thinking,</v>

488
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.070
right opinion Ortho from Greek,

489
00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:46.660
right or true or correct or straight doxa meaning opinion or thoughts or are

490
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:51.280
then it comes to mean doctrine to the problem with using the word Orthodox.

491
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.640
Is that the opposite of Orthodox?
It's usually Harrison.

492
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:57.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>

493
00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.700
<v 0>In this and eventually,
uh,</v>

494
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.100
through different church councils and the fourth and fifth and sixth centuries,

495
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:07.540
what counted as Orthodox Christianity became more clearly defined and then

496
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:10.300
anything that wasn't,
that can be labeled heretical Christianity.

497
00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:14.260
And it was even outlawed at different times and late antiquity.
So for example,

498
00:30:14.261 --> 00:30:16.980
the Nicene creed that proclaims that the trend,

499
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.920
the doctrine of the trinity becomes Orthodox doctrines that say that the trinity

500
00:30:20.921 --> 00:30:25.300
is not true or that there's not the holy spirit and NGS and other are not

501
00:30:25.301 --> 00:30:29.230
Orthodox.
They're heretical are sometimes you'll see the term Hetero docs.

502
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:33.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

503
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:37.780
<v 0>Hetero just means other.
So it's,
it's not Ortho,
it's other.</v>

504
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.120
So Orthodox though the problem is we can't read traject that term easily back

505
00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:46.510
into the second century because in the second century that there are tons of

506
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:49.240
different Christians and tons of different churches that had many different

507
00:30:49.241 --> 00:30:53.110
views and they didn't all agree there are some people heads were started

508
00:30:53.111 --> 00:30:54.820
experimenting with the doctrine of the trinity,

509
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.580
but a lot of Christians wouldn't have recognized the doctrine of the trinity in

510
00:30:57.581 --> 00:31:01.120
the second century.
Some people believe that Jesus was fully divine,

511
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.180
other pleased that people really know he was fully human but not divine.

512
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.210
Some people believed he was both.
Some people do who was a mixture of both.

513
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.580
Some believe that sometimes it was one,
sometimes it was the other.

514
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.380
We'll come back to this issue of,

515
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:16.650
of of what do people believe Jesus was and that's the doctrine of Christology.

516
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.400
What do you believe about Christ?

517
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.090
But right now I'm just going to tell you that the pro that we call,

518
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:26.470
we call Christians and the SEC second century and the first entry pro tow

519
00:31:26.471 --> 00:31:28.420
orthodox because we don't,

520
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:32.200
we know that condom orthodox is anachronistic in this time because there wasn't

521
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.490
to clearly delineate ball Orthodox and heretical,
uh,

522
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:41.140
groups or churches.
W Protoje just means earlier then are the first.

523
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.990
So a lot of scholars,
Bart Ehrman is one of them,

524
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.640
uses this term pro tow orthodox and all it means is those Christians living in

525
00:31:48.641 --> 00:31:53.290
the first or second century who,
whose views happened to win out.

526
00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:58.291
Eventually they happen to hold views that would eventually be the winners and

527
00:31:58.691 --> 00:32:02.560
the fight between Orthodoxy and heresy and be declared Orthodox or correct

528
00:32:02.561 --> 00:32:04.600
Christianity.
So pro to Orthodox.

529
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.110
There was no Christian running around in the second century calling himself a

530
00:32:08.111 --> 00:32:12.220
pro tow Orthodox Christian.
They didn't know they were pro to orthodox yet.

531
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.890
They,
but their views eventually won out.
So these different terms,

532
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.140
we'll come over and over again.

533
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:25.350
Protal orthodox just means someone who sort of had correct christological views

534
00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:27.040
that is correct by later standards,

535
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.980
but they held them before these standards had one out in the debate.

536
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.240
Ancient Gnosticism,
if you want to call it that,

537
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:36.700
does not seem to have been one church.

538
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.570
What I'm going to call gnosticism is an movement that seems to have been around

539
00:32:41.571 --> 00:32:42.770
beginning in the second century,

540
00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:45.950
certainly and becomes important through the second,
third,
and fourth centuries.

541
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:50.530
It's not a church and our institution in the sense that we doubt that you could

542
00:32:50.531 --> 00:32:51.650
have walked into say,

543
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:56.150
the town of Antioch and looked for the the GNOSTIC church.

544
00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:57.650
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

545
00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:01.730
<v 0>It seems like the people who wrote these documents and collected these materials</v>

546
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:03.950
that we find in the Nakematte texts and the gospel of Thomas,

547
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.820
they seem to have been intellectuals who are impressed with Jesus,

548
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.410
impressed with the,
uh,

549
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:13.010
Jewish scripture and a lot of cases impressed with a lot of the teachings of

550
00:33:13.011 --> 00:33:13.844
Christianity,

551
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:18.380
but they interpreted them through the eyes of a certain popular Platonism at the

552
00:33:18.381 --> 00:33:19.250
time.
That is,

553
00:33:19.251 --> 00:33:23.030
they seem to have been influenced by different philosophical views and also just

554
00:33:23.031 --> 00:33:26.780
different intellectual views.
So when they read the,
the book of Genesis,

555
00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.940
for example,
they would read the book of Genesis,

556
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:32.480
but read it as if they were reading it through the eyes of Plato's Timaeus,

557
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:37.370
the great platonic dialogue in which Plato puts forth his own sort of a

558
00:33:37.371 --> 00:33:41.330
cosmology and his own view of,
of the gods and the world.

559
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.530
So it sounds,

560
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:46.550
some of their writing sound like they were reading basically good scripture,

561
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.520
but reading it through the eyes of certain kinds of philosophy.

562
00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.113
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

563
00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:57.450
<v 0>And so what we've come to call gnosticism and the ancient world is a range of</v>

564
00:33:57.731 --> 00:34:02.230
ideas that may have been actually embodied in particular people or it may have

565
00:34:02.231 --> 00:34:04.780
been that some of these just intellectual shutters of playing around with ideas

566
00:34:04.781 --> 00:34:07.660
and writing them up and books and having reading clubs where they got together

567
00:34:07.661 --> 00:34:10.640
every Monday night,
you know,
and drank some beer and uh,
uh,

568
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.310
talked about their gnostic ideas.

569
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.510
Platonism itself might be called pro tow gnostic.

570
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:18.700
That is gnosticism before gnosticism.

571
00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:20.123
<v 2>Okay.</v>

572
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:24.020
<v 0>Uh,
for example,
in Platonism,
especially at this time,</v>

573
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.980
you have a strong emphasis of a dualism of body and soul,

574
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:31.220
our body and spirit.
And in that dualism,

575
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:34.670
often the body or the materiality,
the fleshly existence,

576
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:38.450
the harder matter of things becomes less good.

577
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.510
Sometimes even probably bordering on evil.

578
00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:45.710
And some people thought and spirit or the soul or the mind is the good thing.

579
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:49.940
So you have a mind,
body dualism,
uh,
of body and soul dualism.

580
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:55.210
And often there's the deprecation of the body and a deprecation of matter as

581
00:34:56.031 --> 00:34:57.620
morally inferior.
Now,

582
00:34:57.621 --> 00:35:02.621
why would matter be considered inferior to non material substance?

583
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.000
Because,
uh,
what happens to your body eventually?

584
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:12.410
You all have gorgeous bodies now,
but eventually you're going to look like me.

585
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.550
Your hair's gonna fall out.
Your ears is going to get too big,

586
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.230
your nose won't stop growing.

587
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:23.870
And then eventually you'll get even get beyond me and you'll die and you'll rot

588
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:25.243
and you'll disappear.

589
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:31.390
The body is material and the ancient thinkers all knew that matter passes away.

590
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:37.630
Anything that is material is going to pass away and be destroyed and be gone.

591
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:42.990
But things that are not material like ideas,
an idea.

592
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.810
The great thing about an idea is that it never need die.

593
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:52.190
So the spirit of the soul and platonic theory was superior to material stuff

594
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:56.130
because,
and it was the only thing that could live forever,
be an infinite.

595
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.170
They also,
sometimes you see,

596
00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:01.050
especially in later Platonism the idea that not only is the,

597
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:05.880
is the body temporary,
not eternal and passing away,

598
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.830
but the body is also a prison because your spirit,
they believed,

599
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.030
wants to get out of the body.

600
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:15.990
Aren't you frustrated that you can't just escape your body and go off and go

601
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.490
someplace else for a while and,

602
00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:22.470
and zoom out of your body and go to Argentina for the weekend?
You know,

603
00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.320
not have to pay for airfare or,

604
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.430
so the idea was that the body in prisons,
your spirit and your soul,

605
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.770
and this has come to be a part of Platonism at the time.

606
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:38.210
So what scholars will call basic gnosticism includes some basic themes that they

607
00:36:38.431 --> 00:36:42.150
hold in common first,
the world itself,

608
00:36:42.151 --> 00:36:46.830
which is material is evil.
Salvation,

609
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:51.720
therefore from the world must be escape from this physical world into something

610
00:36:51.721 --> 00:36:52.554
else.

611
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.820
Gross materiality is not only temporary in some texts,

612
00:36:58.841 --> 00:37:00.330
but even bad.
It's evil

613
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.690
and salvation therefore must be the knowledge of how you,
that is the real you,

614
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.200
your brain,
you're up me,
not your brain,
your mind or your soul,
your spirit,

615
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:11.670
not your body.

616
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.620
That real you is existing in this material body that salvation will be if it can

617
00:37:16.621 --> 00:37:19.830
learn how to escape the body and escape materiality,

618
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:25.520
that salvation would come by knowledge and that knowledge is a secret.

619
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:29.400
Not everybody knows it,
so only a few people know it.

620
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.370
The content of this knowledge is related to human origins and destination,

621
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:37.760
so sometimes you get this Ilab,

622
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.800
these elaborate myths developed in some of these texts.

623
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:45.990
Let's say that the Supreme Supreme Supreme Supreme God is,

624
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:50.700
has no name is not a particular thing.
It's this thought.
It's just thinking.

625
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:54.510
It's just abstract thinking that thinking thinks well,

626
00:37:54.511 --> 00:37:57.540
what does a thinking thing think?
The thinking thinks thoughts.

627
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.790
Those thoughts start becoming emanations out of the thinking and in those

628
00:38:02.791 --> 00:38:07.530
emanations think and emanate.
And those become lesser being still.
And these.

629
00:38:07.531 --> 00:38:09.150
So the different divine beings,

630
00:38:09.151 --> 00:38:11.130
there are lots of divine beings of the distant universe and they,

631
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.540
by thinking and being,

632
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:16.560
they eliminate inferior forms of being after themselves.

633
00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:22.310
And eventually what happened is those in fear of forms of being get less good

634
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.030
and less like the most ultimate being.
And one of them,
according to one myth,

635
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:31.140
Sophia,
which needs wisdom,
it's a female name,
but it also means wisdom.

636
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:36.650
Sophia decides she wants to emanate and she supposed to do that with a male

637
00:38:37.811 --> 00:38:42.310
concert because by this time and these beings have male and female versions of

638
00:38:42.311 --> 00:38:43.144
themselves,

639
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:48.210
she's supposed to only emanate or procreate by doing so with her male consort,

640
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.550
she decides she wants to be like the Supreme God and be able to emanate on her

641
00:38:51.551 --> 00:38:56.070
own.
So she puts out of being on her own.
And in other words,

642
00:38:56.310 --> 00:39:01.120
she sort of gives birth without needing a man.
Just the DVM pendulum.

643
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.130
Well of course when you do that,
you end up with a monster.

644
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:08.830
So the being that came out of Sophia ended up being a clumsy,
maybe evil,

645
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:10.120
God.
These,

646
00:39:10.121 --> 00:39:13.990
all of these are divine beings that God decided at some point he wanted to

647
00:39:13.991 --> 00:39:17.560
create things and so he,
he didn't really do it very well.

648
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:20.260
So he made our earth.
He made the worlds.
We know it.

649
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.770
He made little human beings like you just have of dirt and clay,

650
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.680
and that's why you know we were,
we were all creation,

651
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:29.380
not of the Supreme God who would do nothing imperfect,

652
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.480
but if some stumbling or evil,

653
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:35.230
at least clumsy God who made us.

654
00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:40.390
That explains why things go wrong.
Why is it my arthritis acts up all the time?

655
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.920
Couldn't God have made a human body that didn't have arthritis?
Well,

656
00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:48.040
that's because the Supreme God didn't make this body the evil,
clumsy.

657
00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:52.390
God made the body.
This happened and so the the world that we created,

658
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.670
when you read in Genesis,
it says,
God created the world.

659
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.350
That's not the highest God.

660
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.420
That's some clumsy God down further on the hierarchy of divine beings in the

661
00:40:01.421 --> 00:40:06.160
universe that God created what we are.
Now.
What happened was at some point,

662
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:11.110
either Sophia or some other bangs,
they got,
sorry for all of us.
Clay like mud,

663
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:11.980
mud people,

664
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:18.270
and somehow a little spark of the divine itself either fell down or got cut up

665
00:40:18.701 --> 00:40:21.850
or put in our bodies.
Our God placed antibodies are blue into our bodies,

666
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.970
but at least some human beings,
all human beings,
in fact,

667
00:40:24.971 --> 00:40:27.700
human beings are in different categories.
There's,
you know,

668
00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:30.190
the really low human beings like undergraduates.

669
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:35.260
Then there are beings who are a little bit higher like graduate students and

670
00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:39.070
then you had the supreme beings,
gnostics,
like professors.

671
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.980
So the true Gnostics,
so you don't ever,

672
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.070
it's not really like undergraduate and graduate stuff because some of you could

673
00:40:45.071 --> 00:40:48.390
be gnostics.
You would be the ones who really have a real spark in us.

674
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.330
Spark of the divine.

675
00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:54.960
That spark of the divine wants to escape the mud body that is trapped in,

676
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:59.080
but you probably don't even know that you're a really a spark trapped in a mud

677
00:40:59.081 --> 00:41:01.600
body until somebody comes along and tells you,

678
00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:05.620
and that's the job of the redeemer.
That's what Jesus did.

679
00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:10.650
Jesus was a redeemer from the Supreme God who comes in to find those people who

680
00:41:11.921 --> 00:41:14.800
have a spark of the divine in them to blow on that spark,

681
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:18.280
to get it going and to get you to remember where you came from.

682
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:23.260
You're not a mud body after all.
The real you came from God self,

683
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.600
God's various self,
the Supreme God.

684
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:30.880
So the true message of Christianity according to these guys is to learn who you

685
00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:32.330
are,
where you came from,
to tis.

686
00:41:32.331 --> 00:41:35.150
You can escape the body and get back to your true origin.

687
00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:37.520
That is you will become one with God again.

688
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.480
And this was expressing a poem by Thea dotas and went like this,

689
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:46.850
who we were,
what we have become,
where we were,

690
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.770
whether we were thrown,
whether we are hastening from what we are redeemed,

691
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:56.420
what birth is,
what rebirth is.
Okay,
now you answered the riddle.

692
00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.910
It's a poem riddle,
who we were.
If you're a gnostic,
who were you?

693
00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:05.900
Answer for you on divine beings.
Thank you.
See,
it's not hard.

694
00:42:05.901 --> 00:42:08.510
I'm not answering questions.
I'm just trying.
You'll remember this better.

695
00:42:08.511 --> 00:42:13.511
If you answer what have you become mud and trapped in a dead body and trapped in

696
00:42:14.901 --> 00:42:18.800
materiality.
Where were you?

697
00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:25.650
Heaven with the divine father,
with God,
whether we were thrown.

698
00:42:25.651 --> 00:42:30.480
Where have you been thrown into the earth,
into the world,
into materiality?

699
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:34.500
Where are you hastening where are you going in a hurt,
in such a hurry,

700
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.700
you're going back to the divine God.
What are you redeemed from

701
00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.680
your dean,
from Jesus and material world.
You're redeemed from being embodied.

702
00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.073
<v 2>Uh,</v>

703
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.760
<v 0>what is birth
in this system?
What does birth,</v>

704
00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:02.060
damnation,
death?
When you're born,
your spark isn't trapped in your body.

705
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:03.650
That's not a good thing.

706
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:06.230
You shouldn't be celebrating your birthday for crying out loud.

707
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:11.390
That's like celebrating when you were thrown in prison.
And what is rebirth

708
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.460
death are learning your true self.
Learning that you,

709
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.670
the true south won't die at all.
So this learning is your rebirth.

710
00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:24.620
So the little poem is a riddle that can,
contains these doctrines,
uh,

711
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:28.250
within itself.
So here's the true self.

712
00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:32.420
The spark of light is trapped in an alien body with all its central passions.

713
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.550
Sex.
Therefore essential desire.

714
00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.210
Erotic desire is a bad thing as an evil thing because that you're just trying to

715
00:43:38.211 --> 00:43:40.460
trap more sparks into more mud bodies.

716
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.780
You're just creating more sparks trapped in mud bodies.
When you have sex,

717
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:49.310
evil powers exist.
All the different gods that were eliminated,

718
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.980
a bunch of those are evil and they fly around the sky in the heavens and they

719
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.160
did.

720
00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:58.160
They try to keep the true self asleep or drunk in order to keep the evil world

721
00:43:58.251 --> 00:43:59.250
together and their words,

722
00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.960
they don't want you to learn and they don't want your spark to be able to fly

723
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:06.260
through.
But really wise guys like me,

724
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:11.210
we have the secrets and I can give you words,
clues,

725
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.210
secrets that you,
if you know those things,

726
00:44:14.211 --> 00:44:19.211
you can use these secrets to unlock the gates that lead back to God.

727
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:24.720
So this is kind of a common storyline or myth.
There's a hammer,

728
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:26.330
the pearl that I mentioned before,

729
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:30.310
which basically tells this that a king of the east sins,

730
00:44:30.311 --> 00:44:33.240
a royal prince by way of the region.

731
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:36.390
I'm a CNA to Egypt in order to get a precious Pearl,

732
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:39.380
which was being guarded by fierce dragon.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

733
00:44:39.381 --> 00:44:41.040
It's like of like a video game,
right?

734
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:46.440
The prince is poisoned or actually drugged would be a better accurate

735
00:44:46.441 --> 00:44:51.240
translation and made intoxicated by the Egyptians.
But he,

736
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:55.500
the prince is awakened by a message from the king.
He,

737
00:44:55.501 --> 00:44:59.700
the prince takes the Pearl by defeating the dragon with the name of his father

738
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:04.940
and returns to the east where he puts on a robe of knowledge gnosis and ascends

739
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:09.510
to the king palace entering the realm of peace and living happily forever after.

740
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:14.040
It's a nice little fable about a prince who goes to a foreign land,

741
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.340
finds the thing of value,
defeats the evil purposes and goes back.

742
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.880
So some people therefore have read the gospel of Thomas as being precisely this

743
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:27.810
kind of,
uh,
uh,
that some of the sayings,

744
00:45:27.811 --> 00:45:32.730
the gospel of Thomas makes sense if you presuppose these mythological structures

745
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:36.030
and ideas.
And again,
some scholars would say,

746
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:39.060
well you're just putting together as a modern scholar,

747
00:45:39.061 --> 00:45:43.410
a bunch of disparate kinds of texts and ideas and putting it in a system.
Well,

748
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:43.990
yes,

749
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:47.970
that that's where I disagree with some people cause I want to say I believe that

750
00:45:47.971 --> 00:45:50.550
there's enough commonalities between enough documents.

751
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:54.330
Then we can say that there were people who had these kinds of common ideas and

752
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:56.850
this basic structure that I've called the gnostic structure,

753
00:45:56.851 --> 00:46:00.210
the gnostic myth certainly influenced ancient writings of some sort and it's,

754
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.390
and there was some kinds of Christianity there were heavily influenced by this.

755
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.373
So for example,

756
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:08.160
look at back to Thomas for our last closing minutes and let's read some of these

757
00:46:08.161 --> 00:46:12.840
sayings that sound puzzling to us.
And if we understand,
we assume this myth,

758
00:46:12.841 --> 00:46:14.160
maybe we'll read them differently.

759
00:46:14.161 --> 00:46:18.690
Look at 21 [inaudible] Mary said to Jesus,

760
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.170
what do your disciples resemble?
He said,
what?

761
00:46:22.171 --> 00:46:25.320
They resemble his children living in a plot of land that is not theirs.

762
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.830
When the owners of the land come,
they will say,
surrender our land to us.

763
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.100
They for their parts strip naked in their presence in order to give it back to

764
00:46:32.101 --> 00:46:37.060
them and they give them back their land.
An Alec.

765
00:46:37.061 --> 00:46:39.730
Nick could be an allegory.
Who are the owners of the land,

766
00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:43.690
the evil powers that rule the earth?
Who are the children?

767
00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:46.990
Who are the real disciples of Jesus?
Those people who know enough to say,

768
00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.820
when the earth is demanded of you,

769
00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:53.780
when your body is demanded of you by these evil powers,
give it up.
Just give it.

770
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:59.020
It's not valuable.
Anyway,
look at
24

771
00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.640
his disciples said,
show us the place where you are for we must seek it.

772
00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.800
He said that whoever has ears should listen.

773
00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.950
There is a light existing within a person of light,
edited,

774
00:47:11.951 --> 00:47:15.340
lightens the whole world.
If it does not enlighten,
that person is darkness.

775
00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:19.840
Remember how I said some people are just dark people,
they're just mud people,

776
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:25.540
but some people have a light in them and what it means to become a true gnostic

777
00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:28.270
is to note to learn that you are one who has that light

778
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.203
37

779
00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:38.520
his disciples said,
when will you be shown forth to us?

780
00:47:38.521 --> 00:47:40.740
And when shall we behold you?
Jesus said,

781
00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:44.910
when you strip naked without being ashamed and take your garments and put them

782
00:47:44.911 --> 00:47:47.640
under your feet like little children and tread upon them,

783
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:51.930
then you will see the child of the living and you will not be afraid.
Okay?

784
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:54.210
What's the gnostic interpretation of that?

785
00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:02.600
Stripping the material world off yourself.
When you strip your soul,

786
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:04.550
your spot,
your spark of the body.

787
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:08.630
When you realize that it's not the real you and you come to know the real you,

788
00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.380
that's what's going to happen.
56

789
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.921
Jesus said,

790
00:48:15.921 --> 00:48:19.310
whoever has become acquainted with the world has found a corpse and the world is

791
00:48:19.311 --> 00:48:21.050
not worthy of the one who has found the corpse.

792
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:24.320
The world is just a the dead body.

793
00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:27.920
So all of these there,
several of the sayings,

794
00:48:27.921 --> 00:48:31.370
if you go back to the gospel of Thomas with some of this background information,

795
00:48:31.371 --> 00:48:33.680
I've given you these ancient myths and ideas.

796
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:37.220
Some of these sayings seem to fit the that myth and fit that notion.

797
00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.520
There are other things though about what I've just told you that you don't find

798
00:48:40.521 --> 00:48:41.420
in the gospel of Thomas.

799
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:44.540
And those are the things emphasized by people who say the gospel of Thomas

800
00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:46.520
shouldn't be called gnostic.
For example.

801
00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:51.050
There's no mention in here of an evil God that creates the world like you find

802
00:48:51.051 --> 00:48:54.290
in some of these knock Hammadi texts.
You have the father,

803
00:48:54.291 --> 00:48:57.800
you have apparently the good guy,
you have Jesus,
but there's not,

804
00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.220
there's no emphasis on creation here as being a bad thing.

805
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.470
So some people have said that's,

806
00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:06.440
that's one of the fundamental things about the gnostic gnostic miss,

807
00:49:06.441 --> 00:49:07.640
and it's not in the gospel of Thomas.

808
00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.060
Therefore the gospel of Thomas is a not gnostic.

809
00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:16.520
They're also simply no string of myths and evil God's names,

810
00:49:16.521 --> 00:49:18.950
which you often find in the text nakematte.

811
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:22.430
So some scholars would say the gospel of Thomas May have some things in common

812
00:49:22.431 --> 00:49:25.760
with Platonism of at the time,
maybe when something come with certain Gnostics,

813
00:49:25.761 --> 00:49:26.630
but it itself is not.

814
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:29.630
But if you take the gospel of Thomas as representing those ideas,

815
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:33.560
then Jesus comes across the Christology of the gospel of Thomas,

816
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:37.040
becomes something different from the histology of the other texts or at least

817
00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.810
Matthew,
mark and Luke.
As we'll see,

818
00:49:38.811 --> 00:49:43.280
the gospel of John Looks a lot more like this in the synoptic gospels dead.

819
00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.700
But Jesus becomes this redeemer figure,

820
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:51.140
this gnostic redeemer figure who comes into the world of materiality in order to

821
00:49:51.141 --> 00:49:55.670
find those who have sparks of life to blow on their sparks of light to transmit

822
00:49:55.671 --> 00:49:57.620
hidden knowledge of them so they can get back.

823
00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.530
And if you'll stay with me the rest of the semester,

824
00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:05.250
maybe I can give you those secrets and you can escape your mud bodies too.

825
00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:08.840
All right,
you have your,
your uh,
sections this week.

826
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:14.440
By tomorrow they'll be up way on online classes server and uh,

827
00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:17.240
the different instructions for the rest of the sections.

828
00:50:17.241 --> 00:50:19.790
And you'll need to look at that because at your section on Thursday or Friday,

829
00:50:19.791 --> 00:50:23.870
y'all need to choose which day and which topic you'll do your paper for.

830
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:27.020
So that will be online by tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
See you next time.
