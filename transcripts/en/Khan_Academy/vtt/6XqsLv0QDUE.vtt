00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:01.257
- [Instructor] So right over here,

00:00:01.257 --> 00:00:05.582
I have the graph of the function
y is equal to 15 over x,

00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:09.598
or at least I see the part of
it for positive values of x.

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:12.790
And what I'm curious
about in this video is

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.752
I want to find the area
not between this curve

00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:17.590
and the positive x-axis,

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.131
I want to find the area between
the curve and the y-axis,

00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:26.298
bounded not by two x-values,
but bounded by two y-values,

00:00:27.182 --> 00:00:28.957
so with the bottom bound

00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:32.177
of the horizontal line y is equal to e

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:36.842
and an upper bound with y is
equal to e to the third power.

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:39.743
So pause this video, and see
if you can work through it.

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:41.122
So one way to think about it,

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:43.960
this is just like definite
integrals we've done

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.441
where we're looking between
the curve and the x-axis,

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.095
but now it looks like
things are swapped around.

00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:52.102
We now care about the y-axis.

00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:55.060
So let's just rewrite our function here,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.128
and let's rewrite it in terms of x.

00:00:57.128 --> 00:00:59.566
So if y is equal to 15 over x,

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.262
that means if we multiply both sides by x,

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.762
xy is equal to 15.

00:01:04.658 --> 00:01:06.284
And if we divide both sides by y,

00:01:06.284 --> 00:01:09.117
we get x is equal to 15 over y.

00:01:10.108 --> 00:01:14.134
These right over here are
all going to be equivalent.

00:01:14.134 --> 00:01:17.366
Now how does this right over help you?

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.410
Well, think about the area.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.658
Think about estimating the area

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:23.193
as a bunch of little rectangles here.

00:01:23.193 --> 00:01:24.709
So that's one rectangle,

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.862
and then another rectangle
right over there,

00:01:28.862 --> 00:01:32.176
and then another rectangle
right over there.

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:35.034
So what's the area of
each of those rectangles?

00:01:35.034 --> 00:01:38.034
So the width here, that is going to be x,

00:01:38.034 --> 00:01:41.426
but we can express x as a function of y.

00:01:41.426 --> 00:01:43.460
So that's the width right over there,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.334
and we know that that's
going to be 15 over y.

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:49.132
And then what's the height gonna be?

00:01:49.132 --> 00:01:52.206
Well, that's going to be
a very small change in y.

00:01:52.206 --> 00:01:54.502
The height is going to be dy.

00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:57.126
So the area of one of
those little rectangles

00:01:57.126 --> 00:02:00.254
right over there, say the area
of that one right over there,

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.354
you could view as,

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:05.771
let me do it over here, as 15 over y, dy.

00:02:07.972 --> 00:02:10.538
And then we want to sum all
of these little rectangles

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:12.023
from y is equal to e,

00:02:12.023 --> 00:02:15.380
all the way to y is equal
to e to the third power.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.341
So that's what our definite integral does.

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:19.084
We go from y is equal to e

00:02:19.084 --> 00:02:21.608
to y is equal to e to the third power.

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:24.240
So all we did, we're used
to seeing things like this,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.808
where this would be 15 over x, dx.

00:02:26.808 --> 00:02:30.976
All we're doing here is,
this is 15 over y, dy.

00:02:30.976 --> 00:02:32.696
So let's evaluate this.

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:35.777
So we take the antiderivative of 15 over y

00:02:35.777 --> 00:02:37.354
and then evaluate at these two points.

00:02:37.354 --> 00:02:39.046
So this is going to be equal to

00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:42.016
antiderivative of one over y

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:45.834
is going to be the natural log
of the absolute value of y.

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:49.254
So it's 15 times the natural log

00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:51.145
of the absolute value of y,

00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:54.303
and then we're going to
evaluate that at our endpoints.

00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:57.400
So we're going to evaluate it at

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.268
e to the third

00:02:59.268 --> 00:03:00.101
and at e.

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:03.507
So let's first evaluate at e to the third.

00:03:03.507 --> 00:03:06.749
So that's 15 times the natural log,

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:09.891
the absolute time, the natural,
(laughs) the natural log

00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:14.058
of the absolute value of
e to the third power minus

00:03:16.323 --> 00:03:17.530
15

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.174
times the natural log of
the absolute value of e.

00:03:22.174 --> 00:03:23.967
So what does this simplify to?

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:25.608
The natural log of e to the third power,

00:03:25.608 --> 00:03:27.148
what power do I have to raise e to,

00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:28.250
to get to e to the third?

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.957
Well, that's just going to be three.

00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:32.815
And then the natural log of e,

00:03:32.815 --> 00:03:35.318
what power do I have to
raise e to, to get e?

00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:36.760
Well, that's just one.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.288
So this is 15 times three minus 15.

00:03:40.288 --> 00:03:43.371
So that is all going to get us to 30,

00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:47.178
and we are done, 45 minus 15.
