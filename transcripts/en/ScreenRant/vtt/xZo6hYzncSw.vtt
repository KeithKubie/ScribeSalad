Move mistakes come in many forms. Sometimes
it's plot holes or continuity errors, other

00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:16.140
times it's just poor judgement by the filmmakers.
When it comes to superhero movies, there's

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.020
a long history of questionable decisions that
have made us roll our eyes and throw popcorn

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.260
at the screen. So many in fact that we decided
to limit our list of facepalm inducing moments

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.920
to films based on DC properties. &nbsp;
Biggest Mistakes That DC Movies Have Made

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.080
So Far
Superman&nbsp;turns back time&nbsp;

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.850
You can say it’s the superhero movie that
started it all. Richard Donner’s 1978 Superman

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.080
is a classic, establishing many of the tropes
that remain in this age of endless superhero

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.200
movies. However this is the only time, in
any version of the character, that Superman

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.789
has the ability to turn back time. In the
film’s climax, Superman must deal with two

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.330
nuclear missiles, only to discover that the
aftershock of one left Lois Lane dead. A devastated

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.719
Superman starts flying circles around the
earth so fast he manages to turn back time

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:07.001
and save Lois. This is a big power to establish
in one film and then never use again. Events

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:11.630
have less meaning when Superman can just undo
them anytime he feels like flying real fast,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.790
but apparently Lois is the only one worth
busting this trick out for.&nbsp;

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.890
Batman and Robin&nbsp;-ALL the puns&nbsp;
The only thing the 1997 debacle that was Batman

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.150
&amp; Robin accomplished was undoing everything
Tim Burton did to make the caped crusader

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.080
cool in 1989.&nbsp; Burton took the character
as far away from the campy 60s TV show as

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.770
he could, only for Warner Bros. and Joel Schumacher
to bring him right back, complete with bat

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:45.350
nipples, bat credit cards, and terrible, terrible
puns. One IMDb user counted no less that 27

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.000
ice puns used by Mr. Freeze alone. The movie
received such a frosty reception that they

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.500
froze production on the fifth Batman movie,
and waited 8 years for audiences to chill

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.220
out before relaunching with Batman Begins.&nbsp;
Catwoman&nbsp;-basketball scene&nbsp;

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.811
Catwoman was the first attempt to bring a
DC character back to the big screen since

00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:10.610
the failure of Batman and Robin, and it didn’t
fare much better. From bad CGI to any excuse

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.500
to show of Halle Berry’s midsection, there
are almost too many cringe inducing moments

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.530
to choose from. The basketball scene, however,
is next level bad. What’s supposed to be

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.040
some fun flirtation over a game of one on
one between Catwoman and Benjamin Bratt’s

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.290
Detective character ends up looking more like
a 1990s Sunny D commercial. The dizzying camera

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.189
movements and quick cuts were presumably meant
to add to the scene’s playfulness but instead

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.769
add to the scene’s overall bizarreness.&nbsp;
Watchmen&nbsp;-Hallelujah&nbsp;

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:46.660
Zack Snyder’s extremely literal interpretation
of Watchmen is as divisive today as when it

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.150
came out in 2009. Love it or hate it, one
thing that almost everyone can agree on is

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.969
the misguided choice of putting Leonard Cohen’s
solemn voice singing Hallelujah over the sex

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:00.010
scene between Night Owl and Silk Spectre.
The song choice adds a whole new layer of

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.270
awkwardness to an already awkward sex scene.
It’s unclear what his intentions were here

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.989
and whether we’re supposed to take this
scene seriously or not. The real victims here

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.549
are the young people who see the film then
put Leonard Cohen on the next time they’re

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:18.069
trying to set the mood on a date.&nbsp;
Green Lantern&nbsp;-CGI suit&nbsp;

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.049
In 2011, as the Marvel Cinematic Universe
was ramping up towards the Avengers and Nolan’s

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.959
Dark Knight Trilogy was winding down, DC was
in need of another franchise, their attempt

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.680
came in the form of The Green Lantern. Unfortunately
it failed to meet expectations and the sequel

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.920
was scrapped. Some blamed this on the overuse
of CGI, particularly in regards to the Green

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.819
Lantern’s suit. One of the fun parts of
live action superhero movies is seeing their

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.870
costumes brought to life, but the Green Lantern’s
was just animated onto Ryan Reynolds, a fact

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.069
he makes a dig at in Deadpool when Wade Wilson
stipulates that his super suit can’t be

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:57.269
green… or animated.&nbsp;
Dark Knight Rises&nbsp;-where’s The Dark Knight?&nbsp;

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.349
When audiences go into a Batman movie there
are certain things they expect to see: cool

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.950
villains, a grimy Gotham city, the batmobile,
but above all, Batman! Bruce Wayne hung up

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.400
his cape in the previous film, so we knew
we’d have to wait for events to force him

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.050
to suit up again, and Nolan stretches that
anticipation for as long as possible, only

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.500
to have Batman defeated and start another
road to recovery. If you breakdown Batman’s

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.560
screen time, he’s only in about 30 minutes
of the movie, which is actually pretty close

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.691
to Batman’s screen time in the other films,
but when you consider that The Dark Knight

00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:31.560
Rises is the longest Batman movie, running
2 hrs and 45 minutes, that’s a lot of time

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.880
spent without the story’s hero. Seriously,
I’ve seen bread rise faster than this Dark

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.470
Knight.&nbsp;
Man of Steel -Jonathan Kent’s Death Scene

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.451
Remember that scene in Austin Powers when
the security guard doesn’t get out of the

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:48.910
way of the slow moving steamroller? This is
what it felt like when watching Kevin Costner’s

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.720
death scene in Man of Steel. Sure the tornado
was moving faster than a steamroller, and

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.110
it was a powerful scene where Clark had to
choose not to use his powers to save his father,

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.380
but the way the scene was constructed it looks
like he doesn’t even try to save himself.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.190
Perhaps Jonathan Kent had his own demons he
just wanted to escape. In Zack Snyder’s

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:12.220
dreary universe, this isn’t that far fetched.&nbsp;
Batman v Superman&nbsp;-Have we met?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.570
When Batman and Superman meet in the comics
or animated films, they’re usually able

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.790
to deduce one another’s secret identities
rather quickly. For some reason they decided

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.850
not to take this route in Dawn of Justice
while also adding elements that made it even

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.690
less plausible. Batman is supposed to be the
world’s greatest detective, and in this

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.400
story he’s already been focussing on Superman
for two years when he meets Clark Kent, yet

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.410
even he’s unable to connect the dots. And
even though Kent is a journalist for a major

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.210
news corporation, he doesn’t have any clue
who billionaire Bruce Wayne is when he meets

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.300
him. Superman also apparently respects Batman’s
privacy by choosing not to use his X-ray vision

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.390
to look through Batman’s mask. If they knew
who each other were, they could have bonded

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.260
over having moms with same last name long
before almost killing each other.&nbsp;

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.580
DCEU&nbsp;-Too Little, Too Late?
One of the biggest issues with first two official

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.490
DCEU movies is that they feel very rushed.
With the failure of Superman Returns and the

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.500
Green Lantern, and the conclusion of the Dark
Knight trilogy, DC needed desperately to create

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.900
something that competed with with the MCU.
Superman was supposed to have a second standalone

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.930
film before introducing Batman, but after
the lukewarm reception Man of Steel got, they

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.350
needed to bring out the big guns. Even though
these first two films were mediocre at best,

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.610
there are already 11 more films in various
stages of development that will expand on

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.030
this universe. DC is really putting the cart
in front of the horse here in an obvious attempt

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.530
to catch up with what Marvel has achieved,
here’s hoping that rushed productions don’t

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.620
result in more DC disappointment.&nbsp;
These are just a few of the things that have

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.311
bugged us in DC’s movies over the years.
