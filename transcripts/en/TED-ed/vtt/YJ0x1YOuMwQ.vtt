00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.454
Among the great poets of literary history,

00:00:09.454 --> 00:00:10.970
certain names like Homer,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.062
Shakespeare,

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:12.928
Milton,

00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:15.223
and Whitman are instantly recognizable.

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.889
However, there's an early 20th century
great French poet

00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:19.652
whose name you may not know:

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.743
Guillaume Apollinaire.

00:00:21.743 --> 00:00:24.709
He was a close friend and collaborator
of artists like Picasso,

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:25.550
Rousseau,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.290
and Chagall.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.806
He coined the term surrealism,

00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:33.431
and he was even suspected of stealing
the Mona Lisa in 1911.

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:35.048
During his short lifetime,

00:00:35.048 --> 00:00:37.457
he created poetry that combined
text and image

00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:41.642
in a way that seemingly predicted
an artistic revolution to come.

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:44.414
In the late 19th 
and early 20th century Paris,

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:47.377
the low-rent districts of Montmartre
and Montparnasse

00:00:47.377 --> 00:00:49.822
were home to every 
kind of starving artist.

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:51.805
It was all they could afford.

00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:53.903
These painters, writers, 
and intellectuals,

00:00:53.903 --> 00:00:57.089
united in their artistic passion
and counterculture beliefs,

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.317
made up France's bohemian subculture.

00:00:59.317 --> 00:01:04.845
And their works of art, literature,
and intellect would shake up the world.

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:06.620
At the turn of the 20th century,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.067
within this dynamic scene,

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:11.065
art critic, poet, 
and champion of the avant-garde,

00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:14.464
Guillaume Apollinaire 
was a well-known fixture.

00:01:14.464 --> 00:01:16.342
As an art critic, Apollinaire explained

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.699
the cubist 
and surrealist movements to the world,

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:21.270
and rose to the defense 
of many young artists

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.485
in the face of what was often
a xenophobic and narrow-minded public.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:28.671
As a poet, Apollinaire was passionate
about all forms of art

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.956
and a connoisseur of medieval literature,

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:34.627
especially calligraphy 
and illuminated initials.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:38.745
As a visionary, Apollinaire saw a gap
between two artistic institutions.

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:42.960
On one side was the popular, highly 
lauded traditional art forms of the time.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.342
On the other, the forms 
of artistic expression

00:01:45.342 --> 00:01:46.957
made possible through surrealism,

00:01:46.957 --> 00:01:47.784
cubism,

00:01:47.784 --> 00:01:49.534
and new inventions, 
like the cinema

00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:51.269
and the phonograph.

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:52.381
Within that divide,

00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:55.498
through the creation of his most important
contribution to poetry,

00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:56.962
the calligram,

00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:59.409
Guillaume Apollinaire built a bridge.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.955
Apollinaire created the calligram
as a poem picture,

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.112
a written portrait,

00:02:03.112 --> 00:02:04.333
a thoughts drawing,

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.795
and he used it to express his modernism

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:10.231
and his desire to push poetry beyond
the normal bounds of text and verse

00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:13.289
and into the 20th century.

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:15.019
Some of his calligrams are funny,

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.584
like the "Lettre-Océan."

00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:19.160
Some of them are dedicated
to his young dead friends,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.818
like "La Colombe Poignardée 
et le jet d'eau."

00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:24.423
Some of them are the expression
of an emotional moment,

00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:27.995
as is "Il Pleut":

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:31.371
"It's raining women's voices
as if they had died even in memory,

00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:35.726
and it's raining you as well,
Marvellous encounters of my life,

00:02:35.726 --> 00:02:37.395
o little drops.

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:40.903
Those rearing clouds begin to neigh
a whole universe of auricular cities.

00:02:40.903 --> 00:02:45.863
Listen if it rains while regret
and disdain weep to an ancient music.

00:02:45.863 --> 00:02:50.633
Listen to the bonds fall off
which hold you above and below."

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:53.840
Each calligram is intended
to allow readers to unchain themselves

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.709
from the regular experience of poetry,

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.415
and feel and see something new.

00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:03.620
"Lettre-Océan" is first an image to be seen
before even the words are read.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.490
Text-only elements combine with words
in shapes and forms.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.163
Two circular forms, 
one locked in a square,

00:03:10.163 --> 00:03:13.184
the other, morph beyond
the page in the shape of a spiral.

00:03:13.184 --> 00:03:16.887
Together they create a picture
that hints towards cubism.

00:03:16.887 --> 00:03:18.751
Then on closer reading of the text,

00:03:18.751 --> 00:03:20.560
the descriptive words within suggest

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.011
the image of an aerial view 
of the Eiffel Tower.

00:03:23.011 --> 00:03:27.124
They give tribute to electromagnetic waves
of the telegraph,

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:29.313
a new form of communication at the time.

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:34.364
Undoubtedly, the deeply layered artistic 
expressions in Apollinaire's calligrams

00:03:34.364 --> 00:03:36.747
are not just a brilliant display
of poetic prowess

00:03:36.747 --> 00:03:38.944
from a master of the form.

00:03:38.944 --> 00:03:41.579
Each calligram itself is also
a snapshot in time,

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.192
encapsulating the passion,

00:03:43.192 --> 00:03:43.962
the excitement,

00:03:43.962 --> 00:03:47.432
and the anticipation of all the 
bohemian artists of Paris,

00:03:47.432 --> 00:03:48.951
including Apollinaire,

00:03:48.951 --> 00:03:51.332
most of whom are well ahead of their time,

00:03:51.332 --> 00:03:52.839
and with their innovative work,

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:55.197
eagerly grasping for the future.
