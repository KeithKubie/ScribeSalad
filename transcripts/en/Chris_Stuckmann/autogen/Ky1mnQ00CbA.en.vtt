00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.530
it becomes a horror movie but up until
then it's mostly very psychological most

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540

family because he's getting so sucked
 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.340
family because he's getting so sucked
into his work and then there's this

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350
into his work and then there's this
 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.370

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380
crazy otherworldly force that is causing
 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.560

family trauma and when you really look

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
family trauma and when you really look
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.120
family trauma and when you really look
at the devil's candy it's very similar

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130
at the devil's candy it's very similar
 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.069

in that way you have a painter who's

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079
in that way you have a painter who's
 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.530
in that way you have a painter who's
getting far too into his job and there's

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540
getting far too into his job and there's

some forces at work and it's causing him
 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.840
some forces at work and it's causing him
to neglect his family and so you could

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850
to neglect his family and so you could
 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.670
to neglect his family and so you could
look at that and say well it's kind of

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680
look at that and say well it's kind of
 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.870
look at that and say well it's kind of
similar but it's just pulled in a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880
similar but it's just pulled in a
 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.340
similar but it's just pulled in a
different way but all the best horror

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350
different way but all the best horror
 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.080
