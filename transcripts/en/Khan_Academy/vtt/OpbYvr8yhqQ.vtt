00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:02.301
- [Voiceover] Some students
want to know what gets

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:05.698
used up in an incandescent
lightbulb when it is in series

00:00:05.698 --> 00:00:09.575
with a resistor: current, energy, or both.

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:12.282
They come up with the
following two questions.

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:15.740
In one second, do fewer
electrons leave the bulb

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.726
than enter the bulb?

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:21.023
Does the electric potential
energy of electrons change

00:00:21.023 --> 00:00:23.206
while inside the bulb?

00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:25.439
So this first question is
really a measure of current

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.622
because current is how
much charge per second

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:31.441
is going through a particular
part of our circuit,

00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:33.984
so charge per second.

00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:35.969
You could also think of
electrons per second.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.746
So current's going to
measure the first one,

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.881
and the electric potential
energy of the electrons,

00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:41.519
well that's going to be voltage.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:42.598
Does the voltage change?

00:00:42.598 --> 00:00:44.143
Is there a voltage drop when we go

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:46.383
from one side of the bulb to another?

00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:48.508
The students have an
adjustable power source,

00:00:48.508 --> 00:00:50.946
insulated wire, lightbulbs, resistors,

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:52.965
switches, voltmeters, ammeters,

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:55.021
and other standard lab equipment.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.401
Assume the power supply and voltmeters

00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:01.140
are marked in tenths of a volt increments

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.065
and ammeters are marked in hundredths

00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:08.024
of an amp increments.

00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:09.928
Describe an experimental procedure

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:11.983
that could be used to answer questions one

00:01:11.983 --> 00:01:13.168
and two above.

00:01:13.168 --> 00:01:15.362
In your description,
state the measurements

00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:17.404
you would make and how you would use

00:01:17.404 --> 00:01:19.008
the equipment to make them.

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:23.830
Include a neat, labeled
diagram of your setup.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.050
All right, so let's do
part A right over here.

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:32.729
So part A, so we're going to have

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.808
a power source.

00:01:33.808 --> 00:01:35.828
I think they said it was
a variable power source.

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:37.187
Did they say that?

00:01:37.187 --> 00:01:41.324
Yeah, the students have an
adjustable power source,

00:01:41.324 --> 00:01:43.158
insulated wire, lightbulbs, resistors,

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:44.099
switches, and voltmeters.

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:46.003
They want to know an incandescent bulb,

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:49.637
lightbulb, when it is in
series with a resistor.

00:01:49.637 --> 00:01:51.123
So an incandescent lightbulb

00:01:51.123 --> 00:01:53.758
when it is in series with a resistor.

00:01:53.758 --> 00:01:56.800
So let's make an attempt at drawing this.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.285
So just the circuit, the circuit only,

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.608
that they care about,

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:02.721
we could do our adjustable power source.

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.579
So let me draw that.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.580
So you could do that like this.

00:02:08.552 --> 00:02:10.723
I'll do a couple here.

00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:13.567
So like this.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:14.647
So that would be a power source

00:02:14.647 --> 00:02:16.191
where this is the positive end,

00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:17.712
this is the negative end,

00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:21.311
and then let me make my circuit

00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:22.530
before any measurement tools.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.562
Then we'll add the measurement tools.

00:02:24.562 --> 00:02:25.491
So I'm going to make it in series

00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:27.429
with a resistor.

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.983
So let's put a resistor here

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:33.002
of some resistance.

00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:36.683
Then let's keep going with our circuit.

00:02:36.683 --> 00:02:37.611
So we're going to keep going

00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:38.923
with our circuit.

00:02:38.923 --> 00:02:40.746
And now let's put our
incandescent lightbulb.

00:02:40.746 --> 00:02:42.232
The symbol for an incandescent lightbulb,

00:02:42.232 --> 00:02:43.161
there's actually several,

00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:46.639
I'll use one where I do a little bump here

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:47.979
and then I'll continue

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:50.573
and I'm actually gonna put
a circle around that bump.

00:02:50.573 --> 00:02:54.985
So it would be just like I'm almost there.

00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:55.809
I'm trying to do it neatly

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:56.726
because they're telling us to do it

00:02:56.726 --> 00:02:59.095
with a neat diagram.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:02.399
All right, let me draw it a
little bit better than that.

00:03:03.773 --> 00:03:05.480
It would look something like this.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.315
And then let me put a circle around this.

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:11.277
So putting a circle around this,

00:03:11.277 --> 00:03:13.075
this is our incandescent lightbulb.

00:03:13.075 --> 00:03:14.480
This is our power source.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.443
To show it's a variable power source,

00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:19.194
I can put an arrow across it like this.

00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:21.516
That shows us that it is
a variable power source.

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:25.023
So this is a circuit
that I've just set up.

00:03:25.023 --> 00:03:27.622
But I wanna use some
ammeters and voltmeters

00:03:27.622 --> 00:03:29.479
in order to measure what's happening

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:33.962
as our electrons are going
through the lightbulb.

00:03:33.962 --> 00:03:35.633
The standard convention is to show current

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:38.316
going from the positive terminal
to the negative terminal,

00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:39.674
but we know, and if you don't know

00:03:39.674 --> 00:03:40.939
I encourage you to watch the Khan Academy

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.913
videos on it, what's actually happening

00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:44.318
is you have electrons traveling

00:03:44.318 --> 00:03:45.676
from the negative terminal

00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:47.441
to the positive one.

00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:48.637
But in general, if we just wanted to talk

00:03:48.637 --> 00:03:51.524
about the current, you would denote it,

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:55.105
the convention is that the current

00:03:55.105 --> 00:03:57.160
goes from the positive direction

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.996
to the negative direction.

00:03:57.996 --> 00:04:00.040
You could view it as
they're the positive gaps

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.442
of electrons or however you want to,

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.999
but the electrons are actually moving

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:05.601
in the other direction.

00:04:05.601 --> 00:04:07.563
So the first question is do you have

00:04:07.563 --> 00:04:09.037
a different number of electrons

00:04:09.037 --> 00:04:11.417
moving per second before
entering the lightbulb

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.879
then when you come out of the lightbulb?

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.620
Well the way you can measure that

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.723
is by measuring the current

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.639
on either side of the lightbulb.

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.939
The way we can measure the current

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:21.077
on either side of the lightbulb

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:26.077
is we can insert ammeters on either side.

00:04:26.406 --> 00:04:29.506
Ammeters have to be inserted in series.

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:31.630
So I'm clearing up some space

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.616
so I can insert my ammeters.

00:04:33.616 --> 00:04:35.651
So that is one ammeter.

00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:37.613
It's going to measure current

00:04:37.613 --> 00:04:38.845
right through that part.

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.272
So I'll put A there.

00:04:40.272 --> 00:04:42.803
And then that is another ammeter

00:04:42.803 --> 00:04:45.566
right over there, ammeter.

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:47.772
So these are going to measure current

00:04:47.772 --> 00:04:50.547
on either side of our lightbulb.

00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:55.547
So current measures current

00:04:57.738 --> 00:04:59.706
on either side.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.675
Or I could say measuring current

00:05:03.675 --> 00:05:06.677
entering and exiting lightbulb.

00:05:06.677 --> 00:05:11.677
Current entering and exiting

00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:18.333
the lightbulb.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.737
Entering the lightbulb,

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:25.737
or maybe I'll say exiting the bulb.

00:05:25.857 --> 00:05:27.691
We also care about the voltage drop.

00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:29.293
So we could put a voltmeter,

00:05:29.293 --> 00:05:31.336
and the voltmeter can be put in parallel

00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:32.881
with the lightbulb.

00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:35.911
So let me draw the voltmeter here.

00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:39.245
So I'm trying to draw it neatly.

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:43.169
So this is the voltmeter.

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.061
It's going to measure the voltage drop

00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:47.005
from one side

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.354
to another.

00:05:49.354 --> 00:05:50.971
Just connect this there.

00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:54.268
So this measures the voltage drop.

00:05:54.268 --> 00:05:59.268
Measures voltage.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.628
Measures voltage drop.

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:03.812
So I've drawn my diagram.

00:06:03.812 --> 00:06:05.612
Let's see, what else do I need to do?

00:06:05.612 --> 00:06:07.806
So they say describe an
experimental procedure

00:06:07.806 --> 00:06:09.047
that could be used to answer questions

00:06:09.047 --> 00:06:10.883
one and two above.

00:06:10.883 --> 00:06:12.729
In your description,
state the measurements

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.842
you would make and how you would use

00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:16.213
the equipment to make them.

00:06:16.213 --> 00:06:18.348
Include a neat, labeled
diagram of your setup.

00:06:18.348 --> 00:06:23.201
Okay, so I guess my description,

00:06:23.201 --> 00:06:28.201
I could say I'd put two ammeters

00:06:32.722 --> 00:06:35.397
in series

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:40.994
with bulb.

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:47.077
One before bulb.

00:06:52.494 --> 00:06:54.292
One after.

00:06:56.162 --> 00:06:57.981
If current same on both,

00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:59.630
then same number of electrons

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.150
entering and exiting bulb.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.862
If the current

00:07:07.084 --> 00:07:09.075
is the same

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:13.533
on either side,

00:07:18.102 --> 00:07:23.101
then electrons

00:07:24.696 --> 00:07:27.223
per second

00:07:28.134 --> 00:07:31.076
entering and exiting will be the same.

00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:42.583
If the currents are different,

00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:55.150
then the rate of electrons is different,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:00.150
then rate of electrons

00:08:01.616 --> 00:08:03.044
passing

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:07.943
are different.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.231
All right, so that's the first part,

00:08:13.231 --> 00:08:15.668
the first statement, to try to go

00:08:15.668 --> 00:08:17.769
for this first statement
for statement one.

00:08:17.769 --> 00:08:19.152
In one second, do fewer electrons

00:08:19.152 --> 00:08:21.370
leave the bulb than enter the bulb?

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.274
If the ammeters are
measuring the same current,

00:08:23.274 --> 00:08:24.329
well then you have the same number

00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:25.432
of electrons per second entering

00:08:25.432 --> 00:08:26.571
and leaving the bulb.

00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:28.428
If the ammeter measures
different currents,

00:08:28.428 --> 00:08:30.691
well then you've got different
numbers of electrons.

00:08:30.691 --> 00:08:33.093
All right, now for statement two,

00:08:33.093 --> 00:08:33.547
so let me write this,

00:08:33.547 --> 00:08:36.016
this is statement one.

00:08:39.922 --> 00:08:42.047
That is my procedure right over there.

00:08:42.047 --> 00:08:44.031
Now for statement two,

00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:46.331
statement one test I guess I could say,

00:08:46.331 --> 00:08:49.076
and then statement two test,

00:08:53.838 --> 00:08:54.951
I think you guys get the idea

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:55.579
by this point,

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:56.520
but I'm just writing it out

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.541
because you would have to

00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:59.619
if you were taking this AP test,

00:08:59.619 --> 00:09:04.619
I would say put voltmeter,

00:09:07.537 --> 00:09:09.336
I could lowercase voltmeter,

00:09:09.336 --> 00:09:11.793
put voltmeter

00:09:13.923 --> 00:09:16.553
in parallel

00:09:17.603 --> 00:09:20.123
with, let me write it out,

00:09:20.123 --> 00:09:22.590
with bulb.

00:09:23.954 --> 00:09:28.954
If measures voltage drop,

00:09:35.633 --> 00:09:38.623
or I could say if and only if,

00:09:38.623 --> 00:09:40.541
I'll say if measured voltage drop,

00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:44.628
then, how did they actually
phrase the statement?

00:09:44.628 --> 00:09:46.333
Let's see, does the
electric potential energy

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:48.610
of electrons change?

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.199
Then electric potential energy

00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:53.446
of electron changes.

00:09:55.565 --> 00:09:57.775
Did they say electric potential

00:09:57.775 --> 00:09:59.923
energy of electron changes?

00:09:59.923 --> 00:10:04.923
Then electric potential

00:10:06.702 --> 00:10:08.485
energy

00:10:09.362 --> 00:10:12.770
of electrons,

00:10:13.774 --> 00:10:15.620
I don't normally write this much,

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.675
changes.

00:10:17.675 --> 00:10:19.857
Otherwise, it does not.

00:10:19.857 --> 00:10:20.717
If no voltage drop,

00:10:20.717 --> 00:10:23.154
then no change in potential energy.

00:10:23.154 --> 00:10:26.330
If no voltage drop,

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:35.136
then no change

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:37.841
in potential energy,

00:10:37.841 --> 00:10:40.427
electric potential energy you could write.

00:10:42.638 --> 00:10:43.566
And there you go.

00:10:43.566 --> 00:10:45.296
That is part A

00:10:45.296 --> 00:10:47.340
where I've set up my neat diagram.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.117
I'm measuring the current entering

00:10:49.117 --> 00:10:50.555
and exiting the lightbulb.

00:10:50.555 --> 00:10:51.241
And actually, if you view it

00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:52.727
from the electrons point of view,

00:10:52.727 --> 00:10:53.865
this one is measuring the electrons

00:10:53.865 --> 00:10:55.583
going that direction,

00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:56.663
this is electrons entering,

00:10:56.663 --> 00:10:58.277
electrons exiting, but either way,

00:10:58.277 --> 00:10:59.205
the electrons per second

00:10:59.205 --> 00:11:00.067
would affect current.

00:11:00.067 --> 00:11:01.029
Same current?

00:11:01.029 --> 00:11:03.049
Well then you have the
same electrons per second.

00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:04.187
Different current, then you have different

00:11:04.187 --> 00:11:05.431
electrons per second entering

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.650
and exiting the bulb.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.786
This measures the
electric potential energy

00:11:08.786 --> 00:11:10.330
across the lightbulb.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.788
If you actually measure a voltage here,

00:11:14.788 --> 00:11:17.308
then that means that the potential energy

00:11:17.308 --> 00:11:19.653
is changing from one side

00:11:19.653 --> 00:11:22.567
of the bulb to another.

00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:24.365
And so I'll stop there.

00:11:24.365 --> 00:11:27.849
Then I will,

00:11:27.849 --> 00:11:29.243
well, actually, I think
I answered part B too.

00:11:29.243 --> 00:11:31.122
Explain how data from the experiment

00:11:31.122 --> 00:11:32.087
you described can be used

00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:33.689
to answer question one above.

00:11:33.689 --> 00:11:34.943
Explain how the data from the experiment

00:11:34.943 --> 00:11:36.023
you described can be used

00:11:36.023 --> 00:11:37.404
to answer question two above.

00:11:37.404 --> 00:11:39.888
So this was really parts A and B.

00:11:39.888 --> 00:11:41.107
So actually let me write this down.

00:11:41.107 --> 00:11:44.893
So this is A plus B right over here.

00:11:44.893 --> 00:11:45.844
We have the diagram.

00:11:45.844 --> 00:11:46.588
If you're taking the test,

00:11:46.588 --> 00:11:48.248
depending on how your time pressure is,

00:11:48.248 --> 00:11:50.024
you might want to label this more,

00:11:50.024 --> 00:11:50.988
but if you're running out of time,

00:11:50.988 --> 00:11:52.090
then you might not have time

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.801
to describe it in as much detail.
