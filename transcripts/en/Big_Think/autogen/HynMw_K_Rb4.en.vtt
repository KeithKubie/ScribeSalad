and sort of with the the information you
 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.780
and sort of with the the information you
know overflow that is that all of our

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:09.790

the better the more the more information

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.090
the better the more the more information
 

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.670
the better the more the more information
we have available to us the more
