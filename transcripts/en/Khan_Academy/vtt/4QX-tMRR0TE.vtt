00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.910
- [Instructor] The table below
shows the number of chickens

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.460
sold by four friends from January to March

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.750
except one entry is missing.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.760
What number should go in the empty cell?

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.120
So let's see, this is the
empty cell right over here.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.780
They haven't filled out how many,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.910
let's see, this is chickens sold,

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.580
so we don't know how many
chickens Michael sold in March.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.100
Well, we know how many he
sold in January and February

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.260
and we also know the total
he sold in the three months.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.370
So he sold a combined four plus six,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.790
he sold 10 in January and February.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.550
He sold 10 in January and February

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.680
and we know he sold a total of 11.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.520
So this 11 is really the sum
of these three right over here

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.960
so this right over here in
March has got to be one.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.610
He has got to have sold one chicken

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.060
because we see four
plus six plus one is 11.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.710
So let's check our answer.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.530
There we go, let's try this one.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.970
So here's the missing
cell and so once again,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.160
we just need to look at the total.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.130
The total is 107.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.720
So these four numbers right
over here and one is missing

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.270
you need to add up to be 107

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.330
for the solar panel
installations in Wyoming.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.210
So let's see, 32 plus 27 is 59.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.740
59.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.740
59 plus 26 is, let's see, 79, it is 85.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.940
So these three add up to 85

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.990
but they're missing this
one right over here.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.380
So this is going to have to
be whatever 107 is minus 85.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.040
So that is 22.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.340
22 solar panels in Q3
because if 22 is here,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.883
22 plus this, this and this
should be equal to 107.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.760
So we're missing how many
points Gabriela scores

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.980
in the first quarter right over here.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.020
Once again, we know that she
scores 35 points in the game.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.851
In the other three quarters,
she scores a combined,

00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:55.570
let's see, 10 plus 10
plus eight is 28 points.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.060
So if she's 28 in the other three quarters

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.720
and she gets to 35, 35 minus 28 is,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.520
she must have scored seven
points in the first quarter.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.760
Seven points.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.370
Let's do one more.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.220
So in Alabama, how many
solar panel installations

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.670
in the fourth quarter?

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.670
See, 33 plus 26 is 59 plus 21 is 80.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.570
So to get from 80 to 101,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.563
we need to get another 21
sold in the fourth quarter.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.473
We got it right.
