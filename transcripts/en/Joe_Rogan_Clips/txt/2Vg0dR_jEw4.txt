Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, but I think Pete, I'm Deborah tried DMT. Oh, I think he's too measured for that. Well, I think he would want to know. You know, maybe, I bet he's done a lot of shit. He does whatever he wants. Yeah, for sure. Czar. How many, how many checks do you think he's gotten? A stable? Well, I, I will tell you this, I truly believe this. I think that he does. He can just sit there and he has women flock to him. Oh, for sure. They love him for sure. The best looking woman in the world. He doesn't have to do anything. Right. This kind of power. My wife was like, he's, he's hot. Whoa. I go, but he's, he's a gangster. She goes, who doesn't like a gangster? Ooh. And I was like, Ooh, Geez. I had to walk away. I was like, oh, it's uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Steal your girl. Yeah, I'll take your girl. Yeah. Still your, your football ring here. But that know the story about fucking steroidal told me about this. He, uh, who was the football player where Putin stole his ring. Google that the owner of the Patriots wasn't him. It wasn't a player, it was just the owner of the Patriots. Is that the guy that craft that guy? Okay. So he had this a Superbowl ring on, he meets Putin. Putin says, can I hold the dream? You know, and then like takes the ring off, puts it on. It's like, hmm. And he said something like, you could smash someone's face with this ring. And laughed and then just walked off with the ring and they were like, Hey, uh, where's the ring? He's like, no, he just stole the ring. You know, Harvey Keitel really just took his ring money ring.

Speaker 1:          01:30          No, that's awesome. This murdering a dick. So he just decided he wanted it and took it off the guy's hand and was laughing and walked off with it. As the story goes crap hand to the diamond studded ring to Putin is a bit of show and tell I could kill someone to string. Putin reportedly said as he fitted to his finger. Then when Kraft held out his hand to get it back Pruett and surrounded by KGB agents, wordlessly slipped the ring into his pocket. Wow. News circulated quickly. The brain was not meant to as a gift, which prompted craft to issue this statement at the time. At the end of a very productive three hour business meeting with President Putin, I showed the president my most recent Superbowl ring, Kraft said, upon seeing the ring president, Putin, a great knowledgeable sports fan was clearly taken by its uniqueness.

Speaker 1:          02:11          At that point, I decided to give him the rings as a symbol of the respect and admiration that I have for the Russian people and the leadership of President Putin, Aka, I want to live. I want to love it. I dig this, this muttering. No, I do. I do have an admiration. I just think you think he's ever killed anybody with a ring? Uh, yes. Probably. He was the guy from beating people to death. George W. Bush administration had pressured him at the time to let go of the ring to avoid an international incident. Hilarious. Wow. In 2013 craft reneged and offered some backstory about the incident. A legging alleging that the Bush administration had pressured him at the time to let go of the ring. Wow. It would really be in the best interest of us Soviet relations if you meant to give the ring as a present craft or crawls the White House saying, I really didn't want to.

Speaker 1:          03:03          I had an emotional tie to the ring. It has my name on it. Kraft said, I didn't want to see it on Ebay, but maybe putting ms stuff, you know there's a language barrier, so he probably miss. Understood. Listen what he's saying. No, he didn't shut the fuck up. They will. You have Russian propaganda agent. There was a pause at the other end of the line and the White House voice repeated. It would really be in the best interest if you meant to give the ring as a painful, I'm putting a faith, bro. No, I'm saying shut down your podcast. He took that ring. He punked that dude and took his ring. It's not yet a thief. He's gangster. Yeah. It's out there pumping like Harvey Keitel to drop 124 diamonds. The Great Harvey Keitel. Yes. Tell me a story. I think it was him. They said, you know, remember the Akita?

Speaker 1:          03:47          What? No. Um, what's that? What's that fucking that left him. Nikita La femme. Nikita. Remember the actress in the TV show? Yes, I met her once. She was, she went to Russia. Candy Alexander. So tell ask. Okay, so she went to Russia with her boyfriend. The Putin likes her. He used to watch the show all the time. I heard this from, I think it was Harvey Keitel. He kept that dude out into another room and had her out on the balcony talking to her the whole time. And basically he, the guy couldn't get back in and it was very clear that Putin was making a play for La Femme, Nikita. And then it's like, you're in my town now. You go over there, take a seat. I know you came here and take a seat. I'm going to take what's mine. And apparently she was gone. I don't think she did anything, obviously, but you know, let's pretend she did right there.

Speaker 1:          04:38          It is. It is. And he dug her was, oh, Jack Nicholson turning around, Bro. [inaudible] boyfriend's not around. He's not there, Bro. He's not allowed to be at his table. You have legs for this. He was apparently locked out. He was like trying to get in the room and there was, sorry. We didn't know. Wow. It's kind of interesting when you see a guy running a country like that in 2019 that he can run the country in that gangster fashion more and saying that he got people to Sean Penn. Yeah. It's more interesting to me that he's gotten himself in a position where people would actually vote for. So it technically, he's been democratically elected.
