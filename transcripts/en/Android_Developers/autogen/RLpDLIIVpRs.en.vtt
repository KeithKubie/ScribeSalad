hackathon learnings we went to a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
hackathon learnings we went to a
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530
hackathon learnings we went to a
Stanford hackathon we learned a lot of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
Stanford hackathon we learned a lot of
 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.700
Stanford hackathon we learned a lot of
things that we were a little bit

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
things that we were a little bit
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.090
things that we were a little bit
ignorant about we realized that OS and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100

framework development is really

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
framework development is really
 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.679
framework development is really
intimidating there's a lot of work fewer

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
intimidating there's a lot of work fewer
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.800
intimidating there's a lot of work fewer
awards and essentially we came up with a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
awards and essentially we came up with a
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.800
awards and essentially we came up with a
solution that can help us get through it

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810
 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.850
you

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.940
so hello hope us you me know all right

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950
so hello hope us you me know all right
 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.310
so hello hope us you me know all right

so a tree hex was a weekend-long
 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.860

hackathon back in February and that was

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870
hackathon back in February and that was
 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.870

hundred and seventy kids who attended
 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.560
hundred and seventy kids who attended
and you can imagine there was some smart

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570
and you can imagine there was some smart
 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.750

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760
guys there there's applications from all
 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.390
guys there there's applications from all
over the United States so we had two

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400
over the United States so we had two
 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.390
over the United States so we had two
guys submit an entry using the signage

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400
guys submit an entry using the signage
 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.969
guys submit an entry using the signage
mop platform and you know we went there

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979
mop platform and you know we went there
 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.800
mop platform and you know we went there
and that's what we tried to do we I mean

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810
and that's what we tried to do we I mean
 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.340
and that's what we tried to do we I mean
we wanted to get people to hack on it

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350
we wanted to get people to hack on it
 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.490
we wanted to get people to hack on it
and so we had two entries here's the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500
and so we had two entries here's the
 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.460
and so we had two entries here's the
winner sian translate and these guys

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470
winner sian translate and these guys
 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.030
winner sian translate and these guys
built like they went from sinking the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040
built like they went from sinking the
 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.920
built like they went from sinking the
source to building it to adding a whole

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930
source to building it to adding a whole
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.870
source to building it to adding a whole
new feature in three days and we learned

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880
new feature in three days and we learned
 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.150
new feature in three days and we learned
that that's that's very that's a lot to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160
that that's that's very that's a lot to
 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.460
that that's that's very that's a lot to
do and a lot to kind of absorb in just a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470
do and a lot to kind of absorb in just a
 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.680
do and a lot to kind of absorb in just a
short amount of time so these guys had

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690
short amount of time so these guys had
 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.110
short amount of time so these guys had
basically just one day they spent trying

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120
basically just one day they spent trying
 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.420
basically just one day they spent trying
to get the source we bought some hard

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430
to get the source we bought some hard
 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.729
to get the source we bought some hard
drives to make it go by faster but I

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739
drives to make it go by faster but I
 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.640
drives to make it go by faster but I
mean signage and my source is you know

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650
mean signage and my source is you know
 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.770
mean signage and my source is you know
twenty five gigabytes it's going to take

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780
twenty five gigabytes it's going to take
 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.570
twenty five gigabytes it's going to take
some time and then you know they spent

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580
some time and then you know they spent
 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.949
some time and then you know they spent
the next day kind of getting familiar

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959
the next day kind of getting familiar
 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.600
the next day kind of getting familiar
with it with the build system trying to

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610
with it with the build system trying to
 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.940
with it with the build system trying to
figure out the different quirks and I

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950
figure out the different quirks and I
 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.110
figure out the different quirks and I
mean they didn't have that much time

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
mean they didn't have that much time
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.780
mean they didn't have that much time
left to code they maybe they didn't need

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790
left to code they maybe they didn't need
 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.449
left to code they maybe they didn't need
it to be honest and that that said

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459
it to be honest and that that said
 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.910
it to be honest and that that said
something to us so overall I mean we had

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920
something to us so overall I mean we had
 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.070
something to us so overall I mean we had
a great time helping the kids getting it

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080
a great time helping the kids getting it
 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.320
a great time helping the kids getting it
set up but we noticed that most of the

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330
set up but we noticed that most of the
 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.470
set up but we noticed that most of the
time we we weren't helping them with

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480
time we we weren't helping them with
 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.020
time we we weren't helping them with
like very Android specific things that

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030
like very Android specific things that
 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.310
like very Android specific things that
we were there for we're helping them set

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320
we were there for we're helping them set
 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.050
we were there for we're helping them set
up with the build system and just you

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060
up with the build system and just you
 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.550
up with the build system and just you
know weird little quirks and things like

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560
know weird little quirks and things like
 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.680
know weird little quirks and things like
that so this is their project I hope it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690
that so this is their project I hope it
 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.370
that so this is their project I hope it
plays

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380
 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.990
there

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000
there
 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.900
there
so what these guys did was they came up

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910
so what these guys did was they came up
 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.480
so what these guys did was they came up
with an honor fly translator they hooked

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490
with an honor fly translator they hooked
 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.100
with an honor fly translator they hooked
into cyanogenmod and they hooked up to

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110
into cyanogenmod and they hooked up to
 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.700
into cyanogenmod and they hooked up to
google translate and so they they work

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710
google translate and so they they work
 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.770
google translate and so they they work
sperm like the mms app and they're going

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780
sperm like the mms app and they're going
 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.970
sperm like the mms app and they're going
to show you how it works from the web

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980
to show you how it works from the web
 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.490
to show you how it works from the web
browser and they did this in like a span

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500
browser and they did this in like a span
 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:02.680
browser and they did this in like a span
of one day so next slide so we got a la

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690
of one day so next slide so we got a la
 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.300
of one day so next slide so we got a la
lot of feedback from these guys and it

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310
lot of feedback from these guys and it
 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.440
lot of feedback from these guys and it
was great um they love the open platform

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450
was great um they love the open platform

everything is on github they can go sync
they can go look at the code do we even

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380
they can go look at the code do we even
 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.199
they can go look at the code do we even
have some you know documentation that

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209
have some you know documentation that
 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.750
have some you know documentation that
helped them get started but it wasn't

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760
helped them get started but it wasn't
 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.600
helped them get started but it wasn't
enough but some of the some of the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610
enough but some of the some of the
 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.690
enough but some of the some of the
downsides that we saw was that I mean is

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700
downsides that we saw was that I mean is
 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.880
downsides that we saw was that I mean is
it took them way too long to get started

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890
it took them way too long to get started
 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.400
it took them way too long to get started
um and and that's something we took the

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410
um and and that's something we took the
 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.490
um and and that's something we took the
heart we want to fix this it's a huge

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500
heart we want to fix this it's a huge
 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.950
heart we want to fix this it's a huge
codebase that's 25 gigs of source then

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960
codebase that's 25 gigs of source then

you have another 50 when you're building

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400
you have another 50 when you're building
 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.719
you have another 50 when you're building
and then there's you know hundred plus

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729
and then there's you know hundred plus
 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.580
and then there's you know hundred plus
just you know packages you just have to

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590
just you know packages you just have to
 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.650
just you know packages you just have to
look at and this it's a ton of code and

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660
look at and this it's a ton of code and
 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.719
look at and this it's a ton of code and
the thing is this the barrier of entry

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729
the thing is this the barrier of entry
 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.659
the thing is this the barrier of entry
is just it doesn't have to be that high

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669
is just it doesn't have to be that high
 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.020
is just it doesn't have to be that high
and we really tried like we took this

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030
and we really tried like we took this
 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.480
and we really tried like we took this
feedback to heart and we went and we

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490
feedback to heart and we went and we
 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.590
feedback to heart and we went and we
asked her so we came up with these

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600
asked her so we came up with these
 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.969
asked her so we came up with these
questions on how do we improve this

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979
questions on how do we improve this
 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.830
questions on how do we improve this
experience we wanted to decrease the

experience we wanted to decrease the
 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.080
experience we wanted to decrease the

streamline the process and formalize it

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810
streamline the process and formalize it
 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.680
streamline the process and formalize it

we wanted to kind of stabilize our own

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460
we wanted to kind of stabilize our own
 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.219
we wanted to kind of stabilize our own
interfaces inside like if we wanted to

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229
interfaces inside like if we wanted to
 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.830
interfaces inside like if we wanted to
use our own features we could but you

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840
use our own features we could but you
 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.110
use our own features we could but you
know what if it kind of the versioning

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120
know what if it kind of the versioning
 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.460
know what if it kind of the versioning
is changed and what if we change

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470
is changed and what if we change
 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.620

so I mean this is the moral of story OS

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.090
any explosive burgeoning at that time it
also made Q a really horrible experience

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:09.100
also made Q a really horrible experience
 

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.800
also made Q a really horrible experience
because we couldn't set any testing

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:10.810
because we couldn't set any testing
 

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.270
because we couldn't set any testing
expectations based off versioning

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.280
expectations based off versioning
 

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.090
expectations based off versioning
releases and then honestly just horrible

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:15.100
releases and then honestly just horrible
 

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.950
releases and then honestly just horrible
rebased conflicts every single time a

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960
rebased conflicts every single time a
 

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.660
rebased conflicts every single time a
new version of Android came out we'd

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:18.670
new version of Android came out we'd
 

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.210
new version of Android came out we'd
have to go and pretty much replay all

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:21.220
have to go and pretty much replay all
 

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.370
have to go and pretty much replay all
the commits that created the service and

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:23.380
the commits that created the service and
 

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.500
the commits that created the service and
everything that came on top of it just

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:25.510
everything that came on top of it just
 

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.730
everything that came on top of it just
became way too much so with that we kind

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:29.740
became way too much so with that we kind
 

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.470
became way too much so with that we kind
of sat down and said how do we get

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:31.480
of sat down and said how do we get
 

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.420
of sat down and said how do we get
around this so we came about with a

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:33.430
around this so we came about with a
 

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.840
around this so we came about with a
Santa mount platform so it's a new more

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:36.850
Santa mount platform so it's a new more
 

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.640
Santa mount platform so it's a new more
approachable infrastructure and the way

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:38.650
approachable infrastructure and the way
 

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.620
approachable infrastructure and the way
it works is we kind of duplicate the

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:40.630
it works is we kind of duplicate the
 

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.400
it works is we kind of duplicate the
android framework so we essentially have

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:44.410
android framework so we essentially have
 

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.590
android framework so we essentially have
three components here the platform

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600
three components here the platform
 

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.720
three components here the platform
library a secondary resource package and

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:48.730
library a secondary resource package and
 

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.830
library a secondary resource package and
then it's statically linked OBO sdk the

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:52.840
then it's statically linked OBO sdk the
 

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.410
then it's statically linked OBO sdk the
platform library essentially you know

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:55.420
platform library essentially you know
 

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.270
platform library essentially you know
hosts all the system services that we

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:57.280
hosts all the system services that we
 

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.820
hosts all the system services that we
get spun up by the system server within

00:08:59.820 --> 00:08:59.830
get spun up by the system server within
 

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.710
get spun up by the system server within
Android so pretty much anything that

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720
Android so pretty much anything that
 

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.150
Android so pretty much anything that
does state management like the profile

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160
does state management like the profile
 

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.640
does state management like the profile
service or anything that we need to rely

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:05.650
service or anything that we need to rely
 

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.850
service or anything that we need to rely
on being there and interacting with is

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860
on being there and interacting with is
 

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.010
on being there and interacting with is
hosted and loads here but yeah we're

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:11.020
hosted and loads here but yeah we're
 

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.840
hosted and loads here but yeah we're
just leveraging androids powerful IPC

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:12.850
just leveraging androids powerful IPC
 

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.630
just leveraging androids powerful IPC
framework for that secondly that we also

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:15.640
framework for that secondly that we also
 

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.340
framework for that secondly that we also
have a resource package so if ever we

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:17.350
have a resource package so if ever we
 

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.470
have a resource package so if ever we
want to you know just even have like a

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480
want to you know just even have like a
 

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.880
want to you know just even have like a
system label that we're going to reuse

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:20.890
system label that we're going to reuse
 

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.670
system label that we're going to reuse
across applications we now have a very

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680
across applications we now have a very
 

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.130
across applications we now have a very
specific identifiers we can query those

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:26.140
specific identifiers we can query those
 

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.080
specific identifiers we can query those
resources with or drawables or anything

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.090
resources with or drawables or anything
 

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.690
resources with or drawables or anything
in between we can also declare our own

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:30.700
in between we can also declare our own
 

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.460
in between we can also declare our own
permissions that we carry on forward

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:32.470
permissions that we carry on forward
 

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.850
permissions that we carry on forward
without platform releases Oh yep but the

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:35.860
without platform releases Oh yep but the
 

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.920
without platform releases Oh yep but the
biggest point here is the platform SDK

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:37.930
biggest point here is the platform SDK
 

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.440
biggest point here is the platform SDK
so this is essentially you know Jar you

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:40.450
so this is essentially you know Jar you
 

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.510
so this is essentially you know Jar you
can just toss into your project these

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:42.520
can just toss into your project these
 

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.880
can just toss into your project these
are the stable interfaces that can

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:44.890
are the stable interfaces that can
 

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.740
are the stable interfaces that can
invoke the system binder calls and

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:46.750
invoke the system binder calls and
 

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.420
invoke the system binder calls and
you'll actually have access to these

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.430
you'll actually have access to these
 

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.700
you'll actually have access to these
features and this actually goes on a

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:50.710
features and this actually goes on a
 

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.910
features and this actually goes on a
rolling release schedule so we take this

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920
rolling release schedule so we take this
 

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.890
rolling release schedule so we take this
new platform we go back to the

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:55.900
new platform we go back to the
 

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.020
new platform we go back to the
hackathons recently we actually did

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.030
hackathons recently we actually did
 

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.510
hackathons recently we actually did
another event that's done by idea it's

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:00.520
another event that's done by idea it's
 

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.340
another event that's done by idea it's
called code rush and then we went down

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:02.350
called code rush and then we went down
 

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.790
called code rush and then we went down
to Mountain View for hack the planet

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800
to Mountain View for hack the planet
 

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.680
to Mountain View for hack the planet
which really smart kids there came up a

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:07.690
which really smart kids there came up a
 

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.280
which really smart kids there came up a
lot of cool projects and our feedback

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:11.290
lot of cool projects and our feedback
 

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.809
lot of cool projects and our feedback
was a lot different to sun

00:10:12.809 --> 00:10:12.819
was a lot different to sun
 

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:15.299
was a lot different to sun
it's consumable you know ease of use

00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:15.309
it's consumable you know ease of use
 

00:10:15.309 --> 00:10:18.329
it's consumable you know ease of use
gets tossed around our bottlenecks ended

00:10:18.329 --> 00:10:18.339
gets tossed around our bottlenecks ended
 

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:20.549
gets tossed around our bottlenecks ended
up just being logistics so we didn't

00:10:20.549 --> 00:10:20.559
up just being logistics so we didn't
 

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.929
up just being logistics so we didn't
have enough cm devices there and we

00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:21.939
have enough cm devices there and we
 

00:10:21.939 --> 00:10:23.340
have enough cm devices there and we
didn't have an emulator images which

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:23.350
didn't have an emulator images which
 

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.699
didn't have an emulator images which
we're working on currently oh yeah one

00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:26.709
we're working on currently oh yeah one
 

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.009
we're working on currently oh yeah one
such contribution we had from one of the

00:10:29.009 --> 00:10:29.019
such contribution we had from one of the
 

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:33.210
such contribution we had from one of the
interfaces readded is we allowed the

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:33.220
interfaces readded is we allowed the
 

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.009
interfaces readded is we allowed the
user or the developer now to create

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:35.019
user or the developer now to create
 

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:38.039
user or the developer now to create
tiles programmatically and one team who

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:38.049
tiles programmatically and one team who
 

00:10:38.049 --> 00:10:40.999
tiles programmatically and one team who
was creating a QR code application

00:10:40.999 --> 00:10:41.009
was creating a QR code application
 

00:10:41.009 --> 00:10:43.859
was creating a QR code application
essentially a Bitcoin wallet they said

00:10:43.859 --> 00:10:43.869
essentially a Bitcoin wallet they said
 

00:10:43.869 --> 00:10:45.299
essentially a Bitcoin wallet they said
it would be great if I didn't have to go

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:45.309
it would be great if I didn't have to go
 

00:10:45.309 --> 00:10:47.369
it would be great if I didn't have to go
access my app and go all my account

00:10:47.369 --> 00:10:47.379
access my app and go all my account
 

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:49.619
access my app and go all my account
settings and go find this QR code so

00:10:49.619 --> 00:10:49.629
settings and go find this QR code so
 

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:51.239
settings and go find this QR code so
essentially they just publish their QR

00:10:51.239 --> 00:10:51.249
essentially they just publish their QR
 

00:10:51.249 --> 00:10:53.579
essentially they just publish their QR
code to a quick settings panel go in the

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:53.589
code to a quick settings panel go in the
 

00:10:53.589 --> 00:10:55.859
code to a quick settings panel go in the
expanded mode and anyone can scan it so

00:10:55.859 --> 00:10:55.869
expanded mode and anyone can scan it so
 

00:10:55.869 --> 00:10:57.299
expanded mode and anyone can scan it so
it's things like this that we can allow

00:10:57.299 --> 00:10:57.309
it's things like this that we can allow
 

00:10:57.309 --> 00:11:00.719
it's things like this that we can allow
now Romans going to cover how to

00:11:00.719 --> 00:11:00.729
now Romans going to cover how to
 

00:11:00.729 --> 00:11:05.419
now Romans going to cover how to
actually utilize the SDK in your app so

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:05.429
actually utilize the SDK in your app so
 

00:11:05.429 --> 00:11:07.679
actually utilize the SDK in your app so
utilizing it is that is actually I had a

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:07.689
utilizing it is that is actually I had a
 

00:11:07.689 --> 00:11:10.679
utilizing it is that is actually I had a
good experience trying it the first time

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:10.689
good experience trying it the first time
 

00:11:10.689 --> 00:11:12.299
good experience trying it the first time
after everything was in place like it

00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:12.309
after everything was in place like it
 

00:11:12.309 --> 00:11:14.999
after everything was in place like it
was is just as easy as I'd hoped so all

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:15.009
was is just as easy as I'd hoped so all
 

00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:16.799
was is just as easy as I'd hoped so all
you need to do is fire up android studio

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:16.809
you need to do is fire up android studio
 

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:18.960
you need to do is fire up android studio
start up a new project and you're ready

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:18.970
start up a new project and you're ready
 

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:26.759
start up a new project and you're ready
to go you add so we have our version 2

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:26.769
to go you add so we have our version 2
 

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.229
to go you add so we have our version 2
point 0 is our stable release right now

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:28.239
point 0 is our stable release right now
 

00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:30.299
point 0 is our stable release right now
the SDK and to compile against that

00:11:30.299 --> 00:11:30.309
the SDK and to compile against that
 

00:11:30.309 --> 00:11:32.219
the SDK and to compile against that
version you would include the compile or

00:11:32.219 --> 00:11:32.229
version you would include the compile or
 

00:11:32.229 --> 00:11:33.840
version you would include the compile or
exercise wrong platform you hit version

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:33.850
exercise wrong platform you hit version
 

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.079
exercise wrong platform you hit version
20 we are on a rolling release the next

00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:37.089
20 we are on a rolling release the next
 

00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:38.909
20 we are on a rolling release the next
version will be 3 so if you want to work

00:11:38.909 --> 00:11:38.919
version will be 3 so if you want to work
 

00:11:38.919 --> 00:11:41.309
version will be 3 so if you want to work
against our development branches we can

00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:41.319
against our development branches we can
 

00:11:41.319 --> 00:11:43.619
against our development branches we can
do you can set that up in your

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:43.629
do you can set that up in your
 

00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:47.819
do you can set that up in your
build.gradle and now you can use the SDK

00:11:47.819 --> 00:11:47.829
build.gradle and now you can use the SDK
 

00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:49.439
build.gradle and now you can use the SDK
all you have to do is define the

00:11:49.439 --> 00:11:49.449
all you have to do is define the
 

00:11:49.449 --> 00:11:51.679
all you have to do is define the
dependency in your build.gradle and

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:51.689
dependency in your build.gradle and
 

00:11:51.689 --> 00:11:54.509
dependency in your build.gradle and
maven will pull it down sink it and you

00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519
maven will pull it down sink it and you
 

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:57.299
maven will pull it down sink it and you
can hit our SDKs so I'm going to jump

00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:57.309
can hit our SDKs so I'm going to jump
 

00:11:57.309 --> 00:11:59.249
can hit our SDKs so I'm going to jump
right into the code here of how to add a

00:11:59.249 --> 00:11:59.259
right into the code here of how to add a
 

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:03.149
right into the code here of how to add a
custom tile so this works very similarly

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:03.159
custom tile so this works very similarly
 

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:06.210
custom tile so this works very similarly
how you would post a notification so

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:06.220
how you would post a notification so
 

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.559
how you would post a notification so
when you think when you click a

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:07.569
when you think when you click a
 

00:12:07.569 --> 00:12:09.419
when you think when you click a
notification and intent gets fired and

00:12:09.419 --> 00:12:09.429
notification and intent gets fired and
 

00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:11.639
notification and intent gets fired and
so the first thing we do is we need a

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:11.649
so the first thing we do is we need a
 

00:12:11.649 --> 00:12:13.979
so the first thing we do is we need a
pending intent to wrap it and you can

00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:13.989
pending intent to wrap it and you can
 

00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:16.229
pending intent to wrap it and you can
see I'm creating a new intent there with

00:12:16.229 --> 00:12:16.239
see I'm creating a new intent there with
 

00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:18.509
see I'm creating a new intent there with
a custom action that I'll be listening

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519
a custom action that I'll be listening
 

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:22.139
a custom action that I'll be listening
for later on and I can respond to then I

00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:22.149
for later on and I can respond to then I
 

00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:24.779
for later on and I can respond to then I
use the custom tile builder to create

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:24.789
use the custom tile builder to create
 

00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:26.639

collapse after i click it for my
 

00:12:30.819 --> 00:12:33.150
collapse after i click it for my
specific use case and then the last

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160
specific use case and then the last
 

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.540
specific use case and then the last
thing is i can just tell the same status

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:36.550
thing is i can just tell the same status
 

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.069
