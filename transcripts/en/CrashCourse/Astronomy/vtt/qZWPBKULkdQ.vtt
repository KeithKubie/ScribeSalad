00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.840
As we’ve seen over the past few episodes,
a lot of really epic stuff happens when a

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.769
star dies. If the star’s core is less than
1.4 times the mass of the Sun, it becomes

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.610
a white dwarf—a very hot ball of super-compressed
matter about the size of the Earth.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.550
If the core is heftier, between 1.4 and 2.8
times the Sun’s mass, it collapses even

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.769
further, becoming a neutron star that’s
only 20 km across. The neutron soup inside

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.609
of it resists the collapse, and prevents the
core from shrinking any more.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.579
But what if the mass is MORE than 2.8 times
the Sun’s? If that happens, the gravity

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.900
of the core can actually overcome the tremendous
resistance of the neutrons and continue its collapse.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.870
What force can possibly stop it now?

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.399
It turns out, none. None more force. There
is literally nothing in the Universe that

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.100
can stop the collapse. The core of the star
is about to go bye bye.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.400
Way back in Episode 7 I talked about escape
velocity, and it’s about to become a major

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.270
player in the unfolding events of the collapsing
core of a high mass star. In brief, it’s

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.900
the velocity at which you need to fling something
off the surface of an object to get it to escape.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.070
For the Earth, the escape velocity is about
11 km/sec. Get something moving that quickly,

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.020
and it’s gone; it’ll never fall back.
The Sun, which has much stronger gravity than

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.420
Earth, has an escape velocity of over 600
km/sec.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.420
A neutron star, with its immense gravity,
can have an escape velocity of 150,000 km/sec

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.189
– that’s half the speed of light!

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.229
Keep that in mind, and let’s go back to
the collapsing core of the star. As it shrinks,

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.340
its gravity gets stronger and stronger. That
means its escape velocity gets higher and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.069
higher. When it’s neutron star-sized the
escape velocity is half the speed of light,

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.939
but if it’s more than 2.8 times the mass
of the Sun, the core will keep collapsing.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.259
When its size drops just a little bit more,
down to roughly 18 km, an amazing thing happens:

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.590
The escape velocity at its surface is equal
to the speed of light.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.340
And, well, that’s a problem, because in
our Universe, nothing can travel faster than

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.760
the speed of light. Not a rock, not a rocket,
not even light itself. Once the core of the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.629
star shrinks down smaller than that magic
size, nothing can escape.

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.590
No matter can come out, so it’s like an
infinitely deep HOLE, and no light can come

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.790
out, so it’s BLACK.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.010
We should come up with a snappy name for such
an object.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.730
A black hole is the ultimate end state for
the core of a high mass star. Whatever happens

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.650
in a black hole STAYS in a black hole. That
region of space, that surface around the black

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.840
hole where the escape velocity is the speed
of light, is called the EVENT HORIZON for

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.860
that reason. Any event that happens inside
can’t be known. It’s beyond the horizon for us.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.640
Black holes mess with our concepts of space
and time. The math and physics of black holes

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.120
is incredibly complex, so much so that even
after several decades of study, physicists

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.480
still argue over a lot of their properties.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.329
This has led to a lot of misconceptions about
them, too.

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.140
All right, let’s get this out of the way
right now: The Sun cannot become a black hole.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.959
It takes a stellar core at least about three
times the mass of the Sun to overcome neutron

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.920
degeneracy pressure. That means the original
star must have something like 20 times the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.500
Sun’s mass or more. So we’re safe from
THAT particular scifi scenario.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.129
Here’s another misconception: A lot of people
think of black holes as cosmic vacuum cleaners,

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.439
sucking in everything near them.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.549
But that’s not really true. They have powerful
gravity, yeah, but only when you’re very

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.920
close to one. The power of a black hole comes
from its mass, certainly, but just as important

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.430
is its SIZE. Or, really, its LACK of size.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.219
If you could turn the Sun into a black hole,
which you can’t, but let’s pretend you

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:53.959
could, then the Earth would orbit it pretty
much exactly as it does now. From 150 million

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.379
kilometers away, the Earth doesn’t care
if the Sun is big or tiny. We’re so far

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.079
away that it doesn’t matter.

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.150
It gets to be a big deal when you get close.
Remember, from episode 7 about gravity, the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.510
strength of gravity you feel from an object
depends on how massive it is and your distance

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.719
from its center. The closest you can get to
the Sun is by touching it, being on its surface,

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:20.230
about 700,000 km from its center. If you get
any closer to its center, you’re INSIDE

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.770
it. The material OUTSIDE of your position
is no longer pulling you down and so the gravity

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.460
you feel will actually decrease.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.840
But if the Sun were crushed down to about
6 km across it would be a black hole. You

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.250
could get much closer than 700,000 km to it,
and as you did you’d feel a stronger and

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.380
stronger pull as you approached it.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.180
So from far away, a black hole with, say,
ten times the Sun’s mass would pull on you

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.730
just as hard as a normal star with that same
mass.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.560
You can orbit a black hole, too, as long as
you keep a safe distance between you and it.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.380
Orbiting a ten-solar-mass black hole would
be just like orbiting a ten-solar-mass star…

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.880
except not so hot and bright.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.980
Black holes are weird enough without the misconceptions.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.570
Black holes also come in different sizes.
The kind I’ve been talking about has a minimum

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.870
mass of about 3 times the Sun’s, and might
get as high as a dozen or more times the Sun’s

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.970
mass, if the parent star was big enough. We
call these stellar-mass black holes. If it

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.670
happens to gobble down more matter, it gets
more massive, and the event horizon grows

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.230
as well. The black hole gets bigger.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.330
The idea that huge black holes could form
in the centers of galaxies was first proposed

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.370
in the 1970s, and it wasn’t much later that
the first one was found, in the center of

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.680
our own Milky Way galaxy. We’ve measured
its mass at a whopping 4.3 million times the

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.300
Sun’s mass! And now we think every major
galaxy has one at its heart, too, and in fact

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.820
may be crucial in the formation of galaxies themselves.
I’ll discuss those more in a future episode.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.340
Here’s a fun thought: What would happen
if you fell into one? Say, a stellar black

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.360
hole with ten times the Sun’s mass?

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.150
You’d die. But what happens in the few milliseconds
before you left the known Universe forever

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.800
is actually pretty interesting.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.680
As we’ve seen many times in our own solar
system, tides are important. They arise because

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.140
gravity weakens with distance, so a big object
like a moon gets stretched by its planet’s

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.980
gravity; the far side of the moon is pulled
less than the near side.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.580
A black hole has incredibly intense gravity,
so the tides it can inflict are serious indeed.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.660
They’re so strong that if you fell into
a stellar mass black hole feet first, the

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.700
force of gravity on your feet can be MILLIONS
OF TIMES STRONGER than the force on your head.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.910
Remember, even the meager tides of a planet
can rip moons apart. When you multiply that

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.660
force by a million, you’re in trouble.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.320
As you fall in, your feet are pulled so much
harder than your head that you stretch, pulled

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:49.120
like taffy. You’d become a long, thin, noodle,
kilometers in length, but narrower than a hair wide.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.250
Astronomers call this – and no, I’m not
kidding – spaghettification.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.450
This would happen pretty close to the black
hole, just a few dozen kilometers out. If

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.620
you fell in from a long distance, you’d
be moving pretty near the speed of light by

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.840
that point, and you’d only have a millisecond
or so before it killed you anyway, so yay?

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.930
Note that this is only for stellar mass black
holes. Supermassive black holes are far bigger,

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.250
millions or billions of kilometers across.
Compared to that size, the distance between

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.920
your head and feet is small, so the tides
across you aren’t nearly as severe. You’d

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.780
fall in pretty much intact -- if that makes
you feel any better.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.960
But compared to either flavor of black hole,
a star still has substantial size, and one

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:37.060
that gets too close to any black hole can
be disrupted via tides. In March 2011, astronomers

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.340
witnessed just such an event. In a distant
galaxy, a star apparently got too close to

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.920
a black hole, and was torn apart by the ferocious
tides. As the star was disrupted, it flared

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.860
in brightness, momentarily blasting out a
trillion times the Sun’s energy! That’s

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.780
how we were able to see it even though it
was several billion light years away.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.470
But I’ve saved the weirdest thing for last.
One of Albert Einstein’s biggest ideas is

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:06.030
that space isn’t just emptiness, it’s
an actual thing, like a fabric in which all

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:11.080
matter and energy is embedded. What we perceive
as gravity is really just a warping of this

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.360
space, like the way a bowling ball on top
of a bed warps the shape of the mattress.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.500
The more massive an object, the more it warps
space.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.520
Not only that, but space and time are basically
two parts of the same thing, what we now call

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.830
space-time. You can’t affect one without
affecting the other. Einstein calculated that

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:34.560
when a massive object warps space, it also
warps time; someone deep inside the gravitational

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.370
influence of an object perceives time as ticking
more slowly than someone far away from that

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.220
object. I know, it’s bizarre; we think of
time as just… flowing, and everyone should

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:50.959
see it move at the same rate. But the Universe
is under no obligation to obey our preconceptions.

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:53.980
Einstein was right (he was right a lot).

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.699
This slowing of time is stronger the stronger
the gravity of the object is. So your clock

00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:03.110
ticks a bit slower than someone far away from
Earth, for example. The effect is tiny, but

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.500
real, and we’ve actually measured it on
Earth with extremely precise clocks!

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.389
However, if you get near a black hole, the
effect gets a lot stronger. In fact, black

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:17.899
holes warp space-time so much that, at the
event horizon, time essentially stops! You’d

00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:21.660
see your clock running normally, and you’d
just fall in — bloop, gone. But someone

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.790
far away would see your clock ticking more
slowly as you fell in. And this isn’t a

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:32.120
mechanical or perception effect; it’s actually
woven into the fabric of space. To someone

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.980
outside looking down on you, your fall would
literally take forever.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.579
But then, they wouldn’t be able to actually
see you. The light you emit would have to

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:44.100
fight the intense gravity of the black hole
to get out, and to do that it would lose energy.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.060
This is very similar to the Doppler redshift
I’ve talked about in earlier episodes, and

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.990
is called a gravitational redshift. When you’re
right at the event horizon, just when an outside

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.670
observer would see your clock stop, they’d
also see the light coming from you infinitely

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.029
redshift! Your light would lose ALL its energy
trying to leave the vicinity of the black

00:10:02.029 --> 00:10:03.910
hole, and you’d be invisible.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.060
And from your viewpoint?

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.100
Buckle up, because this is...WOW.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:13.730
You’d see the universe speed up, and just as you hit the
event horizon, all of time would pass — all of it. And all

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.680
that light coming at you from the Universe
would be blue-shifted, becoming such high

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.180
energy that you’d be fried. But since you’re about to
fall into a black hole, you probably wouldn’t care.

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:25.430
See? Like I said…WOW.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:30.420
Black holes are so strange, with such fiercely
complicated math and physics to explain them,

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:35.029
that scientists are still trying to figure
out even basic things about them. For example,

00:10:35.029 --> 00:10:39.899
some scientists argue that the event horizon
as we understand it may not actually exist,

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:43.579
and that when you apply quantum mechanics
to black hole physics, you find particles

00:10:43.579 --> 00:10:48.279
can slowly leak out. We’re still new at
this, and struggling to understand what may

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:51.290
be the most complex objects in the cosmos.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.610
Black holes, as bizarre and counterintuitive
as they are, keep popping up from here on

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:00.329
out as we poke our noses into more and bigger
astronomical objects. While they may seem

00:11:00.329 --> 00:11:05.439
scary and weird — and let’s be honest:
they are — they have literally shaped most

00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:07.660
of the objects we see in the Universe.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.310
Today you learned that stellar mass black
holes form when a very massive star dies,

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.779
and its core collapses. The core has to be
more than about 2.8 times the Sun’s mass

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:20.279
to form a black hole. Black holes come in
different sizes, but for all of them, the

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:24.899
escape velocity is greater than the speed
of light, so nothing can escape, not matter

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:29.459
or light. They don’t wander the Universe
gobbling everything down around them; their

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:34.430
gravity is only really intense very close
to them. Tides near a stellar mass black hole

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:39.220
will spaghettify you, and time slows down
when you get near a black hole — not that

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.029
this helps much if you’re falling in.
