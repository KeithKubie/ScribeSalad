00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
Case study of the day: Olivia, she was a healthy
35-year-old woman.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.750
Until one spring day, when she got into a
bad bike accident, and suffered serious head

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.470
trauma. The doctors patched her up, but after
a couple of days in the hospital, she noticed

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.980
something strange was happening.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.690
Or, rather, something wasn’t happening - she
could no longer smell.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.150
Not the flowers in her room, not the nurse’s
rubber gloves, not even the horrible hospital food.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.400
In the weeks that followed, she blackened
a batch of cookies because she couldn’t

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.210
smell them burning. She couldn’t smell the
lilacs blooming, or her husband’s aftershave,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.089
or her car overheating. She drank expired milk
because she couldn’t taste that it had gone sour.

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:37.719
The world got a lot less interesting: eating
wasn’t very exciting, and Olivia started

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.099
getting depressed. Life felt sterile and unfamiliar.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.820
Olivia had anosmia -- a partial or complete
loss of the sense of smell (and with it, most

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.120
of her ability to taste).

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.940
This unfortunate condition is caused by things
as diverse as head trauma, respiratory infections,

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.429
even plain old aging.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.620
And I say “unfortunate” because, what
we sense informs who we are.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.409
But how we experience our six major special
senses all boils down to one thing: sensory

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.369
cells translating chemical, electromagnetic,
and mechanical stimuli into action potentials

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.630
that our nervous system can make sense of.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.350
This process is called transduction, and each
sense works in its own way.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.810
Our vision functions with the help of photoreceptors,
cells that detect light waves, while our senses

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.500
of touch, hearing, and balance use mechanoreceptors
that detect sound waves and pressure on the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.100
skin and in the inner ear.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.119
But our sense of taste, or gustation, and
smell, or olfaction, are chemical senses.

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.750
They call on chemoreceptors in our taste buds
and nasal passages to detect molecules in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.799
our food and the air around us.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.939
These chemical senses are our most primitive,
and our most fundamental. They’re actually

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.479
sharpest right at birth, and they’re so
innate that newborns orient themselves chiefly

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.399
by scent. They can not only taste the difference
between their mother’s milk and another

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.259
mom’s, but they can even smell her
breasts from clear across the room!

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.499
Tastes and smells are powerful at activating memories,
triggering emotions, and alerting us to danger.

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:02.599
They also help us enjoy the small things that
make life worth living…like pizza.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.360
All right, I’m about to perform a superhuman
feat and sit here with this amazing slice

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.210
of Hawaiian pizza WITHOUT EATING IT, so that
I can describe it to you how we smell things.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.450
So if it sounds like I’m going faster during
this episode, it’s not like I don’t enjoy

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.900
our time together; I just want to get to the
part where I actually get to eat the pizza.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.260
Now, the process starts as I sniff molecules
up into my nose. This means that for you to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.570
be able to smell something, the odorant must
be volatile, or in a gaseous state to get

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.880
sucked up into your nostrils.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.280
And yes, that means when you smell poop there
are actual poo particles up in your nose.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.680
The harder and deeper you sniff, the more
molecules you vacuum up, and the more you

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.780
can smell it.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.480
Most of these molecules are filtered out on
the way up your nasal cavity, as they get

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.480
caught by your protective nose hairs, but
a few make it all the way to the back of the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.870
nose and hit your olfactory epithelium.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.620
This is your olfactory system’s main organ
-- a small yellowish patch of tissue on the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.370
roof of the nasal cavity. The olfactory epithelium
contains millions of bowling pin-shaped olfactory

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.730
sensory neurons surrounded by insulating columnar
supporting cells.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.320
So these airborne pizza molecules -- many
of which are just broken-off parts of fats

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.000
and proteins -- land on your olfactory epithelium
and dissolve in the mucus that coats it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.120
Once in the mucus, they’re able to bind
to receptors on your olfactory sensory neurons,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.920
which, assuming they hit their necessary threshold,
fire action potentials up their long axons

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.660
and through your ethmoid bone into the olfactory
bulb in the brain.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.870
But here’s the wonder of specialization
for you: Each olfactory neuron has receptors

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.540
for just one kind of smell.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.840
And any given odorant, like this pizza, is
made up of hundreds of different chemicals

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.540
that you can smell, like the thymol of the
oregano, the butyric acid of the cheese, and

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.160
the acetylpyrazine of the crust.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.180
So, after each smell-specific neuron is triggered,
the signal travels down its axon where it

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.780
converges with other cells in a structure
called a glomerulus.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.370
This takes its name from the Latin word glomus,
meaning “ball of yarn” -- which is what

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.680
it looks like, a tangle of fibers that serves
as a kind of a transfer station, where the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.650
nose information turns into brain information.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.040
Inside the glomerulus, the olfactory axons
meet up with the dendrites of another kind

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.640
of nerve cell, called a mitral cell, which
relays the signal to the brain.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.090
So for each mitral cell, there are any number
of olfactory axons synapsing with it, each

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.470
representing and identifying a single volatile
chemical.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.430
As a result, every combination of an olfactory
neuron and a mitral cell is like a single

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.260
note, and the smell coming off of this pizza
triggers countless of those combinations,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.900
forming a delicious musical chord of smells.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.920
Now just imagine a piano with thousands of
keys able to produce millions of unique chords,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.260
and you’ll get an idea of how amazing our
noses are.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.150
Scientists estimate that our 40 million different
olfactory receptor neurons help us identify

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.310
about 10,000 different smells, maybe even
more.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.150
So, once a mitral cell picks up its signal
from an olfactory neuron, it sends it along

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.650
the olfactory tract to the olfactory cortex
of the brain. From there the pizza-smell hits

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.620
the brain through two avenues:

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.710
One brings the data to the frontal lobe where
they can be consciously identified, like oh,

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.240
melted mozzarella; while the other pathway
heads straight for your emotional ground control

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.760
-- the hypothalamus, amygdala, and other parts
of the limbic system.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.520
This emotional pathway is fast, intense, and
quick to trigger memories. If the odor is associated

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.360
with danger, like the smell of smoke, it quickly activates
your sympathetic system’s fight or flight response.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.780
That’s a big reason that Olivia’s anosmia
was so problematic -- without being able to

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.230
smell, she couldn’t access emotional memories
wrapped up in particular scents, or sniff

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.950
out dangers in her environment.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.460
And these same intellectual and emotional
dynamics apply to taste, as well. Because

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.860
after all, taste is 80 percent smell.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.610
As you chew your food, air is forced up your
nasal passages, so your olfactory receptor

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.050
cells are registering information at the same
time as your taste receptors are, so you’re

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.280
both smelling and tasting simultaneously.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.260
So, it’s true that if you have a bad cold,
or if you just hold your nose, your sense

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.260
of taste is impaired. But it’s not like
you can’t taste anything -- it’s just that

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.740
more subtle flavors involve more volatile compounds
that are picked up by your olfactory receptors.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.960
So you can hold your nose and taste that something
is sweet, but you wouldn’t be able to pinpoint

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.590
it as being carmelized sugar. Likewise, you
can taste that something’s generally sour,

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.919
but you can’t tell the difference between
a lemon and a lime.

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.680
When I read this script I didn’t think it
was going to be so difficult to do this, but

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.140
it is very hard and I am getting very hungry
and I would like to get to the part where

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.980
I get to eat the pizza!

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.480
We are at the point, everyone where I get
to--

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.420
So, as soon as I take a bite, all of the sensory
information in there is quickly sorted by

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.000
the ten thousand or so taste buds covering
my tongue, mouth, and upper throat.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.200
Most taste buds are packed deep down between
your fungiform papillae -- those little projections

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.690
that make your tongue kinda rough. You can
actually see them if you look in the mirror.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.889
Those papillae are not your taste buds.

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.909
Speaking of what and where your taste buds really
are, you know what I could go for right about now?

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:45.800
A DEBUNKING!

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.620
You’re probably familiar with those taste
maps of your tongue from elementary school?

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.440
Well un-familiarize yourself, because they
are bogus.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.140
Those tongue diagrams date back to the early
1900s, when German scientist D.P. Hanig tried

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.250
to measure the sensitivity of different areas
for salty, sweet, sour, and bitter. The resulting

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.980
map was very subjective -- pretty much just relfecting
what his volunteers felt like they were sensing.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.020
While it’s true that our taste sensations
can be grouped into sweet, salty, sour, bitter,

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.320
and the more recently recognized umami, the
notion that our tongues detect these tastes

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.480
only in certain areas is just wrong.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.790
By the 1970s research showed that any variations
in sensitivity around the tongue were insignificant,

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.199
and that all tastes register in all parts.

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:28.440
You can test this for yourself: put salt on
the tip of your tongue and you can still taste

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.620
it, even though Hanig’s map says you shouldn’t
be able to.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.820
Now, back to your taste buds.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.060
They’re actually tucked into tiny pockets
hidden behind the stratified squamous epithelial

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.100
cells on your tongue.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.750
Each bud has 50 to 100 taste receptor epithelial
cells which register and respond to different

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.220
molecules in your food.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.340
Notice that these are specialized epithelial
cells, not nervous tissue, so they still have

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:53.660
to synapse to sensory neurons that carry information
about the type and amount of taste back to your brain.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.580
These epithelial receptor cells come in two
major types -- gustatory -- or the kind that

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.880
actually do the tasting, and basal -- the
stem cells that replace the gustatory cells

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:04.429
after you burn them on a lava-hot melty cheesy
Hot Pocket.

00:08:04.429 --> 00:08:08.800
Basal epithelial cells are extremely dynamic
and replace the gustatory cells every week

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.300
or so, which is why even a terribly burned
tongue will feel better in a couple of days.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.760
Every gustatory cell projects a thread-like
protrusion of the cellular membrane called

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.479
a gustatory hair, which runs down to a taste
pore, a small hole in the stratified squamous

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:26.120
epithelium covering the taste bud and the
rest of the tongue.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.620
In order to taste a bite of pizza, those food
chemicals, or tastants, must dissolve in saliva

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.960
so they can diffuse through those taste pores,
and bind to receptors on those gustatory cells,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.580
and then trigger an action potential.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.959
And each tastant is sensed differently.

00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:44.369
For example, salty things are full of positively-charged
sodium ions that cause sodium channels in

00:08:44.369 --> 00:08:48.829
the gustatory cells to open, which generate
a graded potential, and spark an action potential.

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:53.100
Meanwhile, sour-tasting acidic foods are high
in hydrogen ions and take a different route

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.610
by activating proton channels.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.890
So taste, like all our senses, is all about
how action potentials get triggered.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.340
Once an action potential is activated, that
taste message is relayed through neurons via

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.709
the seventh, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves
to the taste area of the cerebral cortex,

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:11.910
at which point your brain makes sense of it
all, and begins releasing digestive enzymes

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:17.190
in your saliva and gastric juices in your stomach to
help you break that food down so you can use it.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.640
So. You know what I learned today?

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.540
I learned that it is incredibly hard to spend
ten minutes with a piece of pizza in your

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.900
hand, and only be able to take one bite because
you’re talking all the time.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.040
Incredibly hard. So I earned this.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.280
But you learned the anatomy and physiology
of smell, starting with the olfactory sensory

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.360
neurons, each of which contains a receptor
for a particular scent signal. After leading

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.440
to a glomerulus, these neurons synapse with mitral
cells, which go on to send signals to the brain.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.779
Taste begins with taste receptor epithelial
cells, rather than nervous cells, where tastants

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.580
bind to receptors that trigger action potentials to
four different cranial nerves that tell you: PIZZA.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.100
