00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.180
Congratulations on making it to lesson six. This

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.230
is the final lesson for the course, and we

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.170
brought in Facebook data scientist Saung Masin to share

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.890
with you some of his own work in EDA.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.350
&gt;&gt; In this lesson, I'll walk you through an analysis of

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.780
diamonds. You'll learn about the rich history behind the diamond market, and

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.420
use the EDA techniques that you've

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.892
learned to develop a quantitative understanding

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:25.820
of it. The ultimate goal is to build a predictive model of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.200
diamonds that's going to help you figure out whether a

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.730
given diamond is a good deal, or a rip-off.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.020
&gt;&gt; If you're in the market for a diamond, exploring this

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.430
data set can help you understand what goes into the price

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.470
of a diamond, and even if you're not looking to buy,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.790
the socioeconomic and political history of the diamond industry is fascinating.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.020
&gt;&gt; Diamonds gave rise to the mining industry in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.870
South Africa, which is now the most advanced economy in

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.390
the region. Diamonds also drove the British and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.320
the Dutch to colonize southern Africa in the first

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.520
place, and have driven conflicts ranging from the Boer

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.180
wars to modern day civil strife across the region.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.000
&gt;&gt; Now, you should have some experience

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.700
working with the diamonds data based on

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.640
the problem sets in this course. I'll

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.520
let Solomon guide you through his exploration.
