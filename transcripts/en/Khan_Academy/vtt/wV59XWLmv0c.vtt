00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.900
So this car right over here
is approaching an intersection

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.230
at 60 miles per hour.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.590
And right now, right
at this moment,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.420
it is 0.8 miles from
the intersection.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.450
Now we have this
truck over here,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.280
it's approaching the
same intersection

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.370
on a street that is
perpendicular to the street

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.980
that the car is on.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:30.090
And right now it is 0.6
miles from the intersection.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.720
And it is approaching
the intersection

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.000
at 30 miles per hour.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.820
Now my question to you
is, what is the rate

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.350
at which the distance
between the car and the truck

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.730
is changing?

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.390
Well to think about
that, let's first

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.848
just think about
what we're asking.

00:00:45.848 --> 00:00:47.500
So we're asking
about the distance

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.230
between the car and the truck.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.480
So right at this
moment, when the car

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.240
is 0.8 miles from
the intersection,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.510
the truck is 0.6 miles
from the intersection.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.700
The truck is traveling at
30 miles per hour towards

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.250
intersection, the car is
travelling at 60 miles per hour

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.220
towards the intersection
right at this moment.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.940
What is the rate at which
this distance right over here

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.610
is changing?

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.790
And just so that we have
some variables in place,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.610
let's call this distance s.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.540
So what we really are
trying to figure out

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.360
is right at this moment, what
is ds dt going to be equal to?

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.960
Let's think about
what we know that we

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.000
could use to somehow
come to terms

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.890
or figure out what ds dt is.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.100
Well we know the distance of
the car and the intersection.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.600
And let's just
call that distance,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.280
let's call that-- I don't know,
let's call that distance y.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.610
So y is equal to 0.8 miles.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.310
We also know that--
so let me write

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.760
this-- we know that y
is 0.8 miles right now.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.060
We also know the dy
dt, the rate at which y

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.590
is changing with
respect to time is what?

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.520
Well y is decreasing
by 60 miles per hour.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.240
So let me write it as
negative 60 miles per hour.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.090
Now similarly, let's say that
this distance right over here

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.700
is x. x is 0.6 miles
right at this moment.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.410
So we know that x is
equal to 0.6 miles.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.070
What is the rate at which x is
changing with respect to time?

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.982
Well, we know it's
30 miles per hour

00:02:25.982 --> 00:02:27.940
is how fast we're
approaching the intersection,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.770
but x is decreasing by
30 miles every hour.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.590
So we should say it's
negative 30 miles per hour.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.780
So we know what y is.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.530
We know what x is.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.710
We know how fast y is
changing, how fast x

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.860
is changing with
respect to time.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.710
So what we could try
to do here is come up

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.640
with a relationship
between x, y, and s.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.580
And then differentiate
that relationship

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.290
with respect to time.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.460
And it seems like we have
pretty much everything

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.580
we need to solve for this.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.460
So what's a relationship
between x, y, and s?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.380
Well we know that this
is a right triangle.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.240
The streets are
perpendicular to each other.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.270
So we can use the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.690
We know that x squared
plus y squared is

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.540
going to be equal to s squared.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.000
And then we can
take the derivative

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.440
of both sides of
this with respect

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.606
to time to get a relationship
between all the things

00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:24.070
that we care about.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.275
So what's the derivative of x
squared with respect to time?

00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:29.650
Well, so you're going to need
the derivative of x squared

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.770
with respect to x,
which is just 2x,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.950
times the derivative of x with
respect to time, times dx dt.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.620
Once again, just the chain rule.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.970
Derivative of something squared
with respect to the something,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.110
times the derivative of the
something with respect to time.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.304
And we use similar
logic right over here

00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:49.970
when we want to take
the derivative of y

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.480
squared with respect to time.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.670
Derivative of y squared
with respect to y,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.030
times the derivative of
y with respect to time.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.264
Now on the right-hand
side of this equation,

00:03:59.264 --> 00:04:01.180
we once again take the
derivative with respect

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.535
to time.

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:03.900
So it's the derivative of s
squared with respect to s,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.180
which is just 2s.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.580
Times the derivative of
s with respect to time.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.146
Once again, this is all just an
application of the chain rule.

00:04:12.146 --> 00:04:13.520
So now it looks
like we know what

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.840
x is, we know what
dx dt is, we know

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.339
what y is, we know
what dy dt is.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.910
All we need to
figure out is what s

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.860
and then what ds dt is, the
rate at which this distance is

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.540
changing with respect to time.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.010
Well what's s right now?

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.310
Well we can actually use
the Pythagorean theorem

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.810
at this exact moment.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.280
We know that x
squared-- so x is 0.6--

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.470
we know that 0.6 squared
plus y squared, 0.8 squared

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.500
is equal to s squared.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.270
Well this is 0.36, plus
0.64 is equal to s squared.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.980
This is 1, it is
equal to s squared.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.730
And we only care about
positive distances,

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.940
so we have s is
equal to 1 right now.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.719
So we also know what s is.

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:58.510
So let's substitute
all of these numbers in

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.140
and then try to solve for
what we came here to do.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.210
Solve for ds dt.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.240
So the rate at which, so
2 times x-- maybe I'll

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.225
do that in yellow--
2 times x, x is 0.6

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:13.660
so it's going to
be 1.2 times dx dt,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.600
so that's negative
30 miles per hour.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.770
So times negative
30 miles per hour,

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.420
plus 2 times y is
1.6, times dy dt

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.902
is negative 60 miles per hour.

00:05:27.902 --> 00:05:29.360
And I'm not writing
the units here.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.270
But if you were to
write the units,

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.510
you will see that all of
our distances are in miles.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.850
And all of our time
is within hours,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.350
so we're going to
get an answer when

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.604
we solve for ds dt
that's miles per hour.

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:41.020
But I encourage you, if you
want to, to actually write out

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.210
the units and see
how they work out.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.530
And so this is going to
be equal to 2 times s.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.190
Well, s is 1 mile, so it's
just going to be 2 times

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.460
ds dt, which is what
we're trying to solve for.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.050
So what do we get here
on the left-hand side?

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.230
So 1.2 times negative
30, that's negative 36.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.730
Right?

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.440
1/5 of 30 is 6,
yep that's right.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.710
And then 1.6 times
negative sixty,

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.420
that's going to be negative
96, is equal to 2 times ds dt,

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.930
is equal to 2 times
the rate at which

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.210
our distance is changing
with respect to time.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.840
On the left-hand side right
over here, this is negative 132.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.400
Negative 132 is equal
to 2 times ds dt.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.760
Divide both sides by
2, we get negative 66.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.640
And now we could put our units
if we want, miles per hour

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.650
is the rate at
which our distance

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.310
is changing with
respect to time.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.930
So ds dt is negative
66 miles per hour.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.785
Does it make sense that we
got a negative number here?

00:06:45.785 --> 00:06:48.720
Well sure, this distance
is decreasing right

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.211
at this moment, as they
approach the intersection.
