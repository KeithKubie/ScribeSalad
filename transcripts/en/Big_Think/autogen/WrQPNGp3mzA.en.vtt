greenest laptop ever made and all of
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.100
greenest laptop ever made and all of
that comes from looking at it from the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
that comes from looking at it from the
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.020
that comes from looking at it from the
screen backwards the screen is what

what we see and so if you can lower the
 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.950
what we see and so if you can lower the
cost of this screen and the electronics

have motherboards so the question was

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170
have motherboards so the question was
 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.710
have motherboards so the question was
how do you make a display that costs

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720
how do you make a display that costs
 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.150
how do you make a display that costs
less than a hundred dollars because

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160
less than a hundred dollars because
 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.670
less than a hundred dollars because
that's a real barrier to $100 laptop and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680
that's a real barrier to $100 laptop and
 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.980
that's a real barrier to $100 laptop and
what what do you do with the motherboard

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990
what what do you do with the motherboard
 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.300
what what do you do with the motherboard
it was very clear we had to get rid of

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310
it was very clear we had to get rid of
 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.360
it was very clear we had to get rid of
the hard disk right and moved to what we

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370
the hard disk right and moved to what we
 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.540
the hard disk right and moved to what we
call flash and use a smaller processor

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550
call flash and use a smaller processor
 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.680
call flash and use a smaller processor
skinny down the operating system and

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690
skinny down the operating system and
 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.970
skinny down the operating system and
also massively lower the power

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980
also massively lower the power
 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.710
also massively lower the power
consumption but that really came from

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720
consumption but that really came from
 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.750

choosing really noticing working with

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760

with with the the chip manufacturer I

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280
with with the the chip manufacturer I
 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.220
with with the the chip manufacturer I
asked them a question I asked him every

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230
asked them a question I asked him every
 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.080
asked them a question I asked him every
month for about six months and they

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090
month for about six months and they
 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.420
month for about six months and they
finally answered this question how much

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
finally answered this question how much
 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.060
finally answered this question how much
power does it take to just keep the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070
power does it take to just keep the
 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.550
power does it take to just keep the
screen on even if the pixels aren't

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560
screen on even if the pixels aren't
 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.890

changing well the answer was 223 watts

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900
changing well the answer was 223 watts
 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.259
changing well the answer was 223 watts
and at that point I had reinvented a

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269
and at that point I had reinvented a
 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.300
and at that point I had reinvented a
screen that was you know one watt

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310
screen that was you know one watt
 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.910
screen that was you know one watt
instead of usual a usual screen asst is

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920
instead of usual a usual screen asst is
 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.600
instead of usual a usual screen asst is
like seven watt power consumption and so

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610
 
 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.940
 
so I just thought that was stupid to

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950
so I just thought that was stupid to
 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.630
so I just thought that was stupid to
sort of keep a cpu on to you know

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640
sort of keep a cpu on to you know
 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.580
sort of keep a cpu on to you know

people you know I didn't know this is
 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.390
people you know I didn't know this is
going to be so technical I'm just

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400
going to be so technical I'm just
 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.759
going to be so technical I'm just
wondering how to do a technical talk to
