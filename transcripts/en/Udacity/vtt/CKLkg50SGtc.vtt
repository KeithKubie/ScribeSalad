00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.750
I'm here with Siya Raj Purohit who is
a program manager here at Udacity,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.372
managing the app
entrepreneurship degree.

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.293
Thank you so much for
talking to us today Siya.

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:08.830
&gt;&gt; Thanks, David.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.240
Good to be here.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.900
&gt;&gt; So, Siya is an experienced online
student as well as a manager of online

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.510
programs.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.209
So I wanted to start off by asking you,

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.717
what are some of the exciting new things
that are coming out in online education

00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:22.029
that some of our students might not yet
be aware of?

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.650
&gt;&gt; So a year ago,

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.490
Harvard Business School launched
a program called HBX CORE.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.030
So what is really interesting about
this, is that instead of disrupting,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.080
it's core business, which is they took
graduate students with an MBA degree.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.280
Instead, they're extending the pipeline,
by targeting students who

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.410
are undergraduates, or just before
the MBA stage, to teach them critical

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.200
skills in economics, business
analytics and financial accounting.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.210
So these are the three
classes that HPX offers.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.550
And it's a thee month program.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.590
It costs about $1,500 to $1,800.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.980
And students complete it
in cohorts essentially.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.050
So each cohort consist
of about 600 students.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.819
And they go through the program and
gain these skills.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.070
And then take a final exam
at a Pearson Test Center.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.170
So it's a pretty interesting experience,
and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.050
I just completed that,
about two months ago.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.560
&gt;&gt; That's very cool.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.990
It's interesting that, I think,
when online education first got started.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.955
And the reason why we have separate
modules in this course for

00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:22.329
online learning and MOOCs,
is that when online education really got

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.020
started a few years ago MOOCs
were really all the rage.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.597
And it was about these
giant open courses and

00:01:26.597 --> 00:01:29.080
we're just going to put it out there and
if we build it, they will come.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.420
But I think we're seeing more and
more of what you're describing of more

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.036
closed, somewhat gated programs, that
have a monetary cost associated with

00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:38.850
them and have some kind of
credential associated at the end.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.960
&gt;&gt; And we see the same thing at
Coursera and here at Udacity.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.780
Can you comment on the new initiatives
and those directions at those companies?

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.590
&gt;&gt; So finding that in putting courses
together is packaged like this

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.110
improved attention rates
across all companies.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.200
So HPX Core has
a completion rate of 85%,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.930
which is really high for
online learning.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.820
Maybe because of Harvard's name or maybe
because of the giant price tag, but

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.130
it's really working for these companies.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.710
And across MOOCs, the average completion
rate used to be between three percent

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.098
and thirteen percent.

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:16.553
And with nano-degrees, specializations
by Coursera, and the programs such

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:21.088
as HPX Core, they've gone up to between
60 and 80 percent completion rate.

00:02:21.088 --> 00:02:22.150
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.990
&gt;&gt; Which is much more,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.380
because I guess you get a degree
of certification at the end.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.830
Coursera specializations
are really interesting also.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.762
I've looked into the business
fundamentals one.

00:02:31.762 --> 00:02:34.930
The is providing
collaboration of Coursera.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.450
It consists of four courses and
the capstone project in the end.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.430
So what I really liked about it was the
capstone project was designed with 500

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.090
start ups, which was this
very cool incubator program.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.670
And it was like, an option you
need to page 500 start ups, or

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.830
start a problem your solving.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.730
However, what I didn't like about
the course was that all the, or

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.090
the program, was that all the four
courses were about big business things.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.390
So that's like, about like financial
accounting the big company or

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.030
like business analysis at a big company.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.290
And not like the start up kind of
problems you're trying to solve.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.390
As a start up you have no data,
you have nothing to like-

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.480
&gt;&gt; No finances, either.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.730
So, and it's a bit disconnected there.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.950
But I really like where
they're going with that, and

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.590
I think that with Vordan's backing,
it may get somewhere.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, University of Maryland
has one on that platform that's on

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.440
entrepreneurship as well.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.280
It actually has the exact opposite
thing, it covers all about funding and

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.120
startup issues.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.930
And basically, by the time that you're
in a company with 15 employees,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.550
speculation has nothing
to say about you,

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.170
it's all about getting
to that initial point.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.760
But why do you think there's
such a move right now?

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.900
I guess you already commented on it.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.680
The retention rates are higher with
these specializations or nano-degrees,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.720
what we do, XSeries on edX.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.700
Why do you think the retention
goes up when we have

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.750
those knit together programs as
opposed to the individual courses?

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.860
&gt;&gt; I guess because each of
the programs gives you a goal.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.520
HPX is trying to pitch that this is
preparing you for business school.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.890
And they have a huge pipeline of
students who are going to be actually

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.068
part of business school.

00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:08.350
Coursera is incentivizing students to
go through the Warden specialization.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.130
Just to get free Warden
application in the end.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.870
So those kind of
initiatives are helping.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.840
And of course you get
[INAUDIBLE] in careers.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.220
So we're trying to help
them get an expense for

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.910
careers, which is great, too.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.980
So I think those goals are great.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.700
And also, having a cohort system,
of students who are kind of encouraging

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.560
you, and also holding you liable
to complete, really helps, too.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I think we see a lot of that

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.910
in the LMS program as well.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.740
It's actually built in very many
ways around the same model.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.360
It's a credential at the end.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.430
It's some people who join the same
semester, and the semesters are long

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.860
enough that you kind of have
a cohort within the semesters.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.520
But I would be willing to bet, and in
fact we have evidence that suggests that

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.630
the courses on their own are,
they're nice,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.870
but very few people take them if there's
not that big credential at the end.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.782
There's something about that big
external motivator that, yeah,

00:04:56.782 --> 00:04:59.000
is the reason why people
go to traditional college.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.819
And it sounds like they are trying
to include that in some more online

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.293
education initiatives,

00:05:04.293 --> 00:05:09.010
even if it means compromising the
massiveness of these issues in the past.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.700
&gt;&gt; So, sometimes I was not very
motivated during the HBX Core program,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.460
because I have a full time job,
this is very difficult thing to do.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.320
&gt;&gt; I think we can all sympathize.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.680
&gt;&gt; Ten to fifteen hours
a week gets hard.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.120
So what encouraged me during
that time was my classmates.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.930
I became really good friends with
some of them and they would be like,

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.670
okay come on Siya.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.810
The deadline's two days from now.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.382
Let's get started [LAUGH] and
those kind of things.

00:05:30.382 --> 00:05:33.870
And also what HPS courted very
successfully that I think other

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.550
platforms are trying to emulate
is provided a social factor.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.300
So you can hear your
classmates' responses and

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.230
stuff as you go through the course.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.610
So, when they ask questions, and

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.000
then they direct questions to you,
it keeps you motivated to answer them.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So,

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.910
I think those two
components really helped.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.430
Do you have anything last you want
to say to our online students from

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.720
the perspective of either someone
producing online education or

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.010
a consumer of online education?

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.400
&gt;&gt; Yes, so
it's very difficult to complete courses.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.780
Especially when you
have other commitments.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.020
But I think everyone should
find at least one friend

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.220
in every class that they take to make
sure that the buddy system works and

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.150
everyone goes through
these courses together.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.580
I think that online
education will only work

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.200
if people get incentivized with
those kind of social interactions.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.090
So definitely find a friend and
get started on that.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.890
&gt;&gt; And as designers of ed tech also.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.250
Designing things in such a way,
that the people using your product or

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.980
using your tools, can connect with
others and possibly partner with them.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.570
Or even design tools that
explicitly facilitate that.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.230
So many of you might be interested
in computer supportive collaborative

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.060
learning, where you can actually
develop tools that make

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.570
this kind of collaboration at
a distance much more easy.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.800
I think one thing that's been very
empowering to me in this program,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.420
is that the online environment kind
of creates this 24, seven classroom.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.840
And because of that,
you always have people you can talk to.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.480
And you can always go to the classroom
and find someone to chat with.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.160
And building tools that can
enhance that even more.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.570
That could really improve what
we do in online education.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.540
So thank you so much for
talking to us Siya.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.090
&gt;&gt; Thanks David.
&gt;&gt; Thank you all for watching.
