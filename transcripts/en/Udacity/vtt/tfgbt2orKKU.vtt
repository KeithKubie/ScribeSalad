00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.530
All right, welcome back to,
Computer Vision.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.530
Today what we're going to do is,

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.350
we're going to, finish up,
particle filter, particle filtering and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.380
we're going to do,
sort of do particle filtering for real.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.650
We mostly enter, discussed it from
an algorithmic perspective and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.000
sort of how it maintains
density estimate.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.080
And we even looked at some robot
vision examples last time.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.220
You know, localization through
the Smithsonian and, and other things.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.170
And this time, we'll talk a little
bit about real vision and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.250
how you might do it.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.090
So if you remember this
Bayesian filter framework.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.500
We had to have sort of four
different elements, right?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.230
We needed a prior,
which nobody ever talks about.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.190
It's kind of the black
sheep of the family.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.540
A dynamical model or

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.870
an action model that says how we think
things change from moment to moment,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.830
based upon where they were and
the inputs that are provided.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.650
A sensor model, the likelihood
of a measurement given a state.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.770
And then we have this
stream of observations, and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.000
the question is what to do with them?
