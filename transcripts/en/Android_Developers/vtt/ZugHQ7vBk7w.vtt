&gt;&gt; CHRIS: Hi, I'm Chris and I'm interaction
designer with the Android project. Today,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.500
I'm going to talk about my favorite feature,
the Window Shade. The Window Shade gives you

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.610
access to your notifications. Unlike most
platforms, the Android platform allows you

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.050
to, not only see your notifications in the
upper left-hand portion of the screen, but

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.390
actually act on them using the Window Shade.
So for example, I've received an SMS message.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.429
I can just pull down the Window Shade and
automatically see, not only the SMS message,

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.180
but all of the items that have come in on
my device. I can see that I've downloaded

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.090
an application, received an instant message,
an e-mail, as well that SMS, and I can see

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.180
a calendar event is present as well. The difference
here is that these notifications are actionable

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.370
on the Android platform. So for example, I
can see that that instant message, I probably

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.900
should reply to that since thatâ€™s someone
I'm meeting with shortly. Simply tap that

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.820
message and start communicating via Google
Talk with that person.
