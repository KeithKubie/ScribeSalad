00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:10.981
The onset of cancer usually begins as
a solitary tumor

00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:13.559
in a specific area of the body.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.419
If the tumor is not removed,

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.528
cancer has the ability to 
spread to nearby organs,

00:00:18.528 --> 00:00:23.271
as well as places far away
from the origin, such as the brain.

00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:25.606
So how does cancer move to new areas,

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:29.804
and why are some organs more likely
to get infected than others?

00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:34.538
The process of cancer spreading across the
body is known as metastasis.

00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:40.151
It begins when cancer cells from an initial
tumor invade nearby normal tissue.

00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:41.718
As the cells proliferate,

00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:45.797
they spread via one of the three 
common routes of metastasis:

00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:49.660
transcoelomic, lymphatic, 
or hematogenous spread.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.996
In transcoelomic spread, malignant cells
penetrate the covering surfaces

00:00:54.996 --> 00:00:57.281
of cavities in our body.

00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:59.789
These surfaces are known as 
peritoneum

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.292
and serve as walls to segment 
the body cavity.

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:06.015
Malignant cells in ovarian cancer, 
for example,

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:09.707
spread through peritoneum, 
which connects the ovary to the liver,

00:01:09.707 --> 00:01:13.242
resulting in metastasis on 
the liver surface.

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:19.002
Next, cancerous cells invade blood vessels
when they undergo hematogenous spread.

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.845
As there are blood vessels almost 
everywhere in the body,

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:26.476
malignant cells utilize this to reach
more distant parts of the body.

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:30.946
Finally, lymphatic spread occurs
when the cancer invades the lymph nodes,

00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:35.258
and travels to other parts of the body
via the lymphatic system.

00:01:35.258 --> 00:01:37.588
As this system drains many
parts of the body,

00:01:37.588 --> 00:01:40.988
it also provides a large network
for the cancer.

00:01:40.988 --> 00:01:44.894
In addition, the lymphatic vessels empty
into the blood circulation,

00:01:44.894 --> 00:01:48.704
allowing the malignant cells to undergo
hematogenous spread.

00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:52.804
Once at a new site, the cells once again
undergo proliferation,

00:01:52.804 --> 00:01:56.708
and form small tumors known as
micrometastases.

00:01:56.708 --> 00:01:59.824
These small tumors then grow 
into full-fledged tumors,

00:01:59.824 --> 00:02:02.842
and complete the metastatic process.

00:02:02.842 --> 00:02:06.985
Different cancers have been known to have
specific sites of metastasis.

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:11.043
For example, prostate cancer commonly
metastasizes to the bone,

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:14.427
while colon cancer metastasizes 
to the liver.

00:02:14.427 --> 00:02:17.892
Various theories have been proposed to
explain the migration pattern

00:02:17.892 --> 00:02:19.733
of malignant cells.

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:23.068
Of particular interest are 
two conflicting theories.

00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:25.043
Stephen Paget, an English surgeon,

00:02:25.043 --> 00:02:28.708
came up with the seed and soil
theory of metastasis.

00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:32.458
The seed and soil theory stated that
cancer cells die easily

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:34.379
in the wrong microenvironment,

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.043
hence they only metastasize to a location
with similar characteristics.

00:02:39.043 --> 00:02:43.837
However, James Ewing, the first professor
of pathology at Cornell University,

00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:46.072
challenged the seed and soil theory,

00:02:46.072 --> 00:02:50.389
and proposed that the site of metastasis
was determined by the location

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.551
of the vascular and lymphatic channels
which drain the primary tumor.

00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:59.841
Patients with primary tumors that were
drained by vessels leading to the lung

00:02:59.841 --> 00:03:02.831
would eventually develop lung metastases.

00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:06.687
Today, we know that both theories contain
valuable truths.

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:10.449
Yet the full stories of metastasis is much
more complicated

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.810
than either of the two proposed theories.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.880
Factors like the cancer cell's properties,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.582
and the effectiveness of the immune system
in eliminating the cancer cells,

00:03:18.582 --> 00:03:22.831
also play a role in determining
the success of metastasis.

00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:28.098
Unfortunately, many questions about 
metastasis remain unanswered until today.

00:03:28.098 --> 00:03:30.877
Understanding the exact mechanism holds
an important key

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:34.211
to finding a cure for
advanced stage cancers.

00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:37.092
By studying both the genetic and
environmental factors,

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.714
which contribute to successful metastasis,

00:03:39.714 --> 00:03:43.140
we can pinpoint ways to shut down
the process.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.829
The war against cancer is 
a constant struggle,

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.550
and scientists are hard at work developing
new methods against metastasis.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.238
Of recent interest is immunotherapy,

00:03:53.238 --> 00:03:56.831
a modality which involves harnessing the
power of the immune system

00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:59.514
to destroy the migrating cells.

00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:01.226
This can be done in different ways,

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:06.767
such as training immune cells to recognize
cancerous cells via vaccines.

00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:08.824
The growth and activity
of the immune cells

00:04:08.824 --> 00:04:12.911
can also be stimulated by injecting
man-made interleukins,

00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:16.855
chemicals which are usually secreted by
the immune cells of the body.

00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:19.718
These two treatments are only the
tip of the iceberg.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:23.740
With the collaborated research efforts of 
governments, companies and scientists,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.636
perhaps the process of metastasis will
be stopped for good.
