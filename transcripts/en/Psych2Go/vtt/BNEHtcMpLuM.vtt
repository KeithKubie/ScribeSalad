Hey everyone, so my name is Lauren, and my
YouTube channel is Cosmo4confidence and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.070
you can seen my information below, to find
my own videos. But today I am doing for Psych2Go.net

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.140
To find out more about the discussion I'm
going to have today, go to the "Selfie Chronicles,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.090
It's Not That Bad", you can find the link below.
The author is Risha Maes. So, I'm sure many

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.870
people have heard about why selfies are bad.
I know a lot of people say: "Why are younger

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.390
people taking selfies because it's terrible
for you," but then you have people who are

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.710
younger than you, who say: "I love selfies
because I love taking a picture of myself

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.850
posting it online and seeing people compliment
me, basically." So what are the actual problems

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.100
with taking selfies? According to Dr Pamela
Retlidge, she did a study for the psychology

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.629
in taking selfies, and she stated that taking
selfies is detrimental to a person's mental

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.640
health in narcissism, low self esteem and
attention seeking behaviour. When I found

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.140
this article, at first, I completely understood
that, because the main reason why people take

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.790
selfies is to get that attention, to get people
to like their photo, to give them a compliment

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.960
and taking too many selfies as in a mental disorder,
but it does have characteristics of body dismorphic

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.010
disorder. Body dismorphic disorder basically
is the mental illness that involves, that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.369
one's own appearance is defective and that
it has a flaw and that other people can see that flaw.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.509
And I know many people spend sometimes
hours trying to get that perfect selfie, a

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.159
lot of people has this whole thing about them
that they want, a certain angle and what's

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.220
the perfect smile, what's the look you want,
and you end up taking a million selfies and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.329
you always try to find the perfect one. So,
what's the whole thing with this, is you are

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.049
trying to find the perfect selfie and most
of the time, say you had a pimple on your

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.229
face, you will do anything to hide that pimple
and you can do that with selfies, you can

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.930
angle it differently, you can edit the selfie
if you wanted, and it completely makes you

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.629
look at your own flaws and make sure that
you don't show them. There are good things

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.980
about taking selfies. I know sometimes I like
to take a selfie. I think I look nice and

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.629
sometimes I like seeing that people compliment
me, so you know, it's human. I think it's human.
