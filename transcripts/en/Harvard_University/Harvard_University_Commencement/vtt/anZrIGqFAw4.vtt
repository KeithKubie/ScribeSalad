00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.360
Good afternoon. My remarks at this moment

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.310
in our commencement rituals are

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.990
officially titled

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.740
"A report to the alumni." The first time I

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.460
delivered them in 2008 I was the only

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.460
obstacle between all of you and JK

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.470
Rowling. I looked out on a sea of eager

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.260
children, costumed Dumbledores, and

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.710
Quidditch brooms waving impatiently in

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.900
the air. Today you await Mark Zuckerberg

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.590
whose wizardry takes a different form

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.160
one that has changed the world and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.540
although he doesn't seem to have

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.540
inspired an outbreak of hoodies, we

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.270
certainly do have some costumes in this

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.850
audience today; I see we're now handing

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.670
out blankets. This is a day of joy and

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.509
celebration of happy endings and new

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.369
beginnings, of families and friends, of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.969
achievements and hopes, it is also a day

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.209
when we as a university perform our most

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:29.200
important annual ritual, affirming once

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.609
again the purposes that animate us and

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.380
the values that direct and inspire us. I

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.240
want to speak today about one of the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.999
most important and, in recent months, most

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:47.499
contested of these values. It is one that

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:50.249
has provoked debate, dissent,

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.380
confrontation, and even violence on

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.099
campuses across the country, and one that

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:59.319
has attracted widespread public

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.789
attention and criticism. I am of course

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.500
talking about issues of free speech on

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.439
university campuses. The meaning and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.720
limits of free

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.820
speech are questions deeply embedded in

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.000
our legal system. In interpretations of

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.469
the First Amendment and its

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.370
applications. I am no constitutional

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.849
lawyer,

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.569
indeed no lawyer at all, and I do not

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.849
intend in my brief remarks today to

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.629
address complex legal doctrines; nor

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.170
clearly can I, in a few brief minutes,

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.260
take on even a fraction of the arguments

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.400
that have been advanced on this issue.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.950
Instead I speak as one who has been a

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.669
university president for a decade in

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:56.510
order to raise three questions: first,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.469
why is free speech so important to and

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:05.959
at universities? Second, why does it seem

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.609
under special challenge right now? And

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.579
third, how might we better address these

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.000
challenges by moving beyond just

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.150
defensively protecting free speech which,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.400
of course, we must do, to actively and

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.489
affirmatively enabling it and nurturing

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.419
environments in which it can thrive? So

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.199
first why is free speech so important to

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.220
and at universities? This is a question I

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.689
took up with the newly arrived

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.150
first-year students in the college when

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.699
I welcomed them at convocation last fall.

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.329
For centuries I told them universities

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.979
have been environments in which

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:55.329
knowledge has been discovered, collected

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.150
studied, debated, expanded, changed, and

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.509
advanced through the power of rational

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:07.269
argument and exchange. We pursued truth

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.080
unrelentingly but we must never be so

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.640
complacent as to believe we have unerringly

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.120
attained it. Veritas is

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.580
inspiration and aspiration. We assume

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.370
there is always more to know and

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.300
discover,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.720
so we open ourselves to challenge and

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.100
change. We must always be ready to be

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.400
wrong. So being part of a university

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.470
community requires courage and humility.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.720
Universities must be places open to the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.010
kind of debate that can change ideas, and

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.870
committed to standards of reason and

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.560
evidence that form the basis for

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.280
evaluating them. Silencing ideas or

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.370
basking in intellectual orthodoxy

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.540
independent of facts and evidence

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.669
impedes our access to new and better

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.510
ideas, and it inhibits a full and

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.950
considered rejection of bad ones. From at

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.890
least the time of Galileo we can see how

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.850
repressing seemingly heretical ideas has

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.220
blinded societies and nations

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.639
to enhance knowledge and understanding

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.360
on which progress depends. Far more

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.600
recently we can see here at Harvard how

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.310
our inattentiveness

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.550
to the power and appeal of conservative

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.400
voices left much of our community

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.090
astonished, blindsided by the outcome of

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.350
last fall's election. We must work to

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.260
ensure that universities do not become

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.130
bubbles isolated from the concerns and

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.440
discourse of the society that surrounds

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.190
them. Universities must model a

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.440
commitment to the notion that truth

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.000
cannot simply be claimed, but must be

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.550
established. Established through reasoned

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.030
argument, assessment, and even sometimes

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.789
uncomfortable challenges that provide

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.390
the foundation for truth. The legitimacy

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.660
of universities claim to be sources

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.039
and validators of fact depends on our

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.729
willingness to actively and vigorously defend

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.390
those facts. And we must remember that

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.260
limiting

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.530
some speech opens the dangerous

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.260
possibility that the speech that is

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.480
ultimately censored may be our own. If

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.310
some words are to be treated as

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.210
equivalent to physical violence, and

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.510
silenced or even prosecuted, who is to

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.190
decide which words? Freedom of expression

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.920
as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.820
famously said long ago, protects free

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.180
thought for those who agree with us, but

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.220
excuse me, not only free thought

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.190
for those who agree with us, but freedom

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.390
for the thought we hate. We need to hear

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.420
those hateful ideas so our society is

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.550
fully equipped to oppose and defeat them.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.120
Over the years,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.490
differences about the implementation of

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.680
the university's free speech principles

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.030
have often provoked controversy and we

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.880
haven't always gotten it right. As long

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.170
ago as 1939, an invitation from a student

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.630
group to the head of the American

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.890
Communist Party generated protests, and

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.570
the invitation was ultimately cancelled

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.350
by the corporation. Bertrand Russell's

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.720
appointment as William James lecturer

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.030
just a year later divided the

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.150
corporation, but president Conan broke

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.930
the tie and Russell came. Campus

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.630
conflicts over invited speakers are

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.710
hardly new, yet the vehements with which

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.020
these issues have been debated in recent

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.140
months, not just on campuses but in the

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.230
broader public sphere, suggest there is

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.520
something distinctive about this moment.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.800
Certainly these controversies reflect a

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.790
highly polarized political and social

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.070
environment, perhaps the most divisive

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.120
since the era of the civil war. And in

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.810
these already fractious circumstances,

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.000
free speech debates have provided a

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.130
fertile substrate

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.560
into which anger and disagreement could

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.680
be planted to nourish partisan outrage

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.550
and generate media clickbait. But that

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.410
is only a partial explanation.

00:09:05.589 --> 00:09:08.089
Universities themselves have changed

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:11.180
dramatically in recent years, reaching

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.190
beyond their traditional largely

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.759
homogeneous populations to become more

00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:19.089
diverse than perhaps any other

00:09:19.089 --> 00:09:22.130
institution in which Americans find

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.180
themselves living together. Once

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.089
overwhelmingly white, male, Protestant, and

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:33.139
upper-class, Harvard College is now half

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:37.100
female, majority minority, religiously

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.940
pluralistic with nearly 60% of students

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.790
able to attend because of financial aid.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.959
Fifteen percent are the first in their

00:09:56.959 --> 00:10:05.209
families to go to college. Many of

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:07.730
our students struggle to feel full

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.390
members of this community: a community in

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.360
which people like them have so recently

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.829
arrived. They seek evidence and assurance

00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:21.890
that to borrow the title of a powerful

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.709
theatrical piece created by a group of

00:10:24.709 --> 00:10:27.769
our African-American students, evidence

00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:31.810
and assurance that they too are Harvard.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.390
The price of our commitment to freedom

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.290
of speech is paid disproportionately by

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.519
these students. For them free speech has

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:46.760
not infrequently included enduring a

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.490
questioning of their abilities, their

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.180
humanity, their morality, their very

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.200
legitimacy here. Our values and our

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.390
theory of education rest on the

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.459
assumption that members of our community

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:04.250
will take the risk of speaking and will

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.100
actively compete in our wild rumpus of

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.880
argument and ideas. It requires them as

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.120
well to be fearless in face of argument

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.560
or challenge or even verbal insult and

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.800
it expects that fearlessness even when

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.350
the challenge is directed to the very

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.570
identity, race, religion, gender, ethnicity,

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.779
sexual orientation, nationality, that may

00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:35.240
have made them uncertain about their

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.440
right to be here in the first place.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.920
Demonstrating such fearlessness is hard.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.959
No one should be mocked as a snowflake

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:50.380
for finding it so. Hard,

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:58.889
hard but important and attainable.

00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:01.629
Attainable, we believe, for every member

00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:05.319
of our community. But the price of free

00:12:05.319 --> 00:12:08.230
speech cannot be charged just to those

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.819
most likely to become its target. We must

00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:15.850
support and empower the voices of all

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.179
the members of our community and nurture

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:22.059
the courage and humility that our

00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:24.699
commitment to unfettered debate demands

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:27.759
from all of us. And that courage means

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:31.209
not only resilience in face of challenge

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:34.720
or attack, but strength to speak out

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.410
against injustices directed at others

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.910
as well. Free speech does not just happen

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.759
and require intervention when it is

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:49.420
impeded. It is not about the freedom to

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.910
out-shout others while everyone has

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.629
their fingers in their ears. For free

00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:57.819
speech to flourish, we must build an

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.769
environment where everyone takes

00:12:59.769 --> 00:13:02.860
responsibility for the right not just to

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.269
speak, but to hear and be heard,

00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:08.860
where everyone assumes the

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.170
responsibility to treat others with

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.829
dignity and respect. It requires not just

00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:17.740
speakers, but in the words of James Ryan,

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.519
Dean of our Graduate School of Education,

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:24.429
generous listeners. Amidst the current

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:27.249
soul-searching about free speech, we need

00:13:27.249 --> 00:13:30.369
to devote more attention to establishing

00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:32.649
the conditions in which everyone's

00:13:32.649 --> 00:13:36.990
speech is encouraged and taken seriously.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.029
Ensuring freedom of speech is not just

00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:43.269
about allowing speech; it is about

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:45.790
actively creating a community where

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.720
everyone can contribute and flourish; a

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.939
community where argument is relished, not

00:13:51.939 --> 00:13:55.149
feared. Freedom of speech is not just

00:13:55.149 --> 00:13:59.069
freedom from censorship, it is freedom to

00:13:59.069 --> 00:14:02.350
actively join the debate as a full

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.300
participant.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.699
It is about creating a context in which

00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:10.959
genuine debate can happen. Talk a lot I

00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:14.829
urged the class of 2020 last fall; listen

00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:15.519
more.

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:19.089
Don't stand safely on the sidelines; take

00:14:19.089 --> 00:14:21.970
the risk of being wrong: it is the best

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.329
way to learn and grow. And build a

00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:28.089
culture of generous listening so that

00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:31.120
others may be emboldened to take risks

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.110
too. A community in a shared search for

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:38.319
Veritas: that is the ideal for which

00:14:38.319 --> 00:14:42.129
Harvard must strive. We need it now more

00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:46.290
than ever. Thank you.
