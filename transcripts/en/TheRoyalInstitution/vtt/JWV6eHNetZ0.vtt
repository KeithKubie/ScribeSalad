Marilyn vos Savant. She's an American.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.940
She writes a regular newspaper column.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.440
And she's the world's most intelligent person.
She has the highest IQ in the world.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.860
And one week she showed her readers a puzzle
about a game show.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.100
[Game show music plays]

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.060
OK, who wants to come down and play "Don't
Get the Goat"?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.700
Young man at the back there, that's it. Stand
just over there.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.140
What's your name?
- Jeremy.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.640
Jeremy. OK, Jeremy, you're going to play "Don't
Get the Goat".

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.100
I'll explain it first.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.360
Behind these three doors, we have three prizes.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.100
Behind one of them is a booby prize of a goat.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.820
Behind the second one here.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.980
Behind the third one there, is another booby
prize, another goat.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.780
But behind one of the doors is star prize
of a red sports car.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.320
OK, it's a bit easy at the moment, so we're
going to shut them up again.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.860
I'm going to shuffle them around.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.700
Jeremy here is going to face away, look at
the audience.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.920
And all the kind people over here are going
to make sure that

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.940
although they can see exactly what I'm doing,
they don't tell Jeremy where the car is.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.820
OK, shuffle them around.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.420
Great.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.220
OK, you can look now, Jeremy.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.200
Now...

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.760
I want you to choose one of the doors but
don't open it yet.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.160
Choose a door, any door.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.740
That one?

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.340
OK, that's your choice, so I'm going to mark
it like that.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.520
Now I'm the game show host, I know where the
goats are.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.200
And I'm going to open one of the doors and
show you that

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.220
that one has got a goat.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.520
Now, you happy with that choice or would you
rather choose this door?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.160
Do you want to change your mind?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.960
Happy with that one.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.780
You're happy with that one.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.980
OK. Let's see whether you were right.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:37.420
[Game show jingle]

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.109
Yes!

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.659
So that time the contestant stuck with their
choice. They got it right.

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.769
But if we kept doing that, was that the correct
strategy?

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.049
Should Jeremy actually have done that?

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.239
Well, now what Marilyn told her readers was
-

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.239
in the long run that's the wrong thing to
do.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.689
It worked on that occasion, that's probability,
but it won't always work.

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:09.250
And here's her argument.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.049
The car could be behind any one of these three
doors.

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.189
Equal probabilities, one in three.

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.969
The probability it's behind that door is one
in three.

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.489
So when the contestant chooses that door,

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.560
there is a one chance in three that's the
correct door.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.319
Two chances in three that the car is behind
one of the other two doors.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.430
Now when the game show host opens a door to
show a goat,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.189
he knows where the goat is.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.190
If the car is in there, he's not going to
open that door.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.400
So there's still a two thirds chance that
the car's behind one of these two doors

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.799
and it's not that one so it must be that one.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.349
So what Marilyn said was - there's a 1 in
3 chance it's behind the door you first chose

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.120
and then because of what the host does,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.709
there is a 2 in 3 chance it's behind the other
door.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.089
So you should change your mind.

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.829
And yet you look at this and say, hold it,
there's two doors there.

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:17.190
Isn't it equally likely that the car would
be behind that door or behind that door?

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.739
What's the point in changing my mind, it can't
possibly make any difference?

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.040
Nevertheless, Marilyn was right.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.410
I'm going to try and convince you of this,
because it's not at all intuitive.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.870
So to do this, I'm going to exaggerate the
whole thing.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.970
I need another volunteer to come around here
and help me.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.660
Young lady there, you want to come around
and help?

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.550
OK.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.120
Come here, stand in here.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:51.570
If we're going to exaggerate this, we're going
to have nine goats, represented as cards.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.370
And one car, OK?

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.210
Do you want to just check? Lots and lots of
goats, one car.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.480
So I'm going to shuffle these.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.700
I'll shuffle them away.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.700
And then I'm going to lay them out.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:18.750
And I want you to try to choose the card that's
got the car,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.060
just slide it out there, don't turn it over
yet.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.320
Choose a card, any card.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.440
One of them might be the car. Pull it out.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.290
Which one? That one?

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.200
OK, there's your choice. What's your name
by the way?

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.200
Claire. - Claire.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.990
OK, so Claire's chosen that one.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.380
Here's the rest of them.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.520
OK, Claire, what's the chance that the car
is that card do you think?

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.320
There's ten cards altogether. - 1 in 10.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.400
1 in 10. Absolutely right. 1 in 10. 1 time
out of 10, that's the car.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.140
So 9 times out of 10 the car is in here somewhere.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.400
So if at this stage I said to you - alright,
pick one of those piles

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.170
and if the car's in that pile, you win, which
pile do you want?

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.800
That one. - That one.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.470
Right. OK?

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.960
Change your mind.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.230
I'm the host, I know some of these cards are
goats.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:28.210
So I can go through here and I can discard
a whole load of goats

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.140
and I can put the one that was left down there.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.700
So now, which pile do you prefer?

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.030
That one.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.490
Absolutely right.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:54.520
OK, Claire, thank you.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.090
We look at two cards at the end, just like
two doors,

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.450
and we say, unless we're careful, the car
is equally likely to be behind these.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.180
But you saw from the way those cards were
prepared that

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.150
there it's a 1 in 10 chance, there...

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.230
I very carefully selected and played around,

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.320
so there's a nine tenths chance it's in here.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.060
Now, for the game show we saw, it's the same
thing,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.550
but it's as if there are two goat cards and
one car.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.820
So in fact Marilyn is correct, the chances
are not equal for the two doors you're looking

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.820
at.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.919
And if you change your mind, in the long run,
you win twice as often as if you don't.
