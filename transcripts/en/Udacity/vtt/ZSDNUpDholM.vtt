00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.610
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Last time we got to know a little bit about the relationship between lines

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.737
and their equations. Specifically we talked about this idea of intercepts, which

00:00:07.737 --> 00:00:11.431
are where our line intersects either the x axis or the y axis. Let's look at

00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:15.351
this relationship a bit more. Here's the graph of the equation y equals 2x plus

00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:19.179
2. Now I know we don't much about the relationship between this equation and

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.232
this graph, but we're going to find out a little bit. So, from what you remember

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:27.189
from the last lesson, what's the y-intercept for this graph? Enter the numbers

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.490
for the coordinates here.
