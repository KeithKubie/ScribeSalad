Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from W N Y. S. C e n n. P. R. [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:11          Kind of the everyday routine. Ooh, ever dream of a life of romantic adventure. Yeah. Wanting to get away from it all. Yeah. We offer you escape

Speaker 1:          00:27          looking this way.

Speaker 2:          00:28          Escape is, I end the free you from the ball walls up today or a half hour of high adventure [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:37          Okay, so this is an old time radio show from the 1940s late forties I forget that called escape and always starts the same way. You know

Speaker 2:          00:45          we offer you as state,

Speaker 1:          00:48          that phrase, I love how they say it and here's what's great about this show and why it seems like a good way to start this show. Our show is it immediately after they say that phrase? Yes. They then present you with a scenario from which there seems to be no escape

Speaker 3:          01:02          [inaudible] hanging by your fingertips on the sheer face of a nice cliff. Like here's one suspended a thousand feet above instant death with your strength running out and with no chance for escape.

Speaker 1:          01:15          There's a million of them.

Speaker 4:          01:16          It's pretty, I brought a tiny chunk on the ground off the coast of Borneo.

Speaker 2:          01:21          You were lost in the London Park. You're a passenger for seven or eight and you're the subject of an experiment. After the age of aimless tear,

Speaker 4:          01:28          I can take the Blackman [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:31          Great. Oh wait, one more. One more just for kicks.

Speaker 4:          01:33          You're like, clapped in the remote valley of the Andrew Walden by here rock recommended around the new clothing and you is the band, the blind man to watch your eyes.

Speaker 1:          01:50          How could you not listen to that? What is better than like a story where the walls are closing and nonunion? Don't know what you're gonna do. What am I gonna do? What am I going to do? And then suddenly, or Skype, it's like the best story ever. That's true. So you're ready. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:05          This hour we offer you three bizarre scenarios to stories of people and planets writing yearning who, Hey, will they make it? And if they do, what are the scoping? Okay, enough of that. I'm Jad, I'm Robert. This is radio lab and uh, to start, let's talk about escape artists because why not, right? I mean, this is an escape show. Exactly. The most famous escape artists in history is probably Harry Houdini. And our first story is kind of a Houdini story. It comes from our producer pat. Yes. It's about a guy whose nickname is little Houdini. Right? Yeah. I heard this story from my friend Ben. Hello. Like months ago. Oh, your brother Ben, your journalism friend. My journalism trend. Yeah. I'm a reporter with the Tampa Bay Times in Florida, but our story begins

Speaker 5:          03:00          at the Tourney Center penitentiary and only Tennessee. That's where we caught up with little Houdini. He was between escapes. It's a couple of guards. Walked us into this huge cafeteria, sat us down at this little tiny table and brought out Chris, Chris Gay. That's his name. Yeah. Do y'all have, do you interview my brother and everything? Yeah, we talked to then come. Okay. Sorry. Yeah, I us, the first thing I noticed was he was even smaller than I expected him to be. He's going to be a little, you know, nickname, but uh, he was a very little Houdini short little maybe five. Five, yeah. One 41 30. His prison uniform was, was pretty baggy on him. He was wearing a white ball cap and uh, he's got a big smile stretched across his face.

Speaker 6:          03:45          Skype. I think it's, it's actually addicted, I think. Addicted. Yeah. I think it is, but I think what's addictive about it, it's, it's a way to, uh, it's a way to punch him in the stomach. Say, Hey, this can be done. I can do this. I might not have been new. Y'All might have told me I can't do nothing on my life. More people. I've told me that I know I can do it.

Speaker 5:          04:07          How many times have you escaped?

Speaker 6:          04:12          Probably about 13,

Speaker 5:          04:13          13, 13. 13 out of jail. Yeah. And unfortunate to Arthur King. I made all 13. I did a little research to see how that compares to other Houdini's and there are a few people who come close as far as I was able to find out. Nobody alive has that many escapes. Can we say pretty safely that he's the greatest jailbreaker alive. I'll go ahead and call them that. Yeah. So I got away from month pretty much without even asking. Chris began to list his escape. He has escaped every way you can imagine. Slip my hand, clip out. What the dire does, what out the band in between the [inaudible]. All my clothes upset my boxer shorts like handcuffs. He said picking a handcuff keys. One of the easiest things he's ever done. Sure enough, he's used everything from a pen spring to a safety pen. Yeah. Even once the zipper thing might Hank hippy out.

Speaker 5:          05:04          My zipper scrambled out windows, ran out doors, climbed over walls under walls, drilled through them. State suicide twice. Trick the cops by drawing up fake escape plans. Food their dogs by covering his clothes and pepper a pepper. Another time he didn't have any pepper, but he found some roadkill. They didn't smell like a scout and he rubs it all over his body to a racist scent. Pretty good at hiding it too. He's hitting the trees, jumped down at trap door that he cut the floor of his trailer. Once he hit a grave, I'll have the shallow grade beside a dead body. Another time. He ended up in a college campus someplace outside Atlanta and he hit out on top of an air duct for two days until the coast is clear. But one of the interesting things about Chris is that even though he's been doing this for 20 years, there's never a record of him assaulting anyone. No, I'll refuse to do it. Stole things. Pretty much only things to help him run are always refused to go in somebody's house hours, refuse to go in somebody's garage. He says you got rules from sales about how he breaks the law.

Speaker 7:          06:06          Almost like a coat. In fact, the story that got Ben Interested in Chris in the first place is kind of the perfect example of this.

Speaker 5:          06:12          This was a few years ago in 2007 and got a press release from the Florida highway patrol. Be on the lookout for, you know, Chris Gay, and according to the press release, here's what happened. Chris had been locked up in Alabama when he got a telephone call from his family. He said, my mom was a was guy. She had cancer, so he faked suicide, busted out of the prison transport van that was bringing him to the hospital, stole a truck, and just started driving home. Who's going to see his mom to pay his last respects and expect her to live there alone as he comes around the bend in the road to where his mom lives. He's driving a Walmart tractor trailer and he's got like a dozen cops on his tail. When I get Dan are run by, I run off the road crashes truck into a field near his mom's trailer. Jumps out of the truck. Yes it was. That was wrong. Told House. They start, they've jumped out of the cars and running. Told them and just before he makes it inside, they chase him into the woods and he disappears

Speaker 7:          07:03          without seeing his mom who would end up dying before he could see her.

Speaker 5:          07:09          Few days later, Chris turns up in Daytona beach driving a tour bus that belonged to crystal. Gale beat the country's thing ever. Yeah, he's still crystal Gail's tour bus in Tennessee and then drove it to Florida. Yeah. So you get this press release in and you think what? I thought, uh, how do you miss with a story like this? And so Ben writes a story for the newspaper, Big News, and pretty soon actually tour bus that normally carries TV news people on it took off. He's an escape artist and something of a folk hero. And soon crispy came something of a folk song. Literally the week Chris got caught at Grammy Award winning bluegrass picker named Tim O'Brien put out a song called the Dalat of Christopher Daniel. Daniel Gay, pretty soon of famous Hollywood director bought the rights to the movie. They were originally trying to get Johnny yet to do it. But it's perfect. You're the underdog making a run for it, for what seemed to dance. I'm going to be really good intentions. And part of me thought, you know, I mean this is awesome, but it's also, I mean there's gotta be

Speaker 7:          08:23          more to this story. Absolutely. Who's this guy really and why does he keep running

Speaker 5:          08:32          destination? You want to tell us where we're going. Going to Buckeye bottom road to talk to tare gay. A Tory is Chris, his older brother. He says he can tell us that whole story about how they grew up. Here we are. Chris grew up in a small trailer out in the middle of nowhere West Nashville. There are junk cars off

Speaker 7:          08:56          in the woods. Uh, when you, if I entirely hanging out with a couple buddies drinking two beers, I'll have any certain things you want to know about or anything. Or when we start talking about what it was like when they were kids. Now we lived in a little bitty trailer down there. He points off into the woods across the street on this land. It was Kristin, Tyree, mom and dad and a little brother named Eddie who went by cotton. And then there was Leanne lane gay, the eldest among his older sister cottons in jail. So we weren't able to interview him, but Leanne and Terry both told us that growing up in that trailer was hard. We grew up like mountain paving walkie, no, no electricity, no running water. Did their wash in the river wasn't only as much food around. I used to be a big field of plums. A big plum thicket would go down and woody, but you can't live on plums. And a lot of days we would be hungry. Leanne remembers they're lying in bed. One on nine. She couldn't go to sleep because her hunger pangs were so bad. And Tare said, here, this'll help Ya. And he ripped up and little dyeing a notebook paper gave it to Leann. He said, just chew it up real good and swallow it and it'll help. Yeah. And for Chris and his little brother at cotton, those were the good days.

Speaker 8:          10:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          10:07          because when my daddy and her separated, mom and dad got a divorce and the family split apart. Tardy. Leanne went to live with mom, Chris and his little brother Eddie, who are 10 and 11 at that point moved in with their dad and the dad, dad, he really wasn't, you know, I don't guess he just didn't know provider. He wasn't around very much. Oh, I mean, he was a deadbeat dad.

Speaker 6:          10:31          Yeah, he, he got where he, um, he would get off work on Fridays and he wouldn't come home for weeks at a time. He'd tell him to go if they was hungry to go steal from churches. Sometimes they'd hike through the woods into their grandfather's house. Their Mom's dad, who Chris says hated him and his little brother cotton. We would go down there and he would, he got where he started making us fight each other. And we could, if we first fought each other in the winter, got some deep. It's, you know, he, he was me. Maybe it was, that was their life beating each other up for food. He had go. He took his dogs on us.

Speaker 7:          11:03          So one night, one of them went and found their dad's rifle, an old 22

Speaker 9:          11:08          and a tube sock full of rusty bullets and went out behind the barn, uh, lit a tire fire and, uh, made a suicide pact.

Speaker 8:          11:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          11:20          cotton was going to shoot Chris in the forehead and then shoot himself. And Chris closed his eyes and cotton put the gun to Chris's forehead. Chris heard him whimper and he opened his eyes and concept, I can't do it. And Chris said, well, let me, let me, let me do it. He took the gun and he put the barrel to his brother's head and he couldn't pull the trigger either.

Speaker 7:          11:45          And they were 10 and 11 at this point. 10 and 11 man. And Ben says, if you take a step back, you can see that it's right about here at this point that Kristen has brothers start to steal, like really steal. And I started that, likes it on bicycles and then he went to a little, I guess four wheelers and motorcycles is all stuff with wheels.

Speaker 5:          12:04          Yeah. Chris remembers going with cotton to sit on a bluff. Yeah, it was on interstate 40. We would go a wash trucks of ice and they would dream about getting an a in a semi and driving [inaudible]. Then they went to a, I guess forwarders,

Speaker 7:          12:22          motorcycles and cars. And it gradually got bigger and bigger and bigger to one day. When Chris was 17, he stole a a

Speaker 5:          12:30          semi, didn't even really know how to drive it. But, um, I kind of decided the keys was in it, so I started it up from there. There's really no looking back. Can I pause you right there before you continue? Let me just name some modes of transportation and you tell me yes or no. What you've stolen a semi bulldozer. Yes. Skid steer, skid steer, tractor back coat, anything that's that flies. I actually got in a helicopter once and uh, we got in there, started flipping switches and we finally got it. We got the blight would rotate, but it was a little low low thing and got scared and got out of it. Point is this is his life for more than two decades. Even things that move, getting caught in, escaping, stealing things that move, getting caught and escaping until eventually he became bat guy on TV. Dany who had police on the run and six states.

Speaker 7:          13:24          But then when they, something happened that seemed like it might break this loop forever. He met a girl. Yes. Yes. Her name was missy. She was waiting tables at a little campsite diner. He thought she was cute and Missy, he's a smooth talker. I'll give him that. She liked the way he taught, taken right off the bat. And a few months later I got pregnant with my daughter and me and him moved in together and for a while life was really [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          13:55          We still had a little money in the bank and I was working good for Gregory instruction, had a good paying job, running it up bulldozer. And uh, I was actually going to school in Lebanon to get my CDL license. We had a nice trailer and it had a refrigerator. Did you like it? Yeah, I really, I really liked [inaudible]. Matter of fact, I was talking to my daughter last night. It came real close with my daughter. She remembers it like it was yesterday. He got her a dog. She named him blackjack first puppy. She ever got that right. There was the best moments in days of a diapers, days a month, I think for mine in his life I ever, but then things got complicated. The one day when Chris and missy were driving in the car together, we were going right through in the middle of Nashville and, uh, Chris says, look, I gotta tell you something. I stole something cause I stole the bobcat tractor from my

Speaker 7:          14:52          construction job and to make ends meet as soon as she heard that missy whipped her head around. And um, I like hitting with a big Mac right in the middle of Nashville and I just wanted a big man. Yes, Auntie ed. There was only funny for a little while, a couple of days later somebody told on me, I've got arrested. He stayed in jail for about two years and then escaped. I don't know how exactly, but before long he still again and ended up back in jail again. And um, and missy had stayed by his side again. She, she was determined he'd come home from these escapes saying, Oh, just tell you to being locked up. He did being away from you guys won't be a boy for my kids. And I didn't want to be away from me. [inaudible] got locked up. Missy would write him letters. I would send him money cause I work the whole time I was pregnant with my uh, 13 year old. What kind of work were you doing? Worked on a sand and line standard rocking chairs. Chris meanwhile was thinking about his next escape and when he came charging through the front door, thinking of roadkill, telling missy the again he had escaped. I stayed with him again.

Speaker 7:          16:00          But this time you guys started asking for check stubs on a weekly basis and add an hours up that he had been gone from time he left the house, which I would knock down riding time there in from you were keeping tabs on him? Yes I was. She even went so far as to take $5,000 out of the bank account that they shared by a trailer for them to live in one that wouldn't move. You know, I was trying try and more or less to make him do. Right. And it seemed like it was working. But then one night Chris came in after work and sat down in the living room with missy and their daughter to watch some TV next. I know we heard loud, beaten at the door. Well, you know, I jump up and he jumps up and um, uh, next thing I know he was, you know, moving that kitchen table and sliding it out.

Speaker 7:          16:44          Next thing I know, he raises the rug up off the floor and he jumps down in there and he says, cover it back up. So I cover it back up, put the table back and answer the door. And uh, they came in and they walked all around the house and uh, and they laughed. He bought this house to keep him still and he'd cut a trap door in it. Yep. He just stayed up on his father the whole time they were walking over top of him. Wow. Yeah. I guess it was more or less I was young, I knowed but I was also in denial. But eventually something happened that kind of forced her to admit just how bad things had gotten with Chris day before Halloween. [inaudible] owner daddy had went down to Walmart and she had picked out a little which outfit, but she was old enough and they don't, you know, she was for, you know, trickle trading for a four year old.

Speaker 7:          17:31          That was a big thing. The next morning it's Halloween. Her daddy looked at her and said, what baby? I'm going to work. Um, I'll say this afternoon, you know, I'll get home, we'll get you out outfit on you and we'll go trick or treating up in Nashville. And that afternoon, Danielle was sitting on the back step and then was just sitting there in a white tee shirt. And I asked her, I said, Daniel, what are you doing? How about no, my daddy get home mama? He says, we're going to go Nashville and we're going to go trick or treating. I said, okay, he'll be back in a little bit. And she sat there and she sat there and he never came home that night.

Speaker 7:          18:13          You, um, I don't really hear, like, I don't hear a lot of bitterness from, you know, is that accurate? Yes. Why? What? As far as me being upset with Chris or Hating Chris? Yes ma'am. Is that what you're asking me? Yes ma'am. How could you not forgive Chris? 18 years. That's how long I've known that boy and I have seen firsthand where he lived, how he lived. I'm a fighter and I go to church, my kids go to church. I learned to forgive people and Chris was, had a hard life. He needs help. Help that our can't give him

Speaker 8:          19:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          19:06          you saw it for a while that you could give him that help and yes it is.

Speaker 8:          19:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          19:15          I should have been there for my kids. Yeah, they took a lot of time on making this up. Yeah, no, Mike, you know what are done

Speaker 8:          19:22          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          19:23          so what do you make of this story, Pat? Well, somewhere along the way for Ben and I, this, this story really became about the symbol question. Can a person like Chris, you know, grew up the way he did? Can a person like that change or do you just never escape a childhood like that? People live with a how they grew up. Yes. Miss. She says if two kids and a wife that he loves, if we keep stopping, I don't know what Cam, but when we asked Chris, he said, it's in my mind. I'd only change it on our own. They're going to change. I'm working to change. Really? Of course he has said that before. Truthfully, what's different this time? What? What? You know? I'm going places I don't have to take, I've taken every one of them. I'm taking her anger. I'm taking how to be a better daddy. I'm taking everything about, if I were not a pro this month, I'm going to, I asked him, can I go ahead and complete another non-math problem? Wait, is he saying he's going to ask them to keep him in jail? Yeah. It's 20 years of running. He's asking the parole board not to let him go, which made me think, I don't know. Maybe. And Ben, what do you think?

Speaker 7:          20:32          I don't think there's any way that Chris changes. I think he's, you know, unfortunately doomed to stay in the cycle, which sucks. You know? I'm sort of ashamed that I have opinion. Why? I mean, why do you think you feel that way? I, I mean my dad was pretty similar to Chris in many ways. Really. My father abandoned me, uh, when I was, when I was a young boy. And, um, and I got reacquainted with him when I was a teenager. At that point. He was, um, a very sad alcoholic, uh, who often made big mistakes and I played high school football. And near the end of the, of the year, my senior year, they put out this highlight tape. So I took that highlight tape to his trailer in Slick Oklahoma. And after shooting a lot of Tequila, we sat down on the couch together and I put the tape in and we were watching, you know, watching me play football. And, um, not long into it. My Dad starts sobbing, just bawling, tears running down his face. And I look over at him and, uh, and he says, I wish I could have been there. And I wanted nothing more in that moment and today than to ask him, why weren't you?

Speaker 7:          22:09          And, um, I think in some way I get that opportunity in this job to ask my dad that question. Ben Says, his dad never answered that question. And after that day where they watched that football tape, nothing changed. Ben got Older, you graduated from college, got married, had kids and his dad never showed up for any of it. So he says when he's talking to a guy like Chris, in some ways I, I, you know, I'm sitting across the table from my own father, which doesn't give him a lot of hope. The only ounce of encouragement that I have honestly is if we find out that, that Chris has indeed when given the chance to get out of jail, said, no thank you. Maybe that gives me an ounce of hope. And a couple of weeks ago, Ben got a letter from Chris. Can you just say, can you read it for me? Yeah. Uh, he says, dear Mr. Montgomery, thank you for your letter. I'm doing well. I went up for parole and yes, I did ask them to let me go through the program. The final decision was to parole me upon completion of the program, listening to radio lab, radio,W , n, y, s, e, n, p, r, double e, every day routine. Woo. Ever

Speaker 1:          23:46          dream of a life of romantic adventure. Yeah. Wanting to get away from it all. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          23:53          We offer you escape.

Speaker 1:          23:57          Is this this way?

Speaker 2:          23:58          Escape the sign the [inaudible] walls up today, or a half hour of high adventure. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          24:07          okay, so this is an old time radio show from the 1940s late forties I forget that. Called escape and always starts the same way. You know,

Speaker 2:          24:15          we offer, you escape that

Speaker 1:          24:18          phrase, I love how they say it and here's what's great about this show and why it seems like a good way to start this show. Our show is it.
