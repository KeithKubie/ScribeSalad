JAKE: Steve Gargiulo works with
people from all walks of life,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.130
from all over the world, to help
them make their ideas happen.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.810
His new book, "Surge, Your Guide
to Put Any Idea into Action"

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.050
provides the blueprint for how
to take more action on ideas,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.070
sharing dozens of
stories, and distilling

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.510
proven instructional
design, social science,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.310
and adult learning theories.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.610
He loves, among many things,
Honest Tea, the movie

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.850
"Mrs. Doubtfire," and the
"Ghostbusters" theme song,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.560
which is, you know,
that's interesting.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.050
So let's give a warm
Google welcome to Steve.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.250
JAKE: Awesome.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.966
STEVE GARGUILO:
Thanks, Jake, cool.

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.340
Thank you all for
taking time out

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.130
of the day to be part of
this conversation today.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.220
I want to talk for maybe
like 10 to 12 minutes.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.260
And then we can have a
conversation from there,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.340
because I think that's
more interesting.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.420
So I want to start with
something that I love.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.320
And I love Post It Notes.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.260
So maybe a lot of you
spend a lot of time

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.160
using Post It Notes.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.760
I feel like I spend a lot
of time using Post It Notes.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.770
But they have a lot
of interesting uses

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.460
that maybe you're
not used to seeing.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.510
So you can use them
to decorate an office.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.202
You can use them as sunscreen.

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:19.160
You can use them for a
really kicking winter is

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.590
coming Game of Thrones party.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.840
You could teach someone a
lesson who parked in a space

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.060
that maybe he shouldn't
have parked in.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.150
And it turns out that apparently
you can even use them as cheese

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.830
if you're really in a bind.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.460
So as someone who loves Post
It Notes, a few years ago

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.349
when I was at
South by Southwest,

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:38.390
I was walking around one
of the exhibition areas.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.130
And 3M was there.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.682
And they had these
really big Post

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:43.640
It Notes that they had
debuted, those ones that

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.470
are bigger than the
size of the human head.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.150
And I had never
seen those before.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.830
And they were giving
them away for free.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.760
So I was, like, I want to get
a lot of these, like, a lot.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.730
So I walked up, and I kind
of took a bunch of stacks.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.980
And I'm walking with
my friend to a bar,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.660
and we're figuring
out OK, what are

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.160
we going to do with all these
big Post It Notes that we just

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.790
acquired?

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.850
So we decided to just
write on one of these Post

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.840
It Notes, "free problem
solving, #zeroproblems.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.354
And we're sitting at a
bar that's looking outside

00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:12.020
into the street.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.779
We just put the sign up, and
we started accosting people

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.070
as they walked down the street.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.170
So we have our little, kind
of free problem solving stand.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.128
And we're, like, hey,
whatever your problem is,

00:02:20.128 --> 00:02:21.950
horseback riding,
welding, business, you

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.480
know, you name your problem.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.680
We'll solve it for you.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.830
And at first, there's a
couple of people, like,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.499
does my shirt fit well?

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.040
We're, like, well,
you could do this.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.497
Or someone is, like, can I
get a light bulb for this?

00:02:33.497 --> 00:02:34.580
And we found a light bulb.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.450
But then, all of a sudden,
this big line started forming.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.380
And there's this
girl who's, like,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.370
can I solve problems with you?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.510
And it's, like, so then she's
solving problems with us.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.269
We had an intern who was getting
people a couple of blocks down.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.060
All of a sudden, the
big South By accounts,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.360
like this Shit I Saw at South
by Southwest is a big account,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.450
and so it turns into this
whole thing of all these people

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.460
who are coming getting
their problems solved.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.700
This woman, who it turns out,
she's an executive of Goodwill,

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.010
she's how can we grow our brand.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.714
It's, like, you have,
like, 500 stores.

00:03:05.714 --> 00:03:07.130
How could you not
grow your brand?

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.624
At one store,
triple your prices.

00:03:08.624 --> 00:03:10.040
At one store, offer
gift wrapping.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.370
At one store, have
a co-working space.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.286
She's, like, writing
down all of these things.

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:15.620
She's, like, can you come
and give us more ideas?

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.230
It's, like, I just
gave you 10 ideas.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.874
Go do those, and then
maybe we can talk.

00:03:20.874 --> 00:03:23.540
But one of the crazy things that
I learned from this experience,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.550
and there was a lot
of crazy things.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.790
We actually left.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.070
The thing kept going.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.224
It turned into a whole,
kind of big thing.

00:03:30.224 --> 00:03:32.390
But one of the things I
learned from that experience

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.230
is that people seem to
value collecting good ideas

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.010
more than they do actually
making any of them happen,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.510
right?

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.300
And we're all guilty of
this from time to time.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.950
We have those ideas
that we're collecting.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.220
We're collecting those
really good ideas

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.590
in the back of our heads.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.489
But sometimes it can be really
hard to make them happen.

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.030
And so I think one
of the things that

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.780
made something like this happen
was the fact that we're just,

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.580
like, hey, we've got
some Post It Notes.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.080
Let's just try something.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.110
And we had that
bias towards action,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.840
as opposed to the first
thing being, let's

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.630
talk about what we could do, or
let's brainstorm, or let's use

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.280
the Post It Notes to
come up with ideas

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.100
for things we could do.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.770
It's, like, we just
started doing something

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.061
with that bias towards action,
where the first step can

00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:15.260
be action, and then you think
about from there kind of what

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.380
comes next.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.579
You know, I spend a lot
of time, unfortunately,

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.340
in rooms like this with
a ton of Post It Notes.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.500
Who's been in rooms
like this before, right?

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.050
But who's been in a room like
this, and then a week later,

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.030
you wonder what the
hell ever happened

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.240
to any of those things?

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.800
Look how many Post It Notes.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.760
What happened to any
of those Post It Notes?

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.370
What happened to
any of those things?

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.716
And so it's a real problem,
us not having that bias

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:45.340
towards action.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.980
But it's something that
we can do something about.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.380
So this idea of a
surge and what we

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.270
define in the book is, like
Jake said, one of the things

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.830
that I've spent a lot of time
in is in the Ted community.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.280
And so as a Ted
organizer and speaker,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.311
one of the things that happens
is you become this idea magnet.

00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:04.810
And all these people
come in to you,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.870
talking to you about their
ideas, which is great.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.626
But over time, I
realized so few people,

00:05:09.626 --> 00:05:11.500
like in many of these
examples, so few people

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.180
were taking action on them.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.820
And so I started to study
the science of action.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.420
So working with psychologists,
sociologists, anthropologists,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.830
drill sergeants, what are
those important things?

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.510
And one of the most
important things

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.451
is taking that surge
of action right away.

00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:26.950
Because most of the time, what
happens when you have an idea

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.690
is this top bar, right?

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.860
You have this new idea.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.650
And then maybe
slowly, over time,

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.089
you slowly start to make
a little bit of progress.

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:36.880
But the most important
thing, if you really

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.280
want to see an idea happen
is take a surge of action

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.150
right away.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.872
And the first step should be
action and doing something,

00:05:42.872 --> 00:05:44.830
and that's how you start
to create the momentum

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.996
and get on a roll to actually
make something happen,

00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:49.779
to actually bring an
idea into reality.

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.820
I want to tell a couple
of stories from the book.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.579
So the book is filled
mostly with what

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:56.620
I think are fairly funny
stories, because they're

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.730
very relatable.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.146
Because they're
the kind of things

00:05:59.146 --> 00:06:01.510
that make you go I should
have done that or I

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.030
could do that with eight
million different things.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.587
OK, so one starts with these
pink flamingo pool rafts.

00:06:07.587 --> 00:06:08.920
Who's ever been on one of these?

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.040
Or one starts with these, excuse
me, white dove pool rafts.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.440
Who's ever been at a pool
party with one of these?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.406
They're pretty cool.

00:06:15.406 --> 00:06:16.780
So a few years
ago, there's a guy

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.090
who's at a pool party with
these white dove pool rafts.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.350
And he's, like,
wouldn't it be cool

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.183
if there's a pink
flamingo version of these?

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:25.430
So he googles it, and at
the time, there wasn't one.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.610
And most people would just
kind of leave it there.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.000
But he decides, you know what?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.930
Let me just google
China manufacturer.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.930
He finds a phone number.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.513
He gets on it.

00:06:32.513 --> 00:06:34.180
He's, like, hey, China.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.460
I want a pink flamingo raft.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.450
I want it to look like this,
whatever, blah, blah, blah.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.430
Eight weeks later, it
shows up at his house.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.100
He has a pool party with
his pink flamingo pool raft.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.340
Everybody loves it.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.230
He starts GiantFlamingo.com.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.950
This guy has made over
six figures selling

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.600
these pink flamingo pool rafts.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.120
Because in that moment,
he didn't just say,

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.950
this would be a cool
thing to do someday.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.550
It was, like, what is that
first step I can take?

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.970
Yeah, I could find a phone
number, and call a guy,

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.761
and have one show up,
and see what happens.

00:06:59.761 --> 00:07:02.020
And then things started
to snowball from there.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.840
OK, another story--
so when the App Store

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.040
started to get big, 2008,
2009, everybody's making apps.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.290
Everyone wants to make an app.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.030
Has to have an app.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.696
What's your app?

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:11.750
Got to have an app.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.260
And there's a guy who's,
like, all right, I

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.093
want to have an app.

00:07:14.093 --> 00:07:15.400
Everybody has an app.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.280
I have no ideas for any apps.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.710
But what I can do is, I
can look in the App Store

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.630
and say, what is the most
downloaded, lowest rated app?

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.380
So what is the one that people
want the most, but it sucks.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.660
Well, it turns out it
was the Spanish Bible.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.540
Like the only Spanish Bible
app crashed all the time.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.560
It was really bad.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.210
But people want a Spanish Bible.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.700
So he's, like, well,
the Bible is free.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.650
The Bible content's
just out there.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.350
He's, like, I can hire someone
to make a Spanish Bible app.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.630
He makes a new
Spanish Bible app.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.760
Makes a ton of money
on this Spanish Bible

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.440
app just because he
put it out there,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.850
because he had that idea.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.510
Give you one other
example, there's

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.620
a woman-- when FBA came
out, Fulfillment by Amazon.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.256
Great, where you can just
basically send them stuff,

00:07:59.256 --> 00:08:00.380
it counts as their listing.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.130
They fulfill the
orders, all that.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.220
So when that started to get
big, maybe two years back,

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.414
there was a woman who was, like,
I want to use this service.

00:08:09.414 --> 00:08:10.830
I got to figure
out what I can do.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.550
I know I can make
some money on this.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.890
She decided if I go
to Target every week,

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.100
the Target in my hometown,
they have a clearance rack

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.560
that's filled with all brand
new products-- like a vacuum

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.330
cleaner, a spatula,
all this stuff.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.037
It's new.

00:08:23.037 --> 00:08:23.620
It's not used.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.360
It's got the label,
it's perfectly good.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.910
She'd buy everything
on the clearance rack,

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.351
put it in a box,
send it to Amazon.

00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:32.559
Amazon lists it, fulfills
the orders, all this stuff.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.350
She makes six figures a year
buying stuff on the clearance

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.780
rack, driving to FedEx,
putting it in the box,

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.580
sending it to Amazon,
and spending the rest

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.559
of her life just hanging out.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.310
OK?

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.560
But because she had that
bias towards action to do it.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.630
And there's millions of
these kinds of stories,

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.450
and they're not all
about money, right?

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.846
They can be things
like activism.

00:08:49.846 --> 00:08:51.220
There's this woman
in Tunisia who

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.499
wanted to preserve the Star
Wars set, the original Star

00:08:54.499 --> 00:08:56.290
Wars set from the
original Star Wars movie.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.460
And as opposed to just
thinking about it,

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.376
started this campaign.

00:08:58.376 --> 00:09:00.320
It turned into this whole thing.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.430
But there's a lot that we
can learn from those stories

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.629
to think, like, of course,
I see myself in this.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.920
And there's the idea that I
have in the back of my head

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.350
right now, I can work
to make that happen.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.770
So a couple of the lessons
that I think are important,

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.170
just to kind of wrap
this up, is that one

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.760
is that action is a muscle.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.090
So just like some people
exercise their biceps, not me,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.690
but some people, you can
exercise your action muscle.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.970
And it's a matter of
working to say, OK,

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.756
anytime I have an
idea, what is action

00:09:30.756 --> 00:09:31.880
that I can take right away?

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.500
And you start to
work that muscle,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.680
and then you can start to
develop that action bias.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.990
Another is we have to break
the tendency that is we

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.670
want to set aside time later.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.234
Like we'll often
say, we build ideas

00:09:42.234 --> 00:09:43.400
up to be so big in our head.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.040
We have this great idea, it's,
like, I need to set aside a day

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.330
where I can bang that out.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.116
I'm going to block my
calendar for Friday,

00:09:49.116 --> 00:09:50.240
where I'm going to do that.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.800
But you don't respect that time.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.090
You don't protect that time.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.640
You respect someone's meeting
that they put on your calendar

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.900
that you don't even
like that person.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.420
But you prepped for their
meeting instead of your thing,

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.347
because you were
forced to in that.

00:10:01.347 --> 00:10:02.930
But you can't force
yourself to do it.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.580
You can't set aside
the time later.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.630
You don't respect it.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.520
Later never comes, right?

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.220
You have to work on
doing that sooner.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.970
And then one of the biggest
things is when I have an idea,

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.460
it's often really
hard to come up

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.650
with actions for my own idea.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.427
But when someone
else has an idea,

00:10:20.427 --> 00:10:22.760
it's super easy to give that
person-- you could do this.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.270
You could do this.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.020
You could do this.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.700
It's easier to fire off
actions for other people.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.430
So the collaborative
nature is actually

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.984
super important for ideas.

00:10:29.984 --> 00:10:32.400
And one of the things that
happened, when we have an idea,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.340
it's not fully formed
yet, we're a little bit

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.049
embarrassed to share
it with other people

00:10:36.049 --> 00:10:37.548
or to talk to other
people about it.

00:10:37.548 --> 00:10:39.260
Because we feel like
it's not baked yet.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.309
But the most important
thing you can do

00:10:41.309 --> 00:10:43.100
is to have a conversation
with other people

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.930
about it, because they can
help you think about what

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.270
the actions are that you
could take right away to be

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.740
able to do something.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.390
We all get caught
up in this game.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.210
I was on a phone call last
week with a colleague who was,

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.237
like, we got to design a survey
to send out after this program.

00:10:56.237 --> 00:10:58.070
What questions do you
think should be on it?

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.870
And they're talking for 20
minutes about-- well, because--

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.940
I'm, like, guys I just
sent out the survey.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.710
I logged into Survey Monkey.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.120
I built it while
we were talking.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.340
We don't need to
over engineer this.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.960
That bias towards
action is something

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.085
that you just need to
constantly check yourself on.

00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:13.620
And it's really important.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.250
And then the last thing
is everything in life

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.660
that's hard is just a series
of things that are easy.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.410
So it just needs to
be broken down, right?

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.840
When we have these
ideas that are big,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.690
I could have "write a
business plan for a company x"

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.690
on my calendar for six months.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.305
And oh, I don't
want-- it's hard.

00:11:30.305 --> 00:11:31.930
I don't know when
I'm going to do that.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:32.721
That's really hard.

00:11:32.721 --> 00:11:33.960
How do I get started?

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.835
But if it's just a matter
of breaking it down

00:11:35.835 --> 00:11:37.940
to google business plan.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.830
Read the first 10 articles.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.880
Pick a template.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.470
Fill out the first section of
the template, which is what

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.850
you would actually do anyway.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.530
It's, like, oh, crap, like
I could have done that.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.320
But when you build
it up in your head,

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.010
that's when you
get into trouble.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.270
So everything in
life that's hard

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.490
is just a series of
things that are easy.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.450
This is us.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.970
That's me.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.560
Happy to answer
questions and have

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.140
a conversation about action.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.404
So what-- or do you want to
start things up a little bit?

00:12:07.404 --> 00:12:08.820
JAKE: Let's hear
it, up for Steve.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.530
STEVE GARGUILO: Cool, thanks.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.450
JAKE: We're both
super tall guys.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.032
So we're going to just get a
little bit more intimate here.

00:12:15.032 --> 00:12:16.300
STEVE GARGUILO: Cool.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.740
JAKE: And we hope you've all
brought your live questions

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.550
and your ideas.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.370
Steve is excited to hear them.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.307
I figured we could start off
with a softball question.

00:12:25.307 --> 00:12:26.390
STEVE GARGUILO: All right.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.040
JAKE: Steve is a huge traveler.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.160
He's been to over 100 countries.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.535
STEVE GARGUILO:
I thought we were

00:12:31.535 --> 00:12:33.350
going to talk about softball.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.700
JAKE: I haven't asked it yet.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:39.890
What is your most
underrated travel tip?

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.830
And what is your most
overrated travel tip?

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.170
STEVE GARGUILO: Hm.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:49.450
So I think probably underrated,
actually, is hotels.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.820
And not staying in hotels--

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.970
I mean, sometimes hotels,
sometimes Airbnbs.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.930
But you can use
hotels that you're not

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.370
staying in for so many things.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.911
Like, a hotel is
your [INAUDIBLE]----

00:12:59.911 --> 00:13:02.900
you need an envelope, walk
to a hotel, find an envelope.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.450
Any Doubletree Hotel in
the world, you walk in,

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.010
you can have a cookie.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.720
You want to go swimming?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.300
Walk into a hotel
and go swimming.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.710
You want to find a bathroom?

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.180
You need to print your
boarding pass when you're

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.280
staying in an Airbnb,
walk into a hotel and say,

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.140
can I print my boarding pass?

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:23.440
I think you can use hotels
as your personal service

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.380
very easily when traveling.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.430
JAKE: Cool.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.170
OK, I have a bunch
of questions here.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.210
But does anyone have
any live questions

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.330
for Steve about ideas
you're thinking about?

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.357
And you'll have
time to-- oh, sure.

00:13:37.357 --> 00:13:39.190
AUDIENCE: So this isn't
an idea that I have.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:45.070
But just the whole idea of what
you said earlier, about a surge

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.610
in action, and that's sort of
how you move things forward.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.000
What about just sustaining
that motivation,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.600
sustaining things even past
that surge, any recommendations

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.116
there?

00:13:56.116 --> 00:13:57.490
STEVE GARGUILO:
So accountability

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.300
is super important, right?

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.560
Because we all have
things we want to do.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.768
And it's, like, how do you
hold yourself accountable?

00:14:01.768 --> 00:14:04.730
Everybody has different things
that work right for them.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.880
And so knowing yourself
is also really important.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.737
One of the reasons,
often times, you're

00:14:09.737 --> 00:14:12.070
more accountable to someone
else's meeting than your own

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.710
is because you have that guilt
feeling of there's somebody

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:15.890
else involved.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.550
So I think getting other
people involved really helps,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.100
so having an
accountability buddy.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.940
I have different friends
who I do something

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.430
I call accountability
days with, where we'll

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.890
block out two days together.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:27.780
I would say, great,
the first day, we're

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.750
going to be 100%
focused on your stuff,

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.250
but I'm going to
be at your service.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.800
So you want to help
make a website?

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.640
You want to help do this?

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.973
I'm going to be working for you.

00:14:34.973 --> 00:14:37.217
The second day, we're
100% focused on my stuff.

00:14:37.217 --> 00:14:38.800
And you're going to
be helping me out.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.290
And I find that over the
course of those two days,

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.700
I'll get way more done.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.560
Even though I'm only
spending one day on me,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.393
I get way more done
than if I spend two days

00:14:46.393 --> 00:14:47.890
by myself trying to work.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.390
And there are a lot
of ways that you

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.120
can use people to hold yourself
accountable with accountability

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.200
check ins, and tools
and things like that.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.350
So I think the biggest
thing is knowing

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.330
what is it for me
that's the hang up,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.790
and then how do you combat that.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.910
In some languages,
there's actually

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:08.090
two words for what we would
think of as procrastination.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.390
So there's the classic
definition of procrastination,

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.954
which is, I know what I need
to do, but I'm not doing it.

00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:16.120
And then there's this
definition of procrastination,

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.720
which is I actually don't really
know what I need to do yet.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.730
I'm letting it be
on the slow burn.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.440
I'm letting it simmer
in my subconscious

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.170
while I do other stuff
so I can come back to it

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.965
and work on it later.

00:15:27.965 --> 00:15:29.590
We're really good at
tricking ourselves

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.840
into thinking it's the latter.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.904
That, like, I don't know
what I need to do yet.

00:15:32.904 --> 00:15:33.820
I'm letting it simmer.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.240
When the reality is, more often
than not, it's the former.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.550
And you actually know
exactly what you need to do.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.080
It's just a matter of doing it.

00:15:43.595 --> 00:15:44.220
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.002
JAKE: I think one in the
back, and then we'll get you.

00:15:47.002 --> 00:15:48.710
AUDIENCE: OK, so that's
very interesting,

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.930
the idea of pairing up
with somebody else to take

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:55.160
turns, what the
other person's doing,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.170
what the other person's doing.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.040
So it sounds like it would
be very good for people

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.100
with complementary strengths.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.740
So what are some
examples of what

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.480
you've been able to
contribute to that

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.188
specifically versus
what the other person

00:16:10.188 --> 00:16:12.120
has been able to contribute?

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.620
STEVE GARGUILO:
Yeah, a lot of times

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.620
it's not even necessarily based
on complementary strengths.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.600
Because, yeah, I could
see, for example, OK,

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.850
I want to get a website done.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.270
Yeah, I'm partnering
with somebody

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.610
who knows what she's doing and
helping me make the website.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.790
But oftentimes it can be
for a simple thing, which

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.100
is, no, I just need to sit down
and finish writing this copy.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.710
I need to sit down and
actually write down

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.600
what are some jobs that
I want to apply to.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.310
I need to sit down and write--

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.770
honestly, I think
it's better for things

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.840
that you could do yourself.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.480
But having somebody else
in the room helping you

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.540
makes it better and makes
sure that you actually do it.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.602
So it could be the simplest
thing on your to do list.

00:16:50.602 --> 00:16:53.060
But you're bringing someone
else in to help make it happen.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:56.770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.420
Was there a specific moment
where you realized, hey,

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.420
I should stop procrastinating
and should start taking action?

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.884
And if so, what was that moment?

00:17:03.884 --> 00:17:05.550
STEVE GARGUILO: So
everyone in the world

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.966
is their own biggest hypocrite
and everything, too, right?

00:17:07.966 --> 00:17:11.650
So I would be lying to say I'm
not procrastinating on things,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.829
you know, right now as well.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.970
So I don't think there's
any given moment where

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.800
every person could
cross a threshold

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.819
and they never
procrastinate again.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.060
I think it's a matter
of being aware of it

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.240
and being intentional about
understanding that, like, OK,

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.990
I am procrastinating right now.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:31.120
And I know what I could be
doing or should be doing,

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.530
and I'm not doing it.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.660
Where we trick ourselves
is the "I don't know what

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.890
I should be doing right now."

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.973
If you take-- what I do
is, in any given situation

00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:40.330
that's something that
seems hard, it's, like,

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.367
I take the five seconds
to think about--

00:17:42.367 --> 00:17:44.200
Elon Musk talks a lot
about first principles

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.574
and these kinds
of things, right?

00:17:45.574 --> 00:17:48.040
So you take the five
minutes to think about, OK,

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.390
why is this seeming hard?

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:52.630
What is the thing that
I could do right now?

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.270
I either need to collect
data on this to validate it.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.970
I either need to take a first
step that kicks it to somebody

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.440
else to take another step on.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.140
I either need to just
get over the fact

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.140
that my rough draft is going to
be horrible, so that I can then

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.330
give feedback to myself.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.730
Whatever it is, it's like
what is that first thing that

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.090
can start the ball rolling?

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.870
Because it's the first
thing that trips us up.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.610
We think the first thing
needs to be something else.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.400
And if you ask yourself,
what is something

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.840
I could do to progress this?

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.340
That's the biggest thing that
starts to get you on the roll.

00:18:25.434 --> 00:18:27.819
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about something, like,

00:18:27.819 --> 00:18:29.110
what if you're in a situation--

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.960
I wanted to get an investment
property for a while.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.150
And I've been kind of
on the fence with it.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.130
But there's certainly
a lot of downside risk.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.110
So it's sort of
the kind of thing

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.390
that you don't just want to
take immediate action on it,

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.973
then find yourself
in a world or hurt.

00:18:41.973 --> 00:18:44.590
What would you suggest for
how to go about something

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.564
that's a bigger thing that might
have a lot of downside risk?

00:18:48.564 --> 00:18:49.480
STEVE GARGUILO: Right.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.980
So I think the
first action then,

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.510
and that's a perfect
example of thinking

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.884
about what are the things that
I could start to do first?

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:57.289
So, for example, if I wanted
to start taking action

00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:59.080
on that, could one of
the first things I do

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.180
be posting on Facebook, like,
hey, do any of my friends

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.305
have investment properties?

00:19:02.305 --> 00:19:03.250
Could I chat with you?

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.597
Or going and actually
googling some articles

00:19:05.597 --> 00:19:07.180
and starting to read
about it, and see

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.650
if that sets me down a path.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.150
Or something that's
not just doing nothing,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.570
which is what's super
easy, which is I

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.880
want to do that someday.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.620
Or looking at,
like, OK, I'm going

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.420
to take three
examples of properties

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.640
to a friend who knows
about investments,

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.040
and just say, which of
these three would be better?

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.900
Or are all of these horrible?

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:31.420
Or actually doing something
that starts something?

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.799
I'm sorry for the
vague language.

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:33.340
But you know?

00:19:36.194 --> 00:19:38.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you for the
presentation and the insights.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.680
And what will be
your personal tips

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.960
for the personal
management tools,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.795
like any apps or something
which you find really useful?

00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:48.670
STEVE GARGUILO: Yeah.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.440
It's a great question.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.190
And I think it's one
of those things where

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.850
it's what works for you,
because we're all different.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.700
Jake and I were actually
talking about tools that

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.620
can automate tasks for you.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.750
So I love-- I use
Zapier a lot, which

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.120
is a tool that zaps data
between different tools.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.720
Jake was telling me about--

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.480
JAKE: There's a software for
Mac called Keyboard Maestro.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.950
And it will essentially automate
clicking, button clicking,

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.090
and downloading things.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.680
And so if you have
any questions,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.120
you can shoot me a question.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.710
STEVE GARGUILO: Often when
people think about productivity

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.400
tools, they're thinking about
calendar tools and to do lists

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.450
and that kind of stuff,
which I find funny.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:25.930
Because that to me
is not productivity.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.730
Productivity is not
necessarily making a

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.350
to do list, though it could be.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.060
Productivity is what
are the things that

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.280
are making me more efficient
and making me quicker,

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.420
so that at any
given moment it's,

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.230
like, boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.350
Things are happening.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.870
So I like those kinds of things.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.972
Or I like getting people
involved in things

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:41.930
so I know we're going to
make something happen,

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.200
so that I can just remove
it from my head altogether.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.783
I don't have to put
it on a to do list

00:20:45.783 --> 00:20:46.880
and think about it later.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.330
I can just move it away.

00:20:55.892 --> 00:20:57.350
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:01.420
I feel we can all relate
to the million browser tabs

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.290
being open and having
a lot on our minds.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.810
And you just spoke
about productivity.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.990
I just want to hear a bit more.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.570
How do you laser
in on that focus?

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.910
Because I do think a
lot of us in the room

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.500
are here because we
have a lot of ideas,

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.380
maybe an overwhelming
number of ideas.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.756
But how do you sift through
the bad from the good

00:21:23.756 --> 00:21:24.880
and kind of get that focus?

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.703
Because I love the
idea of throwing the to

00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:28.110
do list out the window.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.500
Like, if you're
not doing it now,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.000
maybe you should never do it.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.660
How do you kind of--

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.800
do you have a mantra or
framework or anything else

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.900
you can expand on to help kind
of close all the browser tabs

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.690
and just be more focused?

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.450
STEVE GARGUILO: Yeah, and they
eat up a lot of resources.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.930
I think the biggest thing
in this situation is the oh,

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.240
I have so many ideas.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.040
I don't know what to do.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.092
Pick one, do a
little bit on that.

00:21:55.092 --> 00:21:56.050
I know, it's facetious.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.410
But pick one.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.100
If truly, every single one
of them would be great,

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.321
and there's no way to
distinguish between them.

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:03.820
And it's, like, oh,
there's so many.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.861
I don't know how to pick.

00:22:04.861 --> 00:22:06.054
Pick one randomly.

00:22:06.054 --> 00:22:07.720
Write them, put them
in a hat, whatever.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.440
Pick one.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.330
Spend some time
working on it, and then

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.344
see, oh, this is great.

00:22:12.344 --> 00:22:13.760
I'm going to keep
working on this.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.680
Or no, I'm going to
do something else.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.780
I don't buy the idea of I have
so many things, and I can't--

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.610
one, automatically,
we have ways that we

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.660
rank things in our head.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.010
You know the one that
you're thinking about

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.900
before you go to bed.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.858
The one you're thinking
about when you wake up.

00:22:27.858 --> 00:22:29.390
So automatically,
something's going

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.680
to be bubbling up for you.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.630
But if something doesn't,
then just pick one

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.205
and start working on it.

00:22:34.205 --> 00:22:37.220
And the other good
point of this is

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.560
start working on it
doesn't mean I'm going

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.940
to put my life savings into it.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.149
Start working on it doesn't
mean every night now

00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.940
is working on this.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.710
But it's what are
those actions that you

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.170
could start to take that
can get you more data, that

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.540
can get you more feedback,
that can get you to a place

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.500
where you know--

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.320
I want to start
investing more time.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.000
And the beauty about
doing that is you

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.549
could actually do that for a
number of the different ideas.

00:22:59.549 --> 00:23:02.090
When you start thinking about
it from the perspective of what

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.631
are those quick
things that I can do.

00:23:03.631 --> 00:23:05.750
Maybe it's as simple as
register a domain name

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.630
and put up a Launchrock page
and see if there's interest.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:12.410
And that's super simple to do.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.500
I have something I talk about
that I call the idea tax, which

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.440
is that anytime I have an
idea, I register a domain name.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.510
And then, I know a year
from now I'm going to get

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.290
reminded that I got to pay
another $15 in idea tax

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.300
for this idea that I
haven't done anything with.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.416
And it's going to trigger
me to say, all right,

00:23:28.416 --> 00:23:30.540
are you really going to
make GarlicBreadReviews.com

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.520
happen this year?

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.480
Or can let that one go?

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.180
So again, it's kind of
whatever it is for you.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.930
But it needs to be what are the
little things I can start to do

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.575
that can set me down the path?

00:23:43.575 --> 00:23:44.450
AUDIENCE: It's great.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.742
I love the idea of investing
time, not financials

00:23:46.742 --> 00:23:47.450
in the beginning.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.140
Because it is.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.345
Investing your time
is priceless, really.

00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:50.970
So thank you.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.479
AUDIENCE: Hey,
thanks for your time.

00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:02.270
Forgot my question.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.769
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:02.769 --> 00:24:04.400
AUDIENCE: No, it'll come back.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.300
So I like what you said about
things being hard sometimes.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.160
As we get older,
we can say things

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.430
are hard if they're
difficult, but we also

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.459
have the experience of simpler
things to compare them to.

00:24:14.459 --> 00:24:16.750
I have a young kid, and he
doesn't say things are hard.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.590
He just says, I can't do this.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.220
So do you have an
example of something

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.010
that you could tell a young kid?

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.454
I usually would say
it's not hard, it's new.

00:24:24.454 --> 00:24:25.870
Because you haven't
seen this yet.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:27.910
So maybe you have
a similar example

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.280
of what you can tell the
younger generation as

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.540
to how to take their ideas,
having a bias to action,

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.310
for things that aren't
necessarily hard,

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.380
but they just need--

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.590
STEVE GARGUILO: Yeah.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.860
One of the best principals,
top principals in coaching

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.600
is just asking questions.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.640
And oftentimes when you
ask people questions,

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.620
you realize that they
kind of trap themselves

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.880
in their own logic.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.130
I think that actually
works really well for kids.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.020
If a kid said to me,
that's not possible.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.180
I would be, like, what
makes it not possible?

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.410
Like, help me to understand.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.770
Try to get them talking
and extract them out of it,

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.750
and then they find themselves.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.780
Because it's hard, I get wanting
to say, like, no, anything's

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.590
possible!

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.420
But you telling that
to someone doesn't

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.170
mean they're going to
do anything with it.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:11.467
But if you can lead
them to that place,

00:25:11.467 --> 00:25:12.550
then I think that's great.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.060
And then, I think,
also exposing them

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.290
to all these different
things that are possible.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.650
So they start to collect
those different-- you know,

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.410
life is just this relentless
pursuit of insight.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.395
And so the more insights
from different places

00:25:25.395 --> 00:25:27.520
that you're getting planted
in your brain, the more

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.590
possibilities that you
can see, the more synapses

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.520
are firing together.

00:25:34.506 --> 00:25:35.422
JAKE: One in the back?

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:40.940
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.910
So I have a lot of
ideas in my head.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.280
And when I start
working on them,

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.110
I don't have a problem starting.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.399
But completing them
is really hard for me.

00:25:49.399 --> 00:25:51.190
And I think what happens
during the process

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.650
is that I kind of
sabotage myself,

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.170
thinking will it
really be successful?

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:59.830
Do I have the right network to
get to market with the idea?

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.450
Maybe I'll just do
it, and no one ever

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.230
sees it, things like that.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.350
So all these doubts
start dropping in,

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.530
especially when the things
become larger and larger.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.910
So how do you separate
the bias towards action

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.650
from the outcome?

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.810
How do you see those two things?

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:17.894
Are those separate?

00:26:17.894 --> 00:26:20.060
STEVE GARGUILO: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.580
I think part of the
seeds of your question

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.200
that I probably
didn't quite answer

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.980
that I think is really good
is, like, OK, then if I go

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.430
and I do start all these
different things, that

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.270
can become super
overwhelming, where now I'm

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.353
taking action on all this.

00:26:33.353 --> 00:26:35.110
And OK, what's going on?

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.700
So a couple of things
there, I think.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.980
One is I do think the first
step on an idea is action.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.550
At some point, you have
to make a decision on--

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.170
is this action
yielding the results

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.044
that I would want to
see for this idea, where

00:26:49.044 --> 00:26:50.260
it should continue?

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:54.940
Or should I pause
that, put it away?

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.290
I think we don't do
a good job confirming

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.840
to ourselves that we're
done working on an idea.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.720
Our actions say that we're
done working on an idea.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.460
But we let ourselves
beat ourselves up

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.380
to say, oh, I should
still be working on that.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.680
Versus taking stock and
saying should I still

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.890
be working on this, or am I
allowed to put that one away?

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.810
There's a great book
called "Essentialism"

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.010
which talks a lot about
that kind of stuff.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:19.480
One of the exercises
in that book,

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.530
which I like doing personally
from time to time, maybe

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.950
every six months, is on Post
Its or little slips of paper,

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.080
like, what's everything
that I'm actively

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.480
spending time and energy
on in my life right now?

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.250
And that could be
projects, that could

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.960
be things related to family.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.770
Like, what are things that
I'm actively spending time on?

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.061
And you have a ton of different
things in front of you.

00:27:38.061 --> 00:27:39.990
And then, it's which
of these are essential?

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.281
And which are the ones that
I want to be spending time,

00:27:42.281 --> 00:27:44.850
and which are the ones
that it's time to put away?

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.810
And sometimes we don't
officially put an idea to bed.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.802
And so every now and then
that you think about it again,

00:27:52.802 --> 00:27:54.510
oh, man, I haven't
done anything on that.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:55.801
And you beat yourself up on it.

00:27:55.801 --> 00:27:57.600
When in reality,
you can be, like,

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.720
I feel good about putting
that one to bed for now.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.380
And I'm going to
focus on these things.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.930
So I think that's an
important way to deal with it,

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.014
and then it doesn't
feel so overwhelming.

00:28:06.014 --> 00:28:06.680
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.940
I guess the threshold that
I struggle with this, like,

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.200
maybe I'm deceiving myself into
thinking that this idea won't

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.280
go anywhere.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.830
Just because, I guess,
there is the execution part,

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.220
and then there is
the hustling part.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.750
Just making the world aware
that this thing exists,

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.620
and maybe somebody
should use it.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.399
But maybe I'm too lazy or
too inept in doing that.

00:28:26.399 --> 00:28:27.940
And then I think my
idea isn't great,

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.390
and I just put that to
rest because it's not

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.670
going anywhere.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.640
So that fork in the road
is really confusing for me.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.140
STEVE GARGUILO: One
of the best ways

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.810
to maybe think about
those is how can I

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.360
start involving some more
perspectives in what's

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.046
currently a very hard thing for
me to figure out, this fork?

00:28:46.046 --> 00:28:47.670
I don't know if, with
the ideas, you're

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.590
involved with other people,
or even if you take it

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.673
to someone who's not going
to be involved with it,

00:28:51.673 --> 00:28:53.010
where you just want to bounce--

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.810
you know, hey, here's
what's happening.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.190
What do you think?

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:57.990
The longer things
live in our head,

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.980
the longer nothing's
going to happen with it.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.180
But as soon as we can vocalize
and talk to somebody about it,

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.780
even a person who can't
talk, can't emote,

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.620
can't do anything-- like
that blue thing in the back

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.700
of the room--

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.830
just saying something
to that actually

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.140
can help you think about,
oh, saying it out loud,

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:16.830
I changed this.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.446
But then, assuming that that
thing is sentient and can

00:29:19.446 --> 00:29:21.570
respond to you, it can give
you even more feedback.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.450
So sometimes it's a matter
of get it out of your head,

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.071
write it down,
say it to someone.

00:29:26.071 --> 00:29:27.570
And then you can
realize, OK, here's

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.675
how I can pick up the
pieces and move it forward.

00:29:29.675 --> 00:29:30.300
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:30.800
Thank you.

00:29:35.064 --> 00:29:39.214
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
marketing tips for your ideas?

00:29:39.214 --> 00:29:41.630
You mentioned if you have an
idea, create the landing page

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:42.510
and put it out there.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:43.510
See if there's any interest.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:44.410
Well, let's face it.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.326
Nobody's just going to
show up on your website

00:29:46.326 --> 00:29:50.490
unless you just find some people
to let them know about it.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:54.250
Do you have any go to
testing, marketing things

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:55.375
that you do to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:55.375 --> 00:29:57.874
STEVE GARGUILO: Yeah, question
on marketing tips and kind of

00:29:57.874 --> 00:29:59.260
go to marketing things.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.925
I mean obviously
using Google services

00:30:00.925 --> 00:30:05.410
and products, I'm sure,
would help everyone.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.470
I think it totally depends
on the idea, right?

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.470
Because if you're
trying to do something

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.800
and you're trying to create
some kind of campaign

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.392
or get a bunch of
hits on a video,

00:30:16.392 --> 00:30:18.475
it's very different than
trying to sell a product.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.310
So I don't exactly know
how to answer that.

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:26.870
For me--

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.340
AUDIENCE: It's a retail product.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:28.680
STEVE GARGUILO: OK.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.840
So for a retail product.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.325
AUDIENCE: That you may
sell on Amazon or--

00:30:32.325 --> 00:30:33.200
STEVE GARGUILO: Yeah.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:38.100
So I think I'm
always a big believer

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.210
in the personal
aspects of anything.

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:46.370
So for me, it would be
involving my closest friends

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:49.620
in the story of it and
getting them jazzed about it

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.010
and having them going out on
my behalf, talking about that,

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.540
and kind of starting there.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.957
And that gets to a little bit
of enough of a critical mass

00:30:56.957 --> 00:30:59.165
where you could start to
get feedback and figure out,

00:30:59.165 --> 00:31:00.750
is this something
that's catching on.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:04.680
The other Marketing 101 thing
is just targeting enough.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.440
I think even though
that's so obvious,

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.360
most people still feel
the products that they

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.560
make are for everyone.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.700
But they're not.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.115
The products they're making
are for a specific person,

00:31:14.115 --> 00:31:15.990
and they don't take the
time to really define

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:17.160
that specific person.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.680
And go work on, where
are the communities where

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.450
those specific people exist?

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.100
Am I a member of that community?

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.650
How am I contributing and
adding value in that community?

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:28.410
Have I garnered respect in
that community where I can even

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:29.790
sell something to that person?

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.770
Because selling to that person
is step 10 on that journey.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.080
And if I think I'm just
going to put something up

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.240
and they're going to want it,
I haven't built the trust.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.406
I don't have the permission,
all that kind of stuff.

00:31:38.406 --> 00:31:41.102
I'm a big believer in Seth
Godin and tribes and communities

00:31:41.102 --> 00:31:42.060
and this kind of stuff.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.850
I think community building is,
like, the most important skill

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:46.450
set in the 21st century.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.740
And so that's kind of how
I think about this stuff.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.698
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:31:50.698 --> 00:31:51.674
Thank you.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:56.550
JAKE: Cool.

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:59.400
Any other questions for Steve?

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.240
I've got a couple.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:01.740
Let's see.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:06.150
So you talk in your book
about divergent thinking

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:10.200
which is exploration
of possibilities

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.740
and then convergent thinking,
which is deciding what to do.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.480
We talk a lot about
unconscious bias

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.490
in decision making at Google.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.620
But we don't necessarily
think about bias--

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.990
and you spoke to
it some, like, how

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:25.200
we use bias towards
examining possibilities.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.180
Like, what's possible
for me as an individual?

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.460
What's possible for my team?

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.634
And you've been exposed
to a lot of cultures

00:32:31.634 --> 00:32:33.300
and a lot of different
company cultures.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.085
Curious to get your
thoughts about what

00:32:35.085 --> 00:32:37.350
are some biases people
have towards kind

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.356
of examining possibilities?

00:32:39.356 --> 00:32:40.230
STEVE GARGUILO: Yeah.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.480
I mean, in general, one
of the things that we

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.140
love doing in companies is
having committees and having

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.200
meetings where we explore
possibilities, right?

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.440
And all of those are
still hypotheticals.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.080
And so the more we live in
hypotheticals, where we're

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.350
exploring and examining
what could be,

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.260
the less that we're spending
time in the what actually is.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.420
So it goes back to
the point of, as

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.670
opposed to living
in the hypothetical,

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.791
if there's five ideas to
a given solution, what

00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:12.540
are some things that
you could take action

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.090
on that could start to validate
them in the real world?

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:19.680
Whether that's through
a survey or a prototype

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.460
or a kind of whatever it
is that's making it real,

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.510
now we're having a legitimate
conversation versus an unknown.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.550
I think, especially
at Google, I would

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:34.020
imagine every decision is a
very data driven decision.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.340
And so the longer
something is hypothetical,

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.650
the less data you
could possibly have

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.490
towards helping you
make that decision.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:45.764
So making it real, I think, is
the most important thing to do.

00:33:45.764 --> 00:33:47.680
The other thing I would
say that, if you think

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:53.140
about the cultural aspect
is, I'm sure all of us

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.140
work on global teams on a
day to day basis, right?

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.080
A lot of what we've talked
about today, to many people,

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.140
is viewed as a very
American thing.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.340
It's very American
to be action biased

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:08.409
and to be doing these
kinds of things.

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:10.600
And while I don't
agree with that,

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.510
the reality is, while
there is that perception,

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.880
then you're going to be
looked upon as the person

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.223
on the team who needs to
help drive that change.

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:20.889
If you're leading a
global team, and you

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:23.199
want to create more of
a bias towards action,

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:26.110
you need to go two inches more
for every inch you want to see

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.069
the rest of your team go.

00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:30.360
And so the role modeling, I
think, is really important.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.609
If you're thinking about
wanting to create more action

00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:36.080
bias in your teams, then you
have to be doing it, too.

00:34:39.631 --> 00:34:40.130
JAKE: Cool.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:43.740
Any other live
questions for Steve?

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:44.870
All right, great.

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:46.199
Well, thank you all so much.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:47.370
Thank you, Steve,
for being here.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:48.959
Let's hear it one
more time for Steve.

00:34:48.959 --> 00:34:50.809
[APPLAUSE]
