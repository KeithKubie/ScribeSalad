00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.536
(majestic music)

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.208 size:88% position:44%
  - Zombies.

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.209
 They're hot right now.

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.411 size:84% position:42%
  Oh, yeah.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.279 size:84% position:42%
  The Walking Dead,
  the Talking Dead,

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:15.815
 Fear the Walking Dead,
 Be the Walking Dead.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:20.186
Walking Dead Top Chef,
Walking Dead Real World,

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:24.090 align:start size:88% position:13%
 World War Z, it's
 prequel, World War Y,

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:26.259
it's sequel World War A.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.228
Zombies are everywhere.

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.264
 That's where Rutger
 St. Lawrence comes in.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.332
 See, Rutger is a pure
 warrior of the mind.

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:36.102
Tortured eyes radiate compassion

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:42.241 align:start size:88% position:13%
whilst wisdom dances
from his every man lips.

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:43.709
 He has seen and said it all.

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
 Most people in this new world
 have had to become handy

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:49.615 align:start size:88% position:13%
with a weapon to
survive, but not Rutger.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:52.519 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Oh, no, he was
 born with a weapon.

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:54.687 size:88% position:44%
  His words.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.458
(paper crackles)

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.829 align:start size:88% position:13%
  And when I see
  whoever it may be,

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.665 size:84% position:42%
  a he or a she but
  probably a she,

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.834
 then I will be the one
 that pollinates thee,

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.469 size:88% position:44%
 like the bees does the tree

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:12.438 size:88% position:44%
  and then finally
  you and I will see

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:14.841
 the word that needs no rhyme.

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:18.178
 Love.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.447
(book slamming)

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.618
And with every zombies'
mind he blows to pieces,

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:28.721 align:start size:88% position:13%
 he brings back another
 piece of humanity

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:31.224
 in the hopes of world peace.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.731
Also, he's a black guy.

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:41.568
(dramatic music)

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:45.304
- We're very excited about this

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:49.609 align:start position:0%
 and we'll call you when
 we're ready to make an offer.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:50.610 size:88% position:44%
 (slamming on table)

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.112
- You keep that.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:54.380
 I got plenty.
