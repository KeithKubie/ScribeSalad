00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.620
 
the first time I became interested in

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:04.630
the first time I became interested in
 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.140
the first time I became interested in
survival I was just a little kid and I

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.150
survival I was just a little kid and I
 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.660
survival I was just a little kid and I
was hearing stories about my father who

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670
was hearing stories about my father who
 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.419
was hearing stories about my father who
was a combat pilot in World War two and

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429
was a combat pilot in World War two and
 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.660
was a combat pilot in World War two and
I was realizing that for some reason he

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670
I was realizing that for some reason he
 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.990
I was realizing that for some reason he
had survived and nine of the ten men and

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000
had survived and nine of the ten men and
 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.570
had survived and nine of the ten men and
his crew had not survived and it started

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580
his crew had not survived and it started
 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.580
his crew had not survived and it started
me wondering why some people survived

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590
me wondering why some people survived
 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.370
me wondering why some people survived
and some don't

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380
 
 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.920
 
the most interesting thing once I

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930
the most interesting thing once I
 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.170
the most interesting thing once I
started studying actual cases of

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180
started studying actual cases of
 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.530
started studying actual cases of
survivors is that search-and-rescue

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540
survivors is that search-and-rescue
 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.390
survivors is that search-and-rescue
people would go out and they would find

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400
people would go out and they would find
 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.910
people would go out and they would find
someone dead who was in possession of

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920
someone dead who was in possession of
 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.350
someone dead who was in possession of
all of the equipment he needed to

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360
all of the equipment he needed to
 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.170
all of the equipment he needed to
survive and yet hadn't used it for some

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180
survive and yet hadn't used it for some
 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.140
survive and yet hadn't used it for some
peculiar reason conversely they would

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150
peculiar reason conversely they would
 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.509
peculiar reason conversely they would
find someone alive who they had expected

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519
find someone alive who they had expected
 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.689
find someone alive who they had expected
to find dead and this person would be in

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699
to find dead and this person would be in
 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.430
to find dead and this person would be in
possession of none of the equipment they

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440
possession of none of the equipment they
 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.710
possession of none of the equipment they
needed to survive and so the question

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720
needed to survive and so the question
 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.319
needed to survive and so the question
became what really was it inside these

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329
became what really was it inside these
 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.060
became what really was it inside these
people that caused them to survive and

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070
people that caused them to survive and
 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.610
people that caused them to survive and
that was the the driving force behind my

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620
that was the the driving force behind my
 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.219
that was the the driving force behind my
research was to see if we could find

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229
research was to see if we could find
 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.390
research was to see if we could find
something out about that

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400
 
 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.750
 
what we found out was that the people

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760
what we found out was that the people
 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.820
what we found out was that the people
who survived the best have certain

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830
who survived the best have certain
 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.330
who survived the best have certain
particular qualities for example they

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340
particular qualities for example they
 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.310
particular qualities for example they
tend to be the ones who get the

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320
tend to be the ones who get the
 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.350
tend to be the ones who get the
information about where they're going so

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360
information about where they're going so
 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.300
information about where they're going so
they know something about what they're

they know something about what they're

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320
doing it's not a weekend warrior who
 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.770
doing it's not a weekend warrior who
just happens onto the ski slope or onto

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780
just happens onto the ski slope or onto
 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.660
just happens onto the ski slope or onto

themselves interestingly enough these

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660
themselves interestingly enough these
 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.010
themselves interestingly enough these
people are also very socially connected

people are also very socially connected
 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.570
people are also very socially connected
I've talked to a lot of survivors who

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580
I've talked to a lot of survivors who
 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.820
I've talked to a lot of survivors who
said that at the moment of truth they

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830
said that at the moment of truth they
 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.230
said that at the moment of truth they
said to themselves you know I have to

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240
said to themselves you know I have to
 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.450

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.320
this to my wife if I died it would be
horrible for her they always had some

in other words they had a motivation to
 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.770
in other words they had a motivation to
get there so this was a very important

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780
get there so this was a very important
 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.470
get there so this was a very important
key and in the book deep survival I go

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480
key and in the book deep survival I go
 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.860
key and in the book deep survival I go
through sort of 12 traits of good

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870
through sort of 12 traits of good
 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.080
through sort of 12 traits of good
survivors that that I go into a lot more

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090
survivors that that I go into a lot more
 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.030
survivors that that I go into a lot more
depth with but these are the types of

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040
depth with but these are the types of
 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.150
depth with but these are the types of
things that we found generally
