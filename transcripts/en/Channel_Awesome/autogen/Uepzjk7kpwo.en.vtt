story as far as I know I see a lot of
 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.550
story as far as I know I see a lot of
people you know commenting saying it's

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
people you know commenting saying it's
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.289
people you know commenting saying it's

it doesn't seem to be furthering it um
but it does establish that there's more

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
but it does establish that there's more
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.990

going after them it gives them a little

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910
going after them it gives them a little
 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.090
going after them it gives them a little
bit more of a life and when you do that

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100
bit more of a life and when you do that
 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.880
