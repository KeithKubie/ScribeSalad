00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:01.931
- [Voiceover] What I want
to do in this video is get

00:00:01.931 --> 00:00:05.112
a little bit of experience,
see a few examples

00:00:05.112 --> 00:00:07.434
of trying to roughly
estimate the square root

00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:09.825
of non-perfect squares.

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:11.845
So let's say that I had,

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.909
if I wanted to estimate
the square root of 32.

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.161
And in particular, I'm just curious,

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:23.161
between what two integers
will this square root lie?

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.615
Well one way to think about
it is 32 is in between

00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:27.124
what perfect squares?

00:00:27.124 --> 00:00:29.770
We see 32 is, actually let me

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.976
make sure I have some
space for future examples.

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:35.042
So 32, what's the perfect square below 32?

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:38.641
So the greatest perfect
square below 32 is 25.

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:41.497
32 is greater than 25.

00:00:41.497 --> 00:00:43.238
That's five squared.

00:00:43.238 --> 00:00:44.933
So maybe I should write it this way.

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:48.323
So five squared is less than 32

00:00:48.323 --> 00:00:51.526
and then 32, what's the next
perfect square after 32?

00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:54.267
Well 32 is less than 36.

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:57.250
So we could say 32 is
less than six squared.

00:00:58.184 --> 00:00:59.856
So if you were to take the square root

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:01.225
of all of these sides right over here,

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:03.362
we could say that instead of here

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:04.824
we have all of the values squared,

00:01:04.824 --> 00:01:06.241
but instead, if we took the square root,

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:09.282
we could say five is going to be less than

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:12.742
the square root of 32, which is less than,

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:14.275
which is less than six.

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:16.853
Notice, to go from here to here,

00:01:17.647 --> 00:01:19.854
to go from here to here, and here to here,

00:01:19.854 --> 00:01:21.432
all we did is we squared things,

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:23.196
we raised everything to the second power.

00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:25.913
But the inequality should still hold.

00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:28.259
So the square root of 32 should be between

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.884
five and six.

00:01:29.884 --> 00:01:32.671
It's going to be five point something.

00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:34.226
Let's do another example.

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:37.152
Let's say we wanted to estimate,

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:39.217
we want to say between what two integers

00:01:39.217 --> 00:01:43.336
is the square root of 55?

00:01:44.318 --> 00:01:45.733
Well we can do the same idea.

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:46.814
Let's square it.

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:49.583
So if we square the square root of 55,

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:51.825
we're just gonna get to 55.

00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:52.616
We're just going to get,

00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:53.948
let me do that in the same color,

00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:56.066
55.

00:01:56.066 --> 00:02:00.198
So okay, 55 is between
which two perfect squares?

00:02:00.198 --> 00:02:03.497
So the perfect square that is below 55,

00:02:03.497 --> 00:02:05.261
or I could say the greatest perfect square

00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:07.606
that is less than 55.

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:11.925
Let's see, six squared is
36 and seven squared is 49,

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:13.735
eight squared is 64.

00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:17.565
So it would be 49.

00:02:17.565 --> 00:02:19.681
I could write that as seven squared.

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.283
Let me write that, that is the
same thing as seven squared.

00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:23.699
And what's the next
perfect square above it?

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:24.605
Well we just figured it out.

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:28.250
Seven squared is 49, eight
squared is larger than 55,

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.400
it's 64.

00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:33.329
So this is going to be less than 64,

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.814
which is eight squared.

00:02:35.814 --> 00:02:38.970
And of course 55, just to
make it clear what's going on.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.662
55 is the square root of 55 squared.

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.844
That's kind of by
definition, it's going to be

00:02:45.844 --> 00:02:48.445
the square root of 55 squared.

00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:51.022
And so the square root of 55
is going to be between what?

00:02:51.022 --> 00:02:53.077
It's going to be between seven and eight.

00:02:54.198 --> 00:02:57.379
So seven is less than
the square root of 55,

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.142
which is less than eight.

00:03:00.142 --> 00:03:01.209
So once again, this is just

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.184
an interesting way to think about,

00:03:03.184 --> 00:03:04.949
what would you, if someone
said the square root of 55 and

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.435
at first you're like, "Oh,
uh, I don't know what that is.

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:08.407
"I don't have a calculator,"
et cetera et cetera.

00:03:08.407 --> 00:03:09.778
You're like, "Oh wait, wait,
that's going to be between

00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:13.144
"49 and 64, so it's going to
be seven point something."

00:03:13.144 --> 00:03:15.235
It's going to be seven point something.

00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:17.950
And you can even get a rough
estimate of seven point what

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.318
based on how far away
it is from 49 and 64.

00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:23.988
You can begin to approximate things.

00:03:23.988 --> 00:03:25.505
Let's do one more example.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.549
Let's say we wanted to figure out

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.560
where does the square root of 123 lie?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.022
And like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:03:34.022 --> 00:03:35.160
and try to think about it yourself.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.500
Between what two integers does this lie?

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:42.962
Well, if we were to
square it, you get to 123.

00:03:42.962 --> 00:03:46.260
And what's the perfect square that is

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.768
the greatest perfect square less than 123?

00:03:48.768 --> 00:03:50.740
Let's see, 10 squared is 100.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.552
11 squared is 121.

00:03:52.552 --> 00:03:54.548
12 squared is 144.

00:03:54.548 --> 00:03:56.291
So 11 squared.

00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.287
So 123, so we could write

00:03:58.287 --> 00:04:02.183
121 is less than 123, which is

00:04:02.183 --> 00:04:04.901
less than 144,

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.085
that's 12 squared.

00:04:06.085 --> 00:04:08.893
So if we take the square
roots we could write

00:04:08.893 --> 00:04:13.004
that 11 is less than
the square root of 123,

00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:15.789
which is less than 144.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:16.859
So once again,

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.088
what's the square root of 123?

00:04:18.088 --> 00:04:20.318
It's going to be 11 point something.

00:04:20.318 --> 00:04:22.199
And in fact, it's going to be closer to 11

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.267
than it's going to be to 12.

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:26.703
123 is a lot closer to
121 than it is to 144.

00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:30.209
So it might be, I don't know,
11.1, something like that.

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:31.835
I don't know if that's exactly
right, we would have to

00:04:31.835 --> 00:04:32.973
check that on the calculator.

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:34.087
But hopefully this gives you,

00:04:34.087 --> 00:04:35.318
oops I,

00:04:35.318 --> 00:04:37.454
that actually will be less than 144.

00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:39.079
But if we want to think about
what consecutive integers

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.982
is that be between, it's going
to be a 12 right over there.

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:43.398
Almost made a...

00:04:43.398 --> 00:04:44.652
Well anyway, you get the idea.

00:04:44.652 --> 00:04:46.086
Hopefully you enjoyed that.
