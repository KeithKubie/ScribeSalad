00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.960
&gt;&gt;Do you think the economy will effect the
environment in 2009 in terms of global priority?

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:16.430
&gt;&gt;DR.Adelegan: yeah, I know there will be
some impact, especially to the issue of climate

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.399
change. And we know that in Africa it's not
good to have much impact on other parts of

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:28.839
the world with respect to climate change.
And Africa has challenges which includes poverty,

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:38.449
all kinds of conflicts , problems. But with
the issue of environment having to meet with

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.070
issue of the climate, the environments that
the global economy challenge is likely to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.670
make case in Africa to be worse than it is.
But at the same time with the discussion that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.749
has been going on, with innovation exists
gooder in Africa, I think that with innovations

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.809
coming up Africa should be able to litigate
and to get some of these challenges but not

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.860
completely. We'll still have a lot of these
issues to handle.
