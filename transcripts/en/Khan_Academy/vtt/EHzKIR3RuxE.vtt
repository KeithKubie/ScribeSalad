00:00:00.591 --> 00:00:02.976
- [Instructor] What we're going
to talk about in this video

00:00:02.976 --> 00:00:06.505
are three theorems that are
sometimes collectively known as

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:08.088
existence theorems.

00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:11.046
So the first that we're
going to talk about

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:13.885
is the intermediate value theorem.

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:15.327
And the common thread here,

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:17.272
all of the existence theorems, say,

00:00:17.272 --> 00:00:19.942
hey, we're looking for
something over an interval.

00:00:19.942 --> 00:00:23.465
There exists an x value, between a and b,

00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:25.681
where something interesting happens.

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:27.583
In the intermediate value theorem,

00:00:27.583 --> 00:00:31.588
we assume that if we're continuous
over the closed interval

00:00:31.588 --> 00:00:34.342
from a to b, and in fact all
of these existence theorems

00:00:34.342 --> 00:00:36.471
assume that our function is continuous

00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:38.847
over the closed interval from a to b,

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:43.014
then we take on every value
between f of a, and f of b,

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.753
or another way to think about it is,

00:00:45.753 --> 00:00:48.355
pick a value from f,
between f of a and f of b,

00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:51.074
including f of a, or f of b.

00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:53.074
Let's call that value l.

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:57.540
The intermediate value
theorem tells us that there,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.362
if we make the assumption
that f is continuous

00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:01.951
over this interval,

00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:04.995
then there must be a value between a and b

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:07.586
that takes on the value l.

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:10.699
And I challenge you, try to
draw a continuous function

00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:13.492
that goes from a, comma f of a,

00:01:13.492 --> 00:01:15.008
to b, comma f of b,

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.294
that does not go through l.

00:01:17.294 --> 00:01:19.900
If you're continuous
you've got to go through l.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.651
The only way that you can't go through,

00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:23.809
the only you could avoid going through l

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:25.421
is if you were discontinuous,

00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:27.106
if you had a discontinuity right there,

00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:28.549
then you could avoid going through l,

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.827
but we're assuming that we're
continuous over the interval.

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:33.186
And so here, it's pretty intuitive,

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:34.962
that if you're continuous,

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:36.295
there exists a c

00:01:37.215 --> 00:01:38.764
between

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:41.508
a and b, including it could be a or b,

00:01:41.508 --> 00:01:43.904
that takes on any of those values,

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:46.404
and in this case, this particular value

00:01:46.404 --> 00:01:49.589
that sits between f of a, and f of b.

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:51.752
So that's the first existence theorem.

00:01:51.752 --> 00:01:54.252
The second is what's often known as

00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:56.799
the extreme value theorem.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.502
And this one is similarly
intuitive, I think.

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:01.745
Once again, it assumes
that f is continuous

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:05.260
over a comma, over this closed interval.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.316
But here, we say look,

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:09.831
if it is continuous over
that closed interval,

00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:12.735
then there exists,
that's why they're called

00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:14.324
existence theorems,

00:02:14.324 --> 00:02:16.501
there exists values between a and b,

00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:18.474
and it could happen at a or b,

00:02:18.474 --> 00:02:21.244
where the function takes on a maximum

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:24.533
and there's a value between a and b,

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:26.629
where the function
takes on a minimum value

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.364
over that interval.

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:30.375
So once again, try to draw a function

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:33.370
that does not take on a
minimum and maximum value

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.711
over that interval.

00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:37.387
If I just draw a straight line here,

00:02:37.387 --> 00:02:40.551
well then the maximum
value happens when x is b,

00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.956
the minimum value happens when x is a.

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:44.373
If I do something

00:02:45.872 --> 00:02:46.705
like that,

00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:49.479
the maximum value

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.724
occurs, once again, it is
occurring in this interval,

00:02:52.724 --> 00:02:54.908
it's occurring right here at c,

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.441
and then the minimum
value is occurring at a.

00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:00.073
If I draw something like,

00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:01.571
let me draw it like this,

00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:04.005
if I draw something like this,

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:07.565
then the minimum value is
occurring at this x value,

00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:11.029
and then the maximum value
is occurring at that x value.

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.881
This is just saying that they exist,

00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:14.388
they exist over that interval,

00:03:14.388 --> 00:03:16.222
and it might happen at
a, it might happen at b.

00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:18.669
And once again, the only way
I can construct something

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.410
where these maximum or minimum values,

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.651
these extreme values don't exist,

00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.242
is if I make it discontinuous.

00:03:25.242 --> 00:03:27.294
So, for example, what if I had a graph

00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:28.627
that looked like

00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:32.726
right at where we thought
we were gonna have

00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:35.342
a maximum value, we're discontinuous?

00:03:35.342 --> 00:03:37.779
Well now, you don't have
a clear maximum value.

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.267
Similarly I could do something like this,

00:03:40.267 --> 00:03:43.396
where now we do not have
a clear minimum value,

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:45.675
and so there does not exist an x

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:48.154
where the function
takes on a minimum value

00:03:48.154 --> 00:03:49.959
in that interval.

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.370
But once again, we are assuming
that we are continuous,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.137
and so we will find these extreme values,

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:57.556
and we have other videos where
we go into much more depth

00:03:57.556 --> 00:03:59.209
on it.

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.323
Last, but not least,

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.448
to complete the trifecta,

00:04:01.448 --> 00:04:03.458
we have the mean value theorem,

00:04:03.458 --> 00:04:05.200
and this one is also intuitive.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.415
It starts going into differentiatability

00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:08.902
in the derivative,

00:04:08.902 --> 00:04:10.819
and it adds an extra constraint for us.

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.978
Above and beyond saying
that we're continuous

00:04:12.978 --> 00:04:14.575
over the closed interval,

00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:16.438
we also assume that we're differentiable

00:04:16.438 --> 00:04:17.913
over the open interval.

00:04:17.913 --> 00:04:19.604
If you're differentiable over an interval,

00:04:19.604 --> 00:04:21.609
it does mean that you're continuous,

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.897
but if you're continuous,

00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:24.809
it does not necessarily mean
that you're differentiable.

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:26.293
And all this tells us is,

00:04:26.293 --> 00:04:28.855
if I have a continuous and
differentiable function

00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:30.815
over this interval,

00:04:30.815 --> 00:04:32.738
differentiable over the open interval,

00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:34.765
continuous over the closed interval,

00:04:34.765 --> 00:04:36.293
so let me draw that,

00:04:36.293 --> 00:04:38.640
so let me draw something like this,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.554
and if I were to compute
the average rate of change

00:04:40.554 --> 00:04:42.247
from a comma f of a

00:04:42.247 --> 00:04:43.962
to b comma f of b,

00:04:43.962 --> 00:04:47.871
so the average rate of change
I will do in this pink color,

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:51.531
so that would be the slope
of this line right over here,

00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:53.222
that would be the average rate of change,

00:04:53.222 --> 00:04:54.943
the slope of that line.

00:04:54.943 --> 00:04:56.597
The mean value theorem tells us

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:58.698
that there exists a point c

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:01.381
where the derivative of
our function at that point,

00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:03.751
the slope of the tangent
line, at that point,

00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:06.624
is the same as the average rate of change.

00:05:06.624 --> 00:05:07.940
And we could eyeball that here,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.531
it looks like for this curve,

00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:11.255
there's actually several points

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:13.105
where the derivative looks the same

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:14.678
as the average rate of change.

00:05:14.678 --> 00:05:16.218
Maybe right over here the
slope of the tangent line

00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:18.625
looks like it has the exact same slope

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:20.280
as the average rate of change.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.385
So that could be our c, it exists!

00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:23.676
We feel good it exists.

00:05:23.676 --> 00:05:25.764
But there could more than one value.

00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:28.358
Right over there, it looks like the slope

00:05:28.358 --> 00:05:30.330
is the same as the average rate of change,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.998
that could also be our c right over there.

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:35.200
So how could we construct something

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.500
where that isn't true?

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.345
Well, if we don't assume differentiability

00:05:38.345 --> 00:05:39.658
over the interval,

00:05:39.658 --> 00:05:41.251
we can actually find a continuous function

00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:42.683
where it isn't true,

00:05:42.683 --> 00:05:44.866
where you can find a
point whose derivative

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:47.105
is the same as the average rate of change.

00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:49.356
So, for example, here's my counter case.

00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:52.567
Maybe something like an
absolute value function,

00:05:52.567 --> 00:05:54.883
where the average rate,

00:05:54.883 --> 00:05:58.261
where the average rate of change,

00:05:58.261 --> 00:06:01.092
let me draw it a little bit better.

00:06:01.092 --> 00:06:03.486
So this was some type of
an absolute value function,

00:06:03.486 --> 00:06:05.328
where this is linear up to this point,

00:06:05.328 --> 00:06:06.768
and then linear up to this point.

00:06:06.768 --> 00:06:08.788
We're not going to be
differentiable over here,

00:06:08.788 --> 00:06:11.344
so not, the derivative
isn't defined at this point

00:06:11.344 --> 00:06:13.219
right over here.

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:15.959
Well now, you can't, at no
point over this interval

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.747
is the slope of the tangent line

00:06:18.747 --> 00:06:20.497
the same as the slope conn--,

00:06:20.497 --> 00:06:23.455
or is the same as the
average rate of change.

00:06:23.455 --> 00:06:25.230
You might try to make an argument that

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.691
oh, maybe right over there,

00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:28.339
but we're not differentiable over there.

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:29.864
There isn't a well-defined tangent line,

00:06:29.864 --> 00:06:31.712
or there isn't a well-defined tangent line

00:06:31.712 --> 00:06:33.469
and a well-defined derivative or slope

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:34.969
of a tangent line.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.811
So in other videos we will go into depth.

00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:39.675
But it's nice to look
at them all together.

00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:41.356
See what they are all talking about.

00:06:41.356 --> 00:06:43.130
They're all talking about
the existence of an x value

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.774
in the interval where
something interesting happens,

00:06:45.774 --> 00:06:48.523
where we take on a value
between f of a and f of b,

00:06:48.523 --> 00:06:50.692
where we take on extreme values,

00:06:50.692 --> 00:06:53.368
or where the derivative at that point

00:06:53.368 --> 00:06:55.507
is the same as the average rate of change

00:06:55.507 --> 00:06:57.007
over the interval.
