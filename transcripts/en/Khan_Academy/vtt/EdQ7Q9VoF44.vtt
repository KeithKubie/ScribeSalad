00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome back.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.140
We're finally using the Laplace
Transform to do

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.460
something useful.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.880
In the first part of this
problem, we just had this

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.850
fairly straightforward
differential equation.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.730
And I know it's a little bit
frustrating right now, because

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.650
you're like, this is such an
easy one to solve using the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.260
characteristic equation.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.640
Why are we doing Laplace
Transforms?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.410
Well I just want to show you
that they can solve even these

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.660
problems. But later on there
are going to be classes of

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.650
problems that, frankly, our
traditional methods aren't as

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.500
good as the Laplace Transform.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.790
But anyway, how did
we solve this?

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.850
We just took the Laplace
Transform of both sides of

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.870
this equation.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.540
We got all of this hairy mess.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.145
We used the property of the
derivative of functions, where

00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:38.030
you take the Laplace Transform,
and we ended up,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.100
after doing a lot of algebra
essentially, we got this.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.110
We got the Laplace Transform of
y is equal to this thing.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.330
We just took the Laplace
Transform of both sides and

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.170
manipulated algebraically.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.540
So now our task in this video
is to figure out what y's

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.786
Laplace Transform
is this thing?

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.070
And essentially what we're
trying to do, is we're trying

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.250
to take the inverse Laplace
Transform of both sides of

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.810
this equation.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.010
So another way to say it, we
could say that y-- if we take

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.247
the inverse Laplace Transform
of both sides-- we could say

00:01:05.247 --> 00:01:09.190
that y is equal to the
inverse Laplace

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.260
Transform of this thing.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.372
2s plus 13, over s squared
plus 5s plus 6.

00:01:19.372 --> 00:01:21.780
Now we'll eventually actually
learn the formal definition of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.600
the inverse Laplace Transform.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.040
How do you go from the s
domain to the t domain?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.210
Or how do you go from
the frequency

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.880
domain to the time domain?

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.010
We're not going to worry
about that right now.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.330
What we're going to do is we're
going to get this into a

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.750
form that we recognize,
and say, oh,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.180
I know those functions.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.200
That's the Laplace Transform
of whatever and whatever.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.270
And then we'll know what y is.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.230
So let's try to do that.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.750
So what we're going to use is
something that you probably

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.970
haven't used since Algebra two,
which is I think when

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.720
it's taught in, you know,
eighth, ninth,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.680
or 10th grade, depending.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.740
And you finally see it now in
differential equations that it

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.640
actually has some use.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.450
Let me write it.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.780
We're going to use partial
fraction expansion.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.080
And I'll do a little primer
on that, in case you don't

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.740
remember it.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.539
So anyway, let's just factor
the bottom part right here.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.510
And you'll see where I'm
going with this.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.130
So if I factor the bottom, I get
s plus 2 times s plus 3.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.420
And what we want to do, is we
want to rewrite this fraction

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.980
as the sum of 2-- I
guess you could

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.570
call it partial fractions.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.230
I think that's why it's called
partial fraction expansion.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.110
So we want to write this as a
sum of A over s plus 2, plus B

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.250
over s plus 3.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.280
And if we can do this, then--
and bells might already be

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.710
ringing in your head-- we know
that these things that look

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.650
like this are the Laplace
Transform of functions that

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.960
we've already solved for.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.110
And I'll do a little review
on that in a second.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.680
But anyway, how do we
figure out A and B?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.800
Well if we were to actually add
A and B, if we were to--

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.850
let's do a little aside right
here-- so if we said that A--

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.480
so if we were to give them a
common denominator, which is

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.295
this, s plus 2 times s plus 3.

00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:22.750
Then what would A become?

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.350
We'd have to multiply A
times s plus 3, right?

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.030
So we'd get As plus 3A.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.220
This, as I've written it right
now, is the same thing as A

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.980
over s plus 2.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.080
You could cancel out an s plus
3 in the top and the bottom.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.080
And now we're going to
add the B to it.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.500
So plus-- I'll do that in a
different color-- plus-- well,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.110
if we have this as the
denominator, we could multiply

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.140
the numerator and
the denominator

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.100
by s plus 2, right?

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.890
To get B times s, plus
2B, and that's going

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.470
to equal this thing.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.360
And all I did is I added
these two fractions.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.350
Nothing fancier than there.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.920
That was Algebra two.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.230
Actually, I think I should
do an actual

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.335
video on that as well.

00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:11.410
But that's going to
equal this thing.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:20.899
2s plus 13, all of that over
s plus 2 times s plus 3.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.250
Notice in all differential
equations, the hairiest part's

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.690
always the algebra.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.780
So now what we do
is we match up.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.110
We say, well, let's add
the s terms here.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.440
And we could say that the
numerators have to equal each

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.350
other, because the denominators
are equal.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:51.960
So we have A plus Bs plus 3A
plus 2B is equal to 2s plus B.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.110
So the coefficient on s, on
the right-hand side, is 2.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.910
The coefficient on the left-hand
side is A plus B, so

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.980
we know that A plus
B is equal to 2.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.270
And then on the right-hand side,
we see 3A plus 2B must

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.150
be equal to-- oh,
this is a 13.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.930
Did I say B?

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.190
This is a 13.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.530
That's a 13.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.890
It looks just like a B, right?

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.100
That was 2s plus 13.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:28.640
Anyway, so on the right-hand
side I get, it was 3A plus 2B

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.150
is equal to 13.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.790
Now we have two equations
with two unknowns,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.610
and what do we get?

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.250
I know this is very tiresome,
but it'll be

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.260
satisfying in the end.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.460
Because you'll actually
solve something

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.515
with the Laplace Transform.

00:05:40.515 --> 00:05:43.660
So let's multiply the top
equation by 2, or let's just

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.350
say minus 2.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.320
So we get minus 2A minus
2B equals minus 4.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.240
And then we get-- add the two
equations-- you get A is equal

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.170
to-- these cancel out--
A is equal to 9.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.000
Great.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.530
If A is equal to 9, what
is B equal to?

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.520
B is equal to 9 plus
what is equal to 2?

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.130
Or 2 minus 9 is minus 7.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.160
And we have done some serious
simplification.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.770
Because now we can rewrite this
whole expression as the

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:23.390
Laplace Transform of y is equal
to A over s plus 2, is

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:34.060
equal to 9 over s plus 2,
minus 7 over s plus 3.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.810
Or another way of writing it, we
could write it as equal to

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:47.620
9 times 1 over s plus 2, minus
7 times 1 over s plus 3.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.630
Why did I take the trouble
to do this?

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.920
Well hopefully, you'll recognize
this was actually

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.010
the second Laplace Transform
we figured out.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.290
What was that?

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.950
I'll write it down here just
so you remember it.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:11.970
It was the Laplace Transform of
e to the at, was equal to 1

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.000
over s minus a.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.070
That was the second Laplace
Transform we figured out.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.200
So this is interesting.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.880
This is the Laplace
Transform of what?

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.730
So if we were to take the
inverse Laplace Transform--

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.900
actually let me just
stay consistent.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:32.820
So that means that this is the
Laplace Transform of y, is

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.360
equal to 9 times the Laplace
Transform of what?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.850
If we just do pattern matching,
if this is s minus

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.080
a, then a is minus 2.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.220
So 9 times the Laplace
Transform of e

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.970
to the minus 2t.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.380
Does that make sense?

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.900
Take this, put it in this one,
which we figured out, and you

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.190
get 1 over s plus 2.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.205
And let me clean this up a
little bit, because I'm going

00:07:56.205 --> 00:07:57.455
to need that real estate.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.120
I'll write this.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.270
I'll leave that there, because
we'll still use that.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.800
And then we have minus 7 times--
this is the Laplace

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.500
Transform of what?

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.190
This is the Laplace Transform
of e to the minus 3t.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:25.190
This pattern matching, you're
like, wow, if you saw this,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.270
you would go to your Laplace
Transform table, if you didn't

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.640
remember it, you'd see this.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.430
You're like, wow, that looks
a lot like that.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.000
I just have to figure
out what a is.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.960
I have s plus 3.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.320
I have s minus a.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.520
So in this case, a is
equal to minus 3.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.894
So if a is equal to minus 3,
this is the Laplace Transform

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:42.760
of e to the minus 3t.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.390
So now we can take the inverse
Laplace-- actually,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.070
before we do that.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.750
We know that because the Laplace
Transform is a linear

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.760
operator-- and actually now I
can delete this down here-- we

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.140
know that the Laplace Transform
is a linear

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.110
operator, so we can
write this.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.710
And you normally wouldn't go
through all of these steps.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.530
I just really want to make you
understand what we're doing.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.140
So we could say that this is the
same thing as the Laplace

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:16.700
Transform of 9e to the minus 2t,
minus 7e to the minus 3t.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.860
Now we have something
interesting.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.400
The Laplace Transform of y
is equal to the Laplace

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.830
Transform of this.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:30.570
Well if that's the case, then
y must be equal to 9e to the

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.320
minus 2t, minus 7e
to the minus 3t.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.080
And I never proved to you, but
the Laplace Transform is

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.300
actually a 1:1 Transformation.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.330
That if a function's Laplace
Transform, if I take a

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.420
function against the Laplace
Transform, and then if I were

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.810
take the inverse Laplace
Transform, the only function

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.820
whose Laplace Transform
that that is, is

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.710
that original function.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.550
It's not like two different
functions can have the same

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.050
Laplace Transform.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.680
Anyway, a couple of things
to think about here.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.070
Notice, we had that thing that
kind of looked like a

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.980
characteristic equation
pop up here and there.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.340
And we still have to solve a
system of two equations with

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:08.850
two unknowns.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:13.750
Those are both things that we
had to do when we solve an

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.030
initial value problem, when we
use just traditional, the

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.340
characteristic equation.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.150
But here it happened
all at once.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.900
And frankly it was a little bit
hairier because we had to

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.040
do all this partial fraction
expansion.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.050
But it's pretty neat.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.210
The Laplace Transform got
us something useful.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.970
In the next video I'll actually
do a non-homogeneous

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.850
equation, and show you that the
Laplace Transform applies

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.830
equally well there.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.680
So it's kind of a more
consistent theory of solving

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.730
differential equations, instead
of kind of guessing

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.140
solutions, and solving for
coefficients and all of that.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.100
See you in the next video.
