00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:01.425
- [Voiceover] So let's see if we can find

00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:02.852
the derivative with respect to x,

00:00:02.852 --> 00:00:05.056
with either x times the cosine of x.

00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:06.320
And like always, pause this video

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.486
and give it a go on your own

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:09.402
before we work through it.

00:00:09.402 --> 00:00:11.074
So when you look at this you might say,

00:00:11.074 --> 00:00:11.907
"well, I know how to find

00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:13.682
"the derivative with e to the x,"

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.221
that's infact just e to the x.

00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:16.687
And let me write this down.

00:00:16.687 --> 00:00:18.372
We know a few things.

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:22.095
We know the derivative
with respect to x of

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:23.576
e to the x.

00:00:23.576 --> 00:00:26.510
E to the x is e to the x.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.484
We know how to find the
derivative cosine of x.

00:00:29.484 --> 00:00:33.364
The derivative with
respect to x of cosine of x

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:36.200
is equal to negative sine of x.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.765
But, how do we find the
derivative of their product?

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:41.745
Well as you can imagine,
this might involve

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:42.934
the product rule.

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:43.922
And let me just write down

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:45.693
the product rule generally first.

00:00:45.693 --> 00:00:48.614
So if we take the
derivative with respect to x

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:52.510
of the first expression in terms of x,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.343
so this is, we could
call this u of x times

00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:00.257
another expression that involves x.

00:01:00.257 --> 00:01:01.757
So u times v of x.

00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:05.664
This is going to be equal to,

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:07.310
and I'm color-coding it so we can really

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.508
keep track of things.

00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:11.728
This is going to be
equal to the derivative

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:13.728
of the first expression.

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:18.645
So I could write that as u prime of x

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:21.650
times just the second expression
not the derivative of it,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.820
just the second expression.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.153
So times v of x and then we have plus

00:01:28.773 --> 00:01:30.792
the first expression, not its derivative,

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:32.475
just the first expression.

00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:36.773
U of x times the derivative
of the second expression.

00:01:36.773 --> 00:01:39.405
Times the derivative of
the second expression.

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:40.620
So the way you remember it is,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.015
you have these two things here,

00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:44.534
you're going to end up
with two different terms.

00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:46.280
In each of them, you're going to take

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.274
the derivative of one of
them, but not the other one,

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.649
and then the other one
you'll take the derivative of

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.698
the other one, but not the first one.

00:01:51.698 --> 00:01:56.272
So, the derivative of u
times v is u prime times v,

00:01:56.272 --> 00:01:58.022
plus u times v prime.

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:00.196
When you just look at it like that,

00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:01.395
it seems a little bit abstract and

00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:02.735
that might even be a little bit confusing,

00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:05.204
but that's why we have
a tangible example here

00:02:05.204 --> 00:02:06.996
and I color-coded intentionally.

00:02:06.996 --> 00:02:11.163
We could say that u of x
is equal to e to the x.

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:16.112
And v of x is equal to the cosine of x.

00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:19.195
So v of x is equal to cosine of x.

00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:23.273
And if u of x is equal to e to the x,

00:02:23.273 --> 00:02:24.794
we know that the derivative of that

00:02:24.794 --> 00:02:26.678
with respect to x is still e to the x.

00:02:26.678 --> 00:02:29.154
That's one of the most
magical things in mathematics.

00:02:29.154 --> 00:02:31.602
One of the things that makes e so special.

00:02:31.602 --> 00:02:36.037
So u prime of x is still
equal to e to the x.

00:02:36.037 --> 00:02:37.454
And v prime of x,

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.128
we know as negative sine of x.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:45.170
Negative sine of x, and so,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.681
what's this going to be equal to?

00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:48.347
This is going to be equal to

00:02:48.347 --> 00:02:50.803
the derivative of the first expression.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.664
So, the derivative of e
to the x which is just,

00:02:53.664 --> 00:02:56.687
e to the x, times the second expression,

00:02:56.687 --> 00:03:01.151
not taking it's derivative,
so times cosine of x.

00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.318
Plus the first expression,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.387
not taking its derivative, so e to the x,

00:03:10.197 --> 00:03:13.120
times the derivative of
the second expression.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.115
So, times the derivative of cosine of x

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:18.032
which is negative sine.

00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:20.496
Negative sine of x.

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:21.829
And it might be a little bit confusing,

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.060
because e to the x is its own derivative.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.094
This right over here, you can view this as

00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:27.800
this was the derivative as e to the x

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.156
which happens to be e to the x.

00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:31.145
That's what's exciting
about that expression,

00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:32.205
or that function.

00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:34.085
And then this is just e
to the x without taking

00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:36.549
it's derivative - they are
of course, the same thing.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.797
But anyway, now we can just simplify it.

00:03:38.797 --> 00:03:41.380
This is going to be equal to...

00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:47.218
We could write either as e
to the x times cosine of x,

00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:52.141
times cosine of x minus e to the x.

00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:55.926
E to the x times sine of x.

00:03:57.447 --> 00:03:59.384
Times sine of x.

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:01.038
Or, if you want, you could factor out

00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:02.549
an e to the x.

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.347
This is the same thing as

00:04:05.347 --> 00:04:09.514
e to the x times cosine
of x minus sine of x.

00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:14.184
Cosine of x minus sine of x.

00:04:14.184 --> 00:04:17.246
So hopefully this makes the product rule

00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:19.050
a little bit more tangible.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.421
And once you have this in your tool belt,

00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:23.228
there's a whole broader class of functions

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:26.863
and expressions that we
can start to differentiate.
