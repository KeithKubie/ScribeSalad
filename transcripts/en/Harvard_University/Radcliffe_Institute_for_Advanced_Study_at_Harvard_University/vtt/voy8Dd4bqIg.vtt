00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.130
- Welcome to everybody.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.730
And I'm sorry we're
so tightly packed.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.010
But I'm also gratified
that we have so many people

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.510
to show up for this.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.950
So my name is John Huth.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.010
And I am a Radcliffe
Ventures faculty member.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.620
So that means that I help put
together programs at Radcliffe.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.350
My main focus is
on the sciences.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.910
And this year we, had a science
symposium in October on oceans,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.540
and then have a series of
themed lectures associated

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.170
with oceans.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.390
And this the last in the series.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.540
This is close to my last
official act as a Radcliffe

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.680
Ventures faculty.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.620
And I will just note that
Alissa Goodman over here

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.150
will be taking my role.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.020
So you'll see her at the podium
in future Radcliffe events.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.760
So on to the main event--

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.230
so a lot of cultures
use waves in some way

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.070
as a navigational
aid on the oceans.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.010
This is fairly well-known.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.380
But as far as I'm aware, the
use of waves in navigation

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.830
really reached its pinnacle
in the Marshall Islands.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.140
And it fascinates people.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.240
It fascinated me.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.250
When you look at some
of the artifacts that

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.700
are used to teach people,
you're wondering, what is that?

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.790
And what does that mean.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.290
And so on.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.500
And so the fascination
is understandable.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.950
And trying to tease apart what
the Marshallese navigators did,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.880
how they were taught, and how
they conceptualized using waves

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.850
on the open ocean
really requires

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.920
an interdisciplinary approach.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.940
And I was introduced
to this, and started

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.270
collaborating with one of the
first of our speakers, Joe

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.290
Genz, who is an anthropologist
at the University of Hawaii.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.070
And he introduced
me to Alson Kelen,

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.150
who runs an outfit called
Canoe's of the Marshall

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.330
Islands, and spent
quite a bit of time

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.370
understanding the traditions
of canoe building.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.310
And he'll talk about his
enterprise with that.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.000
And he acted as our host
and navigator on a voyage

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.930
that we took.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.160
And Gerbrant van Vledder, who
is from the University of Delft,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.330
and he specializes in the
numerical simulations of waves.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.855
So we all assembled together
in the Marshall Islands,

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:33.400
in Majuro in the capitol, talked
to one of the last surviving

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.220
indigenous navigators, who
unfortunately passed away

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.630
in January.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.080
And then we took
this trip from Majuro

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.160
to a neighboring atoll, Aur,
and back again and documented as

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.460
best we could to try to
understand the traditions.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.760
And Monday and Tuesday,
we held a workshop

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.500
to go over our
findings, because it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.020
took a while to crunch the
numbers, and to think about it.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.370
And so now, we met
yesterday and today,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.290
talked about what we saw.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.210
Some new information
came out as we

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.040
started talking to each other.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.270
We're going to write a paper.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.230
And we have some ideas about a
forthcoming journey that we're

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.900
going to make, where we're
going to try to systematize

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.310
some of our findings.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.260
OK, so thank you for being here.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.560
And I turn it over Joe.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.080
All right, hello, everyone.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.370
Good afternoon.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.480
My name is Joe Genz.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.211
And as John said, I'm
an assistant professor

00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:36.710
at the University
of Hawaii at Hilo.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.330
And I've been connected to
this project since about 2001

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.880
when I first started
as a graduate student.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.860
So what I'm going to try
to do today is just back

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.400
up a little bit
and talk about some

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.820
of the context that started the
development of this project,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.090
that will then lead into
what Alson, and Gerbrant,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.634
and John will talk about.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.300
So the first thing
to note is that we're

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.920
talking about wave piloting.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.960
But this is really a
system of navigation.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.360
And, in particular,
this is practiced,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.890
and has been practiced
historically,

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.330
in a few places in
the Pacific Islands,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.750
what the residents of
that group in the world

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.270
refers to as Oceania.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.400
And anthropologists have
been particularly drawn

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.240
to this system of voyaging,
which really encompasses

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.910
a whole range of things,
from canoe building,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.390
to sailing, to astronomy, to
weather forecasting, and then

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.230
the kind of ultimate domain
of knowledge of navigation.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.730
The image that we're
showing up here

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.130
today is the picture from
our canoe voyage in 2015.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.930
And the other image
from the Bishop Museum

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.050
in Honolulu from 1883,
to me, represents

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.690
a very strong
continuity of knowledge

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.890
in this particular case.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.650
And so anthropologists have
looked at canoe voyaging

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.940
in a lot of different ways.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.000
Among them is looking at how
the canoes and the systems

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.820
of navigation could have allowed
for the two-way intentional

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.690
settlement to the Pacific, the
discovery, the exploration,

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.146
and the intentional
colonization of those islands.

00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:04.520
That's been a
large focus of what

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.460
anthropology has looked at.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.210
But in order to
understand that, to think

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.957
about that prehistoric
past, anthropologists

00:05:10.957 --> 00:05:13.040
have also needed to know
a lot about the knowledge

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.080
systems themselves.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.200
And so if we look back in time,
these voyaging traditions that

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.380
span the breadth of
Oceania, some of them

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.080
decline very dramatically
several hundred of years ago.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.840
Some places like
Hawaii, they basically

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.880
had to reinvent
and kind of relearn

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.980
their system of navigating
that basically died out

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.410
about 200 years ago.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.530
On another kind of
spectrum of voyaging,

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.100
in places like Satawal, which
is in the contemporary nation

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.800
state of the Federated
States of Micronesia,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.380
they practice voyaging
on a daily basis.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.810
It is part of the
fabric of their lives.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.820
And somewhere in the
middle between those two

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.760
in the spectrum of voyaging
is the Marshall Islands,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.680
where there are traditions that
are intact, to some degree.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.262
But there's also been
a very large decline.

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:04.970
So this is a map of
the Marshall Islands.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.200
It's a very large region.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.810
It encompasses 29 coral atolls
and five low-lying coral

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.360
islands that spread in an area
of about 750,000 square miles.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.500
So it's a very large area.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.990
When you look at
language distributions,

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.380
historical observations,
archaeological evidence,

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.570
it's very clear
that the Marshallese

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.440
had very strong voyaging
capabilities, as evidenced

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.070
by this historic map
that was produced

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.669
by a German explorer
named [INAUDIBLE] who

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.210
was part of a Russian
expedition, who

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.400
worked with navigators
to produce this map based

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.656
on their geographical knowledge.

00:06:42.656 --> 00:06:44.030
And another way
that we know this

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.640
is through the historically
documented stick charts.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.330
These were largely
collected and sent

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.920
to museums around
the world, largely

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.800
in Europe in the late 1800s.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.830
This was one in a
museum in Berlin.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.434
And some of what
this shows is you

00:06:59.434 --> 00:07:01.100
can make out some of
the different names

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.590
of the atolls in the Marshall
Islands all the way from Ebon

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.870
in the south, up to
Bikini in the north, which

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.070
is where Alson is from.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.910
So some of these
stick charts map out

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.640
wave patterns in relation
to the islands, sometimes

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.160
current formations.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.317
But those dark lines
that are labeled as okar,

00:07:19.317 --> 00:07:21.650
those are representing wave
patterns that would actually

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.400
be kind of like a sailing path
between different island pairs.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.350
And so some of
this does represent

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.200
large interaction spheres
between different island

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.720
groups.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.940
However, historically,
the Marshallese

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.071
have faced some of the most
intense moments of colonialism

00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:38.570
ever.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.270
In about 100 years, they
went through regimes

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.910
by the Spanish, then the
Germans, then the Japanese,

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.389
and then the Americans.

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:47.930
So there were a lot
of social changes

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.340
that happened from this.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.000
Missionization came in,
totally fundamentally altering

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.650
religious belief systems,
which impacted voyaging.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.210
Under the German
colonial administration

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.240
prior to World War I,
they put bans on voyaging,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.900
where it was illegal to
actually sail on canoes.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.550
And then right
after World War II,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.670
the US started a 12-year
program of nuclear testing

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.470
from 1946 to 1958, as part
of their nuclear weapons

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.970
testing era.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.490
And as this relates to what
we're talking about today,

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.480
the site where a lot of
these tests took place

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.700
is the atoll of Bikini.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.350
And this is one of the
images from that time period.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:34.090
And I don't have an image
up here of a different test.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.549
It was codenamed Bravo.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:40.409
It was the world's first weapons
grade thermonuclear detonation.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.640
And that took place
on March 1st, 1954.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.570
The fallout from that landed
on a neighboring atoll named

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:47.580
Bikini--

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.100
- Rongelap.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.200
- Sorry, of Rongelap, thank you.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.420
And there was a
whole series of tests

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.880
that went into place, such
as biomedical experimentation

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.980
without consent.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.370
And what this meant was
that the people of Rongelap

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.490
experienced a lot of
direct radiation exposure.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.274
And they have been since this--

00:09:05.274 --> 00:09:06.940
there's a very
complicated history here.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.810
But they're, essentially, off of
their atoll living as refugees,

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.480
in the sense of nuclear exodus,
because they can't live there

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.890
anymore.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.290
Related to our story
is on Rongelap,

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.255
this was a traditional
navigational school

00:09:19.255 --> 00:09:23.620
that, possibly if that
testing hadn't happened,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.619
there would have been probably
about 10 youth in the 1940s

00:09:27.619 --> 00:09:29.410
and '50s that would
have kept learning here

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:33.700
in a traditional style of
how to navigate by the waves.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.820
One of those young
people was a young boy

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.390
named Korent Joel, who later
became known as Captain Korent.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:44.230
And because of this
testing, he never

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.711
had the chance to
really fully become

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.210
a navigator, although he had a
lot of navigational knowledge

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.560
that he had learned.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.720
So fast forwarding, by the
time the 1990s rolls around,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.970
he is getting a lot older.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.850
There was finally
some appropriate ways

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.590
in the Marshalls
for him to start

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.910
to share some of his knowledge.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.816
He was beginning to have the
permission from his chiefs

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.190
that were governing
him about how

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.310
to talk about the navigational
knowledge that he knew.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.770
But, ultimately, he
was not a navigator.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.560
He had not taken a test that
would have allowed him to be

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.390
sanctioned as a navigator.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.010
And so he knew a
lot about the waves,

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.020
but not all of the system.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.230
So he actually had this
call, kind of invitation,

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.280
for a team of essentially
anthropologists and scientists

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.000
to come in to both
help him fulfill

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.420
his breadth of knowledge to
understand some of the wave

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.440
dynamics, but also to validate
and verify some of the ideas

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.990
behind his wave theories.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.860
And so, essentially, he
catapulted this program

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.710
as an invitation for
myself, initially,

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.040
to come in, to work
with Alson, which

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.610
he'll talk about right now.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.130
And that, ultimately,
his dream was

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.370
to have a physicist
and an oceanographer

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:04.030
come and help him understand
the theories underlying

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.000
how these waves were forming
that he was trying to use.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.490
And I'd just like to mention
this now that he passed away

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.020
in January of this year.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.050
So it's a pretty sad
time for the Marshallese.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.884
But his direct person
that he was teaching

00:11:16.884 --> 00:11:17.800
is sitting right here.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.750
So Alson Kelen, has
been his apprentice

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.477
that's been learning under him.

00:11:23.477 --> 00:11:25.060
And I just wanted
to highlight as well

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.230
that what we're talking about,
it is very time sensitive.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.720
So we were also working with
some elders from Rongelap.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.820
These were people that
were slightly older

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.120
than the navigator
Captain Korent Joel.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.400
This was his uncle, Isao
Eknilang, his aunt Lijohn

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.070
Eknilan, and another
relative, Willie Mewkto.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.970
Lijohn and Willie have
since passed away.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.680
Only Isao survives.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.890
So there still is this pocket
of traditional knowledge.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.360
But it's just barely
hanging in there.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.750
And so what we're
trying to do today

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.910
is not only learn
about with these waves

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.370
from a physical
oceanographic perspective.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.890
But we're also trying
to feed into Alson

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.920
to allow him the way--

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.790
to facilitate the ways that he
can perpetuate this knowledge.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.740
And with that, I'm going
to pass on to Alson.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.640
- I was really starting to enjoy
Joe's talk, then he finished.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:33.030
Before I do my two
minutes presentation,

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.570
I'm going to do a little chant.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:41.190
And this is a navigational chant
that I try to teach-- well,

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.940
I teach at the school,
and not just the chant,

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.070
but the definition of it,
and the meaning of it,

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.550
so the kids would feel
the cultural pride

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.550
and the self-esteem.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.095
Anyway, [CHANTING].

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.800
Usually, you'd say
this three times

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.160
to get their spirit going.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.270
Now, their spirit is gone.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:41.940
So 25 years ago, I actually
lived in Oregon before.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.500
And 25 years ago, I went
back to the Marshall's.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.040
As Joe mentioned, I
originated from Bikini Atoll.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.900
I actually lived
there for four years

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:57.480
before we got relocated
because this is the nuclear--

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.460
it was too radiated
for us to live there.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.070
So we moved to Majuro.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.480
And then I went to
high school in Hawaii.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.000
So I lived in
Oregon for a while.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.170
And 25 years ago, I went back.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:15.090
And I worked for the National
Museum in the Marshall's.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.610
I was very excited because,
one of the thing that when

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.860
I grew up in Bikini, one
of the things we had was we

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.110
had a sailing canoe.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.080
And my father used
to take me out a lot.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.240
And he would tell
me all these stories

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.610
about them voyaging between
Bikini, Rongelap, and Wotho.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:37.900
So that's-- it was like
already embedded in me.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.310
We didn't have TV.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.140
So in the evening, my
father would open his arm.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.660
And I would lay flat on
the arm, and close my eyes.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.640
And that was my TV.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.450
He would tell me the story.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:53.070
And the word for Marshallese,
we say, [MARSHALLESE]..

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:58.470
That mean little men, use
your arms as your pillow,

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.830
because when you use their
arm as a pillow, you learn,

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.230
you talk, and you learn.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.780
And it's funny, because
the canoe that we

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.740
use for our voyaging studies
is called [MARSHALLESE],,

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.940
which mean forehead
to forehead, you

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.800
share the knowledge, the skills.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.360
So when you lay your arm,
you [INAUDIBLE] on the arm,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.510
you actually exchange that.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:31.290
So 25 years ago, I was involved
in a documentation project.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.650
And our job was to go
from atoll to atolls

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.170
to document the step by
step construction of canoes.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.860
And our last
project I went to, I

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.680
was working with a colleague
of mine from San Diego.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.710
He was a surfer boy named
Dennis [? Alicio. ?]

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:55.210
All he knew was building
wooden boats, and go surfing.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.850
So him and we, we kind
of connect pretty well,

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.170
because all I knew at
the time was fishing.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:06.990
So we were in Ujae documenting
the canoeing culture.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.150
Most of the time,
you go into town.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.230
So that was kind of good for
me, because I could actually

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.580
directly learn my culture.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.620
But while we were doing all that
work all over the Marshall's, I

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.200
actually, especially
me, see a lot

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.480
of young people coming to the
program, coming to the site.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.900
And I was very happy,
because my thinking was, yes,

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:39.840
they are very into
learning their culture.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.200
I learned later that these young
people actually, a lot of them

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.030
are dropouts.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.150
A lot of them do not pass
the high school exam.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.550
And in the outer island in
the Marshall's, if you do not

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.940
pass the high school
exam, at the age of 14,

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.530
that's pretty much it.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:17:00.240
You get to start thinking about
making a living out of making

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.170
oil, or then starting a family.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.800
So my colleague and I,
says, you know what?

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.900
When we get to Majuro, we're
going to start a school.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.000
We have to start a
school of some sort.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.400
So when we went back to Majuro,
and we finished of our project

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.490
with the National Museum,
both of us were jobless.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.859
So we sat down and
said, well, what

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:29.040
do we know about
starting a school?

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.950
Pretty much zero.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.130
What kind of skills do we have?

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.240
Nothing.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.950
The only skill we
have was the skill

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.370
that we learn
traditionally, the skill

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:46.560
that was passed to
us from the masters.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.420
But I like to note that in
the Marshall's, the skill is

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.110
actually passed on from
generation to generation

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.160
with family.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:03.180
So you have to be adopted in
order to learn the skills.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.230
And when we were on Ujae
studying this, documenting,

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.050
a lot of the master
builders, they

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.620
were doing all the
measurement behind their back,

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.492
even though it was
the permission--

00:18:15.492 --> 00:18:17.700
so you have to go to the
chief to get the permission.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.820
So even though you get the
permission from the chief,

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.150
they were still
hesitant, because it have

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.560
to be from a family to family.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:36.630
So we decided that we're going
to use the documented knowledge

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.510
to train the young people.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.110
But, unfortunately, we didn't
have the money to do it.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.075
So I'm just going
to quickly give it--

00:18:47.075 --> 00:18:49.620
just go a little bit
outside of my talk

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.250
and talk about this
little funny story.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:58.270
So we had this voyaging
canoe we built on Ujae.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:04.570
So when this project was done,
we sailed this canoe from Ujae

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:09.470
to Kwajalein, which is about
130 miles, and then from Ujae

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:13.530
to Kwajalein, which
is about 250 miles.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.270
So I was the caretaker
of this canoe.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.030
And I started to bring in the
young people, the young guys,

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.090
so we can go
sailing, and fishing.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.080
And, of course, we
didn't have any money.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.120
I was volunteering.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:30.540
So one day, an Australian
ambassador came in.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.150
And he asked me if I could
take him out sailing.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.560
And I said, sure.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.150
So I took him out sailing.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:41.580
And he says, well,
I really enjoy this.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.340
Can you tell me your
dream about this?

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.960
So I told him my dream.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:51.450
I want to start a school
using the documented

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:56.970
knowledge to teach the
young people that--

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.860
the dropouts.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.470
And I tell him this story.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.930
And then when we
finish, he says, yeah,

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.160
write me a proposal.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.500
Never done that
before in my life.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.640
So he came back three days.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.360
And he says, where' my
Proposal And I said, well,

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.705
I put the dates.

00:20:14.705 --> 00:20:17.330
And I'm still
deciding, is it dear

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.320
who it may concern, or dear sir?

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.610
He said, you know what?

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.370
Here's $10,000.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.080
You start the program.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.540
And I will write the
proposal for you.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.110
At that time, I had
a good friend, Dr.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.570
Andrew [INAUDIBLE] who
was working for land grant

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.820
at the college in
the Marshall's.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.685
We always talk about canoes.

00:20:40.685 --> 00:20:42.630
And every time that
we talk about canoes,

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:47.940
he says, you bring me
$100, I will double it,

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.105
$200, I will double it.

00:20:50.105 --> 00:20:51.480
I said, what do
you mean, double?

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.490
I'll give you $400.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.470
I ran to his office.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:56.580
I knock on the door.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.935
I open it.

00:20:57.935 --> 00:21:00.280
He says, what's going on?

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.190
I pull out the check.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:06.544
He says, $10,000.

00:21:06.544 --> 00:21:08.460
He says, OK, what am I
supposed to do with it?

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:13.030
I said, well, remember,
100, 200, 400?

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.690
He said, yeah, but you know,
but there's procedures.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.750
You have to write me a proposal.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.630
I said, what is
this about proposal?

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.780
The Australian wrote
a proposal for me.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.360
How come the American can
not write a proposal for me?

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.530
And that money started
the canoe program.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:36.220
We started call
around, and call,

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.730
Hawaii, big islands,
to get wood to start

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:43.440
up up our A-frame building
to start a canoe program,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.240
because we were just
doing it on the beach.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:54.180
So you can see there that we've
been bringing young people.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.090
The first picture,
you saw the canoe.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:00.480
We teach them the cultural part.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.150
We use canoe as the medium.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.080
We also, now we just
have this addition

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.970
to the project is the
carving part of it.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.450
But we found out that
what we need also to do

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.390
is to have counselors
on life skills

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.300
if we want to really
work with the dropouts

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.040
to complete the
picture of training.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:29.180
And not only the training
part is important,

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.730
but you need to
do something fun.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:36.170
So they make learning fun.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.920
And, actually the
cultural practice.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.430
So we start canoe races.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.590
So I went to all the mariners
from different atolls.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.880
I said, bring the best
of the best, and we will,

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.020
too, the top the best
of the best in Majuro.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.722
And, of course, nobody
want to lose a race.

00:22:56.722 --> 00:22:58.430
So they brought all
the best of the best.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.580
And we started
doing canoe races.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.880
And the canoe knowledge,
to canoe tradition,

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.990
in the Marshall's has been
expanded tremendously.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.380
A lot of the people, because
of the canoe races, because

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.850
of the schools,
people are building

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:18.460
canoes in the outer islands.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:25.870
And, of course, fuel
is so expensive.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:30.370
For communities
that make $1 a day,

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:35.960
the fuel costs is
$9 to $10 a gallon.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.740
It's unreasonable.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.960
So since then, we'll see
transport, canoeing culture,

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.570
it's there.

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:48.260
So it's not just the canoeing
that we're kind of teaching.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.570
But now that we're getting
involved more and more

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:57.440
with the team, I'm the only
person here that have no PhD.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.640
They don't call me doctor.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.390
So I'm so happy to have the
group with me so they can--

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.070
I just talk.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.310
And they do all the numbers
and all that stuff for me.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.520
So this is one of
our stick chart.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.905
And this stick chart here is--

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.770
Joe mentioned the name Isao.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.270
He was actually
supposed to be here.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.730
But he was not
feeling very good.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:28.215
So, anyhow, this is his stick
chart to explain the swells.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:34.060
And, of course, this
is Joe's explanation

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.630
of this stick chart.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:40.150
And you can see
this [MARSHALLESE]..

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:43.960
the swells that
come from the north.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:49.660
And [MARSHALLESE] is this stick,
the swell that comes from east.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:54.240
And [MARSHALLESE],,
it comes from south.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:59.830
And [MARSHALLESE] is the
swells that comes from west.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.200
And Marshallese
believe that these

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.900
swells you use to show the
direction where you are going.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.760
And, of course, here
is the [MARSHALLESE]..

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.880
And [INAUDIBLE] is part of
the mixture of these two.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:23.650
And [MARSHALLESE],, this
one is [MARSHALLESE]..

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:28.400
The word [MARSHALLESE]
is pouring outside.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.650
So I think more detail
will come as we--

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.450
the other presentations.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.190
So thank you very much.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.710
- Well, it's a
pleasure to be here.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:00.200
And there's also a story
behind my presence here.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.070
I'm from Holland.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.590
And in the Netherlands, we
need to protect our country

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.180
against the anger of the sea.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:09.460
So we are used to know the wave
environment on the North Sea.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.450
And we built our water
defenses for that.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:13.970
So my professional
career is always

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.940
in the development and
application of wave models

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.880
to predict for safety reasons.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.500
But four years
ago, I was reading

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.820
a book about navigation.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.240
And there was one book
chapter about wave navigation.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.260
And then I thought,
that's interesting.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.990
I didn't know that application.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:33.590
So during my research, I
came into contact with Joe.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:37.280
And then we had a lot
of email correspondence.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.180
And then three years ago,
Joe asked me in January,

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.340
I'm going to Marshall
Islands on an expedition,

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.200
do you want to join?

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.060
What do you say, no?

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.470
Of course, yes.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:52.830
So that's how I became
involved in this project.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:58.120
And the very interesting part
is that wave navigation is there

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.220
for ages, many
hundreds of years.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.990
And in the last
few hundred years,

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:07.060
there were people trying to
document it, and describe it.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.050
And that was also my interest.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:14.750
So, as was introduced by
John, the last navigators

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:18.200
there wanted the scientists
becoming involved.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.390
So my research
started by looking

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.520
at the waves in
the whole Pacific,

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.630
and how they affect the
Marshallese Islands.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:32.270
So what you can see here is the
whole Pacific animation of--

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.580
well, this is the winds.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:38.700
And the whole Pacific is
often called the quiet ocean.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.290
That only relates to
the equatorial region.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.940
But in the south, you
can see the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.040
all the big winds near
Antarctica, and in the north

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.110
also near Alaska.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:55.050
Those winds are generating
all kinds of waves.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.610
And these waves, they radiate
over the whole of the Pacific,

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:03.080
and then enter the
Marshall Islands.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.980
So we can here see a snapshot
of the waves that are still

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.560
actively driven by the wind.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.690
And the next is--

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:19.300
those are the ways that
escape the wind fields.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.010
And they are called
the swell waves.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:23.290
And the swell
waves, we know, are

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.260
waves that are moving
gently over the ocean.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.610
And these swell waves can
propagate tens of thousands

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:34.360
of kilometers from the very
south to the very north.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.350
And halfway, they pass the
area of the Marshall Islands.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:43.150
So the Marshall Islands
are affected by local waves

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.150
generated by the
trade winds, and also

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.610
by the waves coming from
Antarctica, from the south

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.230
and from the north.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.800
And as Alson told, waves move
in all kind of directions.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.420
And because of that,
the Marshall Islands

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.280
have the unique
feature that there

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:03.100
are all kinds of interesting and
stable wave systems passing by.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.650
And because they last
for a number of days,

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:10.700
you can rely on them
for navigation purposes.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.600
So this is an animation of the
southern part of the ocean.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.640
This is one feature.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.930
This is a period of the
waves, of all the swell

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.490
fields, crossing each other.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:24.460
And as you can imagine,
just sit down on one point,

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.060
and you will see a different
wave systems coming

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.080
from the south, from the west,
and the north at the same time.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.420
And this is, really,
the information

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.640
that was picked up
by the navigators

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.880
to help in the steering
over the ocean.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.170
So the next step is we can look
in more detail at what happens

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:45.890
over the course of a year.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:49.570
So this is a plot-- let's just
concentrate on the upper part.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:54.250
On the horizontal axis, you see
each day in a particular year.

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.370
On the vertical axis,
you see the direction

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.300
from which a certain
wave field is coming.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.460
And what you can see, you
can see bands of waves.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.830
In the north, there's 360.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.570
You see all the dots.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:11.200
They represent the swell
coming from the north.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.490
And it's almost always present.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.900
There's also a southerly swell
almost present all of the year.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.460
And at 90 degrees,
that is the trade winds

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.950
waves generated from the east.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.730
And they are also
persistently existing.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.360
So this persistence
makes it feasible

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.080
that the people there
can navigate reliably

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.580
between all the oceans.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.660
If you then go one
level deeper, the waves

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.650
come from the islands.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:44.380
And they interact
with the islands.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.280
So what you can see there
is a schematic diagram

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.480
of the green island.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.470
The waves come from the east.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.850
They bounce against the islands.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.660
They have reflections.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.850
And people can pick
up the reflected wave

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.150
from the islands.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.240
On the other hand,
behind the island,

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.250
the waves bends around it.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.320
And they create cross patterns.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.010
And now, the
remarkable feature is

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:13.060
that the navigators can
look at the sea surface,

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.640
feel it, and then
know where they are,

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.040
with respect to the island.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.870
So that was all schematic.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:23.870
And now, we wanted to bring
in the science in more detail.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.860
So we applied some
computer modeling.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.260
And we just looked in detail
what happens with all the swell

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:34.420
waves, and how they interact
with the wave with the island.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.110
So you can see some shallow
water effects around islands.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.870
The waves bend
around the islands.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.760
And at some point,
you can see a bit

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.500
of a reflection in the island.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.410
So this is a very nice tool.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.020
And we just started
playing with this tool

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:54.940
to unravel all the intricacies
of what all the people know

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.780
there for ages.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.420
But now, we want to
bring it in more detail,

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:05.650
and help them understanding why
all the wave phenomena happen.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.390
So this is just another example.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.610
And here, you can
see a bigger island.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:14.950
And the reflection of the
waves is more easily visible.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:19.510
Well, two years ago,
we were in the ocean.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:24.640
And we did a traveling from
the island-- the red line is

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.590
the course of the canoe.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.050
The eastern course is going up.

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:30.940
We went to the islands of Aur.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.650
And a few days later,
we went down again.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:35.860
And we used, again,
the computer modeling

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.830
to reconstruct what are
the wave conditions.

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.140
And John took all
kind of measurements

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.060
of the waves and the winds.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.320
And we put them together.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.120
And, luckily, they agreed a bit.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.510
But this is the
level that we also

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:52.960
can see the shadowing
effect of the islands.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.290
So if a navigator go from
one island to another island,

00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:00.970
it can see all kinds of
features and differences

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:02.890
in the ocean environment.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:04.540
And that is, really, the trick--

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.810
reading the environment, and
reading the wave parents,

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:11.660
and then know where
you are, almost.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.220
So the next step
is now we want to--

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.320
the navigator is
standing on the canoe.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.500
And he feels like
the wave motion.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.940
So what we are trying
to do is we just

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.350
t make a reconstruction
of the wave surface.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:30.850
The red dot represents a
canoe going through the sea.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:36.940
And the lower two panels show
the vertical movement, the eve,

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.370
how the canoe goes up and down.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.110
And the lower panel,
the black line,

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:44.710
is the pitch as the canoe
goes this direction.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:48.500
And the red line is the
roll this direction.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.800
So this is the first
step in our analysis.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.890
What do the navigators feel?

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:58.000
So the next
challenge is, really,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.130
to put instruments on the canoe,
and then really measure what

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.110
are the motions of the canoe?

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.030
And that will help
us understanding

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.520
the whole way of wave piloting.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.409
So from the big ocean
skill, to the scale

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:16.510
with the islands, and the
scale of the sea, of the ship.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.380
So this is really a challenge.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.080
And we have a lot of work to do.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:27.219
Thank you

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:28.300
Thanks.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.770
So what is my toolkit?

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:31.130
I don't know.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.159
My toolkit is that
of a physicist.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.429
So it's not clear.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:40.270
So I'll pick up where
Gerbrant left off.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:44.040
And the indigenous
navigators will tell you

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.880
that it is the sense of
the motion that they have.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.550
Sometimes, they'll lie on
their back on the canoe,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.380
close their eyes, and feel it.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.830
We were talking with Alson
today about it, and about how

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.580
he felt the waves.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.130
And he said he actually felt
more comfortable navigating

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.230
at night than he
does during the day,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.290
because he said his
eyes play tricks on him.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:07.950
And so there is this notion,
you don't look at the waves.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.030
You actually feel them.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.240
And to some extent,
what I did was not

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.220
only to try to help
document the voyage.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.830
But I also try to put
my feet in the shoes

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:19.290
of an apprentice navigator,
sort of knowing what I learned,

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:22.140
and how well can I do from
what I've been taught?

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.540
And so it's like baby's
first steps in wave piloting,

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.470
is the best way I could put it.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.900
So it was a lot to
juggle at that point.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.690
I think [INAUDIBLE],,
who we talked to,

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.850
said that you feel
it in your stomach.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:39.840
And, in fact, there's this one
mysterious notion that we're

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.110
still trying to unravel.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:44.430
And I'll share with you
what I think it might be.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.100
There are these paths to
connect pairs of atolls

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.410
in the Marshall Islands
called a [MARSHALLESE]..

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.650
And it's been described as
a disturbed path of water

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.810
that connects pairs of atolls.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.750
And it's not a reflection
or a refraction,

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.536
as Gerbrant described.

00:35:59.536 --> 00:36:00.660
That's something different.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.950
There are words for that too.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.990
But this [MARSHALLESE]
is this mysterious path

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.860
of disturbed water that
connects pairs of attols.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.830
And I've been scratching my
head as to what, exactly, this

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.650
represents, because the
descriptions I was given

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.050
didn't really seem
physically correct to me.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:20.490
But this is a bit where
kind of the art of trying

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:24.600
to understand the culture
and the physical descriptions

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.380
is difficult.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.650
And one of the
things that is true,

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:31.350
at least for me
and other examples,

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.720
are, if I were to
ask you, how do you

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.490
know to get from here to there?

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:37.110
You would just say,
well, I know it.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.020
I mean, there is
this intuitive kind

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.890
of sense of how you get
from one place to the other

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:43.750
that you develop.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:46.290
And it's sometimes difficult
to then turn around

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:49.170
to somebody who hasn't done it
and then explain it to them.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.020
So we're dealing with
maybe the difficulty

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.810
of communicating something
that's intuitive knowledge.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:58.820
Or maybe it's the language that
is being used to describe it.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.867
So the idea is, can we feel it?

00:37:00.867 --> 00:37:03.450
And so that was, at least, one
of the things that I was hoping

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.970
to come away from
this voyage with,

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.590
in addition to documenting it.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:11.250
So here's another view of
part of the Marshall Islands.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.140
The capital is Majuro.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.570
We all flew in
there, except Alson

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.610
was there, and
spent a fair amount

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.300
of time getting used to things.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:25.950
And then we departed
Majuro with Alson

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:30.780
and his crew on the Jitdam
Kapeel, which is the outrigger,

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.680
sailed north to Aur, and
I'll described the voyage,

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.010
visited the island of
Tobal in the atoll of Aur,

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:40.080
and then had a
return voyage back.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.600
And so my job was to
try to document it.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.650
But I also wanted
to understand how

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.480
their systems might operate.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.375
So here is a little
video clip of the Jitdam

00:37:53.375 --> 00:37:57.438
Kapeel in the [INAUDIBLE] Aur.

00:37:57.438 --> 00:37:59.660
And you can see the
outrigger, which

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.930
is bouncing up and down a bit.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:02.130
It's designed to do that.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.090
It has to flex.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:06.840
And that's one of the amazing
aspects of the engineering

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.530
of these Marshallese canoes, is
that you cannot rigidly attach

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:11.310
this outrigger.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:14.400
It has to be designed to have
a kind of give and take to it.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.999
And so it's remarkable, if
you see these things up front.

00:38:16.999 --> 00:38:18.540
The other thing is
that the outrigger

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.170
balances against the wind.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:24.820
So the canoe might just
heal over at an angle.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.540
And so what the outrigger does
is it counterbalances that.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.460
And it also helps keep
it tracked straight.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.800
So I don't know how
many of you are sailors.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.050
But if you've ever
heard the term leeway,

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.270
but under the
influence of the wind

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:37.879
you can actually
get pushed sideways.

00:38:37.879 --> 00:38:39.920
And so the design of these
things are remarkable.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.030
They almost have no
leeway whatsoever.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:43.500
So they track very
straight, and go

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.170
exactly where you want to go.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:51.900
OK, so the outgoing
voyage, which I think you

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.400
can see here--

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.170
so I hope you can see that.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:58.660
Here's the track of the
outgoing voyage here.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.650
Can you all see that?

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.290
So I had a GPS with me.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:06.690
So part of it was just to
figure out, where are we,

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.670
each of the places we go.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:12.240
We left this cut
close to sunset.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.840
This is the way I tried
to indicate visually

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.090
on the map the swells.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.520
So the swell
direction, the motion

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.200
of the winds, and the
waves, and the swells,

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.750
were in the direction
of the arrow.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.890
And the crests were
perpendicular to that.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:29.230
So it just helps
visualization, my way

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.420
of visualizing the waves.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:36.920
So there is this set of waves.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.790
When we first left
the cut of Majuro,

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.580
the waves were coming directly
at us, so from the north.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.300
But as we left
Majuro, towards sunset

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.490
the waves were then
coming at an angle,

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:50.230
and eventually from the west.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.480
And in the middle
of the night, I

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:57.340
swear I felt some motion
of a swell from the north.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.160
What Alson did, and
he'll tell you later,

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.040
was he was concerned that we
were going to actually run

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.400
right into the reef of Aur
in the middle of the night,

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.520
because a very strong wind
kicked up as we were sailing.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.980
And so he made the
decision to sail somewhat

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.870
to the east of Aur.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.690
And then he estimated that
the sunrise would happen

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:18.220
when we were to the east.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.590
And then we would sail into Aur.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.750
It was a very rough night.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.150
And we got splashed
in the chase boat.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.060
I think all of us--

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:31.300
like, at least, I got incredibly
seasick on the way out.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.580
And it was a really bumpy ride.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.870
And when we got out there,
there was a maneuver

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.794
to turn towards Aur
that Alson wanted to do.

00:40:40.794 --> 00:40:43.210
But it proved to be difficult,
especially because the rope

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.560
holding the mast broke.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:50.410
So we used the chase
vessel to tow us in.

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:52.340
So that was interesting.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:57.100
We then arrived in Tobal,
which is in the north of Aur.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:01.570
So you see here, some of
the crew taking supplies in.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.080
So we took supplies here.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.790
You see Alson with, I guess
effectively the mayor of Aur.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:07.940
Is that who that is?

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.040
Yeah.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.310
So here, you see some
of the supplies there.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.050
And we had an amazing feast.

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:16.990
I mean, I've never been
greeted by a group of strangers

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.040
so kindly.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.750
It was just unbelievable.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:24.500
And we spent a few days,
and had a return journey.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:29.050
So I didn't know
exactly what to expect,

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:30.520
and how to document this thing.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.200
So we were exposed to the ocean.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.180
So this is my toolkit.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.460
And I had a GPS with me.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.430
I had a handheld
weather station,

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:42.190
which had an ananometer
to measure wind speed.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.330
And I had a compass
to get the heading.

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.440
And so using these three
things and documenting it,

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.456
I could figure out where
the wind was blowing.

00:41:49.456 --> 00:41:50.830
I could use my
body to figure out

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:52.621
where the waves were
going, just by feeling

00:41:52.621 --> 00:41:54.340
the motion of the canoe.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.730
I was able to figure out
what the current was doing,

00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:59.740
because I could calculate
from the heading,

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:04.075
and the way the sails were
pointed in the canoe, where

00:42:04.075 --> 00:42:04.950
they should be going.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.000
But then when they were going in
a slightly different direction,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.260
I attributed that to current.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.380
So just using some native
smarts, and an Excel

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.960
spreadsheet, and the stuff
that I pulled together,

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.307
I was able to reproduce
a lot of the course,

00:42:16.307 --> 00:42:17.890
especially on the
way back, because it

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:19.930
was a little bit calmer.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:23.360
So here, you see my notebook.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.850
It looks like a
bunch of scribbles.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:28.090
But I was able to
reconstruct the voyage.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:33.400
So here is the return trip,
at least an indication

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.280
of the return trip.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:39.010
So we went through
the cut in Aur

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:41.320
I guess a few hours
before sunset.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.960
And it was interesting.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:47.020
I was curious about what this
path one could follow from one

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.970
atoll to another would be.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:53.590
And what I found was that
the trade wind swell always

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:57.250
seemed to be coming
perpendicular to our path,

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:58.660
moving perpendicular
to our path.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:01.160
And our path was actually
an arc of some kind.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.790
And so that was a
clue that, perhaps,

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:09.280
if you follow this arc, that you
would find your way to Majuro.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.010
Also in the middle of
the night, what I did

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:13.977
was I lay on the
back on the canoe,

00:43:13.977 --> 00:43:15.310
and just try to feel the motion.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:20.440
So it went side to side rolling
three times, one, two, three.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.360
And then I had one up and down.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.377
So I figured there
was a trade wind--

00:43:24.377 --> 00:43:25.960
and this happened
over and over again.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.490
So there was a trade
wind swell that

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:28.887
was rolling me back and forth.

00:43:28.887 --> 00:43:30.970
And then there were some
swell from the north that

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:32.439
was pitching me up and down.

00:43:32.439 --> 00:43:33.855
And I wrote this
into my notebook,

00:43:33.855 --> 00:43:36.100
because I was kind
of like, this is it.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.550
I'm staking myself
to this observation.

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:41.030
And it better work out.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:44.740
OK, just to show you that
the observations, at least

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:49.000
of the this path that I thought
we were following, was correct,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.750
here is the hind
cast that Gerbrant

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:56.530
got by just looking at the
winds from the North Pacific,

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.060
and the trade winds, and so on.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.900
And, indeed, I basically
nailed the correct observations

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.930
of where the trade wind
waves and swells were going.

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:08.720
So I kind of got that right
from the observations.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.660
One of the things that
was a little scary

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.780
was that it looked like we
were getting blown off course

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.650
to the west, which Alson
was also concerned about,

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.440
indicating there was
some sort of current.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.160
Alson felt a current
of some kind.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.110
This is just an intermediate
plot that I used.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:30.190
This is showing, instead of
the direction of the swells,

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:33.070
this is showing the wind speed
that I got from the ananometer,

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:36.222
and figuring out the
true wind direction.

00:44:36.222 --> 00:44:37.930
So you could see, we
had wind speeds kind

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:39.100
of approaching 10 knots.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.410
But they died down
around sunrise,

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:42.760
but then the picked up again.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.116
And using that,
knowing which way--

00:44:45.116 --> 00:44:47.740
this is just a diagram which I'm
not going to walk you through.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:51.730
But this dotted line indicates
the performance characteristics

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:56.290
of a proto Hokulea vessel,
which is the one the Polynesian

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:59.650
Voyaging Society uses, and
just did an around the world

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:00.750
trip with.

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:03.650
Here's the Jitdam Kapeel,
which is much more performant.

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:09.130
So it's like a Ferrari compared
to a minivan or something,

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:11.210
I guess for lack
of a better term.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:14.080
So using that and the
information I had,

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.270
I was able to figure
out the currents.

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:20.320
And the currents were quite
strong near Aur and Majuro.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.610
And this was what was
sweeping us to the west.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:27.820
And this is also what Alson
was highly concerned about.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.390
In any case, he'll talk maybe
a little bit more about this,

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:35.540
we also had the wave
data from this period.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.970
And this is a weird plot.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:38.780
But let me just
sketch out what it is.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:44.530
So the angle around this
dot is the direction

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:47.420
that the swells are moving,
and the waves are moving.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.742
So this bit here are
the trade wind waves

00:45:50.742 --> 00:45:52.450
that are coming from
the east and they're

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:53.510
moving toward the west.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:55.590
So you see this big blob here.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:58.640
And then the radial
axis has frequency.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.760
So the longer the
period, the closer

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.200
you will be to the center.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.400
So a very long period swell
would be close to the center.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.800
So if I just let
this evolve here--

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.080
and this was actually--

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:15.550
it was, basically, two
years to the day to today

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:16.990
when we did this.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:19.224
And so when I got this
plot, it looked at it.

00:46:19.224 --> 00:46:21.140
I said, OK, well there's
the trade wind swell.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.270
And look at that.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:24.610
There's a swell from the north.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:26.230
And it's there.

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:27.910
And I was like, yeah.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:31.360
So I was able to get the
swell, get the directions,

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.870
and also feel this north
swell my first time out.

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:36.910
And I was just overjoyed
when I saw this.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.610
So maybe I'm over-playing
it for you folks.

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:44.770
But that was my baby's
first book of wave piloting.

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:46.870
So I'm just going
to turn it over

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:50.894
to Alson for his
impressions of the trip out.

00:46:50.894 --> 00:46:52.310
So you can just
talk about it now.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:58.130
Riff on it.

00:47:01.427 --> 00:47:04.510
- Yeah, I've been
very fortunate to give

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.480
a talk about these kind
of stuff after they

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.750
explain all the details.

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:14.140
So the trip out was
very interesting.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:21.460
First of all, we forgot to cook
our meal, to cook our rice.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.460
Of course, in the Pacific,
rice is a pretty big thing.

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.880
So we used a teapot.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.970
And said, OK, we're
going to cook the rice,

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:34.870
take all the rice out,
and cook the hot water.

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:41.020
So that was a pretty good
way to start off the sail.

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:50.200
And when we went out,
it was still daytime.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.840
So I was kind of
looking at the swells,

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.990
hoping to find the
strong eastern swell that

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:59.200
would show me where to go.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.365
And as we go further
out from Majuro,

00:48:02.365 --> 00:48:04.330
then you could kind
of feel that then.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:07.960
Of course, like John
was saying, because I

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:14.320
keep repeating that I am always
afraid to sail during the day,

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.620
because there is so many
type of waves and currents.

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:22.240
And as a student,
I'd rather eliminate

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:27.130
a lot of the those thing,
and just feel my way out.

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:31.260
So as we go out, there was a
lot of swells, rains, wind.

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:34.630
And every time there
was a swell coming,

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:38.650
we would face the canoe
right into the wind.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:42.220
And at that time, we
were going backwards.

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.580
And having all
that taking place,

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:52.240
we trying to estimate where
we would be if we don't--

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.600
I mean, I try to estimate
where we would be.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:02.350
So keep in mind that
from previous voyages,

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:07.120
I kind of know what
time I would Aur.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:11.180
It would be kind of dangerous
to go directly there.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:16.270
So we were going as far east
as possible to get there.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:19.210
And then the plan was to--

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.200
because the wind
comes like this--

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.880
was go to out that
direction, and then just

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.020
kind of have a nice,
easy sail down.

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.880
But, unfortunately,
when we look up

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.400
at the mast, the rope
that holds the sail up,

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.950
was halfway almost.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:37.000
It was pretty dangerous.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.190
So we brought it down.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:40.650
And we got towed in.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:45.060
On the way back, it
was a very nice sail.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.760
As soon as we got
out, we could see

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:53.370
that there was a current
pushing toward east.

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:57.050
But the problem is, the
wind kind of died out.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:50:00.360
So we were pushed out
more than we wanted.

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:04.110
So when the wind start to
pick up in the morning,

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:10.620
we try to come as
close east as possible,

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:15.900
because these two islands,
I know that the farther you

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.800
come east--

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:21.030
I think the more advantages
if I were to come east.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:26.020
But the currents
were pushing as west.

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.220
So there's another
island toward the south.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:33.210
So I keep saying,
oh, I hope we don't

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:36.330
go to Jaluit, which is far.

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:41.470
But, fortunately, the wind pick
up during the morning hours.

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:44.940
And we were able to
come in into directly

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:51.630
into the pass, which was a
good feeling, because instead

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:53.250
of going anywhere
else, we actually

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:56.490
coming toward the pass.

00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:59.050
So it was a pretty good feeling.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:01.770
It was a success, I think.

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:06.150
So where do we go from here?

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:14.370
We visit schools, and
talk about canoe programs,

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:16.980
and talk about our culture.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:25.900
And from what we've learned
from this trip, personally,

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.030
I want to continue.

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:33.270
I want to make sure that
what we have gathered so far

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:38.190
would be something to look
at, and to move forward,

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:40.950
and trying to figure
out ways to make sure

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:45.720
that we complete our work.

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:49.320
Joe mentioned that he came
in and start talking--

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:54.510
I mean, Ben Finney and Joe
talking to Captain Korent.

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:57.000
And one of the goals
that Captain Korent has,

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.750
because he was a navigator,
he wants to have one side

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:08.280
is tradition navigation, and
the scientific, because even me,

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:12.330
when people ask me
about certain swells,

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:15.300
I can talk about the swells.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:19.800
But the details of it, and
scientific detail of it,

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.670
I don't know.

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:26.730
So I think it would make this
study even 100% better if we

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:29.790
put those two fields together.

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:35.580
A canoe there it's
actually in Hawaii.

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.100
It's called Okeanos
Marshall Islands.

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:41.950
It was donated to
the Marshall Islands

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.307
as part of this
sustainable sea transport.

00:52:44.307 --> 00:52:46.390
Of course, you probably
know that Marshall Islands

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:51.430
is a low lying islands, is most
affected by climate change.

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:55.800
So one of the big things that
our government is going out

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:59.190
and talk about climate change.

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:03.390
And this is one way--
of course, you know,

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:07.710
again, Joe explain about
these islands and 750,000

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:09.310
square miles.

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:13.950
So we're so small and big at
the same time, which means

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:16.180
that our islands are so small.

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:20.150
But, yes, we use probably
more fuel than any other--

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:22.780
some other countries--
around the world.

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:25.780
And for a country that
talk about climate change,

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:29.580
I think we need to change our
attitude toward transportation,

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:33.870
and any other means
of fossil usage.

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:37.590
So we got this canoe.

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:40.330
And I think that's the
plan now, is to try

00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:43.230
to see if we can utilize it.

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:44.700
And, of course,
this canoe is going

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.900
to be under the auspices of
the University of the South

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.050
Pacific.

00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:53.700
So it's even better, because
it's an educational institute.

00:53:53.700 --> 00:54:01.410
So I think that's the goal
now, is to rethink and re-plan

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:05.670
the future of this
program, and of course

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:11.490
to utilize our canoe
program, and the youth

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:14.390
that I'm working with.

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:17.617
So let's see.

00:54:17.617 --> 00:54:18.450
What else?

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:19.030
- We're good.

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.670
- That's good?

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:20.169
OK.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:31.040
- So I guess what we'll probably
do is just take some questions

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.810
and have some discussion.

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:35.180
So there's a microphone.

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:39.110
And I'll let-- I guess
somebody else can adjudicate

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:40.940
the questions, or something.

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.160
And we'll try to take them.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.630
And if you're going
to address us,

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:49.540
you might want to tell
us who you're asking.

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.897
Yeah, OK.

00:54:50.897 --> 00:54:52.730
- Hi, thank you very
much, very interesting.

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:55.670
I guess I would address it
to you as the physicist.

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:59.270
What determines the
periodicity of swells?

00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:01.520
Is it the dynamic
strength of the wind?

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.640
Is it the distance it travels?

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:07.591
And would they be then
differentiable, north, south,

00:55:07.591 --> 00:55:08.090
west?

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:09.340
- That's a wonderful question.

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:16.050
So what determines the height
and the period of the swells

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:19.130
is what's called fetch,
which is the duration

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:21.800
and the time over which
the wind has been blowing.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.510
So the longer the
fetch, typically,

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:25.760
the longer the period,
especially the stronger the

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.990
wind, the longer the period.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:31.220
So if there's a hurricane
out in the Atlantic,

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:35.302
you can get swells that have
periods of maybe 22 seconds

00:55:35.302 --> 00:55:36.260
or something like that.

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:39.570
And they travel at
50, 60 miles an hour.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.560
So the sign of a
hurricane with the swells

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.910
can well outrun the
hurricane itself.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:47.150
And it's thought that
maybe Columbus was

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:49.850
able to determine that
there was a hurricane

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:52.760
in his fourth voyage by
looking at these swells.

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.710
So they do have a
different character.

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:58.490
The swells from the southern
ocean have very long periods

00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:59.587
associated with them.

00:55:59.587 --> 00:56:00.920
I mean, Gerbrant could say more.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:05.280
But I'm sort of thinking
14 to 22 seconds.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:09.470
The North Pacific swells can
also be somewhat as long.

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:12.170
But sometimes in
my gut, I feel them

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:16.370
a little bit shorter period
than the Southern Ocean swells.

00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:19.400
And the trade wind swells
tend to be more wind

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.470
driven and steeper face.

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:24.590
So you tend to get
swells that have periods

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.880
of like seven to 11 seconds.

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:31.347
So each one has kind of a
fingerprint associated with it.

00:56:31.347 --> 00:56:32.680
That's kind of the short answer.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:33.346
Would you agree?

00:56:33.346 --> 00:56:34.350
- Yeah, I agree, yeah.

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:42.150
- So John, you
mentioned the Hokulea,

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:44.760
which has been very much in the
news recently because it just

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:49.370
re-entered Honolulu Harbor after
a three year circumnavigation.

00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:50.910
So those last few days--

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:53.850
that's a double hollowed
outrigger canoe.

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:54.610
Is that right?

00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:56.130
- It's a double-hulled
canoe, yes.

00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:58.740
- Double-hulled-- so
the last few days,

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:01.530
I've been wondering about
among these different atolls,

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:05.880
these different Pacific
atolls, traditionally,

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.740
what is the overlap
in, for example,

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:12.690
boatbuilding technique,
in navigational technique,

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:15.480
and in maybe the theory behind
the navigational technique?

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:19.130
And what are the differences
between the Marshall Islands

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.480
and the Hawaiian
Islands, et cetera?

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.770
- Should I take a whack at it?

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:23.320
- Sure.

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.270
- OK.

00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:30.930
Yeah, well, so as Joe said, the
navigation and canoe building

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:34.100
pretty much disappeared
in the Hawaiian Islands,

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.080
with the exception of these
small outriggers that were used

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.000
more for races than anything.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.780
So the idea of the
double-hulled canoe

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:47.670
was developed by at least
a combination of, I guess,

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:53.850
Ben Finney, Joe's thesis
advisor, and an artist named

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:57.630
Herb [INAUDIBLE] who drew
a lot of paintings of what

00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:01.260
he imagined the Hawaiians when
they were doing long distance

00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.730
voyaging used.

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:06.660
And the large catamaran double
hull makes a lot of sense

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:09.750
for really long distance
voyage, like the 2,000 mile run

00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:14.640
from Tahiti to Hawaii, because
for the smaller canoes,

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.000
like the Jitdam Kapeel,
with the smaller outrigger,

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.610
they really get a work out.

00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:22.410
And the lashings get a
really heavy workout.

00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:26.790
So the Hokulea was designed
to withstand a lot of beating,

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:29.840
like over a month
of ocean swells.

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:34.230
But there's not a lot
of extent information

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:35.880
about that structure,
although I guess

00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:39.330
there was a recent
archaeological

00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:45.180
find in the South Pacific of
a very large steering board.

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:47.770
So that sort of
backs that idea up.

00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:51.120
The navigation
scheme, again, was

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.400
lost in the Hawaiian Islands.

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.220
So the way that Polynesian
voyaging society

00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:59.370
approached this was that
they actually went to Satewa,

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:01.260
which is a Micronesian outlier.

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:05.430
And Alson will be
very quick to say

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:09.300
that this navigator,
[INAUDIBLE],,

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:13.620
learned from the
Marshallese at Bikini.

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:14.530
I don't know.

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:15.885
But he was a master navigator.

00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:18.450
And he wanted to
propagate this, and was

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:20.390
visited by a number of writers.

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.350
So the Polynesian
Voyaging Society

00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:26.280
invited [INAUDIBLE] to be the
first navigator on a Hokulea

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.250
run from Hawaii to Tahiti.

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:34.650
And very rapidly,
a Hawaiian named

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:38.820
[INAUDIBLE] Thompson came under
the tutelage of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:42.810
And [INAUDIBLE] system is
kind of idiosyncratic, not

00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:44.260
so easy to learn.

00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:49.980
So [INAUDIBLE] teamed
up with an astronomer

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:54.480
at the University of
Hawaii, Will Kyselka,

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.390
and spent a lot of time
in the planetarium there.

00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:59.710
And I know he kind of
developed his own schema.

00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:02.160
And I like to say it's
a bit of a mixture

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.300
of a Western navigation
scheme, but non-instrumented.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.937
And I know it was
quite successful.

01:00:08.937 --> 01:00:10.770
And so what he's been
doing is teaching this

01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:14.460
to other members of the
Polynesian Voyaging Society.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:18.030
So the difference is that
it's kind of a hybrid Western,

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:22.210
you know slash what they
learned from [INAUDIBLE] system.

01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:24.960
Whereas in the Marshall
Islands, at least

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.680
we have this kind of unbroken
continuity, which also includes

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.239
stars.

01:00:29.239 --> 01:00:31.530
For example, the names of
stars are actually directions

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:34.230
for sailing, in some cases.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:37.260
So it's a substantial
difference,

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.285
if you're comparing
one to the other.

01:00:39.285 --> 01:00:40.660
- Maybe I'd just
add a little bit

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.170
to the first part of your
question is that there seems

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:47.950
to be really wide consensus that
the navigation traditions that

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:51.030
kind of span the breadth
of the Pacific all share

01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:52.570
some really common features.

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:56.770
So regardless of what atoll or
island community you're from,

01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:58.410
there would be
fairly common ways

01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:01.170
that you would, for
example, set an orientation

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:03.684
to start sailing, and how
you might take a back siding

01:01:03.684 --> 01:01:05.100
to keep your course
going once you

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.531
start to get outside of land.

01:01:07.531 --> 01:01:10.030
Dead reckoning procedures are
a little bit more complicated.

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:12.927
But once you kind of
hone in on an island,

01:01:12.927 --> 01:01:14.760
there seems to be some
fairly common things,

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.010
whether it's looking
at birds that

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:18.930
are going to be nesting
at land at the night,

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:21.300
or certain cloud formations,
the wave pattern.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.710
So there's kind
of a commonality.

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:25.800
But it seems that,
historically and over time,

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.460
certain island groups,
voyaging communities,

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:34.480
developed particular
techniques that were fairly--

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.530
became more elaborated
and developed

01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:39.390
in those particular places.

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:43.350
So whereas if you asked almost
any Pacific navigator today,

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:46.560
even in the historical past,
they would all say, yes,

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.000
we know about wave reflections.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.179
We use those all the time.

01:01:49.179 --> 01:01:51.470
I think the difference is
that in the Marshall Islands,

01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:54.450
it became very much
elaborated so that

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:56.520
was kind of the center
of the entire system.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.930
I think that's the difference.

01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:04.790
- Thanks.

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:11.339
Any of you know how to navigate
our health insurance system?

01:02:11.339 --> 01:02:12.380
You don't have to answer.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:16.280
You're from a different country.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:20.720
I am very interested in
this question of the two

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.790
different kinds of knowledge.

01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:26.030
One, I would characterize
as more experiential

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:32.280
and intuitive, and the other
more abstract and analytical.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.527
And I don't know that we
need to say one is science

01:02:34.527 --> 01:02:35.360
and the other isn't.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.670
It may be different
kinds of knowledge.

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:42.920
And I like what you said, Mr.
Kelen, about these parallel,

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.480
keeping them both
going, not trying

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.290
to make one, if
I understood you,

01:02:47.290 --> 01:02:50.300
not necessarily wanting
to make one the other,

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.880
but have them maybe parallel.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.920
So I'd be interested
in any of you

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.800
might like to talk a little
bit about the ways in which

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:00.920
these forms of
knowledge are different,

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.880
and what meaning, if any,
you give to any of that?

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.650
- You want the question again?

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:15.470
You want to rephrase it for you?

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:19.760
OK, let me see if I can
rephrase it, and you can nod.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.340
So we actually discussed this
this afternoon, to some extent.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:26.120
So I'll try to reframe our
discussion this afternoon.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.320
It was that, how did you
know there was a current?

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.150
And you said, well,
I can feel it.

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:33.660
And how did you know this?

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:39.440
And one of the things that
Alson said was that in his mind,

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.920
he was able to calculate, I
have to worry about the current.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.500
I have to worry about the wind.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.670
I know the wind's strong.

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:47.900
I think I'm going to be here.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:51.770
There was a moment where
he was about 15 miles

01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:53.760
off the southeast corner of Aur.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.255
And Joe radioed
him, because that's

01:03:55.255 --> 01:03:56.660
how we stayed in contact.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:00.030
And he said, Alson, where
do you think you are?

01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:02.600
He said, I think I'm like 10,
15 miles off the southeast

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.230
corner of Aur.

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:04.930
This was 2:30 in the morning.

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:09.190
And from the GPS, that
was exactly where he was.

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:13.880
And so I asked Alson,
do you use numbers,

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.060
moving at so many knots,
and it's been so many hours?

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:20.360
No, it was just as his feeling.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.170
And then we had this discussion
about, how do we teach this?

01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:26.490
Do we bring in science to it?

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:29.840
And Do we teach the
Marshallese the science?

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.810
And Joe said, no, you want to
be really careful, because you

01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:36.950
don't want to infect people
with these Western notions.

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:39.722
And so we really went
back and forth with it.

01:04:39.722 --> 01:04:42.180
And I don't know if you want
to say anything on this point.

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:45.660
Or I did have a
thought about it, but.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:54.060
- Again, I will say
that, mostly, the feeling

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:58.070
and the image that
was in my mind,

01:04:58.070 --> 01:05:02.350
I picture where I was going.

01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:04.970
And it's so funny, because
the question you were asking

01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:09.080
is the same question that we
could ask a master navigator

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.100
in the Marshall Islands.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.230
They would say the same thing.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:15.800
We were feeling our way with
the currents coming, the swells.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.002
And we always joke
around, and say that's

01:05:21.002 --> 01:05:23.210
why a lot of Marshallese
have big stomach, because we

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:26.196
navigate with our stomach.

01:05:26.196 --> 01:05:28.666
- Is it kind of terrain?

01:05:28.666 --> 01:05:34.150
Among other things, is
it a kind of terrain?

01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:35.930
- Yes.

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:40.610
- So a lot of times in
this realm of navigation,

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:43.940
we'll talk about certain
marks, or certain signs that

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.762
would indicate the direction
and distance toward land.

01:05:46.762 --> 01:05:48.470
And most of those in
the Marshall Islands

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:50.690
are described as sea marks.

01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:55.250
So it's the idea a particular
wave 20 miles off land,

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:58.100
or a surging current
15 miles this way,

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:00.410
could be a mark to indicate
the direction and distance.

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:01.701
So, yeah, you're exactly right.

01:06:01.701 --> 01:06:04.040
It's kind of like
this spatial field

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.050
of this multitude
of waves coming

01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:07.680
from every possible direction.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.340
And somehow, the
navigator has to filter

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.560
all that out, figure out
what are the strong signals

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.540
to figure out that
land is that way.

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.880
Yeah, so it is very much an
embodied kind of experience

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.360
that, at a practical
level, navigators

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.670
are probably drawing from.

01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:26.960
- I can add to that, that,
although we use computer

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.250
models, I realize that our
knowledge is still incomplete,

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:34.800
because all the stories about
feeling the reflected waves,

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.604
just what was told before,
we try to reconstruct it

01:06:37.604 --> 01:06:38.270
with our models.

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:40.310
But we are still not there.

01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:42.740
All the computer models
are simplifications.

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.380
And I expect that we
can still learn a lot

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.760
from what the navigators know.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:50.180
So that is one of the
challenges of really unraveling

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.137
what do they feel.

01:06:51.137 --> 01:06:52.970
- And just to kind of
tie this-- and, sorry,

01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:54.530
this wasn't the question.

01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:56.270
But to tie this into
the bigger thing

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:58.311
that we're doing, to what
I said in the beginning

01:06:58.311 --> 01:07:01.060
was just mentioning that
Captain Korent, Joel,

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.937
who kind of started
this project,

01:07:02.937 --> 01:07:05.520
his whole goal was to try to get
the scientific understanding.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:09.530
And part of it was to validate
the knowledge that he already

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:12.440
knew, to kind of increase
the prestige of him

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.250
and his knowledge.

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:15.980
But the other part was
to flesh out the ideas.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:17.960
And so one quick
example is there's

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.840
an image up here of a wave
pattern called [MARSHALLESE]..

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.670
And it's this kind
of refracted wave

01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:25.520
pattern on the leeward
side of an atoll.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:28.580
And when you think conceptually
about what that is,

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:32.300
it's almost identical to what
the navigators talk about.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.870
I mean, it's almost match for
match, OK, we've got refracted

01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:36.814
swells coming in.

01:07:36.814 --> 01:07:39.230
But then we have other things,
like the [MARSHALLESE] like

01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:42.120
John was talking about,
that from a first glance

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.079
make no sense,
oceanographically.

01:07:44.079 --> 01:07:45.870
And that's what we're
trying to figure out.

01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:49.190
So it's kind of this duality
of both validating and trying

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:51.400
to add some explanations.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:55.380
- And I just want to
add one more thing.

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:59.280
So I teach a course here
and one of the things

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.830
that I want the
students to do is

01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:04.330
to be able to find directions
from the stars in the sky.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:08.840
And so what's interesting
is like a technique

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.760
that I've taught
myself, but you have

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:13.670
to memorize the coordinates
of the stars, the declination,

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:17.180
and what is effectively
the longitude of the star,

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:17.720
if you like.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.666
And so they find it tedious.

01:08:19.666 --> 01:08:21.540
And it's like, why we
have to take this quiz?

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.206
And they have to write
down the numbers.

01:08:23.206 --> 01:08:24.529
And they have graph paper.

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:28.029
And they have to plot the
stars, and all this other stuff.

01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:30.529
But then they have a quiz on
the roof of the Science Center.

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:33.710
And it's really something of an
epiphany, because what happens

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.620
is all those numbers
and stuff just fall out.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:38.550
And you're looking at the stars.

01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:40.910
And you say, that's Regulus.

01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:41.680
That's Altar.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.979
That's Vega.

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:45.859
And all of the sudden, all
those numbers and all that stuff

01:08:45.859 --> 01:08:46.430
falls away.

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:47.221
And it's intuitive.

01:08:47.221 --> 01:08:49.761
It's like if I showed you
a map of North America,

01:08:49.761 --> 01:08:52.010
and I tilted it sideways,
and I said, which way is up?

01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:52.939
You say, oh, that way is up.

01:08:52.939 --> 01:08:54.270
And I say, how do you know?

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:56.149
Because I've seen
it a million times.

01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:59.210
It's the same way that once you
learn the stars, you look up.

01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:01.910
And oh yeah, I know
what the directions are,

01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:03.200
and that sort of thing.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.200
So you can take this kind
of scientific approach

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.265
to learning something.

01:09:07.265 --> 01:09:08.764
And then it develops
into intuition.

01:09:08.764 --> 01:09:11.470
And I think it's just one
path that you can take.

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:13.010
It's not necessarily exclusive.

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:15.229
But I think it
could also speed up

01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:17.979
having to go out on the water
over and over, and over again.

01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:20.560
It could seed
learning, in some way.

01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:28.160
- Continuing the stars a
bit, is there any evidence

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.229
that they used the
sun or the stars

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:34.010
to add to their wave knowledge?

01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:42.410
- Well, I think as a supplement,
I mean, do you want to talk?

01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:48.149
- Yeah, the stars, we use
the stars, but not as much.

01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:51.100
Mostly, we use the swells.

01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:56.600
- Captain Korent,
he told us one time

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.750
that the stars are not as
reliable as the swells,

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:01.590
because the stars are
always moving around.

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:04.850
That's a Marshallese conception.

01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:07.820
- But here's one thing, though.

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:11.000
At sunset, Alson
did use the sunset

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.260
as a way of establishing the
directionality of the swells,

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:17.110
and assumed that
the swells were then

01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:20.360
coming from the same direction
throughout the night.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.180
- You used it as a calibration
thing from time to time.

01:10:26.293 --> 01:10:27.620
- Yeah.

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:34.970
- I was curious about how
the boat design was affected

01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:38.690
or interacted with the
actual idea of navigation,

01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:41.780
and the type of navigation.

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:48.680
And just also as a sort of
aside, the traditional boats,

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:53.990
where did they get the materials
to build those large boats?

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:56.285
I mean, my
understanding of atolls

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:58.100
is they don't have
a lot of timber.

01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:05.390
- Yeah, well, the boat
that we used, actually,

01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:09.485
was built with
fiberglass, because it's

01:11:09.485 --> 01:11:12.720
a learning vessel for the
young people, for the youth.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.360
And it was funded by grants.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.720
So it was part of the deal.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:22.100
But in the olden days,
we built our boats

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.350
with breadfruit trees.

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:29.240
And Marshallese boats are
actually planks sewn together.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:35.330
And every once in a while,
a drift log would come in.

01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:38.420
But in the olden days,
drift log is like gold.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:42.350
So if you find a drift log,
it belongs to the chief,

01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:45.950
because that would be the next
voyaging canoe for the chief.

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:52.030
So, yes, and like I said, the
canoes were sewn together.

01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:56.240
So on a voyage,
there is a baler.

01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.380
And if the baler would
reach land a few times,

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:03.480
then they gave him a
piece of land as an oar,

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.706
because the canoes in those
days, if the water come

01:12:06.706 --> 01:12:09.330
to your belly button, they say,
wow, that's a really dry canoe.

01:12:13.504 --> 01:12:14.920
- Thanks for a
great presentation.

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.590
And I'm curious,
have you considered

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:19.140
adding a psychologist
or cognitive

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.644
psychologist to your team?

01:12:21.644 --> 01:12:24.060
I was struck by that thought,
thinking about what you were

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.710
saying about feeling things.

01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:29.040
And people have a sense of
time that psychologists still

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:29.750
don't understand.

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:30.720
It can be dark.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.430
And some people are
very good at knowing

01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:36.390
what time is is with no cues,
and other people are not.

01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:38.860
And I don't think that
that's very well understood.

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:43.160
But I'm guessing that this
kind of navigating by feeling

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.000
is related to that.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.490
So have you guys
thought about that?

01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:49.440
- I've certainly consulted
with a large number

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.565
of cognitive psychologists.

01:12:50.565 --> 01:12:51.905
- Do they have ideas?

01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:57.450
- Yeah, I mean, it
certainly would help.

01:12:57.450 --> 01:13:01.380
I mean, I read a lot of it
because it helps inform us.

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.600
So I'm thinking the same thing.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.640
I haven't found anybody
that's really ready

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.419
to jump in with both feet.

01:13:07.419 --> 01:13:09.210
So if you know somebody,
send them our way.

01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:20.240
- I talk about psychologists, I
was part of a crew that sailed

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.370
[INAUDIBLE] from
Hawaii to Micronesia.

01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:26.460
That was [INAUDIBLE]
last voyage.

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.280
But I was telling these guys
that every 5 to 30 minutes,

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.040
somebody had to
wash some dishes.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.220
So we keep washing and
washing the dishes,

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:38.640
I think, just to get our
mind from the open ocean

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.110
that you see out there.

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:42.110
So that's-- so when you
talk about psychology,

01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:43.860
that was first thing
that came to my mind.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:54.140
- To pick up on that--

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:57.770
in the martial arts tradition,
the center of balance

01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:01.850
is about three inches,
or three thumb lengths,

01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:04.000
below your bellybutton.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.200
It's called the [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.120
And in martial arts,
you move from there.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.830
That your center of gravity.

01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:17.130
That's also the second chakra
in the Indian yoga system.

01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:21.890
So I'm wondering whether
your stomach, the feelings

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:25.330
in your stomach, relate to that
kind of idea of the [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:26.000
and the chakra.

01:14:29.609 --> 01:14:30.650
- First I've heard of it.

01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:32.120
But it's good to know.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.620
- I would just--

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.110
I don't know if we know the
answer to that one right now.

01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:38.761
But what John and
I kind of picked up

01:14:38.761 --> 01:14:40.760
on going through some of
the academic literature

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.550
recently was this notion
of proprioception,

01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:45.350
which is what
we've come to learn

01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:49.070
is like it's a little
like kinesthetic motion.

01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:52.670
And kinesthetic intelligence is
like when your body is actually

01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:54.560
moving through something.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.110
And vestibular would
be like if your body

01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:58.460
is kind of swaying on a canoe.

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:00.140
But nobody's really
running on a canoe.

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.600
So it's really like--

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.370
proprioception is kind of
like these small, tiny, tiny

01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:08.540
movements that somehow impact
your sense of where you are.

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:10.250
And so for the most
part, like if Alson

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:13.340
is sitting on the canoe,
he's just sitting.

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:15.710
Sorry, but he's
just sitting there

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:17.360
on the leeward
platform of a canoe

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.150
just rocking back and forth
with the motion of the canoe.

01:15:20.150 --> 01:15:22.910
And so probably, it's
the tiny little feelings

01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:25.546
of his leg pushing up
against the creaking wood.

01:15:25.546 --> 01:15:28.170
And that's giving him a sense of
what's happening on the ocean.

01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:30.200
And probably, this
term proprioception

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.820
is as close as we
can come to kind

01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:34.820
of really getting
out what is probably

01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:36.520
happening inside the body.

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.730
But it's a great question.

01:15:37.730 --> 01:15:39.021
- What was that, second chakra?

01:15:39.021 --> 01:15:40.114
I'll look that up.

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:50.260
- I had a question for Alson.

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.490
That journey that you
made between the islands,

01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:54.977
have you done that many times?

01:15:54.977 --> 01:15:56.060
- That was my second time.

01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:56.930
- OK.

01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:59.960
- So you had a
sense when you were

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:03.680
moving of the angle of
the waves to the boat.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:07.950
And you knew when the angle of
the waves was going to change,

01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:10.370
just the way a hill
might bend if someone

01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:12.530
was walking along the
top of a mountain range

01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:14.120
or something like that.

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.150
And you had a sense of the time
that the boat was traveling,

01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:20.930
and when that angle
was supposed to happen.

01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:23.660
And you knew exactly where you
were relative to an island.

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:26.690
Is that-- is it just like
you have a map in your brain?

01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:27.912
And you just--

01:16:27.912 --> 01:16:28.620
- I wish.

01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:36.350
Something like that,
no just kidding.

01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:40.520
Yeah, I think from the
first voyage I went on,

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:45.725
I knew the length,
I mean the time

01:16:45.725 --> 01:16:49.460
it would take us to
sail from Majuro to--

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.660
- You knew the boat.

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:51.820
You knew the wind.

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:52.800
You knew the waves.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.755
You knew the current.

01:16:55.755 --> 01:17:00.020
- And when I was
going out, I think

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:05.670
my big concern was make
sure I don't hit the island.

01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:11.720
And with all the winds
and the swells come in,

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.840
I want to go as far
east as possible.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:19.340
So this way, I can
just follow the wind

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:20.420
and come into the island.

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.503
- Was there any point where
you had some question?

01:17:22.503 --> 01:17:26.890
Or were you always like,
no, I think I'm right here.

01:17:26.890 --> 01:17:28.730
- You should tell
the rainbow story.

01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:29.630
- Huh?

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:31.860
- The rainbow-- can
I tell it for you?

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.590
OK, I have to tell it for him.

01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:35.224
He doesn't like to brag.

01:17:35.224 --> 01:17:37.640
So what was this thing about
the 2:30 in the morning where

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.490
he knew exactly where he was.

01:17:39.490 --> 01:17:42.590
And he sailed-- we ended up
sailing a little bit too far

01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:43.190
to the east.

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:45.050
So when the sun
rose, you couldn't

01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:48.380
see anything, the island.

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:52.250
But he was sure that Aur
was to the east of it.

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:53.840
And so we started
to get the tow,

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.867
his crew was, like,
how do you know?

01:17:55.867 --> 01:17:57.950
He said, well, we're heading
towards that rainbow.

01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:01.300
There was a rainbow,
because there was a storm.

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.110
So we're heading
right towards our Aur.

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:06.860
And sure enough, just a
little while after that,

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:07.820
it started to pop out.

01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:11.270
The other one, which I'll also
say just to give you some cred,

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:15.470
was on the way back it was
slower because the wind kind

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:16.190
of dropped out.

01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:18.065
And there was this
concern about the current.

01:18:18.065 --> 01:18:19.570
So he wanted to get some sleep.

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:21.950
Now, this is where,
unfortunately, the watch comes

01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:23.570
into it, but what the hell.

01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:24.410
So he was sleeping.

01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:25.700
He said, wake me up--

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.960
to the crew, wake me up.

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.280
We're going to find Majuro.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.860
We're going to see
Majuro somewhere

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:31.990
between 9:30 and 10:00.

01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:33.990
And so they let him sleep
a little bit too long.

01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.656
And it was 9:50.

01:18:34.656 --> 01:18:37.090
And he gets up, and
he says, hey, we

01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:38.360
should see Majuro, right?

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.640
And then one of the crew
looks up, and says, oh yeah,

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.170
there it is.

01:18:41.170 --> 01:18:44.570
And it was exactly the time
that they found landfall.

01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:50.040
So whatever he's
doing, it works.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.220
- I think Alson is
evading your question

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.650
with a humbleness that is
distinctly Marshallese right

01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:55.970
now, yes.

01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:57.682
- So I have to talk for him.

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:04.880
- I keep saying [MARSHALLESE],,
which means guessing.

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.410
- Good guessing.

01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:08.240
- So I'm curious about
a few of the choices

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.100
that you all made, because
I'm not from New England.

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:11.780
So these are
questions that I don't

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:14.150
have from the inherent
knowledge that many people here

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:15.470
have about sailing.

01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:19.084
And so you all chose to go
south up to Aur, as opposed to--

01:19:19.084 --> 01:19:21.500
or excuse me, north up to Aur,
as opposed to [INAUDIBLE],,

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.600
or is it [INAUDIBLE]
that's south.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.190
Or why didn't you go east west?

01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:28.145
Or why did you go north first?

01:19:28.145 --> 01:19:30.020
Like those questions,
and you said both times

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:30.980
you left in the evening.

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:32.188
Was there a purpose for that?

01:19:32.188 --> 01:19:33.565
Or was it a personal choice?

01:19:33.565 --> 01:19:34.940
And then also
about the supplies,

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:37.180
I saw the rice and the coffee.

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:41.210
Did the weight of that
factor into your trip or not?

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:41.710
Yeah.

01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:46.560
- The rationale for
going more south,

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.550
why going in the evening.

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:51.170
- I think the
decision to go out--

01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:55.480
because we live on Majuro, so
we were just going up north

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.010
to Aur.

01:19:58.010 --> 01:20:03.380
But the reason for going
in the evening was--

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:07.430
so, one of the reasons was
we want to, when we get up,

01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:09.500
we see Aur.

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:12.350
But the plan was,
we were supposed

01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:14.360
to wait a little
bit on the island

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.160
at the mouth of the channel.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.150
But when we went out,
we enjoy the trip

01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:22.550
too much that we just
continue, and go, and just

01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:24.420
start going out to Aur.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:25.970
That wasn't part of the plan.

01:20:28.670 --> 01:20:33.380
So it's just because we
went a little bit early,

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:36.519
we changed the course
a bit toward the east.

01:20:36.519 --> 01:20:38.060
- I'll just add on--
so these canoes,

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.110
they're not tacking canoes.

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:40.776
They're actually
called shantung canoes.

01:20:40.776 --> 01:20:43.400
So to change direction, you
have to pick up the sail,

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.950
and walk it down the length
of the hull, and put it in.

01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:48.720
So it actually can be quite
dangerous on the open ocean

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:51.052
to shunt the canoe,
to change direction.

01:20:51.052 --> 01:20:53.010
So because the winds were
coming from the east,

01:20:53.010 --> 01:20:54.932
it was basically a
straight shot north.

01:20:54.932 --> 01:20:56.640
And there would be no
need to actually do

01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:58.020
that maneuver on the ocean.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.750
That was part of the strategy
of going straight north.

01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:03.160
And then all that food, that
was on the escort vessel.

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.760
So they had like a
couple of bags of food,

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.692
but we had a couple
hundred pounds of stuff

01:21:08.692 --> 01:21:10.400
in the bottom of our
escort vessel, yeah.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.310
- Thank you.

01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:21.890
Alson, I'm wondering if you
could explain or translate

01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:24.080
the chant that you started with?

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.450
And does it have
any significance

01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:29.450
about the navigational process?

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:36.110
- It's actually a chant
that we do when we sail.

01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:41.616
So it's-- the first is
actually two chants.

01:21:41.616 --> 01:21:42.685
[MARSHALLESE]

01:21:52.730 --> 01:21:55.130
That chant is actually--

01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:56.960
it's a spirit.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:00.140
So when we're actually
welcoming the spirit

01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:02.590
to be part of the crew.

01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:06.800
And the other chant is
to speed up the canoe.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:15.260
So [MARSHALLESE] is the
outrigger to balance the cue.

01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:18.810
[MARSHALLESE] is the baler
to bail out any problems

01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:22.090
that you face as you go out.

01:22:22.090 --> 01:22:26.320
[MARSHALLESE] is when
you go, the [MARSHALLESE]

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.430
is the top top part
of the sail, the mast.

01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:36.790
So you actually look forward.

01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:41.540
So when you set your course,
and you kind of [INAUDIBLE]..

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.630
[MARSHALLESE] is the
bow of the canoe.

01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:51.580
So you point the canoe into that
course that you already set.

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:59.030
[MARSHALLESE] means
that you work together,

01:22:59.030 --> 01:23:03.980
and you aim, and everything
will be as fast as when

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:05.190
the lightning strike.

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:16.670
So it's kind of like a spiritual
chant to push the canoe faster.

01:23:16.670 --> 01:23:18.620
And that's in the
olden days, everything

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.500
is all spirits, and chanting.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.630
- OK, one more
one more question.

01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:33.310
- Just technical, Joe said
they're shunting canoes.

01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:39.840
And so I'm wondering,
what do you use to steer?

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.090
Is it a rudder, an oar?

01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:46.310
- We actually have two
paddles, big use paddles.

01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:50.830
And one guy would steer
with a big paddle,

01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:53.060
is called [MARSHALLESE].

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:57.620
But there is also smaller
helper, smaller paddle to help.

01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.240
So [MARSHALLESE],,
which literally

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.370
mean the small helper.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:06.470
So these paddles
actually have the rope

01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:09.310
that ties to the
middle of the canoe.

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:14.480
So they will still
be just part of the--

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.690
they won't go anywhere.

01:24:15.690 --> 01:24:19.580
But when you shunt, then
you throw them in the water.

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.740
And then because when
you shunt, the canoe

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:24.200
actually move direction.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.420
And the paddle will
drift automatically

01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:27.700
to the other side.

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.770
But when you shunt in the
ocean, because you're going up

01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:33.980
and down, the sail actually--

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:38.630
the guy would go to the
front, and pick up the sail.

01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:44.030
And then when the canoe go down,
the sail is kind of in the air,

01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:46.130
because it's so heavy.

01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:52.020
So all you do is you actually
just guiding the sail,

01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:55.230
because when you go down, a
couple of guys in the back

01:24:55.230 --> 01:24:59.060
actually hold onto the rope,
because the masts go like this.

01:24:59.060 --> 01:24:59.840
So there's a rope.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:03.070
So they kind of pushed.

01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:05.720
And the sail actually
automatically just kind of

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.685
fly over to the other side.

01:25:08.685 --> 01:25:12.350
And it's amazing,
because these sails,

01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:16.250
it takes about five or six
guys to put it on the canoe,

01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:17.510
and set it up.

01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:20.720
But when it's shunting in
the middle of the ocean,

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:24.286
it's easier to shunt in
the middle of the ocean.

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:25.910
But you have to know
what you're doing,

01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:28.550
otherwise it's dangerous.

01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:31.700
And it's-- we were talking
about belly button.

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:35.360
And, again, that's how
you measure the rope.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:41.570
When you take the
rope that actually

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:46.510
secures the sail to the sail
step, you bring up the rope.

01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:48.190
And you put it to
your belly button.

01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:51.650
And then you go down, and
you kind of temporary lash.

01:25:51.650 --> 01:25:56.210
So when you bring the rope,
the sail, to the side,

01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:57.650
it won't go all the way out.

01:25:57.650 --> 01:25:59.900
It just stop.

01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:04.550
And whoever came up with the
measure with the belly button,

01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:06.070
actually I've done
it many times.

01:26:10.139 --> 01:26:11.180
- There's somebody there.

01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:12.620
I guess this will
be the last one.

01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:13.697
- OK.

01:26:13.697 --> 01:26:14.780
I have a question for you.

01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.113
Thank you very much, by the way.

01:26:16.113 --> 01:26:17.980
This was a wonderful
presentation.

01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:20.970
I guess this question
is for Joe and Alson.

01:26:20.970 --> 01:26:22.560
And it's about language.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.480
So I think this
presentation has done

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:27.030
a wonderful job of
helping us navigate

01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:30.360
between the cognitivist and
the experiential kind of models

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:34.410
of knowledge, and also showing
that those boundaries are

01:26:34.410 --> 01:26:36.876
quite blurry, in fact.

01:26:36.876 --> 01:26:38.250
And on the one
hand, there's sort

01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:40.020
of the mathematics
of the matter,

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.490
and there's the sort of stomach
feeling on the other hand.

01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:44.880
But I'm wondering about
this in between stuff

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.450
to do with language, and words
like swell, or [INAUDIBLE]..

01:26:48.450 --> 01:26:53.150
And maybe this is a question
to start with you, Joe,

01:26:53.150 --> 01:26:58.050
about how do you use language
to sort of try to commensurate,

01:26:58.050 --> 01:27:00.197
or not, these different
kinds of knowledge systems?

01:27:00.197 --> 01:27:01.530
And what are the limits of that?

01:27:01.530 --> 01:27:03.390
What are the affordances?

01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:06.370
- Yeah, that's a great question.

01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:09.390
So in terms of language, I
mean for myself as an outsider,

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:12.180
just the raw aspect
of trying to learn

01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:14.500
Marshallese in the first
place was challenging.

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:18.470
But once I got to a
certain level of fluency,

01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:20.220
I could start to inquire
a little bit more

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:23.610
about those meanings, and
about what they represent,

01:27:23.610 --> 01:27:25.650
and all the different
parts of that.

01:27:25.650 --> 01:27:31.950
I guess what's interesting
about this particular domain

01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:33.630
of navigation in the
Marshall Islands is

01:27:33.630 --> 01:27:36.490
that there is an extremely--

01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:38.670
there's a lot of older
terminology that seems

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:40.140
to be from a long time ago.

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:41.640
But in terms of
practical language

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.636
today, the number of
Marshallese terms that

01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:48.510
have to do with waves
and swells and currents

01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:51.500
is really, really limited.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.150
I could probably count
less than 10 terms

01:27:54.150 --> 01:27:57.420
that have to do with feelings
of like either roll, or pitch.

01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:59.350
It's very, very limited.

01:27:59.350 --> 01:28:03.710
And so in practice, like
talking with people like Captain

01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:05.325
Korent, whether
it was talk story,

01:28:05.325 --> 01:28:07.200
interviewing, or just
being on the canoe just

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.840
being with him when he
was looking at the waves,

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:13.690
most of it was not in an
articulate explanation.

01:28:13.690 --> 01:28:16.800
I mean, we tried to do
that as much as possible.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.030
But, really, for him it was
just like, look, there it is.

01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:24.240
And it was, really,
like it was--

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:25.740
he didn't have--
there weren't there

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:28.230
weren't descriptions to
say like, well, there's

01:28:28.230 --> 01:28:29.396
a certain shape of a wave.

01:28:29.396 --> 01:28:31.020
And that's what you
need to be feeling.

01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:32.853
And you're going to
feel this certain thing.

01:28:32.853 --> 01:28:34.260
There was nothing
ever like that.

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:38.520
So it was more a
very minimal amount

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.950
of language to gain access.

01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:44.610
And it was more just our
ability, both Alson and mine--

01:28:44.610 --> 01:28:48.000
in the beginning, this
was going back 10 years--

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.090
basically trying to feel
what he was pointing out,

01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:51.840
and somehow internalizing
that feeling,

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.826
but not being able
to articulate it.

01:28:54.826 --> 01:28:56.700
But then you get into
the actual terminology,

01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:58.530
there was a lot of overlap.

01:28:58.530 --> 01:29:02.400
And sometimes, there might be
a Marshallese word for wave,

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.590
which could also mean current.

01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:07.200
And sometimes that could
also refer to a swell.

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.570
And so sometimes,
the language itself

01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:11.250
will get very convoluted.

01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:14.040
And it was very frustrating
for me trying to be very like,

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:16.230
OK, we have to know
what this term means.

01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:20.200
And a lot of times, it was
just very interchangeable.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:21.870
Do you want to speak
to that at all?

01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:29.790
- Well, I could say that there's
two words that I actually

01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:32.290
repeated all the time.

01:29:32.290 --> 01:29:35.790
There, you feel it.

01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:40.090
So that's-- like Joe
said, it's very limited.

01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:47.160
So I had the opportunity
to sail with Captain

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.820
Korent in a few voyages.

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.050
And he doesn't really talk.

01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:57.590
he just say, there
you see it, there.

01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:59.220
You feel it?

01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:00.030
OK.

01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:02.270
So that was kind of
like communication

01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:03.450
go back and forth.

01:30:03.450 --> 01:30:08.355
And I think it's
much the experience.

01:30:08.355 --> 01:30:14.120
I think that's
what the focus was.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:19.040
- OK, so thank you.
