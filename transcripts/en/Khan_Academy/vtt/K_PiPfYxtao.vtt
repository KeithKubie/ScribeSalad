Voiceover:What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.826 --> 00:00:04.858
is graph up a classic exponential function

00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:07.550
and then graph a related
logarithmic function

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.025
and see how the two are related visually.

00:00:10.025 --> 00:00:11.590
The two things I'm going to graph

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.828
are y is equal to two to the x power

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:21.946
and y is equal to the log base two of x.

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:23.261
I encourage you to pause the video,

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:24.514
make a table for each of them

00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:26.697
and try to graph them
on the same graph paper.

00:00:26.697 --> 00:00:28.795
See how they are related

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.422
and if you see how they're related,

00:00:30.422 --> 00:00:32.771
think about why they are related that way.

00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:37.078
Let's first start with y
equals two to the x power.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.200
I'm going to make a little table here,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.551
different x values and the
corresponding y values.

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:44.860
x and y, we can start with negative two,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.548
negative one, zero, one, two, three.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:52.337
In each case y is going to
be two raised to these power.

00:00:52.337 --> 00:00:54.139
Two to the negative two power

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:56.791
is going to be 1/4.

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:59.673
Two to the negative one power is 1/2.

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:01.825
Two to the zero power is one.

00:01:01.825 --> 00:01:03.497
Two to the first power is two.

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.424
Two to the second power is four.

00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:07.609
Two to the third power is eight.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:08.616
Let's graph that.

00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:13.063
Two to the third power is eight.

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:24.311
Two to the second power is four.

00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:26.990
Two to the first power is two.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.654
Two to the zeroth power is one.

00:01:29.654 --> 00:01:33.100
Two to the negative one power is 1/2.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.680
Two to the negative two power is 1/4.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.861
Even the two to the negative third power

00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:39.988
is going to be 1/8,

00:01:39.988 --> 00:01:41.241
so it's going to look something like this.

00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:48.080
The graph is going to
look something like this

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.268
right over here.

00:01:49.268 --> 00:01:51.023
It's kind of your classic,

00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:54.018
sometimes this will be called
your exponential hockey stick

00:01:54.018 --> 00:01:55.558
because it kind of looks
like a hockey stick

00:01:55.558 --> 00:01:57.603
where it just kind of starts kind of slow

00:01:57.603 --> 00:01:59.906
and just oohh bam, shoots straight up.

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:02.066
Notice as we go to the left

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:04.658
as x becomes more and
more and more negative

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:08.028
our value approaches zero
but never quite gets there.

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:10.547
If we have two to the
negative one millionth power

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.241
it's going to be a
very, very small number,

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:13.797
very, very close to zero

00:02:13.797 --> 00:02:15.984
but it's not going to be quite zero.

00:02:15.984 --> 00:02:20.673
We're going to have a
horizontal asymptote at y

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.149
is equal to zero

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:24.799
or the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote.

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:25.808
Fair enough.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.083
Now let's graph y is equal
to log base two of x.

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:33.845
Before I graph that, let's
just think about another way

00:02:33.845 --> 00:02:34.780
of representing it.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.157
This literally says, for any x,

00:02:36.157 --> 00:02:40.764
what power, what exponent
y if I raise two to that

00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:41.790
would give me x.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.969
This is an equivalent statement

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.837
as saying two to the
y power is equal to x.

00:02:48.637 --> 00:02:50.541
If you notice, what we've done here

00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:51.784
between these two things

00:02:51.784 --> 00:02:53.618
you're essentially just
switching the x's and the y's.

00:02:53.618 --> 00:02:55.593
Here's two to the x power is equal to y.

00:02:55.593 --> 00:02:58.396
Here's two to the y power is equal to x.

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:06.982
Really this and this you've
swapped the x's and the y's.

00:03:06.982 --> 00:03:11.942
What we will see is
that we can essentially

00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:13.462
swap these two columns.

00:03:13.462 --> 00:03:15.514
x and y,

00:03:15.514 --> 00:03:21.999
so let me just do 1/4, 1/2, one, two,

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.292
four, and eight.

00:03:27.015 --> 00:03:31.483
Here now we're saying if x is 1/4,

00:03:31.483 --> 00:03:33.588
what power do we have to raise two to,

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.505
to get to 1/4.

00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:38.475
We have to raise it to
the negative two power.

00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:42.120
Two to the negative one
power is equal to 1/2.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.737
Two to the zero power is equal to one.

00:03:44.737 --> 00:03:47.249
Two to the first power is equal to two.

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.254
Two to the second power is equal to four.

00:03:49.254 --> 00:03:51.324
Two to the third power is equal to eight.

00:03:51.324 --> 00:03:52.523
Notice all we did,

00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:55.521
as we essentially swapped
these two columns,

00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:56.692
so let's graph this.

00:03:56.692 --> 00:04:01.812
When x is equal to 1/4, y
is equal to negative two.

00:04:01.812 --> 00:04:09.637
When x is 1/2, y is equal to negative one.

00:04:09.637 --> 00:04:12.642
When x is one, y is zero.

00:04:12.642 --> 00:04:17.786
When x is two, y is one.

00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:22.318
When x is four, y is two.

00:04:22.318 --> 00:04:26.136
When x is eight, y is three.

00:04:26.136 --> 00:04:28.313
It's going to look like this.

00:04:29.574 --> 00:04:31.812
Notice, I think you
might already be seeing

00:04:31.812 --> 00:04:33.225
a pattern right over here.

00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:36.545
These two graphs are essentially

00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:38.067
the reflections of each other.

00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:39.649
What would you have to reflect about

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:40.792
to get these two?

00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:44.139
Well you'd have to reflect
about y is equal to x.

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.243
If you swap the x's and the y's,

00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:49.096
another way to think about,

00:04:49.096 --> 00:04:51.250
if you swap the axis you
would get the other graph.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.440
It's essentially what we're doing.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.657
Notice it's symmetric about that line

00:04:57.657 --> 00:04:59.296
and that's because these are essentially

00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:00.814
the inverse functions of each other.

00:05:00.814 --> 00:05:04.346
One way to think about it is we swapped

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:05.880
the x's and y's.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.683
Just as this, as x becomes more and more

00:05:09.683 --> 00:05:11.255
and more and more negative

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:13.121
you see y approaching zero.

00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:15.837
Here you see is y is becoming
more and more negative

00:05:15.837 --> 00:05:20.129
as x is approaching zero,

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.101
or you could say as x approaches zero

00:05:22.101 --> 00:05:25.294
y becomes more and more and more negative.

00:05:25.294 --> 00:05:26.806
The whole point of this

00:05:26.806 --> 00:05:28.210
is just to give you an appreciation

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.784
for the relationship between
an exponential function

00:05:30.784 --> 00:05:32.113
and a logarithmic function.

00:05:32.113 --> 00:05:34.355
They're essentially
inverses of each other.

00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:36.029
You see that in the graphs,

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:37.194
they're reflections of each other

00:05:37.194 --> 00:05:40.354
about the line y is equal to x.
