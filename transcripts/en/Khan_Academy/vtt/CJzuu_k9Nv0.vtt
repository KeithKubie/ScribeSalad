00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.830
Let's see if we can handle some
slightly more difficult

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.210
amine naming examples.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
So if we look at this blue
molecule right here, we always

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.170
want to start off by finding
the longest carbon chain.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.480
It looks like it's this chain
at the bottom where we have

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.870
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight carbons.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.530
So it's going to be octan.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.640
We don't want to just call it
octane because we have these

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.340
functional groups up here, and
maybe one of them's going to

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.290
take higher priority
than just the fact

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.000
that this is an alkane.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.610
And, in fact, one
of them will.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.850
So let's look at them.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.340
So over here we an
amino group.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.310
That would make this
molecule an amine.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.170
So this is an amino
group right here.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.500
Then we have this
benzene ring.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.540
And when benzene is a functional
group, we call it a

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.790
phenyl group.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.600
And that's derived from I think
it's either the Greek or

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.170
the Latin word for light because
benzene was first

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.430
isolated from, I guess, the
air around lanterns or

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.360
something, so this is called
a phenyl group.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.670
And then finally we have this
OH, which would make this

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.590
whole thing an alcohol, or we
could call that a hydroxy

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.600
group, so this right here
is a hydroxy group.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.550
Now, this is just something
that you need to know.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.560
There's no way to kind
of deduce it.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.025
The people who've decided how
to name things just decided

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:22.990
that certain groups take higher
priority over others.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.170
And out of these three groups,
the hydroxy group, the thing

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.470
that's making this whole thing
an alcohol, takes the highest

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.790
priority, so this is what's
going to define the suffix.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.145
So if we start numbering, we
want to start numbering this

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:37.870
chain closest to the highest
priority group.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.310
So we'll start numbering
at this end.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.250
So it's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.570
So we have a hydroxy group on
the three carbon, so this is

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.820
octan-3-ol.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.960
If this was not a high priority,
we would put a

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.790
hydroxy in the front, but since
this is the highest

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.720
prioritiy, its defining this
as an alcohol, octanol.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.290
But we put the 3 there to say
it's on the three carbon.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.120
And then, of course, this
would be 5-phenyl.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.930
This right here is 5-phenyl.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.470
And this right here
is 8-amino.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.470
And amino comes before phenyl in
alphabetical order, so this

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.230
whole molecule is going to
be-- let me write it over

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.480
here-- it's going to be
8-amino-5-phenyl-octan-3-ol.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.030
And we're done.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.540
So this is an aromatic compound
because of the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.300
benzene ring.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.730
It's an amine because
of the amino group.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.890
And it's an alcohol because
of the hydroxy group.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.810
Now let's look at this molecule
here in green.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.500
And actually, I forgot
to draw part of it.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.160
This is supposed to
be a benzene ring.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.720
So let me make clear.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.975
That is a benzene ring.

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:07.740
So let's think about
the different

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.800
functional groups here.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.750
And we'll start with the one
that you've probably never

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.000
seen before.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.240
This is a nitro group, and
it's highly explosive.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.800
Maybe in a future video, I'll
show you some nitroglycerin

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.860
and some TNT, as you know, which
are highly explosive,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.720
but they have nitro
groups on them.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.040
So this right here
is a nitro group.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.750
It takes very low precedence in
the whole scheme of things.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.480
So this will never be the cause
of naming the suffix.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.970
We just know that this is a
nitro group right here.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.970
We, of course, have
a bromo group that

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.820
we've seen many times.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.980
That is a bromo group.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.230
And then we have an amino
group right here.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.760
So this is going to be--
let me do this

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.110
in a different color.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.220
This is definitely an amine.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.440
This is an amino group
right there.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.315
And out of these three groups,
the amino group is definitely

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.600
of the highest priority.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.552
So you might be tempted to name
this 1-amino-2,3-brom

00:04:13.552 --> 00:04:21.540
o-4-nitrobenzene, but when a
benzene ring is attached to an

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.080
amino group, this one also has
one of those special names.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.930
And let me just do it on
the side right here.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:35.650
So if I just have a benzene
ring attached to an amino

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.330
group, so that's an NH2 right
there, we call this molecule

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.515
right here, and this is just
the common name for it and

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:45.910
it's something to put in your
toolkit, this is aniline.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.710
So that will be the base name.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.800
This whole thing right
here we call aniline.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.900
Let me write it over here.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.440
So this is aniline.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.280
And then we always want to start
numbering at the group

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.400
that's really defining the
molecules, so we start

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.260
numbering here.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.110
And you want to go in the order
where you're going to

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.220
bump into something first. So,
one, two, three, four.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.610
So this is going to be-- if we
look at them, and bromo comes

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.320
alphabetically before nitro,
so it's going to be

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.570
3-bromo-4-nitroaniline.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.950
And we are done!
