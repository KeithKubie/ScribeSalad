00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.029
Most people have nightmares that they’ll
be naked in public.

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.569
I have nightmares Trace will be naked in public.

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.860
Hey Julian!

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.590
Hello Jacks and Sallys, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.730
In the comments of a recent video Luke Hutton
asked us why we get nightmares.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.910
Well Luke today’s the day you’ve been
dreaming about.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.590
Or had nightmares about, if you don’t like
my jokes.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.230
Yes the common knowledge holds true that nightmares
are often a reflection of your waking mental

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.230
state.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.129
Stressing about a looming unpleasantness,
as well as anxiety from events passed can

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.379
cause nightmares.

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.059
Really traumatic events like car accidents
or wars can lead to nightmares with recurring

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.160
themes, or reliving the event over and over.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.300
Healing from the trauma should cause the nightmares
to become less frequent and intense over time.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.300
If you’re among the 5% of people who have
nightmares often enough to affect your waking

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.350
hours, consider seeing a therapist.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.019
Working through stress or trauma in real life
will help you sleep peacefully.

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.429
Nightmares can also be caused by medications
or drugs, especially ones that affect neurotransmitters

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.199
like antidepressants or narcotics.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.140
People who have what psychologists define
as “thin boundaries of the mind” are more

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.810
prone to nightmares too.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.390
These people tend to be more creative and
imaginative, and sometimes have trouble separating

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.750
fantasy from reality.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.160
There are also idiopathic nightmares, meaning
we don’t know why they happen, they just

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.160
do.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.150
So if you have a nightmare every now and again,
it’s nothing to worry about.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.660
85% of adults report having nightmares on
occasion.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.180
They’re more common for children, particularly
young girls, and are likely caused when the

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.950
child is struggling to cope with normal childhood
fears.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.930
To understand nightmares, and to a larger
extent dreams, it helps to know what’s happening

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.780
in your thinking meat while you’re unconscious.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.730
Dreams and nightmares happen during REM, the
last step in the sleep cycle before it starts

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.730
over.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.970
During REM your brain becomes much more active
than when you’re in deep sleep.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.890
Your amygdala in your temporal cortex starts
humming along during REM, and that little

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.200
guy is responsible for processing memory,
decisions, and emotional reactions.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.400
Some areas have even more activity than when
you’re awake, like the hippocampus, which

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.710
is the storage center of memory and emotions;
and parts of your cortex, particularly your

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.890
temporal and occipital lobes.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.990
These regions handle sensory input and visual
information, respectively.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.349
There’s also some spikes in some fast wavelengths,
likely caused by the cortex communicating

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.299
with the thalamus, which is thought to be
a hub for information sharing.

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.200
One area of your brain that doesn’t light
up in REM though is the prefrontal cortex,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.749
which is used in information integration and
episodic memory.

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:26.349
With all that brain talk I just threw at you
in mind, the why and how of nightmares and

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.370
dreams starts to make a little more sense.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.999
The parts of your brain that are involved
in long term memory, emotion, vision, and

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:36.950
language are all hard at work, but the prefrontal
cortex is literally asleep at the metaphorical

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.569
wheel, meaning nothing’s really guiding
what the rest of your brain is doing.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.610
The result is bizarre dreams or nightmares,
especially when something has had a strong

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.870
emotional impact.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.530
And since the REM stage gets longer with each
cycle and is the one you have right before

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.819
you wake up, dreams or nightmares get longer
and more intense until finally you come out

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.400
of it going, “What on earth was that about?”

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.590
So nightmares can be caused by stress or emotions,
but do you have the ability to control them

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.870
while you sleep?

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:17.749
Anthony has the answer here.

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.930
This question was asked by a viewer and we
hope we answered it to his satisfaction.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.920
If you have questions, lay it on us.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.250
You can ask them in the comments or on twitter
or facebook.

Don’t forget to subscribe, it’s kind of
important to come back so you can see the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.340
answer, and I’ll see you next time on DNews!
