TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, everyone.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.320
We're now in the Design
Sandbox, and I've got Liam here,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.730
who is a design advocate.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.670
He's going to tell us
all about the latest

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.687
features and announcement
for material design.

00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:20.270
In fact, there's
some tools that we're

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.515
going to take a look at, right?

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:22.460
LIAM SPRADLIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.004
So one of our big
announcements was

00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:25.670
the idea of material
theming, and that's

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.250
really embodied not
only in the new guidance

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.062
but also in some new
tools that we have,

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.520
one of them being
the Theme Editor,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.470
which is part of
our Sketch plugin.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.210
So I just want to do
a quick demo here.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.260
You can see we have four
existing mock-ups on screen,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.830
and we have a theme
set up in Theme Editor.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.060
So if we switch
over to that, you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.990
can do something as easy as
just adjusting the color.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.200
So if you choose a blue color,
or you can choose a default

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.590
material swatch, it
will automatically

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.080
generate a tonal
palette from that

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.570
and apply it to all
of our components,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.430
tuned for accessibility
and style.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.680
So then we can choose
an accent color.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.480
I'll do a yellow.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.970
And then we'll just save that.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.450
And when we switch over
here, it will show us

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.730
a library is available.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.450
So we just update our
symbols, and all of our colors

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.425
have been systematically applied
throughout all of our mock-ups.

00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:27.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.524
I think particularly is this
idea of the color cascading

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:33.065
through your whole design when
you just make a simple change.

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:33.940
LIAM SPRADLIN: Right.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.470
So it's not just
taking one color

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.386
and applying that
everything in the interface.

00:01:37.386 --> 00:01:39.610
It's actually drawing
from this tonal palette

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.860
to say, what is the
best shade for a text

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.120
field in its resting state?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.960
Or what should
the text label be?

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.494
So it tunes that for
accessibility and for style.

00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:49.660
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And can you
show us one more thing--

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.447
exporting this into Gallery?

00:01:51.447 --> 00:01:52.780
LIAM SPRADLIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.910
So part of our
Sketch plugin is also

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.040
the ability to upload
everything to Gallery,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.011
so I can just upload
this as a new iteration

00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:02.510
on our existing
[? crane ?] project.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:16.420
And once it uploads,
there we go.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:25.020
You can just hit View,
and in Gallery it's

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.180
uploaded all of our mocks.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.300
And because we used Theme
Editor, when you enter Inspect

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.120
Mode, you can actually
click on things

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.950
and find what the text style is
and all of the different specs

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.552
that you'll need to
actually implement this.

00:02:42.552 --> 00:02:44.760
So you can select like
something like a [INAUDIBLE],,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.301
and that will actually
give you links

00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:48.650
out to both the materials
spec and the platform-specific

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.930
implementation.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.761
So you can switch to Android
if you're working on Android,

00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:55.010
and then click out and be
taken right to documentation

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.085
for that component.

00:02:57.085 --> 00:02:58.800
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really awesome.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.030
Thank you so much for
showing that to us.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.863
LIAM SPRADLIN: Yeah.

00:03:00.863 --> 00:03:01.450
Thank you.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And if you'd like

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.196
to find out more about
material design and all

00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:05.850
the announcements
from here at I/O,

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.490
head on over to material.io.
