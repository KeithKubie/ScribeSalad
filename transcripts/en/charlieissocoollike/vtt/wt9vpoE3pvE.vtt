00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.630
Am I going to do the glasses?
Yeah, we'll do glasses. 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.990
You just have to put up with--
This is just gonna be the video.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.230
You will never
see my pupils. 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.510
How you doing?
It's me. That one guy. 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.710
You probably don't
watch me anymore. 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.160
It's fine. I'm still
here, though. 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.010
I'm just going to chat
with you today. 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.660
What's... How do you do this?
How do you vlog? 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.180
Let's start again,
shall we?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.460
SOFT CLAP
That wasn't a very good clap. 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.700
HARD CLAP
I went to a party the other day. 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.420
I went to my first
party of the year.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.550
It was three days ago. 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.420
I am a social butterfly,
I think you could agree. 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.420
For a very long period in my life,
I assumed that I didn't like parties, 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.960
and rightly so because I went to a fair amount
of parties and I never enjoyed myself. 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.800
There were drunk
people all around me 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.180
encouraging me to be drunk
and I did not want it. 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.510
I always wanted to sit in the
corner and play video games. 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450
That was always the highlight
of any party for me: 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.600
if I could find the
Nintendo 64 in the corner 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.020
and encourage whoever's it was to hook it up
so I could just play some Mario Kart. 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.510
That's the kind of
party I like to have. 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.810
There was legitimately one
house party that I went to 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.600
where I brought my GameCube
along being like, 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.920
"Oh, we could like play Mario Kart together.
Wouldn't that be fun?" 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.670
But I "accidentally" left my copy
of Zelda the Wind Waker in there 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.960
and spent the evening
playing Zelda 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.020
and I had like a little audience
of people watching me as well.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.060
That was the
best party. 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.030
I finally came to the realization, though,
that it wasn't parties that I didn't like. 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.220
I just never went to parties
with anybody that I liked. 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.940
And now, I get to go to parties with people
I do like and it's great. They're very pleasant. 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.500
That's a major realization in
my life is that parties can be fun.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.710
Well done, Charlie.
Got there eventually. 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.720
I even went as far as to have
alcohol at a party. Not much at all. 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.710
I had like that much champagne,
but to me it was a big deal. 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.690
I was like, "This is not the
Charlie that I know, 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.560
but he's kind of fancy
and maybe I like him." 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.500
I still have absolutely zero
interest in getting drunk. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.470
I don't understand the appeal
of that, but as it happens, 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.730
you can have a small amount of alcohol
and it makes you feel quite nice 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.300
so long as you're very
sensible about it. 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.540
Another realization that everyone else
has already had, but here I am having it. 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.650
Usually, I plan these things
intensely, very intensely. 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.130
I write out a whole script,
but I am too busy.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.690
I'm doing films now. 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.140
Keeping up with the YouTubers of
today, daily vlogging and all that. 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.300
Nope, not going to do it. 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.780
Going to make 11 minute short films
instead because that's nice and easy. 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.360
The film I'm trying to make right now is
proving to be harder than the first one, 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.500
which was deliberate. 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.670
I wanted ot push myself,
but, turns out, 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.980
when you try to do something
harder, it's harder. 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.070
Well done, Charlie. Just full of
revelations today, aren't I. 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.110
But it'll be fine. 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.950
It's stressful, but that's
what film making is, 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.210
and I am just thrilled
that I get to be doing it.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.170
That is all. Thank you
for clicking on my face. 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.010
If you liked this video, I'm not
going to tell you to click like. 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.510
You thought it was
coming, didn't you? 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.840
You thought
"If you like this--" nope. 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.780
If you like this style of video, let me know
because this was super easy to make.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.950
My God, it's kind of nice not
having a script, actually. 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.030
It's been a while since I've
done this, but. Okay, bye! 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.350
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike, 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.330
which makes you, like, cool. 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.898
CHARLIE: That was fun.
I liked that. I want to do more.
