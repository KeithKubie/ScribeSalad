00:00:20.213 --> 00:00:22.810
Making liquid oxygen is pretty
straightforward if you happen

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.780
to have some liquid nitrogen,
which I do.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.620
So what I've got here, my
cylinder of oxygen, and I'm

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.580
passing the oxygen through this
copper coil here, which

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.390
is immersed in liquid
nitrogen.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.460
The oxygen has a higher
boiling point than the

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.600
nitrogen, so it condenses in
the coil, so by the time it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.655
comes out the other end of
the tube, it's a liquid.

00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:46.730
So this has been
going a while.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.512
I've nearly got a full tube,
so I'm just going to - Oh!

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:54.460
yep, that's pretty full.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.240
So I'll just put this
down over here.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.700
OK, yeah.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.270
So, good.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.043
A half liter of liquid
oxygen here.

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:06.080
I'll just show you what
it looks like.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.760
So there you go.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.980
That's liquid oxygen.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.750
Probably the first thing you
will notice about it I would

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.190
think is that it's actually
blue, which

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.820
is a bit of a surprise.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.250
Colour quite often is just a
manifestation of the way that

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.140
light interacts with the
electrons in materials.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.270
So straight away, this is saying
that there might be

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.490
something a bit funny about
the way the electrons are

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.380
arranged in oxygen molecules.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.170
What that is, actually,
is that there

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.030
are unpaired electrons.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.500
Electrons usually like to pair
up, but in oxygen, there are a

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.640
couple that that doesn't happen
to, and we call them

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.960
unpaired electrons.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.760
And there's actually another
unusual property of oxygen

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.490
that arises from the unpaired
electrons, which I want to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.740
show you now.

00:01:56.317 --> 00:01:58.440
All right, I've got a great big
magnet here, as you can

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.900
see, just a couple of nuts
between the poles just to

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.300
bring the poles slightly closer
together, and I'm going

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.530
to pour the liquid oxygen
between the poles like so, and

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.789
there you go.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.490
You can see the oxygen is -
until it boils away - is

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.710
sticking briefly between the
poles of the magnet.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.920
So, what's going on here, again,
is because of those

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.170
unpaired electrons.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.360
Any electron in an atom or in a
molecule contributes a small

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.800
magnetic dipole moment.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.470
Normally when those electrons
are paired up, the magnetic

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.930
dipole moments cancel out, but
obviously with oxygen, you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.590
have these unpaired electrons,
that doesn't happen.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.230
So as a result, the whole
molecule has a residual dipole

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.540
and acts as a tiny
little magnet.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.325
So I'll keep on pouring this
in, and we can keep

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:47.852
on looking at it.

00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:51.090
Now normally when the oxygen is
just sitting in the flask

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.460
or in the air, all those tiny
little magnets are pointing in

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.160
random directions basically,
so they all cancel out.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.980
So there's no net macroscopic
magnetic field.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.760
But when you introduce the
permanent magnets to the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.780
oxygen here, then you get those
magnetic molecules all

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.300
slightly aligning a bit more
than they would normally, and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.130
that creates a net
magnetic field.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.360
So the induced magnetic field
then interacts with the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.690
magnetic field from the dirty
great magnet and you get the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.910
oxygen sticking in the poles.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.020
Now this phenomenon is something
called power

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.530
magnetism where you get an
induced attractive magnetic

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.210
field in a material.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.090
And I think it was actually
Michael Faraday who discovered

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.270
the oxygen was paramagnetic
right here at the Ri.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.700
So one final thing, seeing as
this is liquid oxygen and this

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.540
is the Royal Institution,
I'm going to set

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.470
something on fire.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.580
This is the classic
demonstration of oxygen

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.860
relighting a glowing splint.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.340
Lovely.
