00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.250
DNews is based in grand old San Francisco.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.770
Known for it’s culture, or counterculture,
giant reddish orange bridge, and earthquakes.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.949
Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates shift.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.310
This sudden burst of energy sends seismic
waves shooting in all directions.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.759
These waves can violently shake buildings
both up and down and side to side with enormous

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:30.759
force.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.320
It’s this forceful shifting that actually
causes stress on the buildings to the point

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.450
of collapse.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.500
As we live in an Earthquake prone area, we
realize a fundamental truth.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.100
Earthquakes don’t kill people.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.100
Buildings do.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.859
So researchers have spent a lot of time wondering
how to make buildings safer.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.710
When an engineer is first planning a new building
they have to take into account where the building

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.989
will be built.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.170
Earthquake guidelines are different in say
Kansas than in California.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.879
The intensity of forces from Earthquakes varies
from place to place.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.409
The goal when building in high intensity earthquake
areas is to make a building earthquake resistant.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.870
Earthquake proof is doable, but extremely
expensive.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.670
Now, to be considered “Earthquake resistant”
a building can suffer damaging, but it can’t

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.710
collapse on the people trying to get out.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.230
And there’s two main ways to do that, by
designing a building so it’s stronger or

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.659
more flexible.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.840
One way engineers can make buildings stronger
is by reinforcing concrete with steel.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.369
But in high risk areas like California, that’s
often not enough.

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.640
One of the most effective ways to protect
a building from such disasters is to keep

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.640
them from moving by detaching it from the
ground.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.000
Base isolation is when engineers design a
structure to be built on top of a separate

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.829
base, instead of attached to a foundation,
so that when an earthquake hits, the base

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.469
moves, but the building only ways slightly.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.170
For instance San Francisco’s City Hall was
retrofitted with a base isolation system.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.710
And this concept isn’t new.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.460
We see these examples as early as the 4th
century.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.270
They utilized isolation bases made of smooth
rocks that could slide against each other.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.619
In modern times these bases are usually made
out of a combination of a flexible material

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.170
like rubber and steel.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.920
The rubber also acts like a shock absorber.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.429
But a cool piece of shocking tech comes Taiwan.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.350
The supertall skyscraper, Taipei 101, combats
earthquakes with a giant 728 ton ball.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.750
Well it’s technically called a “tuned
mass damper” but it’s basically a giant

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.220
ball that’s suspended near the top of the
building.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.730
If the building sways because of an earthquake
or a typhoon, the damper swings in the opposite

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.730
direction.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.130
During a particularly strong gust in 2015,
the ball in Taipei 101, swung a meter from

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.530
it’s center position.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.850
And technology is getting even more advanced.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.070
According to one study published in the journal
Applied Physics Letters researchers are working

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.760
on a way to make a building invisible to shock
waves using a shield.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.070
This shield of concrete and plastic buried
at least 3 feet down, looks like two rainbows

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.550
surrounding the building with a gap between
them.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.680
Each strip, or “color” is more stiff the
farther out they are from the core.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.000
The waves have an easier time traveling through
a stiff and hard layer.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.950
So the waves, once they hit a softer layer,
deflect and head back to the easier path.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.370
The way these plates curve, essentially channels
the shock waves around the building.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.360
As they move around the building they hit
a gap in the plate which allows some of the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.770
force to dissipate.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.440
So the plate kind of hides the building from
the Earthquake.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.760
Like an invisibility cloak for earthquakes!

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.040
When earthquakes hit, their intensity is measured
in a point system called the richter scale.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.010
Trace takes a look at the different ways seismologists
measure earthquakes and what do these ratings

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:45.440
mean in this episode right here.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.740
