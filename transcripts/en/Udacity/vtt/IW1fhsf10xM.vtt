00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
Now how about this little bit more complicated graph?

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.900
Again, I would like you to figure out the number of paths or the number of different ways

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.370
that you can take to get from A to B and the rules here are again the same--

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.970
you can only travel in this forward direction.

00:00:16.970 --> 99:59:59.000
I'm again going to draw the little arrows. So please enter your answer here into this box.
