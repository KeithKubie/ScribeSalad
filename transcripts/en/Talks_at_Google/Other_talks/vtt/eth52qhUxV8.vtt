&gt;&gt;Heath: Hi. My name is Heath. I'm a volunteer
with the Authors@Google team. Thank you for

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.219
joining us today. If you'd like to get involved,
or if you have ideas of other authors you'd

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.349
like to bring in, please let one of us know.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.960
Today we're here to hear from Wes Moore author
of "The Other Wes Moore: One Name Two Fates",

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.680
and by way of introduction I'm just going
to read from the jacket, because I think it

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.350
sets it up pretty well.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.820
"Two kids with the same name were born blocks
apart in the same decaying city within a year

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.860
of each other. One grew up to be a Rhodes
Scholar, decorated combat veteran, White House

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.500
fellow and business leader. The other is serving
a life sentence in prison. Here is the story

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.050
of two boys in the journey of a generation."

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.000
We're lucky today to have one of those two
men with us today. "Wes Moore is a Rhodes

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.480
scholar, a combat veteran of Afghanistan.
As a White House fellow, he worked as special

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.260
assistant Secretary Condoleezza Rice at the
State Department. He was a featured speaker

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.071
at the 2008 Democratic National Convention
and was dubbed one of the Top Young Business

00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:05.780
Leaders in New York by Crain's New York Business.
He currently lives and works in New York City."

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.780
And it's a pleasure to have him in Santa Monica.
Wes Moore.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.420
[audience clapping]

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.869
&gt;&gt;Wes Moore: Thank you very much. It is an
absolute pleasure to, uh, be here. Um, I am

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.119
a huge fan of-of Google for whole collection
of different reasons. First of all, just these

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.770
are some of the coolest offices I've ever
been to before, and in particular if you look

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.320
at the offices that we work at back in New
York there really is no comparison to a to,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.770
to just how much creativity and openness that
you-that you see here is pretty awesome. Um.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.080
Even though I have to say that last weekend,
when y'all did the whole Pac Man thing that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.259
was the most least productive weekend I've
had in my life.

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:45.259
[audience laughing]

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.572
Seriously, I must've spent about eight hours
just tried it figure out trying to get to

00:01:47.572 --> 00:01:48.572
the banana level...

00:01:48.572 --> 00:01:49.572
[audience laughing]

00:01:49.572 --> 00:01:53.150
Moore: ...of Pac Man. But it is really cool
to be here. And actually I have a quick Google

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.630
story, which is which is a true story. Um.
Back in the late 1990s, must have been either

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.700
'97 or '98. I was at some conference, you
know, how you have these like these young

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.100
leaders conferences, whatever. And I was down
at Washington, DC. And I met a guy, ah. And

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.899
I met a guy, and he was telling me his name
was name is Larry.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.421
And I was like," Oh, hey Larry. Nice to meet
you." Um, I was like, "What do you do?" and

00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:16.230
I-I-I felt real good about myself, because
I was just a new student at Johns Hopkins.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.670
And I was like yeah. I'm on my way and I was
like, "So Larry, what do you do?"

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.790
He was like, "Oh, um-I'm um at Stanford. I'm
a graduate student." He was like, "I'm working

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.200
on this business. Umm. And it's a, it's a
'search engine.'"

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.380
And I was like, "A search engine. Okay, that's
interesting. Cool." And I was like, "What's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.380
the name of it?"

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.690
He was like, " It's coming down, but it's
gonna be called Google. You know. It's gonna

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.760
be called Google."

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.530
I was like, "Yeah, well listen, best of luck
to you with that Google idea."

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.770
[audience laughter]

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.710
&gt;&gt;Moore: [laughing]
Um. I wish I could go back in time and say,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.890
"I'd love to invest in that idea, actually."
But um- But it is. Seriously, it is very cool

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.040
to be here, and I am just very appreciative
of the time, and very appreciative, Ahhh of

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.819
our attention. And to all the folks in Googleworld,
it's, ah, great seeing y'all as well.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.319
Ah. I am extraordinarily proud of this book,
and I'm extraordinarily proud of this book

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.280
not just because of, you know, the idea of
just getting this but done, uh, but it's the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.800
idea of a conversation this book is starting.
The idea that the book is really creating,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.800
it's really touching a nerve amongst a lot
of people because I think that they are seeing

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.040
that this book is about so much more than
just these two boys. That this book is about

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.480
so much more than just Baltimore, that this
book is about more than one socio-economic

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.269
group. Ah, But this book is really about all
of us. It is about the choices that we make,

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.959
the people who we have in our lives who are
helping us make those choices, and also with

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.530
the ramifications for those choices..

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.849
My-ah-my-my journey really began back in back
in Maryland, and I'm extraordinarily happy

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:51.810
that my two sisters are here in the-in the
audience as well. But our journey really began

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.010
in the Maryland. Back in 1982 when I was 3
1/2 years old, our father died in front of

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.349
us, and it was something that was so jarring
and so shocking, because here was our-our

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:10.580
mother who at that time was, you know, with
her, you know, with her three children and

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.299
her husband, when out of nowhere, instantaneously,
and completely unexpectedly she was on her

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.509
own. She was now a widow with these three
children. And she really had a difficult time

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.740
dealing with that transition to the point
where a few years after my father passed away,

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.820
she moved us up to New York, up to the Bronx.
And, ah, for the Bronx was going through a

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.409
very interesting time, because the Bronx during
the mid and late 1980s was going through something

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:41.309
a lot of cities in this country were going
through, and that was the introduction of

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:46.740
little rocks that could be found inside of
little vials that were basically running roughshod

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.509
through communities, throughout many communities
in this country. And that was the introduction

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.539
of crack cocaine. And you saw what happened
just the internal fabric of entire communities.

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.620
My mother, as she grew up in the Bronx, you
know, she always talked about how the Bronx

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.349
was a was a place that was a it was a "safe
place" and neighbors they looked out for each

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.139
other. And that was one thing that she loved
about the Bronx. She hadn't seen violence

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.139
until she actually went down to Washington,
DC to college. But the neighborhood that she

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.259
returned back to was a very different neighborhood
than the neighborhood she grew up in. And

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.230
I think as the Bronx was going through this
transition, I think all of us were going through

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.379
this transition now as well.
Now coming up in this new environment, coming

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.919
up in this new community. So as I'm going
in this journey into manhood and trying to

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.509
understand what that means at the same time
you're coming from a neighborhood that's going

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.530
through its transition, and at the same time,
I'm then really starting to understand what

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.330
had happened to us when I was 3 1/2 years
old. Because when you're 3 1/2 years old,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.759
you're enough to know. I was old enough to
know that something happened with my father,

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.479
but I wasn't quite old enough though to know
exactly what. And when you're 3 1/2 years

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.979
old, you're old enough to know that he'd gone
somewhere, but you're not quite old enough

00:05:53.979 --> 00:06:01.089
to understand exactly where. And so as I got
older, and started to internalize it, that

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:08.069
confusion led to anger, that confusion led
to fear, that confusion led to apathy, and

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.072
I think it started to manifest itself in a
lot of things I was doing whether it is back

00:06:11.072 --> 00:06:15.899
in the classroom or back the neighborhood.
So, by the time I was literally 11 years old,

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:20.229
I was already on academic and disciplinary
probation at my school, and then I was also

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.120
now getting in trouble back in the neighborhood.
In fact, there was one time I had a, had a

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.319
friend who was also at this time we were both
11, and he was what we called the runner.

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:36.169
Now what of runner is in many communities
that you find these drug enterprises, runners

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:40.819
are generally kids. Who they'll get to move
the packages from one side of town to another

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:44.389
because generally the cops won't check them.
And so the older boys would get the younger

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.771
guys they would pay them a little bit of money
so they could move a package, hush, then they

00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:51.139
would do it and come back showing that the
package was delivered, and then they would

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.149
get their little bit of money or whatever
it was. So I had a friend of mine who was

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:59.949
a runner, and so he just finish work, his
job, and I have just finished playing a game

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:04.949
of basketball, and so he calls-he calls me
out, we start talking. And then he says, "Hey

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.819
do you want to tag." And what tagging is,
tagging is essentially just spray painting.

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:13.409
You know, you see walls with spray paint on
it and everyone has their little tags or monikers.

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:17.629
And mine was "Kid Cupid." That was the name
I gave myself. I enjoyed it; I thought I was

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:23.869
"Kid Cupid." And considering my spelling abilities,
I spelled it with a KK instead of KC. And

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:27.809
so he's like, "Do you want to tag?" and I'm
like, "Yeah of course." So we reach inside

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:35.869
his bag and we pull out a can of spray paint.
And I proceeded to do my K and another K put

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:42.999
a circle around it, and that was my little
indelible mark on this Bronx wall. Then out

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:47.619
of nowhere a cop car turns the corner and
you start hearing that "Whoop! Whoop!" You

00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:51.789
know, that distinctive police siren, and so
my friend and I looked at each other, and

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:54.880
then we start bolting off in different directions.
He runs in one direction, and I run in the

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.151
other direction. I was a really brilliant
one who ran in the direction of the cops.

00:07:58.151 --> 00:07:59.300
[audience laughing]

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.899
&gt;&gt;Moore: And so literally in, probably about
three or four steps, the cops grabbed me,

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:09.719
put handcuffs on me, and throw me in the back
of the car. My friend, they grab him and throw

00:08:09.719 --> 00:08:16.209
him in the back of the car. So at this point,
we're in the back of his car, and I am terrified.

00:08:16.209 --> 00:08:20.060
Because I knew, there was only one thing that
could happen next. I was headed off to baby

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.310
booking, which is kind of like a juvenile
detention center downtown, and ahhh, then

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.069
they'd have to call my mom.
And that was the last thing I wanted was for

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:30.469
them to call my mom, for them to call my mom
and say-- hey you need to come pick up your

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:34.729
son from baby booking. And so I'm sitting
in the back of this car, hands behind my back,

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:38.519
and I am just absolutely freaking out. And
my friend was sitting there with this very

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:43.110
smug and defiant look on his face that quite
honestly just kept bothering me every time

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.771
I looked at him.
And so I'm looking at him like, "What are

00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:51.279
we supposed to do?" And his answer to me was,
"Just tell them it wasn't you." And I was

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:55.980
a kid I who could make up an excuse for everything,
and even I looked at him and I was like, "That

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.590
is the dumbest idea I have ever heard in my
life."

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.940
[audience laughing]

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.920
&gt;&gt;Moore: And so the cops finally come in,
come into the front seat and look over their

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.350
shoulder and asked us, they're like, "So what
are you guys doing?" And then he begins into

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.720
his whole "it wasn't me." explanation. I begin
into my whole "I'm so sorry, I'll never do

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.580
it again." explanation. And then we're battling
with each other on volume to see who can be

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.769
louder in this. And the cops look at us and
they just start giving us a lecture about

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:25.160
what we were doing and how. And then the one
thing he said, he's like, "You know what?

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.440
The sad thing is-is we'll probably see you
guys out here doing it again. And then the

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:37.050
cops get out of the car and they let us out
and they take the handcuffs off and they tell

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:45.270
us to get moving. And I realized at that point
after you feel the cuffs off your wrist, what

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.610
a break that I got that day. The fact that
they didn't take me down to baby booking,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:55.970
no one was called, my mother didn't have to
come get me, and I made a vow to myself at

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.930
that moment that I would never let that happen
again. Because it was the most vulnerable

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.940
feeling that I've ever felt in my life before.
The idea where I knew not only my present

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.089
but my future was actually in someone else's
hands.

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:15.800
They controlled me. They controlled my movements.
They controlled my destiny. And I never wanted

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:21.769
to feel that feeling again. And then about
four days later and a couple of blocks later

00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:29.579
"kid cupid" was on the loose again. Hanging
out with Shea, putting up marks on these walls.

00:10:29.579 --> 00:10:33.810
And so my mother realized at a pretty early
age that something needed to change. And that

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.500
this was a direction that I was going in that
she needed to actively get involved to try-to

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.060
try-to you know, push me away from.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.649
And so, my mother had been threatening me
with military school since I was about probably

00:10:43.649 --> 00:10:48.079
about eight years old. And she'd say listen,
"If you don't get it together, you're going

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:53.490
to military school." And I'd say, "I know
I know. I'm gonna get it together." And then

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.000
nine years old came and she said, "You know
I'm serious. If you don't get it together

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.639
your go to military school." And I say, "I'm
working on it, really. Just give a little

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:07.839
time. I'm working on it." And then 10 and
11 and then finally 12 years old came and

00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:11.660
she said, "You know I'm gonna send you to
military school." And I'd say, "I know. I

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.801
know. I know you are. I know. I know." And
she said, "No no, you going next week."

00:11:14.801 --> 00:11:16.170
[audience laughing]

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.420
&gt;&gt;Moore: And I was like [amusingly] "I'm going
next week," and she's like, "You're going

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:25.980
next week." And at that point, I was then
had to pack up my stuff and start getting

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:32.189
ready to be sent off to this military school.
And so this military school is in a place,

00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:36.750
it's a place called Valley Forge Military
Academy. It's in Wayne, Pennsylvania, and

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:43.089
all I'd known up to that point was the city.
I'd known big lights, I'd known big buildings,

00:11:43.089 --> 00:11:48.000
I'd known loud noise, I'd known that it's
easier to go to sleep with noise outside then

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.070
it is when it is dead silent outside. But
now here I was in this military school in

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.621
the middle of Pennsylvania, and I remember
a looking at my mom as she was dropping me

00:11:57.621 --> 00:12:02.160
off and thinking to myself I cannot believe
you're sending me off to this place. I cannot

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.910
believe that you, you hate me enough that
your gonna send me away. That you don't even

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.670
want me in your space anymore. Because I didn't
understand that it was actually the absolute

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:17.940
opposite. That she felt that at that time
what I needed was not necessarily a friend,

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.220
but what I needed was a mother.
I needed was someone that was willing to make

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.440
a lot of tough decisions in order to help
me get to that point that I needed to be in.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:32.009
But that first morning at military school
was quite the wake up call. Because that first

00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:36.779
morning in military school, we're all sleeping
in our beds, and I'm sleeping on the top bunk,

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:42.699
and my roommate is sleeping on the bottom,
and were both 12 years old. And at 5:30 in

00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:47.949
the morning I start hearing Guns and Roses.
And I don't know if y'all remember Guns and

00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:51.670
Roses, the-the-the heavy metal group, and
that song "Welcome to the Jungle." And how

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.910
it starts: Da-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne, Da na-ne-ne
na-ne-ne-ne, and then it just proceeds to

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.430
get louder and louder, and then there are
sirens and Whooooooooo, and all this kind

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.319
of stuff.
Then you start, we start, there are lights

00:13:03.319 --> 00:13:08.339
then flashing on and off in the hallway. We-
we start hearing the distinctive sound of

00:13:08.339 --> 00:13:16.499
trash cans being banged with sticks, and then
people yelling and screaming like they have

00:13:16.499 --> 00:13:21.100
absolutely no sense. And you start hearing,
"get up, get up, get out of your racks, please.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.439
Get up, get out here in the hallways." They're
screaming and yelling and cursing, and my

00:13:25.439 --> 00:13:30.899
roommate jumps out of bed, and he is and he
is again 12 years old, his legs are like rail

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:34.550
thin. He's a kid from Brooklyn. And he is
looking up in his legs are like shivering,

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.959
and he looks up at me and he's like, "Come
on Moore." My last name "Come on Moore. We

00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:44.170
got to get up; we got to go in the hallway."
And I look at him and I look at the clock

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.120
and the clock says 5:30 in the morning...

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.120
[audience scant laughter]

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.320
&gt;&gt;Moore: ...and I look back at him. And I
said, "Man, it's 5:30 in the morning." I was

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.850
like, "Tell them to get me around eight o'clock.
I should be ready to go about then."

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:57.850
[audience laughing]

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.439
&gt;&gt;Moore: And he looks at me, and I don't know
if he, I think he was trying to get in his

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:06.540
mind whether I was just really brave or or-or
just really dumb, but he wasn't gonna stick

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:12.450
around and figure out. So, he runs out in
the hallway. And I roll back over, and I start,

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.319
I try to go back to sleep. And I just keep
wondering why they keep making so much noise,

00:14:15.319 --> 00:14:19.309
and I wish they would be quiet so I could
go back to sleep.

00:14:19.309 --> 00:14:22.819
And they're still yelling outside in the hallway,
then out of nowhere I hear "Why is there only

00:14:22.819 --> 00:14:31.360
one person outside of this door!" Then BOOM,
I hear my door fly open, slam the back wall,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:37.470
chip is like, paint its, paint chips are like
falling off the door. And then my first Sergeant,

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:42.600
who is the 17-18-year-old, comes in and he's
yelling and he's screaming at me and he's

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.680
cursing at me and he spitting on the back
of my head and I'm sitting there and laying

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.931
in my bed trying to get some sleep.

00:14:47.931 --> 00:14:49.329
[audience small laughs]

00:14:49.329 --> 00:14:54.749
&gt;&gt;Moore: And so I slowly began to roll over,
and he stops yelling because I think he thinks

00:14:54.749 --> 00:15:01.249
this tirade had done the trick and he looks
at me and I look at him and say to him, "Man,

00:15:01.249 --> 00:15:11.480
if you don't get out of my room." I'm 12.
He's 18. So, then what he does is he smiles,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.170
and he leaves my room, and so my first thought
is you know this military school thing ain't

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.170
bad.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.250
[audience small laughs]

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.570
&gt;&gt;Moore: And the next thing I know, probably
about 10 seconds later, BOOM the door opens

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:27.559
slams open again and my entire Chain of Command
walk in the room, and they pick my mattress

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:32.290
up off that top bunk, and then they turned
the mattress over as if I still wasn't on

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:37.600
the mattress, and then I fall five feet to
the ground to this hard floor. And that was

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.689
my first morning at military school. And so
needless to say, I didn't like the place too

00:15:42.689 --> 00:15:46.949
much. Needless to say that is not my favorite
place in the planet to be at that moment,

00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:52.220
and I let them know that, I let my Chain of
Command know that, because in the first four

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.699
days I'd already runway four times from the
school. I mean every time they'd turn their

00:15:56.699 --> 00:16:00.851
backs, I was running out the gates, because
I kept on trying to find this train station.

00:16:00.851 --> 00:16:04.250
Because I knew, there was a train station
somewhere in Wayne, Pennsylvania. I had heard

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.399
this. And I knew the train station in Wayne
and I could take that to the 30th street,

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:13.050
and take 30th street to Penn Station. Penn
Station I could hop on the 2 train take that

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.499
one up to the Bronx. Walk from the Dunhill
Road stop in the Bronx, and walk back home.

00:16:16.499 --> 00:16:19.119
I had the whole thing mapped out, as to how
this

00:16:19.119 --> 00:16:23.930
whole thing would go down, as long as I could
just find this train station.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:28.249
So, my squad leader comes in my room after
the fourth day, and my roommate and I are

00:16:28.249 --> 00:16:32.420
sitting in-in our-in our respective chairs.
And my squad leader walks in, my roommate

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.680
calls room to attention, and we both get to
attention. And he tells my roommate to get

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:41.480
out, and so now I'm scared, because I'm like,
something is about to go down and he doesn't

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.480
want any witnesses.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.480
[audience faint laughter]

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.310
&gt;&gt;Moore: So, my roommate scurries out of the
room and goes and whatever. And my squad leader

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:55.089
tells me to take a seat, and I take a seat
he grabs a chair turns a backwards like we're

00:16:55.089 --> 00:17:01.069
old buddies having a chat, and he's like,
"listen you don't want to be here, and quite

00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:07.530
honestly we don't want you here. So, I've
drawn you a map on how to get to this train

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.069
station." Because he was basically saying
how pathetic my attempts to find this train

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:17.069
station were. And so I'm looking at this map
like he just handed me a piece of gold. I

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.870
mean I'm like I'm getting like tears welled
up in my eyes. I'm like, "listen, I'll never

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:28.669
forget you, man. When you get to the outside
let me know." And he just looks at me and

00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:31.279
he's just like just get out of here, just
go.

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:36.350
So, I have my- I plan out my whole great escape.
The whole great escape so figured like taps,

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.250
taps in the military, taps is lights out.
When they play the bugle, the dun-dun-dun-dun,

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:44.559
dun-dun-dun. Taps 10 o'clock lights go out.
I figured, you know what, I can set my alarm

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:49.320
for 11:30 because everyone should be asleep
by then, but that'll still give me a good

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.870
head start before 5:30 in the morning wake-up
call. So by the time they figure out that

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:58.203
I'm gone I could already be long gone. So
this is, kind of like, like you know like

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:05.419
in Shawshank redemption. I had the whole thing
planned out and so my alarm goes off, I put

00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:12.309
it under my bed, I quickly shut off the alarm,
jump out of bed, and I grab my little bag,

00:18:12.309 --> 00:18:18.080
my little map, my little flashlight. I say
peace to my roommate and I'm gone. I run out

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.940
the doors. And I go through the gates, and
I'm going into the woods, where I'm following

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:31.169
this map. And so the map is telling me take
10 paces this way, and make a left at a big

00:18:31.169 --> 00:18:36.740
rock, and then take 20 paces this way, and
make a right at a big tree. I'm thinking to

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.340
myself there is nothing in the rocks and trees
I hear man. What rocks and trees do you talk

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.220
about? But I keep on trying to follow this
map, and I go out and it is just taking me

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.980
deeper and deeper and deeper into the woods.
And at this point remember, I'm from the city

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.149
and so I don't know anything about these woods.
And so my imagination at this point at 12

00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:58.250
years old is just running wild. I am hearing
snakes and bears and tigers and elephants

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:03.210
and all things that weren't there, but that's
just my imagination at that point. So I sit

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:09.481
down and I just start crying because there's
that I wanted to do more at that point than

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:14.120
just to go home. There's nothing more I wanted
more at that point then for people to just

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:19.720
leave me alone, and let me be and so I sit
down and just start crying. And then I start

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:27.200
hearing more leaves rustling, and I figured
it was just more bears and more elephants

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:32.530
and then I started hearing laughter.
The laughter was my Chain of Command that

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.210
followed me out to that day the map was fake.
The map took you to the middle of the woods.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:42.230
They just wanted to see how bad I wanted to
go home. And at night they got their answer.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.970
I wanted to go home pretty bad.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.970
So they took me back to campus and we were
in the middle of something called plebe system.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:52.200
And what plebe system is the first six weeks
you in military school where you have zero

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.890
communication with the outside world, and
no phone calls, no television, no e-mails,

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:03.970
no Google, no anything. All of it's cut off.
And the whole point is that they want a break

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:11.210
you down as individuals, and-and then build
you up back as a team for six weeks. And so

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:18.380
out of no where, they say to me they're like,
"If we don't make some break in the rules

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:25.330
we're going to lose him. So, Moore you've
got five minutes to make a phone call. We

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.603
don't care who you call, but you've got five
minutes to make that phone call." And I call

00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:35.720
the only number that I knew, which is my mom.
So, I dial her number, and I'm on the phone,

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.289
and so my mother at this point she wasn't
expecting to hear from me for six weeks because

00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:42.620
we are in the middle of plebe system. And
now in the first four days, at one o'clock

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.590
in the morning she gets a call from me. So
she has no idea

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:51.539
what's going on; so she's like, "Are you okay?"
"Huh, yeah I'm fine, but you know, it's really

00:20:51.539 --> 00:20:56.290
bad here. They treat you terribly, the food
is horrible, they wake you up early in the

00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:01.549
morning." and I'm like, "If you just let me
come home, I'll do what it takes to do better,

00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:05.980
I'll clean my room, I'll clean your room,
I'll do what ever you want me to do, just

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:11.030
let me back home."
And then she stopped me and she said, "Too

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.550
many people have sacrificed in order for you
to be there." she said, "Too many people are

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.289
working too hard and too many people are rooting
for you, and they just want you to give it

00:21:20.289 --> 00:21:26.159
a shot." And she said, "Your father's looking
down on you, and he's proud of you, and he

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:28.370
just wants you to try."

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:33.720
The sacrifices she's talking about, I didn't
realize it at that point, I didn't appreciate

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.809
it at that point, but what she was talking
about were things like, not only the emotional

00:21:38.809 --> 00:21:44.059
sacrifices she was making for this, but that
military school wasn't free and it wasn't

00:21:44.059 --> 00:21:49.450
cheap. So, my mother ended up actually asking
friends and family and coworkers to give what

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:54.390
they could in order for her to do it. And
eventually when she realized she was still

00:21:54.390 --> 00:22:00.390
thousands of dollars short, my grandparents,
who we actually moved up with to live in the

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:07.510
Bronx, then actually took the money out of
their home and gave it to my mother.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.519
My grandparents immigrated to this country
just a few little over two decades earlier,

00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:14.860
because my grandfather want-my grandfather
was following his dream in becoming a minister.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:19.440
And he became the first black minister in
the history of the Dutch Reform Church. And

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.909
they bought a small home up in the Bronx,
when they first moved to this country. My

00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:27.809
grandfather was a minister and my grandmother
was a public school teacher. And they bought

00:22:27.809 --> 00:22:32.559
this home not just they were looking for shelter,
but because they wanted to own a piece of

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:38.279
this country that took them in. And when they
realized my mother was going to be short,

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:41.760
and they realized I was at a crucial point
in my life. At a point that comes for so many

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:47.480
kids in particularly for young buys. Where
that split can happen so quickly, and those

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.690
decisions can become so jarring that they
knew they had to do something. So they ended

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.679
up taking all the retirement money out of
that home and giving it to my mother, so she

00:22:55.679 --> 00:23:03.390
could afford this school. And so I'd be lying
to say if at that moment, I fully made any

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:09.620
type of turn. It took a while, but later on,
as I was there a little longer I began to

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:15.019
understand what my mother was talking about.
Later on as I got older and I was there a

00:23:15.019 --> 00:23:18.370
little longer, I began to understand what
sacrifices she was talking about, and I began

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:23.890
to understand concepts like accountability
and responsibility and leadership. And why

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.929
those became so important in terms of larger
development.

00:23:26.929 --> 00:23:32.690
And if you fast-forward later on, I actually
join the military to become an Army officer

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:38.660
and going on to Johns Hopkins University.
And that's where the origins of this book

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:47.789
began. Because one day, I received-I had just
received the Rhodes scholarship. And the day

00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:51.590
after I received the Rhodes scholarship the
Baltimore Sun, which is my hometown paper,

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:56.269
ended up doing a piece on my childhood and
life and how I had some issues coming up,

00:23:56.269 --> 00:24:02.440
but through a lot of help and support and
intervention that I receive this award.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.429
Around the same time, they were running a
whole series on four guys who robbed a jewelry

00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:13.269
store. Two guys walked into a jewelry store
with guns; two guys walk into a jewelry store

00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:19.909
with mallets. The two guys with guns went
in first, and they got everybody on the ground,

00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:22.910
and everybody that was inside the store got
on the ground and kept their heads down. And

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.980
the two guys with mallet then followed them
in.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.590
One guy with a gun and one guy with a mallet
went to the right. One guy with a gun in one

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.160
guy with mallet went to the left. And then
proceeded to walk around the jewelry store

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.770
smashing the cases taking out rings and watches
and necklaces. And they got away with about

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:46.269
a little over $400,000 worth of jewelry that
day. And then one of them yelled let's go,

00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:53.260
and then all four ran out of the store.
One of the people who were on the ground,

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:58.779
was an off-duty police officer who is moonlighting
as a security guard. That police Sergeant

00:24:58.779 --> 00:25:05.429
was a thirteen year veteran of the police
force. He was a three-time recipient of Officer

00:25:05.429 --> 00:25:12.350
of the Year Award, he was a father of five,
he had triplets and the reason he was working

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:18.020
that day because he was trying to make extra
money for his family.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.929
As the four guys ran out of the store and
ran into the parking lot. He then got up and

00:25:22.929 --> 00:25:28.049
ran after them, trying to stop them from getting
away and he went to the parking lot and he

00:25:28.049 --> 00:25:32.960
was hiding next vehicles to try to see if
he could find out where they were and to see

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.769
if he can keep them from getting away. And
he didn't realize that one of the vehicles

00:25:35.769 --> 00:25:42.720
that was kneeling next to was one of vehicles
that they were in, and then a window rolled

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:49.370
down and three shots were taken at point-blank
range and he was killed instantly. And the

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:55.100
two cars sped away.
Sergeant Prothero, the person that was killed

00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:00.010
that day, was a hero. He was a person of honor
and integrity and character and every shred

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:05.200
evidence that you can find about him says
exactly that. And then three shots at .point-blank

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:12.820
range ended his life. And there was a 12-day
national manhunt for these four guys and finally

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:19.950
all four were caught. The last two were caught
in Philadelphia, and as I discovered, both

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:24.830
by wanted posters that were inside the neighborhood,
and also by the series of articles in the

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:29.980
Sun and all the other papers inside of the
area, because this crime was a big deal.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:36.039
I discovered that one of the guys that was
caught was living in the same area that I

00:26:36.039 --> 00:26:42.220
was living in, was around the same age that
I was, and his name was also Wes Moore.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:49.279
See here you have stories, articles about
these two kids around the same age living

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:54.940
in Baltimore. One ends up getting this scholarship
to go on to England, and the other ends up

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.210
serving life in prison without the possibility
of parole.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:05.100
Him, his older brother, and two other guys
who were there that day. And the story haunted

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:10.809
me, because I began asking myself, how does
that even happen? How does it happen that

00:27:10.809 --> 00:27:15.820
you have two kids who have similar backgrounds
who end up in two completely different places?

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:21.170
What were those factors inside of their lives
that ended up causing such a significant split?

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:30.350
And so few years after I first learned about
the other Wes Moore, I couldn't escape it,

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:36.730
and I couldn't shake it. So, I ended up writing
the note in prison, I ended up writing him

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:41.190
a note a not sure I'd ever hear back from
him and in many ways it didn't even matter.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.071
But I knew these were questions I wanted to
ask, and I knew he was the only one I could

00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:51.210
actually get answers from. And then a month
later I get an envelope back from Jessup Correctional

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:56.940
Institution from Wes Moore.
And in the letter the first thing that he

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.679
writes is he first thanks me for writing him,
because he says, "When you're in prison you

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:05.419
believe the world doesn't think you exist
anymore." And then he proceeds to answer off

00:28:05.419 --> 00:28:12.889
answers to all the questions that I asked
him. And the answers intrigued me. The answers

00:28:12.889 --> 00:28:19.289
intrigued me on a whole collection of different
levels. To the point that eventually I decided

00:28:19.289 --> 00:28:23.620
to write him again, and that one letter turned
into dozens of letters, and those dozens of

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.240
letters have now turned into numerous visits,
and I've now known him around five years.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:34.090
And a few years ago a friend of mine, who
is an author, actually knew that I had reached

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:38.340
out to Wes and knew that I had gotten to know
him. And said, "I think there's something

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.649
larger here, I think there's a bigger truth
that needs to be explored here, I think is

00:28:41.649 --> 00:28:43.460
a book project here."
And at first, I was actually very reluctant

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:49.600
to do so. I felt like I didn't have time.
I felt like I didn't want to explore his life

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.960
that deeply and quite honestly I didn't want
to explore my own life that deeply. And there

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.020
are a couple things that really pushed me
to do it.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.649
The first thing I thought about was the tragic
death of that police Sergeant. And if this

00:29:02.649 --> 00:29:06.769
is something that can be helpful and help
these tragedies from happening again, than

00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:11.130
I thought it was important to do, because
as Edmund Burke said, "All it takes for evil

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:16.820
to triumph is for good people to do nothing."
And then I thought about something that Wes

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:22.279
had told me. Because when I talk to Wes about
it he said, "You know I've wasted every opportunity

00:29:22.279 --> 00:29:26.750
I've ever had in life, and I'm going to die
in here. So if you can do something that can

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:31.389
help people understand the ramifications for
their decisions, and also help people understand

00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:36.970
the neighborhood these decisions are being
made in then I think you should do it."

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.799
And that became the baseline that became the
foundation for this entire story. And the

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:46.570
baseline and foundation for this entire journey.
And there's a lot of things I wanted to explore

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:51.659
with this story, and a lot of things are wanted
to explore what this book. As I went through

00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:57.259
the process of putting this whole thing together,
it took over 200 hours of interviews with

00:29:57.259 --> 00:30:01.080
Wes, his friends, and family and my friends,
and family. Just to make sure that you're

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:07.309
really getting the facts and the feel of the
story right. To interview Wes when you walk

00:30:07.309 --> 00:30:10.820
into a maximum-security facility is the kind
of place that no matter how many times you

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:18.850
go that feeling will never escape you. The
sounds of bars closing behind you, the sounds

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:25.620
of police officer's the rubber soles squeaking
on the ground, the sites of prisoners being

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:32.940
marched in-in their uniforms, the smells.
These are things that will never escape you

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:38.529
when you walk into a maximum security facility.
But every time I went to see Wes and actually

00:30:38.529 --> 00:30:44.220
do these interviews, I was never allowed bring
any type of pens, any paper, any tape recorders,

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:49.740
and any chewing gum, nothing. When you go
see him you're searched twice every time you

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:55.220
go in. He's searched every time he got visitors
area and you just sit together in the visitors

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:59.679
area for an hour before a guard comes taps
you on the shoulder, or taps him on the shoulder,

00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:06.200
and says times up, and then escorts him back
through the gates, and then the visitors go

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:11.769
back where they came from.
And so as I was doing these interviews with

00:31:11.769 --> 00:31:17.559
Wes, I would sit for the hour and talk with
him, and thenonce the guard said it was time

00:31:17.559 --> 00:31:20.580
I would then have to go back to the car, run
back to the car, and I would go back to the

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.880
car where I had a tape recorder waiting on
the seat of my car. And then I would sit there

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:31.520
and regurgitate for the next 20 minutes everything
he said, so I'd have it all down. And then

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.759
I'd go back and later and transcribe it. And
some of the things that we talked about, some

00:31:36.759 --> 00:31:43.400
of the issues that we talked about and some
of the dynamics we talked about were so amazingly

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:50.009
stirring and so amazingly jarring. Some of
the things we talked about and some of the

00:31:50.009 --> 00:31:55.340
challenges and wasted opportunities and the
things that I've learned about Wes for example:

00:31:55.340 --> 00:32:02.570
Wes is not a dumb guy by any stretch of the
imagination. He's made unforgiving decisions

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:06.840
with completely irreversible results, but
he's not a dumb guy.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:13.179
And you think about the shame that it is,
and obviously not just the obvious tragic

00:32:13.179 --> 00:32:18.009
loss of the police Sergeant. But the shame
that this is a person that could be doing

00:32:18.009 --> 00:32:25.779
something else, but will never have that opportunity
again. And the thing that I realized throughout

00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:33.139
this entire process was it helped me to understand
and to recognize our potency as a society,

00:32:33.139 --> 00:32:37.210
because fundamentally what you had were two
kids who at similar times in our lives were

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:43.690
searching for more. Two kids at similar times
in our lives were searching for help, and

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:49.570
one kid got it, and the other kid didn't,
and now the world bears witness to the final

00:32:49.570 --> 00:33:01.630
results of either our attention or our apathy,
our focus or our indifference. What we fundamentally

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:07.480
had is a situation, where you had two kids
who could have been moved in either direction

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.539
to the point that I felt it was even on the
cover of the book where I say, "The chilling

00:33:10.539 --> 00:33:15.539
truth is that this story could've been mine
and the tragedy is that my story could've

00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:21.240
been his." But the decisions and the people
we have in our lives to help us make this

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.179
as you are helping us to make those decisions
help lead to final fates.

00:33:25.179 --> 00:33:29.990
I'm a firm believer throughout this entire
process that this concept of fate for me has

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:34.190
completely been turned on its head, because
I don't believe in this idea of predestined

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:36.880
fate I don't believe in the idea that people
are born to be X or people are born to be

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:45.960
Y. I believe that potential in this country
is universal but opportunity is not. And that

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:53.250
space that difference between potential and
results is where we all come in. That space

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:58.909
and that difference between what we could
be and what we actually are is where parents

00:33:58.909 --> 00:34:05.679
and teachers and role models and mentors and
supporters come in, because I want people

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:10.170
understand our potency.
The entire point of this book was not to create

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:13.270
something people can pick up and look at and
say wow that's great story and kind of throw

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:18.220
it off to the side. The point of this book
is that it's a call to action. The point of

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.830
this book is that people can pick up this
book and see that this book is about so much

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:28.170
more than just two kids. But it's about all
of us. It's about the society we live in and

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:32.170
the society that we hope to live in.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.610
One of the things that I'm most proud of in
this book is actually in the back of the book

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:40.090
where there is a resource guide. Where I lay
out over 200 organizations around the country

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:46.620
who are on the ground doing the work. It's
a place to go to help, and it is a place to

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:51.490
go for help. And I've been so inspired by
not just a reaction to the book, and not just

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:54.560
the reaction to the stories, but that the
fact that people are using this as an opportunity

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.710
to get involved.
I had a mother and a son over in Gaithersburg

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:03.430
at a book festival in Maryland, who came up
to me and said they were reading the book

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:08.180
together. And they said that the thing that
they're going to do is when they're done reading

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:12.270
the book they're going to decide which one
of these organizations they are going to support

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.010
and go volunteer together.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:21.970
I had a woman down in Atlanta who took the
bus, took the Greyhound bus from South Carolina

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:27.172
all the way down to Atlanta to go to the Jimmy
Carter Library where I was talking or I was

00:35:27.172 --> 00:35:31.080
speaking a few days back just so she could
tell me about me the organization that she

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.220
works with and why they are doing such good
work and why I need to include them in the

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:40.170
next edition of the book.
We can make a huge difference. There is a,

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:45.140
we have a Facebook page for the book, and
there is a, there was a woman, there was a

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:51.770
teacher at an alternative school in Baltimore
who posted on the wall, that she wanted, that

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:56.000
she needed books for some of her students
that she works with because she thinks that

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.290
they can really gain from these stories and
get a better understanding about their life.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.690
And then
someone contacted her and shipped her six

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:06.970
copies of the book so she could give to her
students.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:13.910
There was a 14-year-old man in Baltimore,
who wrote me a few weeks back, who's been

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:17.150
in and out of the juvenile justice system
inside of Baltimore growing up. And one of

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:22.070
his older friends told him to read the book,
and he said he begrudgingly did. And he said

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:26.821
it was the first book he's ever read cover
to cover, but he said the book and he said

00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:30.290
he felt inclined to write me, because he said
this book made me think more about the type

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:35.820
of man I want to become, and the role that
I have inside of my family.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:41.490
I want people to understand our potency. I
want people to understand our roles. And the

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:46.070
fact that if we had the time and the inclination
we can genuinely change lives as long as were

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:50.940
willing to do it. My mother says it all the
time and I think she is absolutely right.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:56.170
She says," Kids need to think that you care,
before they care what you think." And as long

00:36:56.170 --> 00:37:01.530
as were willing to show young people that
we care; it's amazing the type of results

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:02.530
they will be willing to show us.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:08.100
So thank you all for your time, and thank
y'all for your continued service. It's greatly

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:14.110
appreciated. Thank you so much.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.520
[audience applause]

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:21.270
&gt;&gt;Moore: What I would what I would love to
do, ahhh either from folks in the room or

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:27.980
folks in Googleland, is take any questions
that uh, that people might have about the

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.850
process or whatever, anything. Yes sir.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:34.510
&gt;&gt;male #1: Did the other Wes Moore have a
chance to read the book?

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:39.310
&gt;&gt;Moore: Thank you. Yes. The question was
has the other Wes Moore had a chance to read

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.902
the book. Uh, he had. Matter of fact actually
I send them a copy of the book even before

00:37:42.902 --> 00:37:49.310
was released. He really had two main thought
the first thought he was just amazed at how

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:54.310
much research went in to it, and it was amazing
that I got all the facts right, because this

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:58.490
was really a long process. Because everything
that you got, not only from his site that

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:03.470
from my side, had to be not only checked and
corroborated and double checked so just to

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:07.330
make sure that everything that you include
inside there is actually accurate and it holds

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:12.640
up to that standard. Umm, and so he was just
amazed at how much research went into it.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.620
And the other thing that he said was as we
were getting a chance to read his life in

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.290
a book like that. He
said it amazed him at how little he's done

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:24.690
with his life. And that was his reaction,
so.

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:31.060
An-But it's interesting because when I first
decided to actually turn this into this, and

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:36.240
as I said you know, Wes really one of the,
you know, one of the one of the main reasons

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:43.990
in what he said to me. Ah. His friends and
family weren't as open to it, but I knew only

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:47.730
way I can get the proper stories out was if
they were open and they cooperate.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.610
I remember I went to talk, there's one character
in the book, uh, one of Wes's good friends

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:55.460
Woody, and I remember when I first got a chance
to meet Woody. And I'd say to Woody, "Woody,

00:38:55.460 --> 00:39:00.550
here's something I'm working on. So Woody,
how was school for you growing up?" He's like,

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:08.510
"It was cool." Thanks Woody. "So how was ah
you know, so what was school like?" "It was

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:14.052
fine." And that's I mean I was not getting
anything from Woody and then one day, I think

00:39:14.052 --> 00:39:18.910
it was like a Thursday, I got a call from
Woody. And what he's like, "Hey Wes, so, what

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:24.400
are you doing on Saturday?" I'm like, "Nothing.
Why?" And he's like, "I talked to Wes, and

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.700
he says you're a good dude, and he says you're
just trying to help some kids."

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.680
So he's like, "I'm going to show you some
things." And so then we spent all day Saturday

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:37.000
going by old spots, old neighborhoods, where
he just downloaded, I mean downloaded to the

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.550
point, I was like alright Woody. I've seen
enough I don't need to see anymore. I got

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:44.031
it thanks."
But I mean, but and he-he, and this is just

00:39:44.031 --> 00:39:48.640
one example who became extraordinarily helpful
in making sure you're really getting the story

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:54.561
correct. Umm, and but had it not been for
Wes pushing his people to do that, and then

00:39:54.561 --> 00:39:58.480
also my pushing my family to do that because
there's certain things in the story, which

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:04.780
were difficult to learn about. There are certain
anecdotes, which I had no idea about. But

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.030
it was really you telling people that you
really needed the story and you needed the

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.300
story correct because that was the only way
I knew it can make a difference was how we

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:17.330
were able to get the story done but those
are really Wes is main reactions.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:23.450
He said it was it was it was in some ways
tough for him to read it, because he realized

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:31.800
how little he's done with his life. Yes ma'am.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.580
&gt;&gt;female #1: [inaudible]

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:42.150
&gt;&gt;Moore: Yeah. Riverdale. Well, actually,
I did not and I'll tell you about Riverdale.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.390
I'm sorry, Yeah.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:51.120
&gt;&gt;female #1: Well, I was wondering what your
views...[inaudible]

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:55.880
&gt;&gt;Moore: Thank you very much. The question
was about if I had gone to public schools

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.260
or what my view is on educational reform.
How much time do we have because I've got

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:03.880
a lot of views on education in this country?
A lot of views.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:09.680
First, on I think in many ways going to Riverdale
for me, for those who don't know Riverdale

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.340
is almost it's a private school out side the
Bronx. And my mother at that time was working

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:17.700
three different jobs in order to send us away
because she was very uncomfortable with the

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.910
schools inside the neighborhood, particularly
as she saw how the neighborhood was changing.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:25.631
Umm, where I went to school, wher-wher-where
we lived there is a school right up the street

00:41:25.631 --> 00:41:32.640
called Evander, which was kind of our neighborhood
public school. Evander actually made national

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:38.190
news, and can't remember what year was in
the early '90s but that was when a young girl

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:42.320
was actually shot in the face at Evander high
school. This is a test, so my mother made

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.870
a decision very early this is just thought
this is not going to be where I send my children.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:53.410
So she worked these multiple jobs in order
to send us to this school, um, which was interesting

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:58.850
to me because it's an extraordinary place
and-and-and it's my problem was in many ways

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:04.360
was I was not ready for it. And my problem
was that I felt myself very much on an island

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:11.120
at the school, because coming from the neighborhood
and going across town to the school you increasingly

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.680
find yourself alone no matter where you went,
because you went to you very quickly became

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.960
too rich for the kids in the neighborhood
who didn't understand why he had to go all

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.400
the way across town to go to school. And then
you became too poor for the kids in school

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.430
who didn't understand why you live all the
way on the other side of the Bronx.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:34.650
And so you found, and so I found myself not
being comfortable anywhere, and I think that

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:38.200
really
manifested itself in a lot of acting out and

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.770
trying to gain acceptance wherever I could
find it from your friends. And one thing you

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:46.220
realize about friends is when they tell you
to do X, Y, and Z and you could do it and

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:50.490
you get in trouble and you look around for
your friends and they're nowhere to be found

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:55.680
that's just about, as much as that friendship
is worth. Um. And so I think in many ways

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:00.150
that even though my mother obviously had the
best intentions, it was really the place I

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:06.000
got most got lost.
Ah. How I feel about larger educational reform

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.440
are a couple of different things. One of the
things that I think military school was useful

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.910
for me; not so much because I waspicked up
from one environment and put into another

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:15.540
enviroment but because actually I think it's
almost the wrong answer for most kids.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:19.890
Where it's just you know it's just take a
handful from here put them somewhere else

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:23.930
and we think we've solved education in this
country. It's backwards and this is not true.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:25.170
Um.

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:31.351
But one thing I do believe was the transition
that happened to me with the psychological

00:43:31.351 --> 00:43:36.700
transition, ah, at that point was I went to
an environment where our motto was "No excuses

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:42.630
No exceptions." I went to an environment where
the expectations of what is going to do was

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:46.251
raised significantly. There's actually a scene
in the book when Wes and I are talking about

00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:49.980
our environments and how he grew up in
the neighborhoods and grew up in and then

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:54.230
I say to him do you think that we're products
of our environments? And he looks at me and

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:57.810
he says I think we'll actually were products
of our expectations. Which I thought was a

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:01.960
really important distinction, because he said
the expectation of you or the neighborhood

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:07.280
you are living in is that you'll finish school,
was that you will go on to college, you will

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.830
go on and get a job in common you will be
a productive husband and father or mother

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:14.960
and wife. Then that's generally what you'll
do.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:20.710
But if the expectation of you and the community
that you live in is that he probably won't

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:25.310
finish school, you'll probably end up in the
juvenile justice system, you'll probably end

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:29.040
up in and out of facilities for the rest of
your life. Then kids have a funny way of proving

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:34.560
you right on that angle as well. And so that's
why I think this whole concept of raising

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.560
expectations and being able to look at the
larger school reform platform becomes incredibly

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.240
important not just for individual communities
but for our nation as a whole.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:49.110
Because the challenge that we have you have
if you have communities in our society where

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:55.160
you have 50 and 60% dropout rates for kids
who enter. If you have communities and societies

00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:00.930
in our country where you have 17% kids of
color who are reading it grade level by third

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:06.250
grade, we've got a real problem, because we
got a significant amount of underutilized

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:10.180
assets within our country and there's no way
that you can continue to compete nationally

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:15.751
as long as you have so many underutilized
assets. So, I have a whole to say about of

00:45:15.751 --> 00:45:20.370
school reform in this country. The beautiful
thing is though and even some of the organizations

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:24.670
we include inside the book they are people
who are doing it right. It's not like this

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:27.450
is a complete broken we don't know what to
do. We know what to do because people are

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.890
doing it.
The question is how are we identifying them,

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:34.090
how are we scaling them, how are we supporting
them, and how are we making those types of

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:40.320
opportunities open and accessible to everybody?
Because we can't have so many of "the others"

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.580
in our society, because it's going to be"the
others" that is really going to make the difference

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.670
between who we want to be and who we are.

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:55.340
I'm sorry ye- do you want to follow up?

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:56.340
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [inaudible]

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.340
&gt;&gt;Moore: ...can't make them drink...yeah.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:17.640
&gt;&gt;female: And I was wondering, what is the
water? [inaudible]

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:31.510
&gt;&gt;Moore: It's a great point. Thank you. It's
obvious you've read the book. And it's a great

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:36.290
point because there is a point where Wes and
Tony are talking. Tony is Wes's older brother

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:42.620
and Tony, heh, Tony, Tony is a, ah fascinating
character. Tony had left school by the time

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:47.310
he was in eighth grade. Tony had been involved
in drugs in Baltimore before his aides had

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:52.320
even hit double digits. But Tony made it a
point from a very early age to try to keep

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.410
Wes out.
He specifically would tell Wes continually

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:59.570
listen you're not built for this, and you're
not built for this game. And you're too smart,

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:03.060
you need to go to school, you need to finish
up. Tony kept trying to drive us away from

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.460
the life of Tony had come to know. Is actually
an interesting dynamic. Because that actually

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:09.590
happens a lot in many communities where you
find older brothers who are trying to look

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:14.200
out for the little brothers trying to basically
say do as I say not as I do. And the scene

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.000
where it's you can lead a horse to water but
you can't make him drink. Was Tony went to

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:26.750
Wes's house and saw a whole tower high, you
know, row of sneakers lined up in Wes's room,

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:30.610
and Tony pulled Wes outside and said, "Where'd
you get this money from? And Wes said, ""Oh,

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:35.410
I'm making the money DJing." And Tony was
too smart for that, and this was when Wes

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:40.300
was 12-13 years old. And Tony looked at him
and said, "I know you didn't make this money

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:46.440
DJing, not at 12 years old. I' gonna ask you
again. Where did you make this money from?"

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.780
And then Wes began to say, oh, I made this
money DJing,. Before he could even get it

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:54.000
out Tony punched him in the face and started
beating him up in the front lawn. And his

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.870
mother came outside and started to break them
up and pulled them off to the side she said,

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:01.810
"What's going on here?" And Tony was like,
"Wes is out here hustling." And in his mothers

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:07.450
like, "No he's not, he's make the money DJing,.
That's what he told me." And Tony kind of

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:12.100
pulls off to the side. And he's like, "Do
you really believe that?" And he put his hat

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.740
back on and he said, "You know what? I'm done.
I'm done talking about it." And then he said,

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.150
"'You can lead a horse to water but you can't
make him drink.'" And he said, "If you need

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:21.990
to learn these lessons the hard way you'll
learn these lessons the hard way."

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:25.850
But it was interesting that scene later on
with the job corp. Wes had a chance to go

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:29.150
to Job Corp because he'd been involved in
drugs for a while. But he went to Job Corp

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:32.650
and Job Corp was a program was started under
Lyndon Johnson, as almost really a second

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.890
chance.
So, Wes got a chance to get his GED in the

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:38.700
Job Corp, he found out he was reading at a
sophomore in college reading level through

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.530
the Job Corp, he started learning carpentry
skills, he built a beautiful house for his

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:47.110
daughter through the job corp. And he left
Job Corp, he left Job Corp and I remember

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:50.570
him telling me, he said, " That was...," he
said, " That was the best experience of my

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:53.730
life going to job corp."
Because he said," I came out so involved and

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:57.831
so empowered. And I knew I wanted to do right."
But then as he returned back to the streets

00:48:57.831 --> 00:49:02.800
of Baltimore, so many of the problems he had
thought he left behind. He realized they were

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.100
just there waiting for him and they were just
compounded at that point because now Wes had

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:12.560
four children. Now Wes had two mothers' of
his children who both needed money; his mother

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:18.120
needed help. And Wes was making $6.50-7.00
and hour doing odd jobs because, you know,

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.790
as a felon your not going to, there's a whole
lot of jobs you're not even eligible for.

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:27.160
And so I say that and share that not necessarily
to make people sympathize with Wes. I say

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.020
that not to have any revisionist history about
what happen, because Wes made the decision

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.020
to go back to the streets.
Because he said he couldn't wait; he needed

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:38.550
the money. But I say that because we have
to understand the dynamics of what challenges

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:44.121
are actually going on. And understanding why
we have 70% recidivism rates in this country.

00:49:44.121 --> 00:49:48.230
It is important that we understand the dynamics
of what are taking place, and not just what

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:52.620
is this society that people are coming back
into, but wha-how are we preparing people

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:56.760
to come back into society? Because the fact
is, 95% of the people in prison are coming

00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:02.920
out. Only 5% are like Wes, who are in there
for life without parole. 95 are coming out

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:07.000
so how are we preparing not only society,
but them for that type of re-entry?

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.200
[whispering] What was that? okay.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:17.080
&gt;&gt;female: If anybody wants their book signed...

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.771
&gt;&gt;Moore: Okay, sorry.

00:50:18.771 --> 00:50:19.771
&gt;&gt;female: It's just that we have to go...

00:50:19.771 --> 00:50:23.550
&gt;&gt;Moore: Sorry. Again I want to thank everybody
for your time an-and just for the curiosity

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:27.900
and for all of your hard work. Its just greatly
appreciated and your support is greatly appreciated.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:32.970
And we are genuinely making a difference as
long as we continue pushing. Thank y'all so

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:33.970
much. Thank you.

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:33.972
