00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.730
Let's look at the answer to
our spatial locality quiz.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.610
The question is, which memory
locations have spatial locality?

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.590
Remember that spacial locality says
that once we access a memory location,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.290
we are likely to access
nearby memory locations soon.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.310
For the variable j,
we keep reaccessing j, but we don't

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.300
know what's close to j so we can not
really say that j has spatial locality.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.150
If we access j,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.430
there is a lot of temporal locality but
not necessarily any spatial locality.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.550
Same for sum.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.840
We are accessing sum
very often by itself but

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.220
we're not really sure whether we're
accessing anything that is close to sum.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.480
For elements of arr, we have seen
that there is no temporal locality.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.380
Each element is accessed
only once in this loop.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.230
However, there is a lot
of spatial locality.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.550
Once we access arr of zero,
in the next iteration,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.520
we'll be accessing arr of one,
and then, arr of two and so on.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.970
So it is true that once we access
a memory location in this array,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.440
we're likely to access
nearby location soon.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.270
So this variable definitely
has spatial locality.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.460
It turns out that the way
this program is compiled,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.300
usually means that there will be some
spatial locality between j and sum.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.060
J and sum are likely to be allocated
by the compiler on the stack

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.580
near each other, so
when we access sum and

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.520
then access j, that might be
an example of spatial locality.
