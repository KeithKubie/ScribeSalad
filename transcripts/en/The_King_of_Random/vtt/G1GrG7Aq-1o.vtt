00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.080
[Captions by Mary V. at Y Translator]
In our last video,
we showed you how to assemble

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.240
some of the electronics
inside our flame thrower arm,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.840
and in today's video, we'll be finishing
those up and testing it out on my arm.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:15.200
[Music]

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.220
One propane canister
runs out fairly quickly.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.140
So I decided I wanted
to add a second one.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.320
I wanted to build something
that would let me use

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.800
two propane canisters at the same time

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.460
for double the fuel capacity.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.260
For that, we turned back to our
small little brass pipe fitting pieces.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.980
This is what I came up with.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.260
We've got our valve.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.340
In fact we've got two of them.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.100
This is what we built
earlier by soldering on pieces.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.230
You can see the copper,
little pieces soldered onto both.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.320
We can see the knobs faces soldered closed,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.740
so there's no leakage there.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.660
On one side, it's pretty direct.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.605
The valve goes through
an elbow into the T

00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:51.460
which threads down into our barb.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.900
What we can do is we start
with this side, with it closed,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.840
thread our tank onto here,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.140
thread our other tank
on to the other side,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.960
then we can open and
we have both tanks at once

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.660
feeding down into the barb.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.760
And then I've got this.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.500
This is just a block of wood.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.240
I cut out of a plywood.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.480
It's sort of T-shaped that lets
the hose clamps grip on

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.990
and hold it firmly in place.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.540
And I've added a little elbow
bracket onto the top of that,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.940
which is what I can use to
attach this whole weird assembly

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.800
onto the skeleton arm frame.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500
And now I can bolt that on right there.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.220
I've drilled two holes into the frame.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.460
That goes right there.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.880
Now, if I just had this
mounted onto the arm,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.300
and two full propane tanks above it,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
that would be a lot of stress
on this one little piece right here.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.979
So we wanted to build a support
that could hold everything in place

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.880
a little bit higher up on the bottles.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.880
We're just gonna cut
that out of a piece of wood.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.540
[Music]

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.580
Looks like about 2 and 13/16
inches is the diameter of our bottles.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.640
Take a compass, measure out
a circle just the right size.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.440
But just the right size mean just a hint
bigger so it's not gonna scrape and rub.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.940
We're gonna go for some open circles.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.720
They won't be entirely
enclosed by the board.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.970
Have it be open on one
end just a little bit.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.000
Let's see. I'd say we've also got
some extra board back here.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.700
So we'll trim that down a bit too.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.600
[Music]

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.820
Our piece of wood is cut out,

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.700
and if we measured it correctly,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.620
the bottles can fit through this,
and then directly into their valves.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.660
So I've got two propane cans
that are completely empty.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.200
There's nothing left in these.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.880
They don't hiss when
you push down the pins.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.560
Nothing remnant so I'm not gonna
be risking filling the air

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.220
with propane as I do this.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.360
There we have it.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.900
Two propane cans,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.560
and as I just said these
are both completely empty

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.240
that's why nothing is venting out here.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.080
These are just drained.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.699
So now I can mount
this onto the arm skeleton,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.180
and it should hold those pretty nicely.

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.159
I've got one elbow bracket right here.

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.529
Let's throw a second elbow
bracket onto this piece,

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.400
and that'll let us attach both of them.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.900
[Music]

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.849
Lovely lovely lovely.
This brace is working well.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.360
It's holding our canisters
right where we want them.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.680
All right next up.

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.060
We're going to want
to attach the solenoid,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.140
and then run the hose from
this barb into the solenoid.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.680
Where did I put the solenoid?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.099
The solenoid conveniently
for mounting has a couple of spots

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.880
on the bottom with threads in it.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.860
So, we can use a couple of machine
threaded screws to attach that.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.020
And to attach it to the arm,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.699
we've got a couple of
holes drilled into the metal.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.340
Our hose reaches to the solenoid,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.480
and in fact, we've got
quite a bit of extra hose.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.680
So, what we want to
do is cut it to a length

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.200
so that it easily reaches when
my arm is bent or straightened out.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.180
All right.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.100
Straight, bent, both ways.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.280
That hose reaches just fine.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.120
In order to dump the propane out,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.920
we need to be able
to activate the solenoid.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.400
And to do that, we have
our battery pack of course.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.220
So we need somewhere
to put the battery pack.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.620
I've got some space up here
in between the propane tanks,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.000
and it seems like it would
be a shame to waste that.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.120
So I'm gonna see if I can't
attach our battery pack up here.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.580
[Music]

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.530
There we go.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.200
That's held nicely in place.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.500
We're gonna take apart this umbrella
and use the spring-loaded metal bars

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.609
as a sort of extending arm
and try and make our prongs

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.140
reach out onto the front of that

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.440
so all of the electricity is just
a good distance in front of our arm.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.560
That way there shouldn't
be any fire on our hand,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.180
there shouldn't be any
taser leads on our hands.

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:33.500
It should just be safer all around.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.360
[whistling]

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.800
Okay, I think I need to
completely destroy this umbrella.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.300
The umbrella mechanism
is pretty simple here.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.620
We've got one metal rod that
fits closely inside of another one.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.640
There's a lock that doesn't
move until you press down on that.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.300
Collapses down.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.080
Normally what holds it in the down
position to some other hardware

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.260
that I've already stripped off.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.319
We do have these little barbs down here.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.830
But they don't latch on
to anything at the moment.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.780
So what I need to do is cut
a hole in the metal right here

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.520
so that it'll little hook on to those.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.900
That way when I push
this button, it should spring out.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.160
[Music]

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.979
We've got the hole cut well filed in.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.520
So now we can bring this back,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.780
and it latches into place.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.560
And when we push this button down,

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.360
it shoots forward.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.740
As you saw, it's quite difficult
to push that button down.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.640
This spike is a little more
intense than we need it to be.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.440
So once again we'll gonna the file,
we're gonna keep the spike there.

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.449
We're gonna shorten it,

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.340
so we don't have to push
quite so hard on this button.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.900
[Music]

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.870
Here is what we're going to use
to extend those taser diodes.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.860
I have these two leads that have
sort of a ceramic non-conductive back,

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.860
and of course the metal up front.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.920
At the back of these leads,
I have soldered on these two wires,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.620
and covered the backs
in some liquid electrical tape.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.319
And I'm now actually going to put
several more layers of stuff over that

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.919
to make absolutely sure
that the electricity isn't going

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.260
to try and arc between
the wires back here,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.600
and that it really sticks
to the leads where I want it.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.849
We're also going to attach these
onto the front of this telescoping rod,

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.650
And now need to drill a hole big
enough for the screw to fit in,

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.300
and I'm then going to
add some proto putty.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.700
Just some silicone
mixed up with some water,

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.640
and maybe a little bit of cornstarch
to just build up around here.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.660
Now, if we attach this
umbrella bar right about here,

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.460
we should be able to press this button,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.680
and it will extend automatically.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.080
So we need to attach
the umbrella bar onto the frame.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.979
To do that, we've got
a hole drilled right here.

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.540
We'll drill a hole into this,
and use a bolt to hold that in place.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.760
[Music]

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.860
All right, this arm is
attached on one side,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.969
but doesn't have much
support on the other.

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:52.280
So what I think we're
gonna do is take this eyebolt.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.140
We will attach that onto the front
of the frame right about here,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.020
and that will just sort of
be a spot where this can rest.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.480
And we'll then tighten this bolt down
once we have an angle we want.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.360
And the advantage of the eyebolt
is that it should hold it in place,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.060
and as it extends outward,
it should be able to slide along that.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.280
Still giving a little bit of support,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.920
but without gripping it
so it doesn't slide easily.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:30.480
[Music]

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.020
That's what we're looking for.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.640
I needed a handle to be able to control
both the gas and electricity at once.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.840
This was originally part
of a wrist rocket,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.029
and I thought I could repurpose it
to be my little double trigger handle.

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:45.471
So what I've done is
cut three holes into it.

00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:47.780
I've got a rectangle hole
that I cut in right here,

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.699
and then I've got two more holes
that I drilled down in the bottom.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.480
And then it already had
one hole in the top

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.300
that happened to be just the right size.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.160
So what we've got is a couple
of different kinds of switches.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.760
So this switch is designed to
do something rather particular.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.220
You can have electricity going into it,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.220
and you can have something
that is activated by the switch,

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.540
and then something that is always on.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.660
The second wire is the one
you want to be conditional.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.540
We are actually not going
to be using this wire,

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.620
the one that is always on.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.760
So we're just going to cut that off.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.960
Now this switch can mount inside
the rectangle hole that I cut out.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.600
And if I leave enough space,
I can still click it.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.700
We've also got this little
push button switch.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.420
Both switches only allow electricity to
flow through as the button is held down.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.378
This one I'm gonna put on top and
it's gonna be the activation for the taser,

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.320
and then pulling
the trigger will drop the fuel.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.260
Beautiful.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.480
We now have two separate
switches we can activate.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.880
Click click click click.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.660
Let's use a couple more zip ties
to attach our switches

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.360
to this other piece of aluminum.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:57.660
[Music]

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.330
From a functional standpoint,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.980
this flame thrower arm
should be ready to go.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.360
I think we need to give it a test.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:11.700
[Music]

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.020
Let's try this sucker out.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.460
[Music]

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.160
[laughing]

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.140
Yes!

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.280
We're not using it a whole lot right now.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.920
Basically, we're just showing
you that it is functional,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.820
and I'm pretty happy with
where we've gotten this to.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.700
It does work.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.900
It shoots fire.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.720
It's not mounted to a chair anymore.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.880
I can carry it around.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.140
It's got some heft to it.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.040
It's not exactly a super comfortable
flame thrower arm but it does work.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.860
All of it is mounted just
on one arm right there.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.440
This thing is pretty sweet.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.180
Stay tuned for part three where
we decorate this whole thing,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.860
in some cool cosplay style armor
and make it look like a giant robotic arm.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.540
Guys as always, we've got
more for you to see,

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.650
so you don't miss out on the fun.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.640
This box up at the top will
take you to our last video.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.220
That's a good one.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.140
You should go check that out.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.200
The box down at the bottom is
gonna show you what YouTube

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.360
thinks you need to be watching,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.610
and this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you in the channel.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.820
This is how you make sure you don't miss
out on anything cool we do in the future.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.940
Don't forget to ring that bell
and we will see you in the next one.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.540
Talk to you then.
