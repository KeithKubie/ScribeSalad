00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.980
Not all lies are alike. Some people lie, but...

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.090
their lies are not caused by a serious

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.390
mental illness. Constantly, psychopath lie

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.880
habitually, and their vice is a part of a

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.800
personality disorder that makes them

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.660
cold hearted and have no conscience.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.599

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.280
psychopath? Here are some telltale signs one...

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.909
psychopaths lie extremely frequently many...

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:41.039
people tell a white lie once in awhile to...

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.949
spare someone's feelings. Psychopath lie...

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.230
pathologically about anything and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.989
everything deception is an integral part

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.550
of their disorder... (Two) Psychopaths lies

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.489
are driven by multiple motives. Ruthless...

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.739
powerful, dictators like Stalin and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.440
Hitler were Psychopaths... they lie and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.199
means a manipulation to exercise dominance...

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.020
over others. These individuals also lie...

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.179
to cover up their misdeeds in illegal...

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:12.300
activities. Characteristically, they tell...

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.649
the ultimate lie "I love you..."

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.840
Psychopaths have a convincing manner

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.509
lying seems to be as effortless as

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.000
breathing for a psychopath since they

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.190
lack empathy they can lie while looking

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.289
people in the eye and be very convincing;

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.020
because they're skilled actors and don't...

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.940
feel shame they can give the impression

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.920
of being guiltless. (4) Psychopaths rely

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.649
on people sympathies, they play upon the

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.569
natural tendency of people to want to

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.039
help those in need.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.319
It's common for them to fake injuries or

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.440
ailments. Their ease and skill in the art of  deceit...

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.020
opens the doors for many exploitation

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.070
opportunities

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.120
(five) A psychopath's truth is momentary; as

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.250
their feelings are shallow the truth

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.430
they tell are only momentary varities for

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.680
example, they may declare their love for

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.080
girlfriend in the heat of passion, but an

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.149
hour later be in hot pursuit of another

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.260
woman...

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.330
the focus is always on the next

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.170
temporary pleasure...

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.340
(six) Psychopath leave behind trophies of their lies

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.780

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.070
deceit, known as trophies

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.980
it's a way of flaunting their lies for

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.470
example, if they're having an affair

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.000
they might leave a trinket from their

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.830
girlfriend a place where they know it

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.959
will be discovered by their wife.

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.690
This is a game of catch me if you can...

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.850
this could also be spending time with

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.489
one woman you are texting another living

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.820
on the edge is a thrill for them...

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.920
(seven) Psychopaths have their own

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.950
language, common phrases and statements

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.840
have a different meaning for psychopaths.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.530
For example, "you're my one and only" might

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.690
mean, "You're one of a long line of woman

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.670
who has succumbed to my charm."

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.670
Likewise, "Trust me..." might translate into

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.910
"What a dope!"

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.750
(eight) Psychopaths are masters of denial

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.390
and minimization. They're good with the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.340
Denial's and minimization when their lies

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.890
are discovered. If confronted with their

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.170
deceit they quickly accuse the victim

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.300
of imagining things or exaggerating.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.120
Thus, their denials compound the lie...

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.560
no desire to stop lying. The biggest

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.420
emotional high comes from deceiving a

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.390
woman who trust them. Regardless of how

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.220
much trouble they get into because of

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.710
their lies, they lack more incentive to

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.870
improve their behavior

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.690
aforementioned manipulative tendency.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.480
Desire to dominate, and lack empathy now. They're...

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.930
