00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.000
- [Narrator] The heart pumps
blood throughout the body.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.093
Carrying oxygen and
nutrients to every cell.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.750
It's this circulation
of blood that is vital

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.313
to sustaining life.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.340
The heart is an organ made up of several

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.803
tough layers of muscle.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.150
The pericardium is the thin
layer that covers the exterior

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.323
while the endocardium
lines the inside walls.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.040
The heart is divided into four chambers.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.620
Two upper and two lower.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.010
The upper chambers known
as the atrium receive blood

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.540
coming into the heart.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.203
The lower chambers are the
ventricles that pump blood out.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.120
Between each chamber are
valves that open and close

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.450
and help keep the blood moving.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.780
They are the tricuspid, mitral,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.063
pulmonary, and aortic valves.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.190
A pumping cycle starts
when oxygen repleted blood

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.960
returns to the heart after
circulating throughout the body.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.180
The blood enters through the
right atrium before flowing

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.720
to the right ventricle.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.600
It's then pumped to the lungs
via the pulmonary arteries.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.030
There blood is rejuvenated
by air that's breathed in.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.720
The oxygen rich blood
returns to the heart through

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.630
the left atrium where it
goes to the left ventricle.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.860
Then by way of the aorta artery
the fresh blood is pumped

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.073
throughout the body before
the process repeats itself.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.823
That process happens with every heartbeat.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.363
And it's relentless.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.240
The heart beats 100,000 times a day.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.200
40 million times a year

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.280
and up to three billion times
over an average lifespan.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.000
But there are conditions
that can disrupt a heartbeat

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and that normality.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.030
They can range from myocardial
infarction or heart attack

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.620
to heart disease and hypertension.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.910
In contrast, exercise
and emotional excitement

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.156
can also have an impact
on a person's heartbeat.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:06.980
The various blood vessels that comprise

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.010
the circulatory system are a
network of veins, arteries,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.570
and capillaries that
span over 60,000 miles

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.130
throughout the body.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.640
And the heart is the
pump at the center of it.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.973
(heartbeat)
