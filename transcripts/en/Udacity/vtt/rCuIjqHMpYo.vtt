00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.370
Negative numbers are always
on the left side of 0 and

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.340
positive numbers are always
on the right side of 0.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.900
So these two are correct.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.820
Every number line will not
always have the same scale so

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.680
this one's not correct.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.870
And this one's not correct either.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.520
While it's not required that you mark 0,
it's really helpful to do so.
