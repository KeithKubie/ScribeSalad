00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.590
So now that we've discussed how to write slightly more

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.400
complicated SQL queries, why don't you give it a try?

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.780
We're going to read in our aadhaar_data csv to a

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.040
pandas dataframe. Afterwards, as we did before, we'll rename the

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.460
columns by replacing any spaces with underscores, and by setting

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.540
all characters to lowercase. So that the column names more

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.300
closely resemble column names you might find in a SQL

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.500
table. Can you write a SQL query that will select from

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.580
the odd hard data table? How many men, and how many women, over the age

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.170
of 50, have had aadharr generated for them

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.440
in each district? Your query should go here.
