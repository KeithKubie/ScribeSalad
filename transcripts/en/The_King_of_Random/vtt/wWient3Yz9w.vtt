00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.840
For this project, I’m going to show you
how to use the secrets of the Force to turn

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.880
a handful of gummy bears into custom Star
Wars gummies.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.620
To start this project, you’ll need something
to mold your gummies, and I’m using these

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.250
Star Wars trays that my brother got me for
Christmas. You should be able to find them

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.730
online, or at one of the novelty stores at
your local shopping mall.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.759
The trays are silicone and actually designed
for freezing ice cubes, but they work impressively

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.900
well for making chocolates, and gummy candies
as well.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.810
Now all you need to start casting your clones,
is a big bag of gummy bears. So go ahead and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.100
dump the entire bag on the counter, because
they’ll all need to be sorted out in just a second.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.600
The cool thing about using gummy bears, is
that the candy is already made. So that means

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.030
you don’t have to worry about following
a recipe or messing around with food coloring,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.510
and flavoring. Instead, all you need to do
is figure out a way to liquify them so you

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.899
can pour them into the molds.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.980
Get busy separating all the colors into different
piles, and you’ll probably end up with mountains

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.920
of red, green, white, yellow, and orange,
which in this case all seem to be fairly even.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.800
With the colors sorted out, it’s time to
grab a microwave safe container like a glass measuring cup.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.230
Fill the container with as many, same color
gummy bears as you feel like, then simply

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.320
put it in the center of the microwave, and
nuke it for around 10-15 seconds. If it needs

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.510
a bit more than that, don’t go longer than
10 seconds at a time, because you’ll end

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.940
up making a really big mess on the inside.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.220
The syrup is ready when all the gummy bears
have melted completely, and the gummy goo

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.460
is just runny enough that you can pour it.
Which is exactly what we’re going to do

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.730
next.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.500
Slowly and carefully pour the molten gummy
goodness into the ice cube trays, and try

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.030
to resist the temptation to lick it, or pour
it in your mouth. It’s really hot and will

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.770
probably burn you, so be careful and use something
like a spatula to catch the drips instead.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.440
These will need some time to cool, so while
we’re waiting, let’s go ahead and melt

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.980
down all the other gummy bears as well, and
fill up the rest of the molds the exact same way.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.180
When the trays are filled, give the syrup
about half an hour to cool on the counter,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.310
then carefully move them to the fridge so
they’ll firm up as much as possible.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.110
They’re going to take about 5 hours to fully
set, but when they’re finished, go ahead

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.650
and pop the gummies out of the molds, and
take a good look at what you’ve created.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.990
You can see there’s a fantastic amount of
detail that gets captured in the candies,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.540
which is impressive considering how quick
and simple they are to make.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.140
Now with more intricate molds, like the stormtrooper
helmets, it might take a bit of stretching

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.520
and prying to get the candies to come out,
but you’ll see that once they release, they

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.340
quickly spring back into shape.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.720
Keep in mind that there’s really no limit
on how big you can make your candies either.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.090
So let your imagination run wild with that
idea, and see how far it takes you.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.670
Well now you know how to transform a bag of
gummy bears into a tasty batch of colorful

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.640
Star Wars gummies, that you could randomly
bust out at the next Cosplay party, or simply

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.250
use to bribe your kids.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.360
By the way, if you don’t want to spend money
on big bags of gummy bears, there’s a much

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.040
cheaper option you can try instead. I used
Jell-O, gelatin, and a bit of corn syrup to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.430
make mountains of colorful LEGO gummies that
look and taste just as good. Look for my recipe

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.750
on how to make these, in another project video.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.790
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
