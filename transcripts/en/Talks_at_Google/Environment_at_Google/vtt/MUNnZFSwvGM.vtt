[DIGITAL TONES]

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.944
VALLI BINDANA: So let's
start with a very tiny story.

00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:13.610
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.920
- And so she came down to
earth with such a force

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.710
that everyone was scared that
the Earth will split into two.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.770
That's when Shiva
stepped forward and said,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.450
leave this to me!

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.400
Let her fall on my head.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.460
I will slow her down
with my long matted hair.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.610
- He had a moon on his head?

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.120
- Yeah, and he even looks
like the Himalayan mountains.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120
The moon is white like
the snow-capped peaks.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.950
The River Ganga flows
from all that snow

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.300
and ice melt, the glaciers.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.780
And all that here are the
dense forests and vegetation.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.920
- And this snake?

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.707
Is that about wild
animals in the forests?

00:00:50.707 --> 00:00:51.706
What do you think, Mama?

00:00:51.706 --> 00:00:52.772
[END PLAYBACK]

00:00:52.772 --> 00:01:00.820
So in 2013, when I
began making this film,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.510
I was not a researcher.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.970
I was not a scientist.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.820
I was not religious.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.780
I'm not now.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.070
I was not a social worker,
not an engineer, not a tribal.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.110
I was not a fish.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.170
I was just a common human
in search of a river--

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.140
my river.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.240
This is the Ganga,
known as Ganges

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.570
in the rest of the world.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.340
We used to holiday
by this river.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.250
This was sometime back, about
15 years back, with my family--

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.230
with my mum and my
brothers and my dad.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.240
And we would go to this river
for a few days every year

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.960
for a few years.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.990
And we would have a
really, really good time.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.150
Very, very memorable moments
we would spend there.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.410
And the river used to
flow at that time and flow

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.330
very swift and very fast.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.699
And the color was as you
see here, very bluish-green.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.010
And we were mesmerized
by this river.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.700
So yeah, we fell in love.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.800
And here's another shot.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.150
This is the river
coming downhill

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.570
on the foothills of the
Himalayas in Rishikesh.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.620
A lot of water--

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.760
there were no dams
upstream at that point.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.860
And then I took a
break of a few years.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.040
And I did not go.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.440
And then life happened.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.520
And I had a child.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.820
And she grew up
to be 5-years-old.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.820
And when she was five,
I thought it was time

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.910
for her to experience
Ganga and for her to go.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.440
And it was time for me to
introduce her to the river

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.535
and have her see what I
had been talking about.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:00.410
And I had been telling
her all these stories,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.570
like the one you heard--

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.307
very dramatized versions of
mythology or even geography.

00:03:06.307 --> 00:03:07.890
Not just mythology--
geography-- like,

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.210
the entire Indian
subcontinent-- how it came.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.070
And it rammed into Asia.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.740
And all these mountains
came up, and all of that.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.510
She would be awed
by these stories.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.360
And there were stories about
the fish-- the [INAUDIBLE] fish,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.350
which was 3 feet, sometimes 4--

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.000
much bigger than her.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.820
And I would tell her about
the family times we have had

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.510
and how I had spent time
with my mother by the river

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.840
and, now, she should
also see what it all

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.360
meant for all of us.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.130
And she got pretty
excited about it.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.320
And so we went back.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.370
And we always used to
go into the Himalayas,

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.660
where the river was,
not in the plains.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.770
So we went back there.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:04.080
And this is what we
found off the river.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.665
Now, this is the
Bhagirathi River.

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:09.700
Now, there are two main rivers,
Bhagirathi and Alaknanda, that

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.850
originate in the Himalayas.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.200
And then they come down and meet
at a place called Devprayag.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.129
And from there, it
starts becoming Ganga.

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:17.920
It's called Ganga, but
it's the same river.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.656
So this is the Bhagirathi.

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:25.980
This is how it looked like.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.060
And-- no river.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.690
It's all gone.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.780
It's not like we
misplace our keys

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.440
or we say, oh, our
wallet has disappeared.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.382
Where is our wallet?

00:04:36.382 --> 00:04:37.090
It's disappeared.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.627
The entire river, or what we
saw it, was not there at all.

00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:43.835
Some puddles of water here
and there-- very stagnant.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.350
No sounds of gushing
water of course.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.150
So we talked to
the local people.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.420
And we asked, so what happened?

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.690
And they said, well, our
region has developed.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.720
And a lot of
developmental activity

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.800
is taking place
around this place.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.260
And there are a few dams
upstream that have come up,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.560
which are generating
electricity for the country.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.530
And so then we said, OK.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.460
And my daughter again had-- of
course-- questions of her own.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.335
And she asked, so where
did all the water go?

00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:27.710
Which was a very
valid question--

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.360
where did all the water go?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.899
And then she said, where
did all the fish go?

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:32.690
The water is there.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.060
Where did the fish go?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.110
And then she asked
me a question, which

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.550
sort of put me up a stump.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.430
And she asked me, if the
river is not there, why do you

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.710
tell me stories about it?

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.080
Now, she was questioning
my storytelling.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.350
So I didn't have any answers
at that point for her.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.480
And my brother was there.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.320
Marthand was there.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.930
And we discussed about it.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.390
And we wondered, why a river--
and this is not just a river.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.270
This is the Ganges
we are talking about.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.590
Ganges is-- we talk
about her since eternity.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.840
It's in our mythology.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.392
We say, she's responsible for
the birth of a civilization.

00:06:18.392 --> 00:06:20.960
And we call her Mother
Goddess and all of that.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.180
And yet, when a
river disappears,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.850
there is no talk about
it down in the plains

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.040
where we came from.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.820
And not just talk--

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.440
the media doesn't
discuss about it.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.470
People like us,
common people who

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.810
just go about our daily lives--

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.244
we don't know that there is
no Ganges up in the mountains.

00:06:43.244 --> 00:06:44.535
So nobody's talking about this.

00:06:44.535 --> 00:06:47.745
So that was more disturbing,
that something like this

00:06:47.745 --> 00:06:49.620
has happened, and nobody
is talking about it.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.790
So we thought,
let's do something.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.200
Right-- so what do we do?

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.580
Let's get people
to know about this.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.430
How do we get people
to know about this?

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.620
If we go down and tell
them, there is no Ganges,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.286
they'll say, what are
you talking about?

00:07:02.286 --> 00:07:06.300
Ganga has been
there for so long.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.630
So we said, OK, let's
make a film about it.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.435
And I forget to tell you, 2013--

00:07:13.435 --> 00:07:16.110
I was not a film-maker either.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.352
And so Marthand knew
something about the cameras.

00:07:21.352 --> 00:07:23.810
And so he bought a camera-- a
tiny little camera-- a Canon.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:29.900
And I remember, we got a
very tiny audio equipment.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.690
We got a $30 Lav mic.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.670
And with very, very
basic equipment,

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:40.230
we set out to meet
people who have

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.580
been working in this area of
water and rivers for decades.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.100
This is another
shot of AsiGanga,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.230
which is another
tributary of the Ganga--

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.190
the Ganges-- up in the
mountains-- no water at all.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.100
So we began our meeting--

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.400
a person called
Himanshu Thakkur.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.800
He is a coordinator of
SANDRP, South Asian Network

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.510
of Dams, Rivers, and People.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.450
And this organization-- and
Himanshu, in particular--

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:19.760
has been working on rivers--
and he's a researcher.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.930
He's been working on river
issues for a long, long time.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.990
And if there's any
person you need to have,

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.560
if you have any questions,
he's the person to go to.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.090
Because he's like
an encyclopedia

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.179
of all of these issues.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.919
So we met him.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.470
And we had this tiny
set of equipment.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.750
And we had loads and
loads of questions.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.460
So we met him.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.040
And this is one of the first
interviews that we did.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.410
And I think we interviewed
about three or four times

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.200
over the period of four years.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.670
So he introduced us to the
issue of how everything

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.194
came to being what it is.

00:08:58.194 --> 00:10:00.720
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.340
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.990
So just a little background on
where we were at that point,

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.940
at the time we started
making the film.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.670
This was, again, 2013.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.030
And all of these figures
are very suspect,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.155
in the sense that all the people
that we talked to-- and this

00:10:18.155 --> 00:10:20.700
includes the Ministry of Power.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.060
They never came up with a single
figure or a very confident

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.890
answer to our questions.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:31.470
So there were 51 operating
hydropower projects,

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:32.850
each over 1 megawatts.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.740
[INAUDIBLE] were operational.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.300
And this is all in
the Ganga River Basin.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.100
And then 40 projects under
construction-- again,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:46.380
a number which you can say,
give or take a few projects.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.710
And then the last one
is quite a whopper.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.780
It is 80 to 600.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.330
So at that point,
the number of dams

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.000
being planned on the
Ganga River Basin

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.830
were anywhere between
80 to 600 dams.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.740
And these are all
hydropower projects

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.610
on the Ganga River Basin.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.890
So if all of these would come
to fruition, if all of these

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.260
were set up, the
Ganga River Basin

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.220
would become one of the densest
dam sites on the planet.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:28.120
So now, each of
these projects need

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.780
to go through a certain
set of clearances.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:36.070
And one of the clearances is
the environmental clearance.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.350
And our focus was on
that, because that

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.450
is what we were dealing with--

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.010
the environment.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.950
So here is Himanshu again.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.480
Now, when he gave
the interview, he

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.550
talked to us about
environmental clearances

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.400
and all the processes
that need to be

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.500
or ideally should be followed.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.480
For about 20 minutes
he talked about it.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:04.720
So quite a complex process
and quite intricate--

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.040
and I have about two
minutes of it for you now.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.710
And he talks about
hydropower projects.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.670
But we can apply,
probably-- or nearly--

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:21.130
the same processes for other
forms of big centralized energy

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.700
production as well.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.310
So let's hear what he has to
say about environmental impact

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.632
assessment, which
is a EIA process.

00:12:30.632 --> 00:13:26.750
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.280
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:41.100
So he talks about
a couple of things.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.050
He talks about the
cut-and-paste jobs of the EIAs.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:51.020
And this has happened
earlier in some assessments.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.400
There have been names
of animals and shrubs

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.630
and foliage and trees reported
in the assessment, which don't

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.790
exist in the region at all.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.640
That is how shoddy the
environment reports are.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.220
And he talks about cumulative
impact assessments.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.840
Now, this is also a
very important point.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.210
And he really, really elaborated
on it when we talked about it.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.130
So cumulative
means what it says.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:25.700
It means that when a project
comes up on a river there are

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.930
a whole lot of other activities
that surround the project--

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.400
for example--

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.924
now again, going back to the
two rivers, the Bhagirathi

00:15:34.924 --> 00:15:36.590
and the Alaknanda,
there are a whole lot

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:41.660
of tributaries that come
and join into these two

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.160
big major rivers.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.800
Now dams are proposed
and dams are planned

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.280
and dams are being constructed
in all of these tributaries.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.210
And these are pristine areas.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.810
These are untouched
Himalayan regions,

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.810
where there is no road,
there is no electricity,

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.340
there is hardly anything there
except a few villages here

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.780
and there scattered.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:06.020
So when a project comes
up there, how do you get--

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.490
what you need is people.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.790
You need big heavy equipment
to be transported there.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.790
So how do you do that?

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.815
You build roads.

00:16:12.815 --> 00:16:13.940
And how do you build roads?

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.400
And we're not talking
about flat surfaces.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.500
We're talking about 45-degree
angles and mountains

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.772
that are steep.

00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:22.730
And how do you do that?

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.470
You blast your way through
into these regions.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:29.630
Now, Himalayas are a very
young mountain range.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.460
And they are very
brittle in nature.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.070
And when you actually
go into the mountains

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.250
and you scrape the mountainsides
that have been cut,

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.880
you will find just pebbles
and rocks and mud and sand.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.260
They are not like solid
rock that will stay.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.240
When they blast their
way through the mountains

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.380
and into these pristine areas,
the mountains move about.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.520
They tremble.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.170
They vibrate.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.620
And so that results in a
whole lot of landslides.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.130
Now, when we were driving
up and down the Basin,

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.190
there were times
when we wouldn't see

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.760
the road for a long, long time.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.530
Why?

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.319
Because there had
been landslides

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.359
throughout the entire
road that we were very,

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.339
very slowly going.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:19.790
And this is in the case
throughout the Basin.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:24.630
And then there are these
run-of-the-river tunnels.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.740
So there are many
different types of dams.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.200
There are gravity dams.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.040
And then there are these
run-of-the-river dams,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.670
which are showcased by the
companies and the governments

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.630
as the most
environmentally-friendly

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.750
technologies.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.820
Which sound very good actually,
the way they describe it.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.540
But the way they are
implemented in the mountains

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.820
is very different.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.800
So what they do is
they put a wall--

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.740
put a [INAUDIBLE] in place.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.330
They stop the water.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.270
The water level rises.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.680
And then they dig a
tunnel through from here.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.230
And then they keep
digging a tunnel inside.

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:11.280
And the tunnel takes
the entire water

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.070
from the river--
from the storage.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.330
And it goes.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.380
And the dam that we were--

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:24.510
[INAUDIBLE] Dam-- the tunnel
was about 8.2 kilometers long.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.110
So that now, the river
water is in the tunnels.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.510
And outside, the river
bed was completely dry.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.660
And then downstream somewhere,
they would release the water.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.860
The turbines would spin.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.315
The electricity would be made.

00:18:39.315 --> 00:18:40.350
Now, you would say, OK.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:45.300
There are hundreds of kilometers
of river lengths in the Basin.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.310
What would this do?

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.240
8 kilometers is not a big deal.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:55.660
But the way it is implemented
is the dam wall is here.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.340
The river is dry.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.870
The water is released here.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.760
And the next dam begins
right in front of it.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.420
So now, we're talking
about a cascade of dams

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.800
throughout the Basin.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.500
Now, the way they
dig the tunnels

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:13.540
is again with blasting of
dynamite and other explosives.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.570
So all of this results in a lot
of shaking and a lot of damage

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.710
in this very, very
fragile mountain

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:25.725
range and a lot of landslides
and land sinking happens.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:37.320
And sometimes it results
in a very serious damage

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.900
to the villages that are
there in the mountains.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.760
Let's hear this out.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.200
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.590
- One such village that
had faced the brunt

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.500
is Jhamak perched right
above the tunnel entrance

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.840
of one of Himalayan dams.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.730
- It was '91 or '92.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.360
There was a single
earthquake in Uttarkashi.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.070
And around that time, all
the other villages-- there

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.980
was not so much destruction.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.440
But Jhamak [INAUDIBLE]----
there were maximum number

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.284
of casualties.

00:20:10.284 --> 00:20:13.236
Why there were maximum
number of casualties?

00:20:13.236 --> 00:20:15.620
This is the area where,
apart from the tunnel,

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.870
there was nothing else.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:21.150
- 76 people died
in Jhamak alone.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.950
The incident wasn't isolated.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.690
Throughout the
Ganga River Basin,

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.390
around construction sites of
these massive developmental

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.065
projects, as the
earth below trembles--

00:20:30.065 --> 00:20:30.990
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.760
So this was just one of
the many, many incidents

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:41.204
that happened in the Himalayas.

00:20:41.204 --> 00:20:44.540
This is a 2018 news item--

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.040
very recent.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:50.160
And it talks about
mountain springs drying up.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.630
This is being reported
in the mainstream media.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:57.540
And it is 2018.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.200
But actually, this news
is not news of 2018.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:06.294
This has been happening
for many, many years.

00:21:06.294 --> 00:21:11.910
And when we went, we
saw firsthand just how

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.430
this impacted the local people.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.870
We have Mallica and Bharat
Dehi and [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:26.710
talk about this.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:27.376
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:27.376 --> 00:21:29.065
- [SPEAKING HINDI]

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:44.760
These are fresh water sources.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.630
And they have been [INAUDIBLE]
water sources for villages

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.770
since eternity.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.550
Now when blasting starts to
happen and then these boulders,

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.360
these mountains,
they move about,

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.500
the water gets displaced.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.170
All the fresh water
of the mountains,

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.250
it just flows into the tunnels.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.482
So obviously, there is
nothing in the villages.

00:22:03.482 --> 00:22:30.810
- [SPEAKING HINDI]

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.540
- Because we are here in
[INAUDIBLE] and we work

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.650
continuously in the communities,
two years ago when we had

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:42.120
a very severe drought, we did
a deep survey of, what was it

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.320
doing to women and children?

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.620
75% of the streams
had disappeared

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.360
because of climate havoc--

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.850
because climate
change intensifies

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.880
drought and floods and cyclones.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.380
Women were having to walk
even further for water.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.780
Worse, children had
stopped going to school,

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.880
because they had to carry
that additional pot.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.520
When a stream comes through, you
fill your pit in five minutes

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.630
and go home.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.140
When it comes as a trickle,
drop by drop by drop,

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.990
a child is standing
there for six hours

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.840
to collect one
day's need of water.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.990
Women and children always
carry the heaviest burden

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.940
of ecological destruction.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.424
And the disappearance of
water is no exception.

00:23:23.424 --> 00:23:24.820
[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:30.060
So we actually followed a
couple of-- not these women.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.500
But we actually followed
a couple of women

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.980
when they walked about
a kilometer, a kilometer

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.910
and a 1/2, to collect
water for their house--

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.822
just simple household needs.

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:44.780
And we took the camera.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.690
And we actually followed.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.370
And this was, again,
in the Himalayas.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.360
So 1 and 1/2 kilometers
of walking for them

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.342
is OK, because they've always
walked 1 and 1/2 kilometers up

00:23:53.342 --> 00:23:54.050
in the mountains.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.450
But for us, with all the
equipment and everything,

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:57.400
it was pretty tedious.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.200
So there's a very
interesting story about how--

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.110
the first day we went
into the village.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.650
And we were carrying
again our equipment.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.200
And we were city folk--

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.620
very unfit people.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.490
So we went there.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.550
And we go into the house.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.660
And guess what the first
thing that they ask us is?

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.650
They ask us, would you have
like to have a glass of water?

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:21.860
And so I said, yeah, sure.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.040
And this is the first day
of shoot in the village.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.840
And they bring water.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.615
And I drink it up.

00:24:28.615 --> 00:24:29.990
And then the whole
day, we shoot.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.615
And we go back.

00:24:30.615 --> 00:24:32.370
And then, when we
shoot, actually then

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.714
we find out just how the
water came into their house.

00:24:35.714 --> 00:24:37.380
And so the next day,
we went back again.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.100
And they asked, water?

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.058
I said, oh, no, no, no.

00:24:39.058 --> 00:24:39.600
We're fine.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.910
We're good.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.300
And if you go back--

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.010
and we shoot the whole day.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.070
And you're thirsty like crazy.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:51.330
And we go back to the place
where we were staying.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.510
And the caretaker comes.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.881
And I said, oh, I want water.

00:24:53.881 --> 00:24:55.005
I'm really, really thirsty.

00:24:55.005 --> 00:24:56.175
They said, what happened?

00:24:56.175 --> 00:24:57.720
I said, I didn't drink there.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.860
So he started laughing.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.340
He just doubled up.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.470
So in a way, it is normal for
them to accept these hardships

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.630
and still go on with life.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.970
And these two women actually--

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.250
what they are holding
on their backs

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:16.320
is food and foliage
for their cows.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.090
Now, each family that--

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.310
the village we went
to, [INAUDIBLE]----

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:25.872
each family had about one
or two cows or a calf.

00:25:25.872 --> 00:25:28.650
Earlier, what they
tell me, is they used

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.920
to have four or five or more.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.890
But now, they cannot
maintain so many,

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:39.360
because they have to feed and
actually take care of them.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.890
So the way their economics
works is, in their household,

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:44.550
there's a cow.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.260
And the cow gives plenty.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.990
And the cows give milk also.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.750
So the women, they feed the cow.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:52.590
And they milk.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.930
And they sell the milk
and get the money.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.690
So now, if you don't
feed the cow properly,

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:00.880
they don't give enough milk.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.070
So now, when the springs
and the groundwater

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.580
was there, say,
about 20 years back,

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.870
the women would go out
at 6:00 in the morning

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:19.020
and collect this water and
come back by 10:00 or 11:00

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.280
during the day.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.340
And then they have farming
to do, kids to take care of,

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.830
and all the other
stuff going on.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.830
But now, since the
springs are gone

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.590
and the groundwater is
gone, the forests are dry--

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.510
and they call it
[HINDI] is grass.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.250
It's not grass.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.160
It's foliage.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.440
But anyways, the
cattle don't graze.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.540
So the women have to go
deep into the mountains--

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:47.460
and what they told me was
about 20 to 25 kilometers--

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.700
every single day to get
a bunch of this kind

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.860
of foliage for the cows to eat.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.070
So they would leave at
6:00 in the morning.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.650
And they would come back
at around 4:00 or 5:00

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:05.020
in the evening, just for
one job of feeding the cows.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.400
So you would
understand what happens

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.200
to the rest of the
work that is there--

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.770
the farms to be
tilled and other work

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:17.104
that is there in the house.

00:27:17.104 --> 00:27:18.020
That doesn't get done.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:28.340
This was a gruesome one.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.750
So a river, the
geography of it--

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:38.570
the river acts as a
barrier against predators

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:43.980
and natural hazards from other
parts of the whole region.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.170
So if there's a village here and
there's a river flowing there,

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.520
the village stays
protected from elements

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.150
from the other
side of the river.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.360
When the river goes--

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.590
oh, there's another
part to this.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.730
When the river goes, the
leopards come, that's fine.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:06.050
So over centuries,
the way the people die

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:11.090
is they would
cremate their dead.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:15.500
So they would cremate their
dead beside the river Ganges.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.670
Now, sometimes it so happens
that the wood is damp.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:24.800
And so it's not burned properly,
the corpse is still there.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.130
So in such cases, when
the leopards come,

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.920
they get a taste of human flesh.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.040
And they turn man-eaters.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.600
Now, this is not folklore.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.830
We were there.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.350
And we saw them living this.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.850
We saw corpses being burned.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:51.800
The fear of leopards around was
so near and so discomforting.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:58.130
Nobody would go out alone
at dusk or beyond that.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.810
They would carry stuff.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:03.020
They would carry sticks
and some kind of thing

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.300
to ward the attack off.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.384
But this danger was there, very,
very present in the region.

00:29:09.384 --> 00:29:11.300
It's not just one village
we're talking about.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.450
We're talking about [INAUDIBLE],,
which is a small town beside

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.100
the village--

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.310
but very real and
very, very present.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:27.170
So Bijna Devi is a village
elder from [INAUDIBLE] who talks

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.810
about it--

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.174
very matter-of-factly,
by the way.

00:29:31.174 --> 00:29:31.960
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:31.960 --> 00:30:17.970
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:18.553
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:18.553 --> 00:30:21.260
So I bet none of
these stories would

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.530
have even featured in any of the
EIAs that we are talking about.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:29.090
So all that I showed you
today or talked about

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:31.400
is not there in the film.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:37.280
The film-- giving you
a very raw deal here.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.210
And I talked about just
the hydro component of it.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.830
And hydro is just
1/3 of the film.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:45.580
There's coal.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.840
And then there's the
rise of solar and wind.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.230
And we go in depth
into each area,

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.990
talking to-- again--
researchers, doctors,

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:57.670
and social workers, and people,
and the builders themselves.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:58.930
So what's there in the film?

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:00.580
In the film, we have--

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:04.990
these are very few of the
things that are listed here.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.620
But there's more.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.220
There's social and
cultural impact

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.550
of a disappearing Ganges.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.410
There's geology and seismicity.

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:19.810
And these dams are built on top
of faults and some very active

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.670
faults as well.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.740
Farming and livelihood
is something

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.350
that we covered a little bit.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.760
Fish-- we covered--

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.410
again, it's a panoptic film.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.400
We are connecting the
dots between a whole lot

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.840
of different perspectives.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.240
We set out to find the
truth about what's going on.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.940
But all we found
were perspectives.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.914
A scientist would have
a different perspective.

00:31:44.914 --> 00:31:47.080
A villager would have a
different-- the same valley,

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.700
the same river, the
same water-- we're

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.942
talking about the same issue.

00:31:49.942 --> 00:31:51.650
There are so many
different perspectives.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.850
And this fish is
also a perspective.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.160
So we covered that as well.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.710
And we covered a little bit of
Northeastern Himalaya as well.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:04.060
The same sort of issues
are taking place, if not

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:04.900
more dramatic.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.150
Because the Brahmaputra
is a big volume river.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:11.260
And then there's the
dark side of coal, which

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:15.160
is the second 1/3 of the film.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.610
And then there's rise
of solar and wind.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.590
So I'll move on to--

00:32:24.335 --> 00:32:26.420
oh, the making of "SunGanges."

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.290
So when I finished
the film-- and this

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.500
is an independent
production completely.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.524
When I finished the film,
my peers and people said,

00:32:33.524 --> 00:32:34.190
it's a big deal.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:35.930
And I didn't know
about it actually.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:40.790
So it's hard to just list
out, on hindsight, what we did

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.220
to finish this entire feature.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.460
We did not know the story
when we began filming.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.680
We had these questions.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.270
But the answers
would make the story

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.550
that the film would be about.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:57.720
We didn't know the answers.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:04.530
So there was a downside to
it, that a lot of wastage

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:07.620
happened-- that we covered
a whole lot of things

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.580
about hundreds of
hours of footage

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.310
and that had to be
condensed into, say, an hour

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:17.070
and 1/2 or less.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:21.910
And it was like taming a
wild beast on the edit table.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:26.250
So in case any of you are
thinking of making a film,

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:29.940
knowing your story would
be a good way to start.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.920
Not knowing is also
good, because then you

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.030
approach the project with
a really, really open mind.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:36.900
We listened a lot.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.340
We listened to everybody.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.350
We listened to the
children in the village.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.520
We listened to the tribals.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.811
We listened to the researchers.

00:33:42.811 --> 00:33:45.360
We listened to the boy who
served us in the restaurant.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.920
We listened to everybody.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.740
And that really, really helped
get more and more perspective

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.350
into the film.

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:53.909
We did not wait for
stuff to happen.

00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:55.200
We did not wait for the grants.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.670
We did not wait
for emails-- people

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:57.780
to get back with their emails.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:58.988
We did not wait for anything.

00:33:58.988 --> 00:34:01.560
We just plunged into the
deep end with the camera

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.440
and whatever little that we had.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.920
We made full use of our
ignorance about the subject,

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.679
about what's going on.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:14.820
And that is probably because
of why the film turned out

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.274
to be the way it is right now.

00:34:17.274 --> 00:34:18.690
And we stayed
stubborn throughout.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:22.020
It took about 4 and
1/2 years to make.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.570
And it got ready
of late last year.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:32.712
And it made a European premiere
in Germany early this year.

00:34:32.712 --> 00:34:33.378

[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:25.521 --> 00:36:27.062
MODERATOR: If you
have any questions,

00:36:27.062 --> 00:36:29.276
there's a mic right there.

00:36:29.276 --> 00:36:33.210
AUDIENCE: So it sounds like
what you're proposing--

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:37.590
what the movie's proposing-- is
a push for renewable energy--

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.980
mainly solar and
wind, I'm guessing.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.090
VALLI BINDANA: Yes.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.820
AUDIENCE: Does India have
that natural capacity

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:50.630
to sustain itself with those
kind of renewable energies?

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.100
Because one of the
arguments I hear

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.270
is that hydro-power is
important because it is such

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.315
a easy and powerful
renewable energy source.

00:37:01.315 --> 00:37:03.655
And so people are
reluctant to say--

00:37:03.655 --> 00:37:09.390
even in the US, they're like,
we can't just not build dams.

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:15.042
But it seems like there are
natural consequences to that.

00:37:15.042 --> 00:37:18.060
VALLI BINDANA: Yeah, so there
are natural consequences.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.150
You would see it in the film.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:26.770
Arguments are put forth
in favor of big hydro.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:30.870
And the arguments are
that it's clean and green.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:36.510
And I would echo all the
researchers that we talked to.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:41.680
And they would say
that, well, it depends

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.170
upon how you define clean.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.390
And how you do define green.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.750
If you're submerging
a whole lot of land

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:52.560
and if you're drying
up rivers, then how

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.110
would you define it as green?

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.770
Especially when there
is an alternative energy

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.540
source available,
which is getting

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.600
cheaper and cheaper by the day.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.870
Again, there are
arguments in favor of coal

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:09.539
as well, despite
all that we show

00:38:09.539 --> 00:38:11.580
in the film and all that
is-- and again, the film

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.630
covers a lot.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.220
But then please be
mindful that it's just

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.317
the tip of the iceberg
of what actually

00:38:17.317 --> 00:38:19.650
is happening all over the
country and all over the world

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:21.150
probably.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:23.590
So there are
arguments put forth.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:28.650
But when you compare
just what a dam does

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:34.410
to a river and the ecosystem and
what a distributed solar model

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:40.680
does, there is no
comparison, when

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.780
it comes to
destroying livelihoods

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:48.234
and cultures and just the
ecology of the entire region.

00:38:48.234 --> 00:38:50.180
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks
for making this.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.245
And thanks for
presenting this today.

00:38:52.245 --> 00:38:53.950
I have two questions.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.400
One-- it seems like
the EIAs were actually

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.230
supposed to be an
actual mechanism

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.030
to protect against
bad decisions.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.470
And they're failing incredibly.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:10.330
And so the first question is,
did you see any optimistic sign

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:14.540
for the mechanism being
actually enforced?

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.922
Is there any hope that
the EIA will improve?

00:39:16.922 --> 00:39:21.300
That the people responsible
will be held accountable?

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.465
And second question--
in your journeys,

00:39:23.465 --> 00:39:26.030
did you come across
some examples where

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.540
the local community
was able to push back

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.630
against the [INAUDIBLE]
more hydro-power?

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:35.926
Were there any small local
victories against a larger--

00:39:35.926 --> 00:39:36.878
top-down?

00:39:36.878 --> 00:39:39.550
VALLI BINDANA: So actually,
I have-- do we have time?

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:42.580
I have about six
minutes of actual film

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.520
that I would like
to show to you.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.400
It's about a time where
the entire discourse

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.390
about hydro-power dams in India
changed after that event--

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.440
the Uttarakhand floods.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.670
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.080
VALLI BINDANA: So
it's part of the film.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.330
And I'd like to show it to
you if we have time, right?

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.970
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
five more minutes.

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.510
VALLI BINDANA: So
this was, again, 2013.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:07.270
Just a little bit
of background--

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:11.710
and this part is towards
the end of the hydro segment

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.100
in the film.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.220
It's about these
flash floods that

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:19.570
had happened in Uttarakhand
and what it did to the dams

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:22.480
and what the dams did to
the floods and the people.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:29.530
So it was a very give-and-take
kind of situation there.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:30.510

[END PLAYBACK]

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:23.360
Pancheshwar dam, which
is coming up with Nepal--

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.230
its about 311 meters
high-- it's going to be.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.240
It has been cleared.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:33.560
And it is in a high seismic zone
where earthquakes have happened

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:39.290
in the past few years, about
five or six times, all over 5

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:40.880
on the Richter scale.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.030
So we did not cover
corruption in the film at all.

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:46.550
We just focused on the
technology and the economics

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:49.130
aspect of it and, of course,
the impacts and reactions

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:51.560
of other people and
their perspectives.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.030
So corruption is
a different story.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:54.500
Corruption is a series.

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.720
It can't be limited to a film.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.770
It has to be a web
series or something.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:01.760
It's too much.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.720
It's too ingrained.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.260
And if we expect them to do
a very good job of an EIA,

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.870
I think we are living
in a fool's paradise.

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:11.051
I don't think it's possible.

00:48:16.298 --> 00:48:18.977
AUDIENCE: Can you talk about
the SunGanga [INAUDIBLE] and--

00:48:18.977 --> 00:48:20.810

got to watch the film.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.510
VALLI BINDANA: You've got
to watch the film for that.

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:23.630

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.930
VALLI BINDANA: Yeah.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:25.495
AUDIENCE: But you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:25.495 --> 00:48:27.620
VALLI BINDANA: So when we
started making this film,

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.240
we started with just the river.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:33.360
And then there was this very
famous author called Tony Seba.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.750
I'm not sure if you
have heard of him yet.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.120
But he wrote this book
called "Clean Disruption

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.190
of Energy and Transportation."

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:41.690
And we connected with him.

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:45.010
And he said, why are you just
limiting yourself to hydro?

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:45.930
There's coal.

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:46.880
There's this.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.380
And then he opened
the can of worms.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.790
And we got sucked into it.

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:54.200
And we expanded the entire film
to include the rise of solar

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.240
and wind as well.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.450
The difference between filming
coal and hydro and solar

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:01.580
and wind was very,
very, very stark.

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.970
While hydro and coal-- it
was very difficult to film,

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:08.370
in the sense that there was
a lot to hide and people

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:11.690
were suspicious about
our making the film

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:13.850
or just having the camera.

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.520
The solar and wind guys
and all the companies,

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.700
they would really welcome us and
say, this is what we're doing.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.370
And this is where we are
going to take this company.

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:23.840
Or these are our projects.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.890
This is a product--

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:25.610
and all of that.

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:29.510
So it was very, very
different filming

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.520
the solar and wind
component of the film.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.020
