00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
 I want to tell you a story that never ends. 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.120
 a looping story - this story is end to end 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.600
 I am going to make subtitles for myself. 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.360
 A long time ago, 108 green forest heroes gathered in the waters of Liangshan 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:26.760
 Songjiang, their owner, said: "Please tell us a story." 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:39.460
 The hero began to say: "A long time ago, 108 green forest heroes gathered in the waters of Liangshan" 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:51.500
 Songjiang, their owner, said: "Please tell us a story." 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.220
 The hero began to say: "A long time ago" 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.900
 Like this, this story has been connected end to end. 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.600
 Every computer scientist knows the difference between recursion and iteration 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.660
 Recursion is a function layer to solve itself 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.060
 And iteration is to repeat the same process but enter different variables 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.800
 Child, I have to be a challenge because my Chinese is not very good. 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.080
 I can hardly speak Chinese, but I want to try to tell this story in two languages. 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.040
 I will use English and Chinese. 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.600
 In addition, I don’t need such a round satin to tell a story. 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.740
 I want to try if I can bring it with Mobius. 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.300
 This is the version of Liangshan with Mobius 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.680
 There may be many mistakes, I apologize in advance 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.800
 This is a recursive story with no ending, but I will iterate in two languages. 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.800
 If I speak five languages, then I will use five languages, but now I will try it in two languages. 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.480
 A long time ago, 108 green forest heroes gathered in the waters of Liangshan 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:21.900
 Songjiang, their owner, said: "Please tell us a story, use Chinese." 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.880
 The hero begins to say 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:41.480
 "A long time ago, the green forest heroes will gather in the Liangshan of the waters" 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.960
 Their village leader Song Jiang commanded 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.940
 Please give... please tell us a story. 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.860
 The hero begins to say 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.380
 use English 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.440
 A long time ago, 108 green forest heroes gathered in the waters of Liangshan 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.560
 This is a Mobius strip 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.360
 You said, "A strange story." 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.800
 However, all Chinese people know this famous story. 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.560
 108 ancient green forests in ancient China, the uprising against the corrupt court 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:33.700
 This "Water Margin" is about these wonderful people. 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.440
 Wonderful uprising 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.200
 Every character 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.400
 Some chapters are about these people. 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.300
 Children, you definitely don’t want to meet them on the street. 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:56.120
 These people are holding an axe or a big knife one by one. 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.860
 They are all insurgents 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.980
 Under the leadership of the Songjiang River, the leader of the village, against the court 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.860
 Song Jiang was also forced by the court to Liangshan 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.420
 I am going back to my hot cocoa now. 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.940
 I want to be a math fan 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.040
 You should know the Drost effect 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:25.380
 I think a person who understands mathematics, you should also know Droste hot cocoa. 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:35.720
 On the box, a waitress holds a plate 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.460
 On the plate is still a box of Drose hot cocoa, the image on the box is still her 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:52.000
 This is a box of recursive images. In fact, the recursion in an advertisement like this is called the Drost effect. 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.940
 I want to apologize to my native English audience for my bad Chinese. 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.400
 My Chinese is not very good 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.800
 Yeah, I forgot, I almost forgot Chinese. 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:17.940
 Because 40 years ago, I studied Chinese. 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:29.680
 Also teaches astronomy, at the Purple Mountain Observatory of Nanjing University. 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.060
 In the south of China, Jiangsu Province 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:48.880
 But now, I almost forgot how to speak Chinese, so I apologize again. 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.620
 But every time I speak Chinese, I will still be very happy. 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.740
 Come over, look at this! 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.220
 Under my room 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.400
 There is a small forklift that will ship the Klein bottle from the warehouse... 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.760
 Pull this thing, um, please look carefully...
