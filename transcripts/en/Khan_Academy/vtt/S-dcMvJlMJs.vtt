00:00:00.255 --> 00:00:01.407
- [Voiceover] What I
wanna do in this video

00:00:01.407 --> 00:00:04.906
is a few examples that test our intuition

00:00:04.906 --> 00:00:08.091
of the derivative as a rate of change

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:10.632
or the steepness of a curve

00:00:10.632 --> 00:00:12.899
or the slope of a curve

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.169
or the slope of a tangent line of a curve

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.696
depending on how you actually
want to think about it.

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:20.279
So here it says F prime of five

00:00:21.463 --> 00:00:23.552
so this notation, prime

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:26.423
this is another way of saying
well what's the derivative

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:29.430
let's estimate the derivative
of our function at five.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.028
And when we say F prime
of five this is the slope

00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:35.778
slope of tangent line

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.256
tangent line at five

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:44.344
or you could view it as the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.750
you could view it as the rate of change

00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:52.908
of Y with respect to X

00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:57.848
which is really how we define slope

00:00:57.848 --> 00:01:00.431
respect to X of our function F.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.589
So let's think about that a little bit.

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.627
We see they put the point

00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:10.118
the point five comma F
of five right over here

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:12.684
and so if we want to estimate
the slope of the tangent line

00:01:12.684 --> 00:01:16.381
if we want to estimate the
steepness of this curve

00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:18.434
we could try to draw a line

00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:20.587
that is tangent right at that point.

00:01:20.587 --> 00:01:22.619
So let me see if I can do that.

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.862
So if I were to draw a line starting there

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:29.125
if I just wanted to make a tangent

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:31.754
it looks like it would
do something like that.

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:33.699
Right at that point that looks to be

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:35.811
about how steep that curve is

00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:38.267
now what makes this an
interesting thing in non-linear

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:40.076
is that it's constantly changing

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:43.660
the steepness it's very low
here and it gets steeper

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.492
and steeper and steeper
as we move to the right

00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:48.227
for larger and larger X values.

00:01:48.227 --> 00:01:49.852
But if we look at the point in question

00:01:49.852 --> 00:01:53.676
when X is equal to five
remember F prime of five

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:55.186
would be if you were estimating it

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:57.427
this would be the slope of this line here.

00:01:57.427 --> 00:01:59.122
And the slope of this line it looks like

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:01.925
for every time we move
one in the X direction

00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:05.483
we're moving two in the Y direction.

00:02:05.483 --> 00:02:09.650
Delta Y is equal to two when
delta X is equal to one.

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:12.038
So our change in Y

00:02:13.013 --> 00:02:14.686
with respect to X

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:16.691
at least for this tangent line here

00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:18.291
which would represent our change in Y

00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:20.844
with respect to X right at that point

00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:24.491
is going to be equal to
two over one, or two.

00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:28.515
And it's almost estimated,
but all of these are way off.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:31.534
Having a negative two derivative

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:35.701
would mean that as we increase
our X our Y is decreasing.

00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:39.267
So if our curve looks something like this

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:41.531
we would have a slope of negative two.

00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:43.814
If having slopes in this

00:02:43.814 --> 00:02:45.742
a positive of point one

00:02:45.742 --> 00:02:47.724
that would be very flat
something down here

00:02:47.724 --> 00:02:51.131
we might have a slope closer to point one.

00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:54.459
Negative point one that
might be closer on this side

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.875
now we're sloping but very close to flat.

00:02:56.875 --> 00:03:00.427
A slope of zero, that would be
right over here at the bottom

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:03.081
where right at that moment as we change X

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:05.248
Y is not increasing or decreasing

00:03:05.248 --> 00:03:07.977
the slope of the tangent line
right at that bottom point

00:03:07.977 --> 00:03:10.935
would have a slope of zero.

00:03:10.935 --> 00:03:12.815
So I feel really good about that response.

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:15.184
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:15.184 --> 00:03:18.851
So alright, so they're
telling us to compare

00:03:19.993 --> 00:03:23.451
the derivative of G at four
to the derivative of G at six

00:03:23.451 --> 00:03:25.751
and which of these is greater

00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:27.091
and like always, pause the video

00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:29.160
and see if you can figure this out.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.047
Well this is just an exercise

00:03:31.047 --> 00:03:33.155
let's see if we were to

00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:37.200
if we were to make a line
that indicates the slope there

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.608
you can do this as a tangent line

00:03:39.608 --> 00:03:41.533
let me try to do that.

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:44.953
So now that wouldn't,
that doesn't do a good job

00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:47.536
so right over here at

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:49.067
that looks like a

00:03:49.067 --> 00:03:52.003
I think I can do a better job than that

00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:54.336
no that's too shallow to see

00:03:54.336 --> 00:03:57.024
not shallow's not the
word, that's too flat.

00:03:57.024 --> 00:03:59.392
So let me try to really

00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:01.747
okay, that looks pretty good.

00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:03.536
So that line that I just drew

00:04:03.536 --> 00:04:05.715
seems to be indicative of

00:04:05.715 --> 00:04:08.194
the rate of change of Y with respect to X

00:04:08.194 --> 00:04:10.082
or the slope of that curve

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:12.715
or that line you can
view it as a tangent line

00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:15.066
so we could think about what
its slope is going to be

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:17.877
and then if we go further down over here

00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:20.544
this one is, it looks like it is

00:04:21.842 --> 00:04:24.925
steeper but in the negative direction

00:04:25.897 --> 00:04:29.746
so it looks like it is steeper for sure

00:04:29.746 --> 00:04:31.713
but it's in the negative direction.

00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:34.480
As we increase, think of it this way

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.563
as we increase X one here

00:04:37.893 --> 00:04:41.810
it looks like we are
decreasing Y by about one.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.514
So it looks like G prime of four

00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:49.426
G prime of four, the derivative
when X is equal to four

00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:52.343
is approximately, I'm estimating it

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:54.705
negative one

00:04:54.705 --> 00:04:58.295
while the derivative
here when we increase X

00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:00.511
if we increase X by

00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:02.428
if we increase X by one

00:05:03.398 --> 00:05:07.565
it looks like we're
decreasing Y by close to three

00:05:09.118 --> 00:05:10.535
so G prime of six

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.826
looks like it's closer to negative three.

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:18.348
So which one of these is larger?

00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:23.019
Well, this one is less negative

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:26.209
so it's going to be
greater than the other one

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:28.148
and you could have done this intuitively

00:05:28.148 --> 00:05:29.458
if you just look at the curve

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:31.758
this is some type of a sinusoid here

00:05:31.758 --> 00:05:35.362
you have right over here the curve is flat

00:05:35.362 --> 00:05:38.134
you have right at that moment

00:05:38.134 --> 00:05:40.194
you have no change in Y with respect to X

00:05:40.194 --> 00:05:42.443
then it starts to decrease

00:05:42.443 --> 00:05:45.058
then it decreases at an even faster rate

00:05:45.058 --> 00:05:47.226
then it decreases at a faster rate

00:05:47.226 --> 00:05:48.914
then it starts, it's still decreasing

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:52.791
but it's decreasing at
slower and slower rates

00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:55.775
decreasing at slower rates
and right at that moment

00:05:55.775 --> 00:05:59.731
you have your slope of
your tangent line is zero

00:05:59.731 --> 00:06:03.163
then it starts to increase,
increase, so on and so forth

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:05.213
and it just keeps happening
over and over again.

00:06:05.213 --> 00:06:08.868
So you can also think about
this in a more intuitive way.
