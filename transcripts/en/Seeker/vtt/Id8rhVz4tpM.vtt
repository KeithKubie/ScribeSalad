00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.310
Is it possible we should be looking for life-supporting
planets a little differently?

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.310
Maybe.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.230
And maybe that’s a good thing.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.579
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews, and one of the
most compelling things we’re doing in space

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:19.320
is looking for other Earth-like planets that
could harbour life orbiting other stars.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.930
When we look for life on exoplanets, we typically
look for Earth-like planets in Earth-like

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.720
places, that is, terrestrial planets that
orbit their star’s habitable zone, that

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.970
magic zone where water can exist as a liquid
on the surface.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.900
But new research from Cornell University says
we might want to broaden our search.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.250
For young solar systems, the habitable zone
around a host star can actually be much further

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.020
from that star than previously thought.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.120
That’s because young stars are hotter; stars
gradually cool as they age.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.420
And this is good news in the search for exoplanets
because it’s easier to detect planets slightly

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.090
farther away from their stars.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.000
And because stars can cool for up to 2.5 billion
years, it's possible that life could begin

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.740
on a planet during its star’s early life
when the star’s habitable zone is further

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.030
away because it’s much hotter.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.290
As the star cools and the habitable zone shrinks,
that life could theoretically move to the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.220
planet’s subsurface or underground oceans.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.970
So there could be life on planets well outside
a star’s current habitable zone.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.800
But there are other factors at play here,
like if a runaway greenhouse effect is triggered.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.560
This happens when a planet absorbs more energy
from its star than it can radiate back to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.720
space, which can lead to a rapid evaporation
of surface water.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.500
But that doesn’t mean the planet will be
forever lifeless.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.010
A planet could still become habitable if water
somehow arrives after the runaway phase ends,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.880
like a late heavy bombardment of water-rich
asteroids.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.900
That’s what happened to the Earth.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.540
Some of our water arrived after this early
runaway phase from a heavy bombardment of

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.540
water-rich asteroids.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.630
So when it comes to looking for life on other
planets, looking at nascent systems around

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.040
young stars might be a better way to look.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.570
It doesn’t change things immediately, but
are you guys excited at what widening our

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.070
search for life on other worlds might reveal?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.380
