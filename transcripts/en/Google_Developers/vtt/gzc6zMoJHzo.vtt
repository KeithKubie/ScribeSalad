TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.580
and this is the Developer Show
on location at Google I/O 2016,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.790
and I'm here with Noah.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.598
We're going to talk
about Project Tango.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.566
Now, there is a
Project Tango game

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.940
that people are
playing with here

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.557
in the Sandbox called "World."

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.140
Can you tell us a
little bit about it?

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.765
NOAH FALSTEIN: So
this is a game that's

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.160
being done by a new company
called [? Phenomena, ?] but

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.490
with some very old and
experienced game developers,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.620
including a designer
called Keita Takahashi.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.089
He worked on a game
called "Katamari Damacy."

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:40.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
an awesome game.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.140
NOAH FALSTEIN: Oh,
just great stuff.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.470
But very playful approach, and
he's brought that to "World."

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.060
It's a game where
you can actually

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.890
set up little things
in a virtual world that

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.500
are situated in the real world.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.420
So as you move around
with the Tango device,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.378
you can actually see them
from different angles

00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:59.700
and set them up on the real
walls and floors of your room.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.320
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now,
you were telling me

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.130
a little bit earlier
about the first steps

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.088
you take into the game.

00:01:03.088 --> 00:01:04.010
What is that like?

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.459
NOAH FALSTEIN: Sure.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.708
Well, at the beginning, one
of the things that you do,

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:08.920
for example, is you're
given a little seedling,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.760
and you can plant
that in the ground.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.800
And then perhaps on a nearby
wall, you can take a cloud,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.600
but the cloud is
actually on a spring,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.050
so you put it on the wall and
it goes boing, boing, boing.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.170
You can click on the cloud
and it starts raining,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.920
and suddenly the seed will
sprout and turn into a flower.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.920
So it's stuff everybody
understands intuitively,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.780
but then you can
play with the stuff,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.560
put the flower on top
of another flower,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.160
have them start rotating,
make them bigger or smaller.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.650
Whole thing just opens it up
as a playground for you to try.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Something I've heard

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.630
you talk about
before which I really

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.370
loved in Project
Tango is the ability

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.830
to make any space a
play space, which seems

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.955
to be evident in this game.

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:47.663
NOAH FALSTEIN: So one
of the great things

00:01:47.663 --> 00:01:50.230
is that you can use the
Tango device to actually

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.110
have it be sort of a magic
window into a virtual world

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.720
that you create or has been
created by the developer

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.219
so that as you move
it around, it's

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.385
as if you're seeing right
into this other space that

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.290
isn't even there.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.190
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.140
NOAH FALSTEIN: It's great stuff.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: One more
general question for you.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.410
What is your favorite
thing about being

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.359
a game designer and developer?

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.150
NOAH FALSTEIN: Wow.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.620
I think the best thing
about being a game designer

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.930
is that you get to make
things that you enjoy,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.432
that are fun, that please
the rest of the world.

00:02:15.432 --> 00:02:17.140
It's pretty much like
other entertainers,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.260
just a lot more nerdy than
being a rock star, for example.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.100
Thank you so much, Noah.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.974
NOAH FALSTEIN: All right,
thank you, Timothy.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.228
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Eitan, let's
talk more about Project Tango.

00:02:30.228 --> 00:02:31.530
What do you say?

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.110
EITAN MARDER
EPPSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.810
Why not?

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So there's
a handful of things

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.201
that I'd like to ask you about.

00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:37.460
First off, it's been a few
months since we've talked,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.490
and we talked a little bit
about stuff coming up at I/O

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.247
this year.

00:02:41.247 --> 00:02:42.580
What are some of the highlights?

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.621
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
Yeah, so this year at I/O,

00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:46.550
we've announced a
couple of things.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.720
So the first one is we've
made some improvements

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.000
in our meshing
APIs, and the second

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.520
is that we're announcing
that a month from now

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.770
we're going to be releasing some
improvements in area learning

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.760
APIs.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.870
And specifically,
we'll be correcting

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.130
for drift of the device as it
moves around an object that

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.360
should keep your augmented
reality content really fixed

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.930
in the world in a nice way.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.350
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And that's really

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.440
key for augmented reality.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.450
In fact, we talked to
Noah about "World,"

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.010
where it's kind of making
the real space around you

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.510
a play space by adding
virtual objects,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.160
and something like
that drift compensation

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.410
would be really key for
keeping those virtual objects

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.200
where you place them.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.820
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Exactly.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.700
You want to lock
those objects in place

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.105
relative to the geometry of
your physical environments,

00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:30.480
and that's something
we're really

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.830
excited to be able to
provide to our developers.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.530
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.970
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What
are some of the coolest,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.160
most exciting things
that they're working on?

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.000
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
Yeah, so this year

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.416
we're really excited
because we're

00:03:39.416 --> 00:03:41.570
building real apps for
our consumer launch,

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.270
and we're showing some of
them in our booth today.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.480
So we've got "Measurements,"
which I really like.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.080
So you can use your Tango device
as a tape measure, measure

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.520
from the floor to the ceiling
or in hard-to-reach places,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.370
measure things like areas
and volumes very easily.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.420
Then we've got at-home
retail, so we've

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.290
got companies like
Lowe's and Wayfair

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.650
who are trying to place
furniture and kitchen

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.570
appliances into your home, let
you visualize how they look,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.020
see how it fits in your
space-- make sure that you're

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.910
good to go before
you buy online,

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.980
and sort of reduce
the number of returns

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.830
and give people a better
sense of interior decoration.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.940
And then we've got gaming.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.290
So we've got "World"
by Phenomena,

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.870
we've got [? Trixy ?] Studios
with their [? "Phantageist" ?]

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.580
game.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.030
And it's really exciting
to see people brought

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.005
into their environment,
engage with their environment,

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:29.880
but also with, like,
virtual creatures thrown

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.713
in for good measure.

00:04:30.713 --> 00:04:32.215
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's so cool.
