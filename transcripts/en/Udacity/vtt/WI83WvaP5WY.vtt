00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's say of the 40 people in the hospital,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
36 were actually sick and passed away,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and some were healthy, 4 of them,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and they all survived.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's further assume, for the people at home,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
40 were indeed sick,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and 20 of them passed away,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
whereas the remaining 7,960,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
they were healthy,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
also inquired a total death of 20,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
perhaps because of accidents.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
These statistics are consistent with

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the statistics I gave you before.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We just added another variable,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
whether the person's sick or healthy.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Please now fill out once again,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in percent,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
what is the percentage of people that passed away

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.999
in each of of those 4 groups?
