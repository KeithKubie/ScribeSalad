00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.870
Scientists have thought for a while now that
there may be water trapped within the earth’s

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.870
mantle.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.400
Yeah, a secret ocean--underneath our oceans--inside
the earth!

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.700
This would change our common understanding
of what the earth looks like on the inside.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.820
Now, there’s new evidence that provides
even more support for this idea, and has geoscientists

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.610
of all kinds wondering how Earth’s hidden
oceans could have formed.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.789
And get this--the new evidence...it’s diamonds.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.130
Back in 2014, scientists discovered diamonds
that contain water-bearing minerals.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.010
These diamonds were brought up into human
range from deep within the earth’s transition

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.640
zone, around 400 miles below the earth’s
surface, so this was pretty remarkable.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.129
How did water get trapped in something that
far down?

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.230
Well, when we’re talking about water here,
we’re not talking about the liquid water

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.800
we’re familiar with.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.039
They’re actually the different elements
that make UP water--hydrogen and oxygen--bound

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.570
into the crystalline structure of a solid
mineral, which is where we get water-bearing

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.570
minerals.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.890
See, the earth’s mantle moves by convection,
meaning hot magma rises and pushes other parts

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.540
of the mantle down further into the earth.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.080
When these water-bearing minerals get pushed
down because of this convection activity,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.450
the increased pressure literally wrings the
water out of them--this time, as water we

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.950
would probably recognize.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.340
The initial conjecture that there might be
some water deep within the earth was confirmed

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.750
by the 2014 diamond discovery, and then backed
up with seismic data.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.500
The seismic readings were consistent with
the idea that there was water in the mantle,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.189
and it contributes to the mantle’s behavior.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.689
More recently?

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.409
Even more diamonds!

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.620
These new jewels pulled from the earth’s
depths actually do contain water...but in

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.130
a TOTALLY new form that we’ve never observed
before.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.860
These diamonds, from several locations across
southern Africa and China, contain tiny inclusions

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.979
of a form of water called ice-VII, an extremely
high pressure form of water that scientists

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.479
refer to as water-ice . This is the first
time we’ve ever actually observed this form

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.259
of water in nature.

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.760
The researchers say these new diamonds support
the presence of, at least what they’re calling,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.590
‘aqueous pockets’ of water throughout
the mantle.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.131
So not only is there water DEFINITELY inside
the earth, but also, it may be in a totally

00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:11.131
novel form of water.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.790
Who knew water came in different forms?!?

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.270
I feel like that leads us to two important
questions: 1.)

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.670
“So what?” and 2.)

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.069
“How did it get there?”

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.200
Well, one answer kind of addresses both.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.010
The main theory for how we have water on earth
at all is that it got brought to us by rogue

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.680
asteroids containing water-bearing minerals
crashing into us from the far-reaches of our

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.209
solar system.

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.849
The theory goes that when the earth was forming,
our solar system was probably too hot for

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.120
any water molecules to survive and cling to
the space dust that would become the earth,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.810
so water had to have been brought to us from
off-planet after the earth formed.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.340
But these new diamonds could upend that.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.340
Some scientists now estimate that the mantle
might contain more water than all the earth’s

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.459
oceans combined, which is way more water than
could have been pulled, via convection, from

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.830
the surface of the earth into the mantle in
the given time frame.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.940
We may need to re-examine our theories about
the state of the solar system at the time

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.630
the earth was forming--maybe it was possible
for water to survive and cling to dust and

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.740
rock as it coalesced to form the earth.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.530
Maybe there’s an entirely different theory
that we haven’t thought of yet!

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.810
We’re still unsure of the exact amount of
water in the mantle though, or what form it

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.810
might be in.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.980
Scientists plan to keep exploring, though,
both with seismic measurements and lab experiments

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.739
that try to simulate the materials and pressures
that we would find inside the earth.

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.440
And, of course, keep looking for and examining
diamonds--not the kind you want to put in

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.970
a ring, but of course the kind that contain
hydrous minerals.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.570
A girl’s true best friend.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.739
Fun fact: the materials that primarily make
up the earth’s mantle are called Wadsleyite

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.440
and Ringwoodite, both water-bearing minerals
whose structure leaves them prone to gapping,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.280
letting researchers think of them a bit like
a sponge that’s holding the mantle’s water.
