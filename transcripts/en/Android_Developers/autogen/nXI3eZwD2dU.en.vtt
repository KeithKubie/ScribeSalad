pinal in Venezuela who says we are
developing an application we need to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
developing an application we need to
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.849
developing an application we need to
block our clients outgoing SMS while

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
block our clients outgoing SMS while
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.979

driving we got the accelerometer working

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
driving we got the accelerometer working
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.920
driving we got the accelerometer working
but not blocking about going SMS is it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
but not blocking about going SMS is it
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.450
but not blocking about going SMS is it
possible is there a hint you could point

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
possible is there a hint you could point
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.440
possible is there a hint you could point
to us thanks so to my knowledge I don't

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
to us thanks so to my knowledge I don't
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.520
to us thanks so to my knowledge I don't
think there's actually a way to do this

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
think there's actually a way to do this
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.620
think there's actually a way to do this
for the same reason you can't block

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
for the same reason you can't block
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260
for the same reason you can't block
outgoing calls we don't really want

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
outgoing calls we don't really want
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.670
outgoing calls we don't really want
people to go and try and you write a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
people to go and try and you write a
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.080
people to go and try and you write a
malicious app that keeps people from

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
malicious app that keeps people from
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.260
malicious app that keeps people from
calling people it's generally found upon

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
calling people it's generally found upon
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.149
calling people it's generally found upon
so that's one of those things that you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
so that's one of those things that you
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.770
so that's one of those things that you
don't have much flexibility you now you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
don't have much flexibility you now you
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.690
don't have much flexibility you now you
can set up apps that will go and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
can set up apps that will go and
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.740
can set up apps that will go and
intercept you know the send text message

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
intercept you know the send text message
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.590
intercept you know the send text message
intent and give the user the option to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
intent and give the user the option to
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.410
intent and give the user the option to
bring your up to the foreground but you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
bring your up to the foreground but you
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.520
bring your up to the foreground but you
can't go and prevent somebody from

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
can't go and prevent somebody from
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.190
can't go and prevent somebody from
saying a text gotcha so we can't pump

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
saying a text gotcha so we can't pump
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.499
saying a text gotcha so we can't pump
block it but perhaps approach you can

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
block it but perhaps approach you can
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.219
block it but perhaps approach you can
take is is too strongly suggest to users

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
take is is too strongly suggest to users
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.929
take is is too strongly suggest to users
who are doing it not to so yeah if you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
who are doing it not to so yeah if you
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.429
who are doing it not to so yeah if you
have your own app come up with an option

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
have your own app come up with an option
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.080
have your own app come up with an option
and then suggest that they use that as a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
and then suggest that they use that as a
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.850
and then suggest that they use that as a
default then I guess that's this one way

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
default then I guess that's this one way
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.740
default then I guess that's this one way
of sort of doing it but there's there's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
of sort of doing it but there's there's
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.340
of sort of doing it but there's there's
no real way of stopping them at all

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350
no real way of stopping them at all
 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.429
no real way of stopping them at all
unfortunately huh okay cool yeah I mean

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
unfortunately huh okay cool yeah I mean
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.620
unfortunately huh okay cool yeah I mean
there are some apps out there which do

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
there are some apps out there which do
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.320
there are some apps out there which do
go and provide child lock functionality

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
go and provide child lock functionality
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.630
go and provide child lock functionality
by doing some Turks that we can't really

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640
by doing some Turks that we can't really
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.010
by doing some Turks that we can't really
recommend will go and look through the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020
recommend will go and look through the
 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.700
recommend will go and look through the
list of running out

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710
list of running out
 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.750
list of running out
so when they see other apps in the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760
so when they see other apps in the
 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.280
so when they see other apps in the
foreground will go and put their app on

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
foreground will go and put their app on
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.940
foreground will go and put their app on
top of theirs not again nothing we

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950
top of theirs not again nothing we
 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.650
top of theirs not again nothing we
generally recommend so there might be

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
generally recommend so there might be
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.420
generally recommend so there might be
some work around if you really want to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430
some work around if you really want to
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.490
some work around if you really want to
do this but nothing that can actually

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500
do this but nothing that can actually
 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.130
do this but nothing that can actually
give you as a best practice mad and Chet

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140
give you as a best practice mad and Chet
 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.560
give you as a best practice mad and Chet
actually asks if airplane mode is an

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570
actually asks if airplane mode is an
 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.180
actually asks if airplane mode is an
option it's an interesting idea but I

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190
option it's an interesting idea but I
 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.770
option it's an interesting idea but I
don't believe you can programmatically

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
don't believe you can programmatically
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.960
don't believe you can programmatically
set airplane mode yeah that's right I

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
set airplane mode yeah that's right I
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.060
set airplane mode yeah that's right I
think ultimately you down to the if

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070
think ultimately you down to the if
 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.860
think ultimately you down to the if
someone wants to send a text message

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870
someone wants to send a text message
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.300
someone wants to send a text message
when they're driving even though that's

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
when they're driving even though that's
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.330
when they're driving even though that's
clearly a very bad idea the only thing

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340
clearly a very bad idea the only thing
 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.950
clearly a very bad idea the only thing
you can do as a third party programmer

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960
you can do as a third party programmer
 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.530
you can do as a third party programmer
to prevent that from happening without

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
to prevent that from happening without
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.720
to prevent that from happening without
citing to do things which has travis's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
citing to do things which has travis's
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.780
citing to do things which has travis's
are probably not the best approach so

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790
are probably not the best approach so
 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.370
are probably not the best approach so
some sort of warning message or

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380
some sort of warning message or
 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.690
some sort of warning message or
something like that which tells people

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700
something like that which tells people
 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.820
something like that which tells people
hey you shouldn't be doing this it's

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830
hey you shouldn't be doing this it's
 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.940
hey you shouldn't be doing this it's
probably your best option at this point

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950
probably your best option at this point
 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.320
probably your best option at this point

downloading from our own servers that
 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.600
downloading from our own servers that
it's just using sockets so not using

it's just using sockets so not using
 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.450
it's just using sockets so not using
HTTP so we rolled our own on everything

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460
HTTP so we rolled our own on everything
 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.820

manager so we download just fine the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280
manager so we download just fine the
 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.820
manager so we download just fine the
issue that we're having is if for some

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830
issue that we're having is if for some
 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.510
issue that we're having is if for some
reason they don't finish the download we

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520
reason they don't finish the download we
 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.010
reason they don't finish the download we
would like to inspect the download

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020
would like to inspect the download
 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.050
would like to inspect the download
manager when the app starts the next

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060
manager when the app starts the next
 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.440

time to finish the download so I'm

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450
time to finish the download so I'm
 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.200
time to finish the download so I'm
wondering is it possible with HTTP

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210
wondering is it possible with HTTP
 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.150
wondering is it possible with HTTP
headers in a range to tell download

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160
headers in a range to tell download
 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.350
headers in a range to tell download
manager to start at some byte offset to

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360
manager to start at some byte offset to
 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.790
manager to start at some byte offset to
finish some download that had started

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800

previously okay actually I think your

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320
previously okay actually I think your
 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.900
previously okay actually I think your
question is a little bit further down on

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910
question is a little bit further down on
 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.040
question is a little bit further down on
the question list but I said yeah so

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050
the question list but I said yeah so
 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.300
the question list but I said yeah so
we'll probably get to that a minute but

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310
we'll probably get to that a minute but
 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.710
we'll probably get to that a minute but
since you're there right now we can

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720
since you're there right now we can
 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.650
since you're there right now we can
actually just answer it right here so to

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660
actually just answer it right here so to
 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.180
actually just answer it right here so to

my knowledge the way download manager
 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.940
my knowledge the way download manager
works it should automatically resume the

add to the action bar which did much the

00:15:24.449 --> 00:15:24.459
add to the action bar which did much the
 

00:15:24.459 --> 00:15:27.150

you should check this isn't honeycomb

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:40.270
you should check this isn't honeycomb

gallery we should add it a share button

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:42.730
gallery we should add it a share button
 

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.810
gallery we should add it a share button
of some sort oh yeah probably should

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:45.820
of some sort oh yeah probably should
 

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.360
of some sort oh yeah probably should
probably share action provider but we

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:48.370
probably share action provider but we
 

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.620
probably share action provider but we
should probably change the name because

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:49.630
should probably change the name because
 

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.300
should probably change the name because

rapidgator fragment gallery or we could

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:55.570
rapidgator fragment gallery or we could
 

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.470

call it pretty Google picture gallery

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480
call it pretty Google picture gallery
 

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.030

that's much better than Google picture

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040
that's much better than Google picture
 

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.620
that's much better than Google picture
gallery yes rolls right off the tongue

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:03.630
 

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.730
all right let's say we've got a question

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:05.740
all right let's say we've got a question
 

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.810
all right let's say we've got a question
from a Gregory cook on the stream and he

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:09.820
from a Gregory cook on the stream and he
 

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.210
from a Gregory cook on the stream and he
asks why are fragments hosted in frame

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:12.220
asks why are fragments hosted in frame
 

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.940
asks why are fragments hosted in frame
layouts related ken fragments be hosted

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:14.950
layouts related ken fragments be hosted
 

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.980
layouts related ken fragments be hosted
in other layouts why do samples declare

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:16.990
in other layouts why do samples declare
 

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.960
in other layouts why do samples declare

classes and well okay so there's three

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:21.250
classes and well okay so there's three
 

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.650
classes and well okay so there's three
questions let's focus on the first wire

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:22.660
questions let's focus on the first wire
 

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.730
questions let's focus on the first wire
fragments host

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:23.740
fragments host
 

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.560
fragments host
in frame layout and can they be hosted

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:25.570
in frame layout and can they be hosted
 

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.960
in frame layout and can they be hosted
in other layouts so the answer to both

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:27.970
in other layouts so the answer to both
 

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.060
in other layouts so the answer to both
of those questions is they don't have to

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.070
of those questions is they don't have to
 

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.160
of those questions is they don't have to
be friendly as it can be in any layout

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.170
be friendly as it can be in any layout
 

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.650
be friendly as it can be in any layout
that you like friendly I've just happens

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:34.660
that you like friendly I've just happens
 

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.970
that you like friendly I've just happens
to be convenient because of the way

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:35.980
to be convenient because of the way
 

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.130
to be convenient because of the way
fragments are usually used but yeah if

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:38.140
fragments are usually used but yeah if
 

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.800
fragments are usually used but yeah if
you want to go and leave them at some

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:40.810
you want to go and leave them at some
 

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.540
you want to go and leave them at some
other way I feel for you it'll work just

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:42.550
other way I feel for you it'll work just
 

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.810
other way I feel for you it'll work just
fine absolutely yeah so generally you'll

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:45.820
fine absolutely yeah so generally you'll
 

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.400
fine absolutely yeah so generally you'll
see friend layout used in a lot of

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:47.410
see friend layout used in a lot of
 

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.650
see friend layout used in a lot of
sample code because it's the easiest way

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:49.660
sample code because it's the easiest way
 

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.660
sample code because it's the easiest way
to put it in something like that here

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:51.670
to put it in something like that here
 

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.310
to put it in something like that here
why don't you serve a linear layout too

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:53.320
why don't you serve a linear layout too
 

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.560
why don't you serve a linear layout too
at the same reason because you like him

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:55.570
at the same reason because you like him
 

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.440
at the same reason because you like him
just a few fragments side-by-side nicely

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:58.450
just a few fragments side-by-side nicely
 

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.240
just a few fragments side-by-side nicely
yeah linear lad is another really common

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:00.250
yeah linear lad is another really common
 

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.670
yeah linear lad is another really common
one so yeah you should see examples of

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:02.680
one so yeah you should see examples of
 

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.000
one so yeah you should see examples of
both of this why do the samples declare

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.010
both of this why do the samples declare
 

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.980
both of this why do the samples declare
fragrances public static in classes

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:09.990
 

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.780
that's a good question I'm guessing it's

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:12.790
that's a good question I'm guessing it's
 

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.670
that's a good question I'm guessing it's
for simplicity to keep things all in one

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:14.680
for simplicity to keep things all in one
 

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.410
for simplicity to keep things all in one
of us yeah we're having things sort of

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:16.420
of us yeah we're having things sort of
 

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.180
of us yeah we're having things sort of
spread around the place but I don't

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:18.190
spread around the place but I don't
 

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.250
spread around the place but I don't
think that there's any need to do it i

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:20.260
think that there's any need to do it i
 

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.900
think that there's any need to do it i
think it's just that yeah just easy i

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:21.910
think it's just that yeah just easy i
 

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.330
think it's just that yeah just easy i
think it's just a convenience of sample

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:24.340
think it's just a convenience of sample
 

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.250
think it's just a convenience of sample
code as opposed to production code we

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:26.260
code as opposed to production code we
 

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.900
code as opposed to production code we
try to make our code easy to read and

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:27.910
try to make our code easy to read and
 

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.080
try to make our code easy to read and
digest but we're not always optimizing

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:31.090
digest but we're not always optimizing
 

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.670

for something that should be copy pasted
 

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.470
for something that should be copy pasted
into production yeah and it's a really

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480
into production yeah and it's a really
 

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.910
into production yeah and it's a really
good point with sample code a lot of the

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:35.920
good point with sample code a lot of the
 

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.190
good point with sample code a lot of the
time there's a big priority is to try

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.200

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340
two updates together and then it just
 

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.450
two updates together and then it just
pushes the newest one on the degree if

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460
pushes the newest one on the degree if
 

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.310
pushes the newest one on the degree if
you see what I mean because if like you

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320
you see what I mean because if like you
 

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.500
you see what I mean because if like you
place too gooey things over each other

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:15.510
place too gooey things over each other
 

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.710
place too gooey things over each other
it only shows that

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720
it only shows that
 

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.789
it only shows that
just one if it updates the way yeah that

00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799
just one if it updates the way yeah that
 

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:23.370
just one if it updates the way yeah that
seems reasonable but again that would

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:23.380
seems reasonable but again that would
 

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.770
seems reasonable but again that would
then only work if you did the update

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:25.780
then only work if you did the update
 

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.870
then only work if you did the update
more frequently than one per second so

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880
more frequently than one per second so
 

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.520
more frequently than one per second so
if you had if you made it point nine

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:29.530
if you had if you made it point nine
 

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.440
if you had if you made it point nine
nine nine nine nine instead of one and

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:31.450
nine nine nine nine instead of one and
 

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.240
nine nine nine nine instead of one and
then that works then I would buy it but

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:33.250
then that works then I would buy it but
 

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.649
then that works then I would buy it but
if you're making it one point zero zero

00:25:34.649 --> 00:25:34.659
if you're making it one point zero zero
 

00:25:34.659 --> 00:25:36.600
if you're making it one point zero zero
one and that makes it work and that

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:36.610
one and that makes it work and that
 

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.539
one and that makes it work and that
would seem to be counter so it

00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:39.549
would seem to be counter so it
 

00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:41.760
would seem to be counter so it
definitely seemed something buggy so

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:41.770
definitely seemed something buggy so
 

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.250
definitely seemed something buggy so
first a bug on bags Tokyo yeah

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:44.260
first a bug on bags Tokyo yeah
 

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.500
first a bug on bags Tokyo yeah
definitely will keep track of that one

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:46.510
definitely will keep track of that one
 

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.169
definitely will keep track of that one
as well that seems very strange you

00:25:49.169 --> 00:25:49.179
as well that seems very strange you
 

00:25:49.179 --> 00:25:51.529
as well that seems very strange you
seeing that across multiple devices a

00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539
seeing that across multiple devices a
 

00:25:51.539 --> 00:25:53.909
seeing that across multiple devices a
just on their the devices the day of

00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919
just on their the devices the day of
 

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:56.130
just on their the devices the day of
which is which are the galaxy s2 on the

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:56.140
which is which are the galaxy s2 on the
 

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.380
which is which are the galaxy s2 on the
Galaxy Nexus right that's two devices

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:58.390
Galaxy Nexus right that's two devices
 

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.000
Galaxy Nexus right that's two devices
that's that's enough to suggest that

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.010
that's that's enough to suggest that
 

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.039
that's that's enough to suggest that
it's not hardware-specific yeah

00:26:02.039 --> 00:26:02.049
it's not hardware-specific yeah
 

00:26:02.049 --> 00:26:03.510
it's not hardware-specific yeah
definitely post a bug and we'll keep

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520
definitely post a bug and we'll keep
 

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.029
definitely post a bug and we'll keep
track of that one as well okay thank you

00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039
track of that one as well okay thank you
 

00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:09.690
track of that one as well okay thank you
yes Matthew you are up next as the chat

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:09.700
yes Matthew you are up next as the chat
 

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.810
yes Matthew you are up next as the chat
window says yes or I had a question I've

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:12.820
window says yes or I had a question I've
 

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.940
window says yes or I had a question I've
been looking at the source code for the

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:14.950
been looking at the source code for the
 

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:18.440
been looking at the source code for the
honeycomb calendar app lately and so

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:18.450
honeycomb calendar app lately and so
 

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:22.560
honeycomb calendar app lately and so
I've noticed that so calendar contract

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:22.570
I've noticed that so calendar contract
 

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.529
I've noticed that so calendar contract
was introduced in four point oh right

00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539
was introduced in four point oh right
 

00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:27.299
was introduced in four point oh right
and then I noticed in the honeycomb

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:27.309
and then I noticed in the honeycomb
 

00:26:27.309 --> 00:26:29.490
and then I noticed in the honeycomb
calendar app that they're using almost a

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:29.500
calendar app that they're using almost a
 

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.850
calendar app that they're using almost a
very similar class called calendar just

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:32.860
very similar class called calendar just
 

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.590
very similar class called calendar just
has a different name but has all the

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600
has a different name but has all the
 

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.200
has a different name but has all the
exact same constants and whatnot I was

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:37.210
exact same constants and whatnot I was
 

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:41.340
exact same constants and whatnot I was
wondering is it possible to use the

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:41.350
wondering is it possible to use the
 

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.690
wondering is it possible to use the
constants from four-point-oh to use the

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:45.700
constants from four-point-oh to use the
 

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.000
constants from four-point-oh to use the
honey oh sorry the calendar API in

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.010
honey oh sorry the calendar API in
 

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.669
honey oh sorry the calendar API in
honeycomb I think that depends on

00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679
honeycomb I think that depends on
 

00:26:50.679 --> 00:26:51.810
honeycomb I think that depends on
whether or not we did our job properly

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:51.820
whether or not we did our job properly
 

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.350
whether or not we did our job properly
and if we did that class to be marked is

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360
and if we did that class to be marked is
 

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.390
and if we did that class to be marked is
not exported or that contemporary I

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:57.400
not exported or that contemporary I
 

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.250
not exported or that contemporary I
should be not exported in which case

00:26:59.250 --> 00:26:59.260
should be not exported in which case
 

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.770
should be not exported in which case
answer is now I mean you can firmly

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:01.780
answer is now I mean you can firmly
 

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.620
answer is now I mean you can firmly
welcome to try it at this point you know

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:04.630
welcome to try it at this point you know
 

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.890
welcome to try it at this point you know
there is a public API in 40 and 30 isn't

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:07.900
there is a public API in 40 and 30 isn't
 

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.130
there is a public API in 40 and 30 isn't
changing so if you can get it to work

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140
changing so if you can get it to work
 

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.110
changing so if you can get it to work
cool of course we can't really recommend

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120
cool of course we can't really recommend
 

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.149
cool of course we can't really recommend
that you use private api is if it is if

00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159
that you use private api is if it is if
 

00:27:15.159 --> 00:27:17.789
that you use private api is if it is if
it is accessible I mean you usually a

00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799
it is accessible I mean you usually a
 

00:27:17.799 --> 00:27:20.669
it is accessible I mean you usually a
lot of the way our api's walk is we go

00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679
lot of the way our api's walk is we go
 

00:27:20.679 --> 00:27:22.230
lot of the way our api's walk is we go
and test them internally as a private

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240
and test them internally as a private
 

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.299
and test them internally as a private
api and then we're happy that things

00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:24.309
api and then we're happy that things
 

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:27.270
api and then we're happy that things
look proper we'll go and you know do the

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:27.280
look proper we'll go and you know do the
 

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.380
look proper we'll go and you know do the
extra work to go and turn it into a

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:28.390
extra work to go and turn it into a
 

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:29.940
extra work to go and turn it into a
public api that gives it's time to go

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:29.950
public api that gives it's time to go
 

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:30.540
public api that gives it's time to go
and

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:30.550
and
 

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.980
and
experiment and see what works what

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:31.990
experiment and see what works what
 

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.020
experiment and see what works what
doesn't once you go and make something a

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:34.030
doesn't once you go and make something a
 

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:37.050
doesn't once you go and make something a
public API it's locked down so there is

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.060
public API it's locked down so there is
 

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.430
public API it's locked down so there is
a good chance those classes are almost

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440
a good chance those classes are almost
 

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.870
a good chance those classes are almost
identical I think the big question here

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880
identical I think the big question here
 

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.340
identical I think the big question here
is whether we've actually gone and set

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:41.350
is whether we've actually gone and set
 

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:45.510
is whether we've actually gone and set
them up as you said be surprised if they

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520
them up as you said be surprised if they
 

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.070
them up as you said be surprised if they
were it's as you say it's generally the

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080
were it's as you say it's generally the
 

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.050
were it's as you say it's generally the
case that will you'll see snippets of

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:52.060
case that will you'll see snippets of
 

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.790
case that will you'll see snippets of
things which later become public API is

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:53.800
things which later become public API is
 

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.550
things which later become public API is
in earlier releases but yeah it's

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:56.560
in earlier releases but yeah it's
 

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.750
in earlier releases but yeah it's
generally a case that you can't actually

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760
generally a case that you can't actually
 

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.280
generally a case that you can't actually
do anything with them till those later

00:27:59.280 --> 00:27:59.290
do anything with them till those later
 

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.550
do anything with them till those later
releases okay cool that sounds good

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:02.560
releases okay cool that sounds good
 

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.850
releases okay cool that sounds good
Thank You rose let's have a look let's

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:05.860
Thank You rose let's have a look let's
 

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.120
Thank You rose let's have a look let's
go to moderator queue why is there a

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.130
go to moderator queue why is there a
 

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:12.240
go to moderator queue why is there a
noticeable latency in Android Audio how

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:12.250
noticeable latency in Android Audio how
 

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.040
noticeable latency in Android Audio how
can we avoid this in real time

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.050
can we avoid this in real time
 

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:18.600
can we avoid this in real time
applications ie audio video chat so the

answers to why is a very complicated

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:20.500
answers to why is a very complicated
 

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.710
answers to why is a very complicated
question probably we need your

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720
question probably we need your
 

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.150
question probably we need your
oscilloscope I think we need in a

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:24.160
oscilloscope I think we need in a
 

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.940
oscilloscope I think we need in a
skilled source code plan to that yea

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:25.950
skilled source code plan to that yea
 

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:29.390
skilled source code plan to that yea
orsa me from the media team that'll work

things like Layton's quite a bit as far

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:40.420
things like Layton's quite a bit as far
 

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.190
things like Layton's quite a bit as far
as how to go and avoid the crank latency

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200
as how to go and avoid the crank latency
 

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.430
as how to go and avoid the crank latency
in real time application there's really

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440
in real time application there's really
 

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.320
in real time application there's really

it it's you know it is low level access
so it does require additional work but

00:30:18.499 --> 00:30:18.509
so it does require additional work but
 

00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:20.709
so it does require additional work but
if you really need real-time performance

shortest one there part of the reason we

00:30:56.959 --> 00:30:56.969
shortest one there part of the reason we
 

00:30:56.969 --> 00:30:59.299
shortest one there part of the reason we
do that is because system goes and we'll

00:30:59.299 --> 00:30:59.309
do that is because system goes and we'll

thank you for the feedback okay where

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:16.370
thank you for the feedback okay where
 

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.410
thank you for the feedback okay where
were we yes you were discussing the fact

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:20.420
were we yes you were discussing the fact
 

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.410
were we yes you were discussing the fact
this so I'm thinking less than 15

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:23.420
this so I'm thinking less than 15
 

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.500
this so I'm thinking less than 15
minutes yes alarms right thank you yeah

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:26.510
minutes yes alarms right thank you yeah
 

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.240
minutes yes alarms right thank you yeah
so basically this a short version is

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:28.250
so basically this a short version is
 

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.560
so basically this a short version is
that the reason why you get power

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:29.570
that the reason why you get power
 

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:30.850
that the reason why you get power
savings there is because it's going to

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:30.860
savings there is because it's going to
 

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.710
savings there is because it's going to
cool us in these events and this you go

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720
cool us in these events and this you go
 

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.880
cool us in these events and this you go
and make this time interval short

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:33.890
and make this time interval short
 

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.220
and make this time interval short

battery life so i don't use any way to

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:41.210
battery life so i don't use any way to
 

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.400
battery life so i don't use any way to
do it yeah once you're talking about

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:42.410
do it yeah once you're talking about

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.170
updating it around that frequency you
 

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:01.740
updating it around that frequency you
might be able to use things like

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:01.750
might be able to use things like
 

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.870

have alarm so she'll update that
 

00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:14.000
have alarm so she'll update that
frequently but at least that way you're

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.010
frequently but at least that way you're

mode by force you can this app does it

00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599
mode by force you can this app does it
 

00:34:48.599 --> 00:34:52.040

well but uh whenever you come out of it

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.050
well but uh whenever you come out of it
 

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:56.450
well but uh whenever you come out of it
it just it says it's off of it but um it

00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:56.460
it just it says it's off of it but um it
 

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.730
it just it says it's off of it but um it
actually doesn't show any service so i'm

00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740
actually doesn't show any service so i'm
 

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.980
actually doesn't show any service so i'm
not sure if that's a problem with the

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:00.990
not sure if that's a problem with the
 

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.980
not sure if that's a problem with the
programming or whatever ok that's

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:03.990
programming or whatever ok that's
 

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.680
programming or whatever ok that's
interesting oh yeah i would suggest that

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:06.690
interesting oh yeah i would suggest that
 

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.089
interesting oh yeah i would suggest that

calling a private api probably and
that's probably why they can't

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:17.220
that's probably why they can't
 

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.680
that's probably why they can't
effectively doesn't sound like they can

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:18.690
effectively doesn't sound like they can
 

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.780

so right what once you manually turn it
off airplane mode everything works fine

00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:31.859
off airplane mode everything works fine
 

00:35:31.859 --> 00:35:36.050
off airplane mode everything works fine
now right right they found a work one

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:04.530
time machine for consider being able to
 

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.760
time machine for consider being able to
answer and effectively but there is a

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:07.770
answer and effectively but there is a
 

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.069
answer and effectively but there is a
developer relations team around google

00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079
developer relations team around google
 

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:12.020
developer relations team around google
drive and they may have some insight

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:12.030
drive and they may have some insight
 

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.710
drive and they may have some insight
into

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720
into
 

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.410
into
features which the app has or may have

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:15.420
features which the app has or may have
 

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.330
features which the app has or may have
in the future but chances are they're

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:17.340
in the future but chances are they're
 

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.640
in the future but chances are they're
not going to be to be willing to tell

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:19.650
not going to be to be willing to tell
 

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.010
not going to be to be willing to tell
you what's gonna work that my question

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.020
you what's gonna work that my question
 

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.110
you what's gonna work that my question
all right thank you very much look at my

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:24.120
all right thank you very much look at my
 

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.660
all right thank you very much look at my
key feature it really does oh I'll put

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:26.670
key feature it really does oh I'll put
 

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.000
key feature it really does oh I'll put
in a feature request for that yeah what

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.010
in a feature request for that yeah what
 

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.130
in a feature request for that yeah what
exactly does that do instant upload so

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140
exactly does that do instant upload so
 

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.290
exactly does that do instant upload so
you drop a file into the folder like the

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300
you drop a file into the folder like the
 

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.700
you drop a file into the folder like the
way the dropbox were actually drop the

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:34.710
way the dropbox were actually drop the
 

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.930
way the dropbox were actually drop the
file and folder and then they would just

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940
file and folder and then they would just
 

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.770
file and folder and then they would just
appear on Google Drive okay gotcha but

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780
appear on Google Drive okay gotcha but
 

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.690
appear on Google Drive okay gotcha but
yeah I think you already have it for

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:41.700
yeah I think you already have it for
 

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.330
yeah I think you already have it for
Google+ but I think a lot of users I've

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:44.340
Google+ but I think a lot of users I've
 

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.620
Google+ but I think a lot of users I've
heard want to have that available for

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:47.630
heard want to have that available for
 

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.850
heard want to have that available for
Google Drive I feel like they feel like

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:49.860
Google Drive I feel like they feel like
 

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.890
Google Drive I feel like they feel like
there's redundancy how there's an

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900
there's redundancy how there's an
 

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.840
there's redundancy how there's an
instant upload folder that's not also

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:53.850
instant upload folder that's not also
 

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.450
instant upload folder that's not also
present in Google Drive and also they

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460
present in Google Drive and also they
 

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.400
present in Google Drive and also they
feel as though that there's not a music

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:58.410
feel as though that there's not a music
 

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.320
feel as though that there's not a music
folder in Google Drive that connects

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:00.330
folder in Google Drive that connects
 

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:01.760
folder in Google Drive that connects
with google music so I think they're

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:01.770
with google music so I think they're
 

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:03.470
with google music so I think they're
kind of trying to integrate it off let

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480
kind of trying to integrate it off let
 

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.210
kind of trying to integrate it off let
me go interesting but there are three

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220
me go interesting but there are three
 

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.670
me go interesting but there are three
claudia i like the idea integrate a

little bit different functionality

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:08.940
little bit different functionality
 

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.420
little bit different functionality
together yeah all the clouds is all

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:11.430
together yeah all the clouds is all
 

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.130
together yeah all the clouds is all
together in one place i think the only

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140
together in one place i think the only
 

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.170
together in one place i think the only

is that google music does not organize
 

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.880
is that google music does not organize

adoption rates for the newest version of
 

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.090
adoption rates for the newest version of
the software so they always start off

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:17.100
the software so they always start off
 

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.520
the software so they always start off
pretty slow and then ramped up really

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:19.530
pretty slow and then ramped up really
 

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.760
pretty slow and then ramped up really
really quickly so yeah I like within the

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:22.770
really quickly so yeah I like within the
 

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:25.070
really quickly so yeah I like within the

00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:37.619
processes and then suddenly they push it
 

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:39.200
processes and then suddenly they push it
out to a bunch of their existing

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:39.210
out to a bunch of their existing
 

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:41.150
out to a bunch of their existing
handsets and obviously all of their new

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160
handsets and obviously all of their new
 

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.579

honeycomb was kind of a special case in

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:45.510
honeycomb was kind of a special case in
 

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:47.660
honeycomb was kind of a special case in
that it was never developed for phone

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:47.670
that it was never developed for phone
 

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.240
that it was never developed for phone
specifically so ICS I think you're going

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:50.250
specifically so ICS I think you're going
 

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.520
specifically so ICS I think you're going
to see come out on a lot of different

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:52.530
to see come out on a lot of different
 

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.950
to see come out on a lot of different
devices phones and tablets both new and

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960
devices phones and tablets both new and
 

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.140
devices phones and tablets both new and
old we don't have any specifics but

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:57.150
old we don't have any specifics but
 

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:59.299
old we don't have any specifics but
based on on prior experience I would

00:38:59.299 --> 00:38:59.309
based on on prior experience I would
 

00:38:59.309 --> 00:39:01.190
based on on prior experience I would
expect to see that ramping up really

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200
expect to see that ramping up really
 

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.130
expect to see that ramping up really
quickly and probably quite soon based on

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140
quickly and probably quite soon based on
 

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.040
quickly and probably quite soon based on
when ICS came out i think this device

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:07.050
when ICS came out i think this device
 

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.049
when ICS came out i think this device
trevor has actually runs ICS it does

00:39:09.049 --> 00:39:09.059
trevor has actually runs ICS it does
 

00:39:09.059 --> 00:39:11.150
trevor has actually runs ICS it does
indeed i saw a little ICS icon on the

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160
indeed i saw a little ICS icon on the
 

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.450
indeed i saw a little ICS icon on the
box and this is not this is a device not

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460
box and this is not this is a device not
 

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.480
box and this is not this is a device not
uh it's not a nexus it's not a google

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:17.490
uh it's not a nexus it's not a google
 

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:19.730
uh it's not a nexus it's not a google
designed device now so it's a totally

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:19.740
designed device now so it's a totally
 

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.370
designed device now so it's a totally
third party that actually runs MIPS that

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.380
third party that actually runs MIPS that
 

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.130

I had never seen before today so yeah I

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140
I had never seen before today so yeah I
 

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.609

mean I like rato said there's a there's

00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:28.619
mean I like rato said there's a there's
 

00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:30.349
mean I like rato said there's a there's
a certain amount of latency that I think

00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359
a certain amount of latency that I think
 

00:39:30.359 --> 00:39:32.900
a certain amount of latency that I think
sometimes gets mistaken for lack of

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:32.910
sometimes gets mistaken for lack of
 

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:34.880
sometimes gets mistaken for lack of
interest from the hardware manufacturers

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:34.890
interest from the hardware manufacturers
 

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.930
interest from the hardware manufacturers
but especially because we easily we

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940
but especially because we easily we
 

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.359
but especially because we easily we
typically release a device like we

00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:41.369
typically release a device like we
 

00:39:41.369 --> 00:39:43.099
typically release a device like we
release the ICS device like I want to

00:39:43.099 --> 00:39:43.109
release the ICS device like I want to
 

00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:44.870
release the ICS device like I want to
say a month or maybe a couple weeks or

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880
say a month or maybe a couple weeks or
 

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.730
say a month or maybe a couple weeks or
something like that before we release

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:46.740
something like that before we release
 

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.490
something like that before we release
the source code and then once they get

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:49.500
the source code and then once they get
 

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.289
the source code and then once they get
the hands on the source code then you

00:39:51.289 --> 00:39:51.299
the hands on the source code then you
 

00:39:51.299 --> 00:39:52.520
the hands on the source code then you
know there's all the testing and stuff

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:52.530
know there's all the testing and stuff
 

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:55.670
know there's all the testing and stuff
that rate I described but definitely

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680
that rate I described but definitely
 

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.940
that rate I described but definitely
coming yeah yeah there's no luck with

00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:58.950
coming yeah yeah there's no luck with
 

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:00.440
coming yeah yeah there's no luck with
honeycomb that was a kind of a thing

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:00.450
honeycomb that was a kind of a thing
 

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:01.849
honeycomb that was a kind of a thing
it's like me we knew it wasn't going to

00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:01.859
it's like me we knew it wasn't going to
 

00:40:01.859 --> 00:40:03.200
it's like me we knew it wasn't going to
be on phones we knew there was going to

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:03.210
be on phones we knew there was going to
 

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.260
be on phones we knew there was going to
be a certain you know difficulty there

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:06.270
be a certain you know difficulty there
 

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:07.730
be a certain you know difficulty there
but that's kind of the whole point of

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740
but that's kind of the whole point of
 

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.650
but that's kind of the whole point of
ICS is to bring everything together and

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660
ICS is to bring everything together and
 

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.930
ICS is to bring everything together and
then get as many fans as possible way in

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:11.940
then get as many fans as possible way in
 

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.880
then get as many fans as possible way in
the same version I would say also we

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:13.890
the same version I would say also we
 

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:15.859
the same version I would say also we
have a we maintain a pie chart on the

00:40:15.859 --> 00:40:15.869
have a we maintain a pie chart on the
 

00:40:15.869 --> 00:40:18.170
have a we maintain a pie chart on the
developer site that has p breakdown of

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:18.180
developer site that has p breakdown of
 

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.589
developer site that has p breakdown of
android users by platform version and

00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599
android users by platform version and
 

00:40:20.599 --> 00:40:23.420
android users by platform version and
let's see gingerbread was released the

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:23.430

and now it's completely doback with this

00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:50.329
and now it's completely doback with this
 

00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:52.819
and now it's completely doback with this
looking at it at the moment we got here

00:40:52.819 --> 00:40:52.829
looking at it at the moment we got here
 

00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:57.229
looking at it at the moment we got here
okay so a key yeah yeah the gingerbread

00:40:57.229 --> 00:40:57.239
okay so a key yeah yeah the gingerbread
 

00:40:57.239 --> 00:41:00.249
okay so a key yeah yeah the gingerbread
is like yeah yeah somebody was asking if

00:41:00.249 --> 00:41:00.259
is like yeah yeah somebody was asking if
 

00:41:00.259 --> 00:41:02.569
is like yeah yeah somebody was asking if
usps suppose was actually had in your

00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:02.579
usps suppose was actually had in your
 

00:41:02.579 --> 00:41:04.880
usps suppose was actually had in your
bed and just double check it looks like

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:04.890
bed and just double check it looks like
 

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:06.739
bed and just double check it looks like
we added host mode in android three ones

00:41:06.739 --> 00:41:06.749
we added host mode in android three ones
 

00:41:06.749 --> 00:41:11.660
we added host mode in android three ones
that is honeycomb yeah but that does

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:11.670
that is honeycomb yeah but that does
 

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:13.249
that is honeycomb yeah but that does
bring up another good point here that to

00:41:13.249 --> 00:41:13.259
bring up another good point here that to
 

00:41:13.259 --> 00:41:16.219
bring up another good point here that to
about USB which is if you want to go and

00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:16.229
about USB which is if you want to go and
 

00:41:16.229 --> 00:41:18.410
about USB which is if you want to go and
use USB and you are concerned about the

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:18.420
use USB and you are concerned about the
 

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.809
use USB and you are concerned about the
compatibility a better option is USB

00:41:20.809 --> 00:41:20.819
compatibility a better option is USB
 

00:41:20.819 --> 00:41:23.180
compatibility a better option is USB
accessory mode and so there's to root

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:23.190
accessory mode and so there's to root
 

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.219
accessory mode and so there's to root
for first off I think USB host but even

00:41:25.219 --> 00:41:25.229
for first off I think USB host but even
 

00:41:25.229 --> 00:41:26.839
for first off I think USB host but even
on newer devices is optional right it

00:41:26.839 --> 00:41:26.849
on newer devices is optional right it
 

00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:28.519
on newer devices is optional right it
has to the device has to support

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:28.529
has to the device has to support
 

00:41:28.529 --> 00:41:32.390
has to the device has to support
something like USB on-the-go yeah but

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400
something like USB on-the-go yeah but
 

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.370
something like USB on-the-go yeah but
USB accessory mode will work on any

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380
USB accessory mode will work on any
 

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.299
USB accessory mode will work on any
device going back to I can't remember

00:41:38.299 --> 00:41:38.309
device going back to I can't remember
 

00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:40.370
device going back to I can't remember
how far back it goes Middle East

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380
how far back it goes Middle East
 

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.009
how far back it goes Middle East
gingerbread for sure but I think does it

00:41:43.009 --> 00:41:43.019
gingerbread for sure but I think does it
 

00:41:43.019 --> 00:41:45.680
gingerbread for sure but I think does it
go on open devices if I'd left to check

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:45.690
go on open devices if I'd left to check
 

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.979
go on open devices if I'd left to check
for me um lotro yeah but but so you

00:41:48.979 --> 00:41:48.989
for me um lotro yeah but but so you
 

00:41:48.989 --> 00:41:50.449
for me um lotro yeah but but so you
speak accessory mode is sort of

00:41:50.449 --> 00:41:50.459
speak accessory mode is sort of
 

00:41:50.459 --> 00:41:51.890
speak accessory mode is sort of
interesting that it runs the device in

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:51.900
interesting that it runs the device in
 

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.199
interesting that it runs the device in
reverse so your accessory is actually

00:41:54.199 --> 00:41:54.209
reverse so your accessory is actually
 

00:41:54.209 --> 00:41:56.359
reverse so your accessory is actually
the USB host and the Android device is

00:41:56.359 --> 00:41:56.369
the USB host and the Android device is
 

00:41:56.369 --> 00:41:58.670
the USB host and the Android device is
you know in USB slave mode like it

00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680
you know in USB slave mode like it
 

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.299
you know in USB slave mode like it
normally would be the OS has a special

00:42:02.299 --> 00:42:02.309
normally would be the OS has a special
 

00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:04.269
normally would be the OS has a special
protocols used to talk to the devices

00:42:04.269 --> 00:42:04.279
protocols used to talk to the devices
 

00:42:04.279 --> 00:42:08.209
protocols used to talk to the devices
which also get a you know okay I think

00:42:08.209 --> 00:42:08.219
which also get a you know okay I think
 

00:42:08.219 --> 00:42:09.890
which also get a you know okay I think
even in a host but you can have your pop

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:09.900
even in a host but you can have your pop
 

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.309
even in a host but you can have your pop
up but accessory mode mostly it gives

00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319
up but accessory mode mostly it gives
 

00:42:13.319 --> 00:42:14.449
up but accessory mode mostly it gives
you a lot of options as far as

00:42:14.449 --> 00:42:14.459
you a lot of options as far as
 

00:42:14.459 --> 00:42:17.269
you a lot of options as far as
compatible is concerned so certainly

00:42:17.269 --> 00:42:17.279
compatible is concerned so certainly
 

00:42:17.279 --> 00:42:19.579
compatible is concerned so certainly
something to look into and if you just

00:42:19.579 --> 00:42:19.589
something to look into and if you just
 

00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:20.870
something to look into and if you just
want to play around with the two we do

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880
want to play around with the two we do
 

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.779
want to play around with the two we do
have the android accessory development

suddenly start working with the yo-yo
 

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.309
suddenly start working with the yo-yo
over budget I said oh it's very cool

00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319
over budget I said oh it's very cool
 

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:12.710
over budget I said oh it's very cool
awesome like that yeah so that's

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720
awesome like that yeah so that's
 

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.120
awesome like that yeah so that's
actually built by another engineer here

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:14.130
actually built by another engineer here
 

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:17.180
actually built by another engineer here
here man via so yeah assess was

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:17.190
here man via so yeah assess was
 

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:19.940
here man via so yeah assess was
something to check out okay let's say

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:19.950
something to check out okay let's say
 

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.220
something to check out okay let's say
look I got a question from young shaky

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:22.230
look I got a question from young shaky
 

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:25.280
look I got a question from young shaky
on the stream he says he'd like to

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:25.290
on the stream he says he'd like to
 

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.500
on the stream he says he'd like to
create a Google+ app using the Google+

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:27.510
create a Google+ app using the Google+

API it's like the friend caster up for

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:29.730
API it's like the friend caster up for
 

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:32.150
API it's like the friend caster up for
facebook can I do this or could he do

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160
facebook can I do this or could he do
 

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.030
facebook can I do this or could he do
this I think that comes down to figuring

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040
this I think that comes down to figuring
 

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.250
this I think that comes down to figuring
out what api's are available for google

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:37.260
out what api's are available for google
 

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.069
out what api's are available for google
plus i don't think that there is an api

00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079
plus i don't think that there is an api
 

00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:42.260
plus i don't think that there is an api
to allow you to write to the stream no

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:42.270
to allow you to write to the stream no
 

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:45.740
to allow you to write to the stream no
no there is so that may be may be tricky

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:45.750
no there is so that may be may be tricky
 

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.180
no there is so that may be may be tricky
I'm not sure what the friend caster up

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:47.190
I'm not sure what the friend caster up
 

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:50.270
I'm not sure what the friend caster up
for facebook does so if it's it's

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280
for facebook does so if it's it's
 

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.980
for facebook does so if it's it's
reading streams than that that may be

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:51.990
reading streams than that that may be
 

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:53.450
reading streams than that that may be
something possible if it's writing as

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460
something possible if it's writing as
 

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.150
something possible if it's writing as
well then probably not anything from

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160
well then probably not anything from
 

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.280
well then probably not anything from
castor f is the exact same thing as the

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:58.290
castor f is the exact same thing as the
 

00:43:58.290 --> 00:43:59.990

facebook has just updated a little bit

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000
facebook has just updated a little bit
 

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.559
facebook has just updated a little bit
with a different UI oh so it's just an

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:02.569
with a different UI oh so it's just an
 

00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:05.210
with a different UI oh so it's just an
alternative Facebook implementation okay

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:05.220
alternative Facebook implementation okay
 

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.599
alternative Facebook implementation okay
yeah so probably not oh we can't do that

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:07.609
yeah so probably not oh we can't do that
 

00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:09.680
yeah so probably not oh we can't do that
for Google+ because there's no way to

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:09.690
for Google+ because there's no way to
 

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:11.569
for Google+ because there's no way to
write to the stream but if you do want

00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579
write to the stream but if you do want
 

00:44:11.579 --> 00:44:13.099
write to the stream but if you do want
to get more information about that there

00:44:13.099 --> 00:44:13.109
to get more information about that there
 

00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:15.170
to get more information about that there
is a Google+ developer relations team as

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180
is a Google+ developer relations team as
 

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.240
is a Google+ developer relations team as
well and they also do office hours like

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:17.250
well and they also do office hours like
 

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:19.550
well and they also do office hours like
these weekly fact I think they do them

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:19.560
these weekly fact I think they do them
 

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.819
these weekly fact I think they do them
at Wednesday at eleven-thirty that's

00:44:22.819 --> 00:44:22.829
at Wednesday at eleven-thirty that's
 

00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:24.500
at Wednesday at eleven-thirty that's
right it was earlier today so check

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:24.510
right it was earlier today so check
 

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:28.609
right it was earlier today so check
check them out on google+ and maybe send

00:44:28.609 --> 00:44:28.619
check them out on google+ and maybe send
 

00:44:28.619 --> 00:44:29.660
check them out on google+ and maybe send
them alone and they'll be able to give

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:29.670
them alone and they'll be able to give
 

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.309
them alone and they'll be able to give
you more info on exactly what's possible

00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319
you more info on exactly what's possible
 

00:44:31.319 --> 00:44:35.720
you more info on exactly what's possible
with the API let's see a question for me

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:35.730
with the API let's see a question for me
 

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:37.760
with the API let's see a question for me
how good is there a way to get the new

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:37.770
how good is there a way to get the new
 

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.440
how good is there a way to get the new
android development book in digital copy

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:39.450
android development book in digital copy
 

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.030
android development book in digital copy
outside the US i will answer that

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040
outside the US i will answer that
 

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.750
outside the US i will answer that
offline okay i have a particular doubt

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760
offline okay i have a particular doubt
 

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.730
offline okay i have a particular doubt
in regards to the recognition algorithm

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740
in regards to the recognition algorithm
 

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.890
in regards to the recognition algorithm
used by the gesture overlay component

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900
used by the gesture overlay component
 

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.470
used by the gesture overlay component
does the component only as a version of

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480
does the component only as a version of
 

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.540
does the component only as a version of
for used to protractor algorithm or is

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:53.550
for used to protractor algorithm or is
 

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.450
for used to protractor algorithm or is
it also supported by older versions so i

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.460
it also supported by older versions so i
 

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.740
it also supported by older versions so i
think that's more of an implementation

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:57.750
think that's more of an implementation
 

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.870
think that's more of an implementation
question and probably not something were

00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880
question and probably not something were
 

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.250
question and probably not something were
the best folks to answer you'd want to

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260
the best folks to answer you'd want to
 

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.240
the best folks to answer you'd want to
speak to the engineers who actually

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:02.250
speak to the engineers who actually
 

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:06.380
speak to the engineers who actually
wrote the gesture recognition stuff

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:06.390
wrote the gesture recognition stuff
 

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.920
wrote the gesture recognition stuff
alright or barring that up look at those

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:09.930
alright or barring that up look at those

you can take a look yeah our engineers
 

00:45:17.519 --> 00:45:20.089
you can take a look yeah our engineers
are hard hard working people and

00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099
are hard hard working people and
 

00:45:20.099 --> 00:45:21.890
are hard hard working people and
sometimes it takes less time to dig

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900
sometimes it takes less time to dig
 

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.480
sometimes it takes less time to dig
through you find the source code than it

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:23.490
through you find the source code than it

this so yeah it sounds like it's just an
 

00:47:02.039 --> 00:47:03.319
this so yeah it sounds like it's just an
eclipse problem because I've definitely

00:47:03.319 --> 00:47:03.329
eclipse problem because I've definitely

and everything since yeah that sounds
 

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.259
and everything since yeah that sounds
like it's an eclipse thing so one very

00:47:15.259 --> 00:47:15.269
like it's an eclipse thing so one very

so the big benefits is things like what
we like to call the menu button of shame

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200
we like to call the menu button of shame
 

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.900
we like to call the menu button of shame
so a lot of apps will have a menu button

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:03.910
so a lot of apps will have a menu button
 

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:05.100
so a lot of apps will have a menu button
which appears even though you're using

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:05.110
which appears even though you're using
 

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:06.360
which appears even though you're using
action bar and everything else just

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:06.370
action bar and everything else just
 

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:07.830
action bar and everything else just
because you haven't set the target SDK

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:07.840
because you haven't set the target SDK
 

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.140
because you haven't set the target SDK
high enough and then you just change

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:10.150
high enough and then you just change
 

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:11.880
high enough and then you just change
that and miraculously it goes away and

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:11.890
that and miraculously it goes away and
 

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:14.100
that and miraculously it goes away and
everything kind of works which is kind

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:14.110
everything kind of works which is kind
 

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:15.420
everything kind of works which is kind
of the point of the way a lot of

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:15.430
of the point of the way a lot of

development goes for Android the idea is

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440
development goes for Android the idea is
 

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.320
development goes for Android the idea is
to make sure that everything just works

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:19.330
to make sure that everything just works
 

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:21.600
to make sure that everything just works
when a new version comes out which

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:21.610
when a new version comes out which
 

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:22.470
when a new version comes out which

improving because with each new version

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:25.930
improving because with each new version
 

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:27.420
improving because with each new version
of Android there's new libraries there's

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:27.430
of Android there's new libraries there's
 

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:29.070
of Android there's new libraries there's
new API us which you're able to use to

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:29.080
new API us which you're able to use to
 

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.530
new API us which you're able to use to
make things better but even without

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:31.540
make things better but even without
 

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.330
make things better but even without
making any changes a lot of time you

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:33.340
making any changes a lot of time you
 

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:34.560
making any changes a lot of time you
have a lot of benefit just by changing

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:34.570
have a lot of benefit just by changing
 

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:38.220
have a lot of benefit just by changing
the target SDK yeah and yeah there's

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:38.230
the target SDK yeah and yeah there's
 

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:39.750
the target SDK yeah and yeah there's
actually even easier now to because

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760
actually even easier now to because
 

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.450
actually even easier now to because

make sure that you go and wrap those

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:47.710
make sure that you go and wrap those
 

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:49.230

there is one thing about this question

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.070
there is one thing about this question
 

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:04.650
there is one thing about this question
showing us and the person said they were

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:04.660
showing us and the person said they were
 

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.470
showing us and the person said they were
using the the version of android with

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:07.480
using the the version of android with
 

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.110
using the the version of android with
google map support and there is

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:10.120
google map support and there is
 

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.520
google map support and there is
something to watch out for there and

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:11.530
something to watch out for there and
 

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:14.130
something to watch out for there and
that is that if you're using support

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:14.140
that is that if you're using support
 

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:17.370
that is that if you're using support
fragments you i believe you don't have

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:17.380
fragments you i believe you don't have
 

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.590
fragments you i believe you don't have
access to is it map activity that's

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:19.600
access to is it map activity that's
 

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:23.760
access to is it map activity that's
called a no use map progress if you're

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:23.770
called a no use map progress if you're
 

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:26.010
called a no use map progress if you're
using avi's in the support library and

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:26.020
using avi's in the support library and
 

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.630
using avi's in the support library and
yet you you have to derive your

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:27.640
yet you you have to derive your
 

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.870
yet you you have to derive your
activities from that from franklin

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880
activities from that from franklin
 

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.080
activities from that from franklin
activity thank you 33 total rather

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:34.090
activity thank you 33 total rather
 

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.310
activity thank you 33 total rather
different map activity which is a

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:35.320
different map activity which is a
 

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.900
different map activity which is a
requirement to be able to use matthews

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:36.910
requirement to be able to use matthews
 

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:38.790
requirement to be able to use matthews
right that's a good point so yeah in

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800
right that's a good point so yeah in
 

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:43.140
right that's a good point so yeah in
that case probably what I do is actually

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:43.150
that case probably what I do is actually
 

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.060
that case probably what I do is actually
a semi really tough fact probably I

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:45.070
a semi really tough fact probably I
 

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:45.960
a semi really tough fact probably I
would recommend in that case

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:45.970
would recommend in that case
 

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:48.990
would recommend in that case
is if you are running on a device that

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000
is if you are running on a device that
 

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.530
is if you are running on a device that
needs to go and display or if you're

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:52.540
needs to go and display or if you're
 

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:53.550
needs to go and display or if you're
running on a device it doesn't have

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:53.560
running on a device it doesn't have
 

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.970
running on a device it doesn't have
access to math pregnant have a button to

00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:56.980
access to math pregnant have a button to
 

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.410
access to math pregnant have a button to
go and pop up the map in a transparent

00:51:58.410 --> 00:51:58.420
go and pop up the map in a transparent
 

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.320
go and pop up the map in a transparent
activity yeah that's what I mean you

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:01.330
activity yeah that's what I mean you
 

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:02.640
activity yeah that's what I mean you
still won't be able to display it in a

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:02.650
still won't be able to display it in a
 

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:05.370
still won't be able to display it in a
fragment on older devices but you'll be

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:05.380
fragment on older devices but you'll be
 

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.380
fragment on older devices but you'll be
able to get something that's not too

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:07.390
able to get something that's not too
 

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.690
able to get something that's not too
obtrusive yeah and I'm how did the

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:09.700
obtrusive yeah and I'm how did the
 

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.400
obtrusive yeah and I'm how did the
interesting thing I mean you will

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:11.410
interesting thing I mean you will
 

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:12.810
interesting thing I mean you will
definitely lose the advantage of being

00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:12.820
definitely lose the advantage of being
 

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:14.609
definitely lose the advantage of being
able to reuse fragments across multiple

00:52:14.609 --> 00:52:14.619
able to reuse fragments across multiple
 

00:52:14.619 --> 00:52:16.440
able to reuse fragments across multiple
activities if you do what I'm about to

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:16.450
activities if you do what I'm about to
 

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:19.710
activities if you do what I'm about to
suggest but most of the case well in

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720
suggest but most of the case well in
 

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.589
suggest but most of the case well in
almost all of the cases the devices

00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:22.599
almost all of the cases the devices
 

00:52:22.599 --> 00:52:27.000
almost all of the cases the devices
which which are pre honeycomb our phones

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:27.010
which which are pre honeycomb our phones
 

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.310
which which are pre honeycomb our phones
which means that is less need to have

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:29.320
which means that is less need to have
 

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.870
which means that is less need to have
multiple fragments on screen so you can

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880
multiple fragments on screen so you can
 

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.730
multiple fragments on screen so you can
just have your map activity as a

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:32.740
just have your map activity as a
 

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.190
just have your map activity as a
separate thing and then you can have

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200
separate thing and then you can have
 

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.140
separate thing and then you can have
separate activity which has your map

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:37.150
separate activity which has your map
 

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:39.720
separate activity which has your map
plus whatever else you want for the

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:39.730
plus whatever else you want for the
 

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:41.010
plus whatever else you want for the
tablets which are running honeycomb

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:41.020
tablets which are running honeycomb
 

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.500
tablets which are running honeycomb
above so it's it's not ideal as a bit of

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:43.510
above so it's it's not ideal as a bit of
 

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:46.560
above so it's it's not ideal as a bit of
duplication it's not quite as neat but

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:46.570
duplication it's not quite as neat but
 

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:48.960
duplication it's not quite as neat but
at the moment that's kind of the best

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:48.970
at the moment that's kind of the best
 

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:51.089
at the moment that's kind of the best
way forward I guess until until we get

00:52:51.089 --> 00:52:51.099
way forward I guess until until we get
 

00:52:51.099 --> 00:52:53.010
way forward I guess until until we get

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:15.970
to what you guys were previously talking
 

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:17.880
to what you guys were previously talking
about you yeah yeah it gets it gets

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:17.890
about you yeah yeah it gets it gets
 

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:19.950
about you yeah yeah it gets it gets
really complicated so I know that there

00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960
really complicated so I know that there
 

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.050
really complicated so I know that there
are some third-party libraries which

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:22.060
are some third-party libraries which
 

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.240
are some third-party libraries which
attempt to do this sort of thing

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:23.250
attempt to do this sort of thing
 

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:26.430
attempt to do this sort of thing
pitchers but it's it's non-trivial and

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:26.440
pitchers but it's it's non-trivial and
 

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.440
pitchers but it's it's non-trivial and
it tends to result in bad things

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:28.450
it tends to result in bad things
 

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:30.930
it tends to result in bad things
happening uh-huh so yeah I would

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:30.940
happening uh-huh so yeah I would
 

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.820
happening uh-huh so yeah I would
probably recommend against that kind of

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:32.830
probably recommend against that kind of
 

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:36.030
probably recommend against that kind of
approach at the moment at least ok what

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040
approach at the moment at least ok what
 

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:39.950
approach at the moment at least ok what
other question you can yeah so when

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960
other question you can yeah so when
 

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.839
other question you can yeah so when
obviously a lot of our apps we targets

00:53:42.839 --> 00:53:42.849
obviously a lot of our apps we targets
 

00:53:42.849 --> 00:53:45.210
obviously a lot of our apps we targets
the most recent version of the SDK and

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:45.220
the most recent version of the SDK and
 

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:48.000
the most recent version of the SDK and
then provide a min SDK back to let's say

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:48.010
then provide a min SDK back to let's say
 

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:57.750
then provide a min SDK back to let's say
2.1 or 2.2 I find it even if I am using

00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760
2.1 or 2.2 I find it even if I am using
 

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:02.700
2.1 or 2.2 I find it even if I am using
a holo theme and I put the minimum SDK

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:02.710
a holo theme and I put the minimum SDK
 

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:07.110
a holo theme and I put the minimum SDK
version back to 2.2 it uses the old

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:07.120
version back to 2.2 it uses the old
 

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.840
version back to 2.2 it uses the old
widgets and not the hollow widgets have

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:09.850
widgets and not the hollow widgets have
 

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:12.540
widgets and not the hollow widgets have
you guys ever experienced that yes it

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:12.550
you guys ever experienced that yes it
 

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:15.300
you guys ever experienced that yes it
uses the old widgets on every platform

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:15.310
uses the old widgets on every platform
 

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:17.400
uses the old widgets on every platform
or just on the old platform on which

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:17.410
or just on the old platform on which
 

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:21.120
or just on the old platform on which
devices do you see this on Galaxy Nexus

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:21.130
devices do you see this on Galaxy Nexus
 

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:23.640
devices do you see this on Galaxy Nexus
so and it is on all platforms so on the

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:23.650
so and it is on all platforms so on the
 

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:26.940
so and it is on all platforms so on the
Galaxy Nexus 4 point now I see the old

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:26.950
Galaxy Nexus 4 point now I see the old
 

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:29.130
Galaxy Nexus 4 point now I see the old
widgets show up even though i have the

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:29.140
widgets show up even though i have the
 

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:32.130
widgets show up even though i have the
holo theme on what is hitting the target

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:32.140
holo theme on what is hitting the target
 

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:40.410
holo theme on what is hitting the target
SDK trick for point out so 15 I don't

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:40.420
SDK trick for point out so 15 I don't
 

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:43.080
SDK trick for point out so 15 I don't
know why that would be yeah I'm not sure

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:43.090
know why that would be yeah I'm not sure
 

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:45.300
know why that would be yeah I'm not sure
I can you you go through that process

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:45.310
I can you you go through that process
 

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:47.670
I can you you go through that process
again for me I just know not sure that

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680
again for me I just know not sure that
 

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:52.380
again for me I just know not sure that
the mission shares so I make an appt set

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:52.390
the mission shares so I make an appt set
 

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:57.780
the mission shares so I make an appt set
the theme to hollow and and then so I

00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:57.790
the theme to hollow and and then so I
 

00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.270
the theme to hollow and and then so I
set the target SDK to four point oh so

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280
set the target SDK to four point oh so
 

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.270
set the target SDK to four point oh so
if you I'll over 15 and I set the min

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280
if you I'll over 15 and I set the min
 

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:10.380
if you I'll over 15 and I set the min
SDK 27 I if I run it on four point oh it

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:10.390
SDK 27 I if I run it on four point oh it
 

00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:12.120
SDK 27 I if I run it on four point oh it
shows the old widgets rather than the

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:12.130
shows the old widgets rather than the
 

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:14.010
shows the old widgets rather than the
hollow widgets interesting and if you

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:14.020
hollow widgets interesting and if you
 

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.570
hollow widgets interesting and if you
change the munis decayed or something

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:15.580
change the munis decayed or something
 

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.390
change the munis decayed or something
other than seven minutes if i if i

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400
other than seven minutes if i if i
 

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.210
other than seven minutes if i if i
change it to 11 which would be honeycomb

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:21.220
change it to 11 which would be honeycomb
 

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:27.660
change it to 11 which would be honeycomb
it does show the hollow widgets that's

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:27.670
it does show the hollow widgets that's
 

00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:29.370
it does show the hollow widgets that's
unexpected yeah I've never heard of it

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:29.380
unexpected yeah I've never heard of it
 

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.730
unexpected yeah I've never heard of it
before good yeah let us I think we're

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:32.740
before good yeah let us I think we're
 

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.200
before good yeah let us I think we're
gonna have to see that for ourselves to

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:34.210
gonna have to see that for ourselves to
 

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:35.550
gonna have to see that for ourselves to
try and figure out what's going on so

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:35.560
try and figure out what's going on so
 

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.680
try and figure out what's going on so
we'll take that as an action item off

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:37.690
we'll take that as an action item off
 

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:39.120
we'll take that as an action item off
the back of this and go and make a

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:39.130
the back of this and go and make a
 

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:41.610
the back of this and go and make a
sample project which just does exactly

00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:41.620
sample project which just does exactly
 

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.320
sample project which just does exactly
that are you seeing it for anything

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:43.330
that are you seeing it for anything
 

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:45.270
that are you seeing it for anything
other than when you say widgets you mean

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280
other than when you say widgets you mean
 

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.180
other than when you say widgets you mean
like home screen widgets yeah oh no no

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:48.190
like home screen widgets yeah oh no no
 

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:50.190
like home screen widgets yeah oh no no
no i sorry i'm at like views like

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.200
no i sorry i'm at like views like
 

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:55.160
no i sorry i'm at like views like
buttons spinners stuff like that exactly

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:55.170
buttons spinners stuff like that exactly
 

00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:58.440
buttons spinners stuff like that exactly
okay that should be easy to test all

00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:58.450
okay that should be easy to test all
 

00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:00.270
okay that should be easy to test all
right yeah let us look into that that

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280
right yeah let us look into that that
 

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.280
right yeah let us look into that that
seems surprising it seems like maybe

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:02.290
seems surprising it seems like maybe
 

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:04.920
seems surprising it seems like maybe
something else is going on or I feel

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:04.930
something else is going on or I feel
 

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:06.480
something else is going on or I feel
like we would have run into that earlier

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:06.490
like we would have run into that earlier
 

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:09.630
like we would have run into that earlier
it seems contrary to the way that I have

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:09.640
it seems contrary to the way that I have
 

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:10.860
it seems contrary to the way that I have
seen it work

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:10.870
seen it work
 

00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:12.840
seen it work
so yeah let us let us look into that

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:12.850
so yeah let us let us look into that
 

00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:15.990
so yeah let us let us look into that
yeah we'll get back to you as well if

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000
yeah we'll get back to you as well if
 

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.240
yeah we'll get back to you as well if
we're not seeing it happens straight

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:18.250
we're not seeing it happens straight
 

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:19.830
we're not seeing it happens straight
away or I guess either way I must have

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:19.840
away or I guess either way I must have
 

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.690
away or I guess either way I must have
looked into it we may want to get back

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:21.700
looked into it we may want to get back
 

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:22.800
looked into it we may want to get back
in touch with you to get a little bit

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:22.810
in touch with you to get a little bit
 

00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:24.420
in touch with you to get a little bit
more information as to exactly what's

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:24.430
more information as to exactly what's
 

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:26.160
more information as to exactly what's
happening just in case we can't

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:26.170
happening just in case we can't
 

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:29.010
happening just in case we can't
replicate it ourselves yeah it just came

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:29.020
replicate it ourselves yeah it just came
 

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:31.830
replicate it ourselves yeah it just came
up so I think I might i'll test it again

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:31.840
up so I think I might i'll test it again
 

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.900
up so I think I might i'll test it again
i might file a bug report if i still

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:33.910
i might file a bug report if i still
 

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:36.450
i might file a bug report if i still
have it oh yeah and do a ping android

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:36.460
have it oh yeah and do a ping android
 

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:37.860
have it oh yeah and do a ping android
developers as well so we can keep track

00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:37.870
developers as well so we can keep track
 

00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:41.910
developers as well so we can keep track
of it that way to cope like okay thanks

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920
of it that way to cope like okay thanks
 

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:47.130
of it that way to cope like okay thanks
man um Josh she had a question yeah mine

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:47.140
man um Josh she had a question yeah mine
 

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:50.360
man um Josh she had a question yeah mine
was with regards to gradient drawables

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:50.370
was with regards to gradient drawables
 

00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:53.790
was with regards to gradient drawables
so we're declaring them in XML and

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:53.800
so we're declaring them in XML and
 

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.450
so we're declaring them in XML and
dealing with radial gradients basically

00:56:57.450 --> 00:56:57.460
dealing with radial gradients basically
 

00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.930
dealing with radial gradients basically
when you try when you set the radius the

00:56:59.930 --> 00:56:59.940
when you try when you set the radius the
 

00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:02.790
when you try when you set the radius the
the actual attribute is an int rather

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:02.800
the actual attribute is an int rather
 

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:06.660
the actual attribute is an int rather
than a dimension and so density scaling

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:06.670
than a dimension and so density scaling
 

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:09.240
than a dimension and so density scaling
becomes kind of tricky especially since

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:09.250
becomes kind of tricky especially since
 

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:10.460
becomes kind of tricky especially since
I don't think it will even take

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:10.470
I don't think it will even take
 

00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:12.540
I don't think it will even take
references so I can't just you know

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:12.550
references so I can't just you know
 

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:15.450
references so I can't just you know
declare that in the values XML I haven't

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:15.460
declare that in the values XML I haven't
 

00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:16.950
declare that in the values XML I haven't
have to have a separate copies in each

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960
have to have a separate copies in each
 

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.160
have to have a separate copies in each
one is there a better approach to that

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:20.170
one is there a better approach to that
 

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.050
one is there a better approach to that
so it's a really good question so I

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:22.060
so it's a really good question so I
 

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.060
so it's a really good question so I
noticed this myself a little while ago

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:24.070
noticed this myself a little while ago
 

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:27.270
noticed this myself a little while ago
