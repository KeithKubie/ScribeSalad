Last Friday was That Sucks Day,

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:04.505
the one day a year
when we're allowed to talk

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:06.507
about all the things
that suck in our lives--

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.309
from bad haircuts
to manspreading on the subway

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.178
to how Chris Hardwick sucks
corporate (bleep)

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.180
'cause he liked
the <i>Walking De</i> finale.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:17.017
Uh, and... we missed our chance,
and that sucks.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.620
So, comedians, let's celebrate
That Sucks Day right here,

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:21.555
right now, by venting
about things that suck.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.891
In 60 seconds. And begin. Tom.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.893
My new inflatable dartboard.

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:28.161
-Yes. Points. Chris.
-Terrible.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:29.563
Covering up concussion studies

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.431
in a multi-billion-dollar
sports league.

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:32.766
All right.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.102
What would you know about that?!

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.503
Points. Tom.

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:38.839
Uh, whatever's on the other side
of that weird hole

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.842
-in my dressing room.
-All right, points.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.710
-Rachel.
-People on Tinder

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:45.913
looking for a partner in crime.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.714
Yeah. All right, points.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:50.851
Oh, that's so... I know
exactly what you're... Chris.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.853
Using a racial slur
as your team's name.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.855
All right, points. Tom.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.591
People that say, "Oh, my God,
that's so funny"

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.593
-instead of actually laughing.
Yeah. -Yes, points.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.528
Points. Rachel.

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:03.597
People that argue
about the Holocaust

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.465
under unboxing videos.

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:07.401
-In the comment section.
-All right, points.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.403
-I'm just specifically...
-Yeah. Points. Chris.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:11.405
Nickelback.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:12.673
(buzzer sounds)

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:12.773
Well, the science backs it up
now.
