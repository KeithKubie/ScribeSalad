All of us at The School of life would like
to thank you, from the bottom of our hearts

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.310
for helping us reach 3 Million subscribers.
It is fascinating to think that there are

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.780
now more people subscribed to this channel
than there are residents of Jamaica. The entire

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.369
population of Fiji could subscribe three times
each and there would still be more of us left

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.810
over. Together you have watched over a billion
minutes of The School of Life. Thank you for

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.930
subscribing to our channel, watching our films,
exploring the big questions and growing our

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.110
collective emotional intelligence.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.290
This channel wouldn't exist with your support,
your comments, likes and purchases in our

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.550
shop all mean that we can keep sharing what
we love with you.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.320
To say thank you for all your support, we would like to

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.000
to give away some of our best holiday gifts,
our Great Thinkers Set, our Relationships

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.711
Set and our Calm Set. To be in with a chance
of winning one of these you simply have to

00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:05.050
like this video, subscribe to our channel,
turn on notifications and comment below which

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.000
gift you would like. A winner will be chosen
at random and we will contact you in your

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.140
YouTube inbox to give you the good news.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.240
From everyone at The School of Life we thank
you. Your support means the world to us.
