00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
Hellllooo, I'm the Nostalgia Critic,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380
I remember it so you don't have to!

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.220
Remember the movie, Jaws?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.040
That scary film that made everyone afraid to go back into the water?

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.520
It took the world by storm.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.220
The Spielberg classic was about a giant killer shark

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.800
Who roamed the seas killing people.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.700
Swimmers were dropping like flies

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.200
but luckily, Roy Schneider came in,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.720
said, "Smile, you son of a bitch",

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.180
and blew the monster to kingdom come.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.280
Allowing our heroes to live happily ever after.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.880
Some random guy: "I'm not dead!"

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.100
Oh, until he made an unexplained comeback  in Jaws 2.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.460
Funny, I didn't know sharks could put themselves back together so neatly.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.420
But no matter!

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.940
Schneider is back to save the day!

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.180
He fights the creature off,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.440
and once again blows him to smithereens!

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.680
allowing, once again, for our heroes to live happily ever after!

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.420
Random guy: "I feel fine!"

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.400
GOD!

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.240
That is until Jaws 3D, where once again the shark can't take a hint that we don't want to see him anymore!

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.740
Ok, you know the drill.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.180
Shark, screaming, blow em' up, Sea World regrets granting filming privileges,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.780
And once again, our heroes live happily ever after.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.880
Random guy: "I feel at peace!"

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.400
Oh, Christ... ANOTHER ONE?!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.200
This shark has more lives than a soap opera lead!

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.720
That's right folks,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.180
Jaws 4 is the unnecessary sequel to the unnecessary sequel of the unnecessary sequel.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.180
It has all the crap and over the top shark attacks, you'd expect to see at this point.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.440
and all you had sacrifice was your ability to give a shit.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.540
It's the very last in a very long line of disappointment.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.740
So let's head back into the water for the worst of the worst,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.880
This is Jaws 4.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.300
Random People + Nostalgia Critic: "Seen It."

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.520
Good God, how many times are we going to see that 'Shark Point of View?'

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.460
Haven't we established that this already is the world's slowest moving shark?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.260
And on top of that,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.620
the movie is called, "Jaws: The Revenge".

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.920
Really? It's taken him four movies to finally get a plan together?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.520
It'd better be a damn good scheme.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.240
Oh, hey can I take a guess?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.260
I'm gonna say it's um, sneaking up on people and eating them.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.340
*Sarcastically* Am I close? Tell me I'm close!

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.220
Sean: "We're going with Tiffany to buy a Christmas tree."

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.780
Ellen Brody: "Okay, but a small one this year."

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.480
We open with the wife of Martin Brody, Ellen Brody.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.460
Little girl on the phone: "I can use the phone by myself!"

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.380
Ellen Brody: "I know you can use the phone by yourself, you're a big girl!"

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.280
Little girl on phone: "I'm five years old now, grandma!"

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.820
Ellen Brody: "I know you're five years old."

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.420
Sean: "Hiya Kiddo! How ya doin' down there in the sunshine?"

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.640
Little girl on the phone: "I'm fine, Uncle Sean."

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.420
Yeah, yeah yeah, where's the shark?

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.420
Random lady: "How come you get to leave early?"

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.980
Ellen: "Because my desk is closer to the door."

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.300
Okay, I guess the shark's got a while, so let's introduce the appetizers.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.740
This is Sean, Ellen's son.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.460
This is Michael, her other son.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.280
Where's Roy Schneider you might ask?

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.080
Well...

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.320
He's right there!

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.300
Yeah, I guess they figure if they hold on this picture for a good 5 minutes, somehow that'll count as him making an appearance.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.700
Sean: "That bad, huh?"

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.580
Actually they say that he died in between films.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.980
And I have to admit I always find it weird when they kill off characters in between movies, when we clearly know the actor is alive.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.800
Like with Sean Connery in the last Indiana Jones movie.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.380
Indiana Jones: "Brutal couple years, huh Charlie?"

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.240
"First Dad, and Marcus..."

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.700
Oh, really? He died in between films?

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.520
Yeah, well I sure hope you kept that receipt for that CUP OF EVERLASTING LIFE.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.600
Kinda false advertising, don't you think?

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.020
Lady: "There's an old dock pile drifting in the channel, stuck on a channel marker."

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.680
So Sean is called out to get rid of an old dock pile.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.040
and of course to do this, he has to go on a boat.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.280
Okay, how long until he gets it?

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.540
*Random People shouting their choice*
*Nostalgia Critic Saying the choices*

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.760
Alright, all bets are off, let's take a look!

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.980
"It's a trap!"

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.360
*Screaming*

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.060
And the official answer is.....Two minutes! Well done everybody, well done!

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.400
Guy: "He's not quite dead!"

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.100
Shut up.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.160
By the way, don't you love how there's blood already in the water even before he attacks?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.380
Maybe he's so intimidating that people start bleeding before they even see him.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.320
Sean: "Oh god!"

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.040
*More screaming*

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.800
Of course the shark bites him again and takes him under.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.640
Leaving Sean's mother to deal with the bad news.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.060
Some other guy: "Okay, will sombody  tell Max Von Sydow to take off that wig, this is a serious moment.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.080
So her other son, Michael, comes in to try and comfort her, but the pain is too overbearing.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.280
Black Haired Lady: "She's been out there for hours."

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.340
"How's she doing?"

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.740
Oh, dancing on rainbows, singing show tunes. How do you think she's doing?!

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.420
"Thea! You're so grown up!"

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.860
Thea: "Uncle Sean is dead you know? Will he ever come back?

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.940
I don't know? If you can blow up a shark three times, I'm sure Uncle Sean has a shot.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.740
But Ellen is convinced this is not your just your everyday shark eating, incredibly large boat incident.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.660
There must be a connection.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.300
Ellen: "It came for him..."

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.680
Micheal: "What?"

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.940
Ellen: "It waited all this time and it came for him."

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.700
Waited all this time? Where?!

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.240
Was he filling up on SNL cast members for practice?

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.240
Ellen: "I want you to get out of the water..."

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.520
Michael: "What?"

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.020
Michael: "Come on and sit down. We'll get there, it's alright."

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.320
Ellen: "I don't want anyone in my family anywhere near the water! Never again, never!"

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.640
Oh now, where is this coming from?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.140
Micheal: "Can't belive that voodoo, sharks don't commit murder, they don't pick out a person!

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.540
Ellen: "It picked out Sean, it killed your father!"

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.340
Micheal: "Dad died from a heart attack."

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.340
Ellen: "He died from fear! The fear of it killed him!

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.460
Ahhhhhhhhh, so it's the 'Fear' of the shark that killed him!

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:38.100
Hmmmm, that's interesting, considering that how he kicked this thing, swam around it, and blew it up TWICE in two movies!

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.740
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's really insulting to his character!

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.560
I mean look at this guy! He had more balls than any of us put together! He is fighting a shark!

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.920
And your actually going to say that he died of fear?!

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.100
Well... That's one hell of a delayed response, isn't it?!

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.040
I mean, what? Was he just sitting around one day saying...?

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.180
"Holy smokes, that was dangerous!"

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.140
*Heart attack*

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.980
So they go to Sean's funeral and...in a sort of bizarre scene, she starts laughing.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.860
I guess she's thinking of all the good times they had  but...Look at everybody! They're looking at her like she's totally nuts!

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.100
Priest: "A time to mourn and a time to dance..."

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.700
"Oh, I'm sorry! I just saw "Dick In a Box" for the first time!"

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.760
*Chuckling*

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.660
*Whispers* "Cut a hole in the box..."

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.560
So Michael offers his mother to live with him down in the Bahamas.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.900
Hoping that being surrounded by even more water will somehow cheer her up.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.480
Michael: "Okay....Airplane right? *Airplane Noises*

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.560
*Ellen Crying*

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:53.180
No no no, lady you got the reactions backwards. You're supposed to cry at the funeral and laugh when you're with the little girl. God, Didn't they you anything at Acting 101?!

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.860
So they fly down to the Bahamas with the help of their pilot friend played by Michael Caine.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.700
Who you may remember acting alongside much more believable animatronics in the Muppet Christmas Carol.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.220
He actually starts to befriend her and have a little bit of a romance going on.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.720
*Sarcastically* Meanwhile, though, Michael has the incredibly exciting job of watching underwater snails!

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.060
*In a quiet voice* Woooooooo.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:22.480
Jake: "You go away, you leave me high and dry, doing the work by myself, to come back acting like a zombie, it's Christmas Eve! We're working all the time because of you!

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.040
Micheal: "Hey!"

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.740
Jake: "I'm sorry about your brother, man."

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.200
What the...?! What is with the emotional transitions in this movie?!

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.880
They're all so sporadic!

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.700
Is the eastern seaboard just filled with bi-polars?

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.800
Oh, well, they try to look past their emotional awkwardness and still try to have a Merry Christmas.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.660
Micheal: "Sharp shirt, Jake."

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.200
Jake: "Heeeeeyy, may your sex life be as busy as your shirt!"

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.040
Michael's Wife: "Thank you."

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.900
Nostalgia critic impersonating Sophia: "Mommy, what's sex?"

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.760
Sophia: "It has a tea pot and cups and saucers!"

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.100
Jake's Wife: "And a sugar bowl and a creamer!"

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.680
Nostalgia Critic Impersonating Sophia: "Yeah, it'll improve my sex life!" *hit sound* "OW! What?!"

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.220
But sure enough, even in the Bahamas, Ellen's sharky sense is tingling!

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.900
Micheal: "Kay'..."

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.700
Yes, you're seeing this right people.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.340
The shark actually followed them all the way from the United States to the Bahamas!

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.360
Holy shit! How is that possible?

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.560
How can he find these people?

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.620
Is he like some sort of technologically advanced super shark?

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.860
*Airplane noise*

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.100
Shark:"Ha! You won't get away that easily!"

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.660
*Rocket sound*

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.280
"Batman theme song*

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:43.020
He attacks the ship and... oddly enough the crew looks less terrified and more annoyed.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.560
Man: "Jesus Christ!"

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.220
Impersonating man: "Oh! That is so annoying!"

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.540
*Whispers* "We should report him..."

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:57.860
So rather than saying, "Holy shit, sharks can travel miles and miles solely fueled by grudge!"

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.500
Michael decides he wants to study the creature.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.360
Jake: "Now we're going to do some real research, Boy!

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.660
Michael: "Do me a favor will ya? Don't say anything about this to my mom."

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:13.100
Critic impersonating Michael: "She would totally ground me! I mean last time I went out with a shark, I came back after my curfew, I was in so much trouble!

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.080
So, of course, like a dumbass, he continues to go out into the ocean, trying to tempt the shark.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.560
Boy, Jaws's revenge plot doesn't have much focus, does it?

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:36.540
Critic Impersonating the shark:"I'll travel miles and miles, across the sea just to get my revenge...Ooo cow leg! NUMNUMNUM!"

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:43.020
"Well hey, you guys don't go around for the cheap stuff do yo- OW, you cock hole! Damn it! Eye's on the prize J-boy, Eye's on the prize!"

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:50.120
So to be honest, most of the movie is just Cane and Ms. Brody getting to know each other better.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.440
While, once in while, they'll cut to a shot of the shark. That's it!

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.620
Yeah, it's like 'Terms of Endearment' if it was interrupted by, oh I don't know, A JAWS MOVIE!

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:06.060
But over time, Jaw's manages to get the dart off, I guess he had one of his undersea friends with opposable thumbs help em' out.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.720
So, of course, they have a hard time looking for him but don't worry he finds them pretty easily.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.020
Michael: *Muffled* "Jake!"

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.680
Jake: *Over com* "Michael!...Michael! Can you hear me!"

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:25.620
Oh my God, look at this, the roof is gone, he's completely in the open and yet....JAWS CONTINUES TO EAT THE METAL ON THE SHIP!

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.800
You know? For a movie called, 'The Revenge,' the actual 'Revenge' is extremely clumsy!

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.380
Dude! Just eat him! This is what you do!

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.240
This revenge should only have two steps!

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.460
Bingo!

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.020
But thank God just like in every Jaws movie, there's a sunken ship just a few meters away!

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.160
You know? He doesn't look as scary when he's just wiggling his way through tiny halls.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.600
You ever see a really fat person trying to get through a tiny door?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.020
Kinda the same reaction.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:09.140
*Kool-Aid song plays*

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.140
Critic Impersonating Jake:"So, same time tomorrow?"

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:27.580
Actually, that's exactly what happens. He goes back into the water to fight this thing, but this time Jaws isn't looking for him!

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.900
Yeah, his ingenious revenge is now directed him to a beach a couple miles away.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:38.540
Yeah, that's right, the guy is literally throwing himself at him and he's off at a beach trying to eat some kids!

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.460
I'm sorry, I really don't get Jaws' plan!

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.700
I mean, again, here he (referring to Michael) is out in the open and you're eating this banana boat!

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.020
I mean, okay, I guess you can make the argument that he was going for the granddaughter,

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.760
But, she's right there!

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.600
He literally ignores her and goes for this other chick!

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.400
What does she have to do with your plan?!

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.740
What, did she kick you when you were a guppy or something?!

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.720
I'm sorry! I know I'm dwelling on this, but I wouldn't concentrate on this aspect of the revenge if the movie wasn't called "THE REVENGE"!

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.240
And the fact that he traveled so far to pull it off!

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:13.100
I mean if it wasn't the revenge plot he was thinking of all that time? Well then what WAS he thinking of swimming to the Bahamas?!

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.280
*Double-Rainbow song playing in the background* *Jaws' singing along*

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.760
"Cross the sky...."

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.480
"Double Rainbow...."

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.020
"Cross the skyyy....."

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.900
But this time, Ellen decides the shark has gone too far!

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.180
It's time for Jaws to face his greatest opponent yet!

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.080
An aging, wrinkly, old blonde haired woman!

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.140
But everyone else decides, 'Hey! That's a fucking weak climax!'

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.480
So they get Michael Caine to fly them out to where she's headed.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.200
Michael: "It'll find her!"

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.820
"What do you know about it?"

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.660
"She got the idea in her head, that the shark that killed Martin and Sean is following the family!"

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.620
"Hey! He's not talking about our shark, eh?"

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.480
"What do you do when your not flying people?"

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.680
"I deliver laundry!"

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.080
Peculiarly weird line...

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.940
But it seems like Jaws is getting closer and closer to his target and the clock is ticking!

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.280
Critic Impersonating Caine: "It's okay! Shark's are terrified of aviation! Everybody knows this!"

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.120
So they land the plane in the water, which means now Jaws has four people he can munch on!

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.380
But for some reason, he doesn't go after the people already in the water and decides, instead, he's in the mood for British food!

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.340
"Ah, shit!"

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.460
Okay, this movie might be worth it just for that one line.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.600
"Ah, shit!"

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.340
I wish I could be so nonchalant about a great white coming after me!

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.120
Critic Impersonating Charlie Sheen: "Ch, Winning!"

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.400
Caine: "Give me a hand here, for Christ sake!"

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:08.500
Oh yeah, good thing an aging Michael Caine can outswim a giant killer shark without losing any of his limbs and coming out of the water almost completely dry!

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.420
Yeah, to quote what you just said earlier:

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.880
Ahhh, shit!

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.600
But it turns out, Jake might have an idea about how to fix the problem.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.520
"This is all theory though, if it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it."

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.120
Donatello: "According to the life force scanalyzer, these rampaging creatures are from Dimension X."

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.660
"If we rig an antenna on this, we got a slave unit that will shock the hell out of it."

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.360
Jake: "Right!"

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.920
Batman: "Sunlight could reverse the freezing process..."

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.140
Robin: "But it's morning in the Congo!"

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.820
"I'm rigging the receiver. If it works, we get it inside that bastard, and then we set it off!"

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.960
Data: "A positronic sub-processor detected high-frequency interfacing signatures from the organisms."

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.360
Yeah, the short version is a blinking light will make him mad, so that's what they try.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.460
"JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-"

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.780
Critic Impersonating Micheal: "I do my impression of a dolphin humping a goat for youuu!"

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.500
"AAAAAKE!"

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:04.040
Well because it worked so well the first time, they're going to try blinking the light on him again!

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.900
*Shark Roars (yes really)*

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.040
*Scoffs* Did that thing just roar?

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.060
*Shark roars again*(seriously, no joke)

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:20.120
Oh my God, that's Jaws roaring people! I wouldn't mind so much except I think I know where this roar came from!

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.840
This is the roar Jerry let out in a Tom and Jerry cartoon!

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.100
Seriously! Listen!

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.600
*Jerry roaring*

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.640
*Jaws' roaring again*

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.740
Well, gee, if you're gonna steal cartoon sound effects, there's a great boatload more you could of ripped from!

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.140
*Using the He-Man sound effect* "I HAVE THE POOWWWER!"

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.680
So Ellen, in a fit of rage, starts driving the boat towards the shark!

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.100
Not exactly sure what that's going to do? but let's find out!

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.500
Schnider: "Smile you son of a bitch!"

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.080
What the hell?!

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.520
He just... Blew up!

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.620
How the hell did the shark just blow up?!

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:03.080
Okay, all right, the other movies got bad but they at least had a reason why the shark blew up!

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.560
He didn't just spontaneously combust!

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.500
I mean, Jesus! Why are we so afraid of this thing if you if he could blow up this easily?!

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.660
It's like the worlds most sensitive shark!

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.440
*Little tap noise*

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.940
*Blowing up effect*

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.120
And get ready for dumb luck number two!

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.720
The black guy survives!

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.140
Yeah, look at him! Talking and everything!

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.840
You know what? I bet he actually feels better! I bet he actually feels better after getting eaten by a shark!

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.440
Micheal: "The hell are you doing alive, huh?"

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.840
Jake: "I tell ya, I tell ya, Uncle Jake's equipment don't crap out, eh?"

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.860
Well, I have no idea what you just said so we'll just say a wizard did it!

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:44.940
And that's it! That really is it! I don't know what makes the death of this shark more permanent than the the other three but it looks like this is finally, the last Jaws movie!

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.280
Thank God!

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.160
This is not only stupid, but it's mostly kind of a bore.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.680
The set up is crazy, the characters are not interesting and it mostly feels padded out!

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.320
The shark's not as fake the third film, but it's still pretty damn fake!

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.900
And for a film called 'The Revenge,' it's a pretty lame revenge!

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.440
Trust me when I say, it's safe to go back in the water,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.260
because anything is better than sitting in your living room and watching this piece of shit!

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.840
I'm the Nostalgia Critic... And I deliver laundry!
