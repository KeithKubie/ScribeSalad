00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.760
I keep losing socks in the dryer.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.660
I think the most likely explanation is lizard
people are hoarding them so they can assassinate

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.969
the Prime Minister of Malaysia.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.269
Hey co-conspirators, Julian hear for DNews.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.250
More people believe in conspiracy theories
than you might think, not just your crazy

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.190
uncle who lives in a shack in the woods.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.360
Multiple polls and studies estimate that about
half the population ascribes to at least one

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.160
conspiracy theory, believing that malevolent
forces are manipulating events in ways that

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.930
contradict the official narrative.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.079
Part of why so many people buy into alternative
explanations is because the world is a big

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.879
scary chaotic place, and our brains don’t
like that.

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.420
Dartmouth neuroscientist Paul Whalen explains
that when confronted with things we have no

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.250
control over like natural disasters or terrorist
attacks, our amygdalae, the part of the brain

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.590
that process fear, jump-start the parts of
our brains that processes information, looking

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.289
for some pattern or explanation, so it can
assess threats and plan the next step.

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.059
Unfortunately this is where math teams up
with neuroscience to trick your brain.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.019
Ramsey theory is the mathematical principle
that basically says given a data set large

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.929
enough, you can find just about any pattern
you like.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.390
And then the principle of confirmation bias,
where we tend to only seek out information

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.260
that agrees with what we already believe,
brings psychology into the mix, rounding out

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.580
the scientific conspiracy that makes you believe
in conspiracies.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.000
The Psychological principle of proportionality
bias is often involved too.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.230
It’s our tendency to believe that large
events have large causes.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.820
The idea that just one guy with a gun and
a good view from a book depository could murder

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.250
one of the most powerful people in the world
is unsatisfying, and we instinctively search

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.750
for bigger forces at work.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.170
But by that explanation we wouldn’t look
for conspiracies if we didn’t believe in

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.930
conspiracies, and according to University
of Kent psychologists, that tautology is exactly

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.130
the case; once you believe a shadowy cabal
pulled the strings behind one event, it becomes

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.480
much more likely that you’ll look for shadowy
cabals again and again.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.850
And herein lies another problem: sometimes
conspiracy theories turn out to be right.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.480
When the Nixon administration was accused
of burgling the Democratic National Committee’s

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.550
headquarters in 1972, the whole thing seemed
far fetched.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.000
But as it turns out that was exactly what
happened, and knowing that sometimes there

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.950
is a web of lies and deceit opens the door
to speculation about what else might have

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.710
an alternate explanation.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.080
Was the moon landing faked?

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.429
Do vaccines cause autism?

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.099
Is global warming a hoax?

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.189
No matter how many times scientific evidence
refutes those claims, some people still believe

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.189
it.

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:17.280
Because we’ve been burned before.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.700
Thanks Nixon.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.349
And often they even believe in it harder,
thanks to a phenomenon called the backfire

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.959
effect where people reject contradictory evidence
and double down on what they already believe.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.739
But while there are sometimes conspiracies
they usually don’t stay secret for long.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.450
This is less thanks to internet sleuths and
more thanks to the fact that people can’t

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.950
keep their mouths shut.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.510
According to Oxford University Physicist David
Robert Grimes the more people involved in

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.629
a conspiracy, the faster that conspiracy will
unravel.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.109
Grimes calculated the chances that a conspirator
would slip up on a given day was 1 in 250,000,

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.109
even in the most generous circumstances where
everyone was dedicated to the utmost secrecy

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.379
and no outside eyes were prying.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.300
What that means is a conspiracy with over
2500 people on board will probably only stay

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.749
secret for 5 years at most.

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:05.420
Considering that at its peak almost 50 years
ago the Apollo program employed 400,000 people,

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.890
I think it’s pretty safe to conclude we
did in fact land on the moon.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.280
One conspiracy I have actually heard is that
seat belts don’t save lives.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.340
Some people believe that if you’re not strapped
down in a serious crash you’ll be thrown

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.790
clear of danger, presumably landing in a field
of pillows and marshmallows.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.239
The actual science says that If you get in
a crash and you’re NOT wearing your seatbelt

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.730
you only have a 50/50 chance of surviving.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.730
No rewinds.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.730
No do-overs.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.849
So why do cops enforce seat belt laws?

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.510
Because seat belts save lives, and you might
not get a second chance to buckle up.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.550
Even if you get one of those newfangled self
driving cars, it’s still a good idea to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.550
wear a seatbelt.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.650
Not because the cars are unsafe, but because
other people are still out there driving like

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.650
maniacs!

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:52.060
Trace explains here.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:04.099
I’m sure some of you watching had a backfire
effect yourselves.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:13.450
What conspiracy do you think I’m covering
up?
