00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.690
Some of your favorite TV shows have some of
the greatest Easter eggs in them, ranging

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.540
from opening credits to hidden movie references.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.690
Show runners are creative individuals that
have a love for television and film, they

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.021
work very hard to hide these Easter eggs but
we do our best to find them for you.

00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:20.021
Whether you like sitcoms, dramas, superhero
or another type of shoe, we have you covered

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:21.021
in this video from Screen Rant.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.580

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.890
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Easter
Eggs That Take Popular TV Shows to Another

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:46.340
Level.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.340
Community

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.280
Dan Harmon was the show runner for Community
for the first three seasons but his perfectionism

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.649
and last minute script updates were not loved
by the network, maybe this had to do with

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.350
the lack of stellar ratings.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.180
So when production of season four started,
Harmon was out but in an unheard of move by

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.340
networks they brought him back in for season
five.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.860
In season five, at the end of the opening
credits there is a pencil tapped up to reference

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.090
Harmon trying to fix his beloved show.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.670
In former seasons there was no tape.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.920
And episode from Season 3 and season 5

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.490
The Walking Dead

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.170
When fan-favorite Daryl digs through his bag
of meds to help T-Dog out, there is a familiar

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.900
blue looking drug on the bottom of the bag.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.810
Remember that blue meth from the TV show,
Breaking Bad?

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.780
It looks like Daryl made a stop at Walter
White’s trailer before the apocalypse broke

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.750
out just in case someone needed…um, pain
meds.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.290
All we know is the blue product looks very
familiar and both shows were produced by AMC.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.620
An interesting hidden Easter egg from the
TV crew.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.620
Season 1, Episode 2

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.710
Friday Night Lights

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.340
Some people might forget that TV show Friday
Night Lights is not only a show starring Minka

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.670
Kelly but also the football team she roots
for, the Dillon Panthers.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.410
The football players have a “P” decal
on their helmets but realistically they would

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.970
have “D”, as that would stand for Dillon
High School.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.700
But the show runner Peter Berg wanted to play
homage to his feature film of the same name,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.930
so "P" is actually a reference to the Permian
Panthers.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.099
Did we mention Minka Kelly is in this show?

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.250
Daredevil

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.810
The law office of Nelson &amp; Murdock on Daredevil
pledges itself to defending those that wouldn't

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.459
be able to defend themselves, even if that
means only being paid in the form of food.

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.569
When Foggy receives a pie from a happy client
he replies, “Strawberry, rhubarb... you

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.629
will be mine..."

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:40.150
This is in reference to the movie Wayne’s
World when Wayne speaks of his desired guitar.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:48.090
The writers are fans of the SNL sketch and
wanted to show a little love to Mike Myers.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.090
Yeah baby!

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.969
Season 2, Episode 1

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.480
The Simpsons

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:03.510
Undeniable The Simpsons is one of the most
creative shows to ever air on television and

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.490
there is no way to know all the references
the writers and animators make.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.629
The opening credits are famous due to the
shows Couch Gag, but there is another reference

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:12.939
in those credits.

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.969
When the show first aired we see Maggie mistakenly
put through the scanner of a supermarket till

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.280
with a hidden Easter egg.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.390
Originally, the price came up as $847.63 referencing
the average monthly cost of raising a child

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.680
in America in 1989.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.450
That is just one of thousands of other references
The Simpsons have put in their long running

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.450
show.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.450
Season 1 Epsiode

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.450
Doctor Who

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.029
Starting over 50 years ago, Doctor Who has
garnered fans from all over the world.

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:44.750
The British science-fiction TV show depicts
the adventures of a Time Lord called "The

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.090
Doctor", an extraterrestrial being from the
planet Gallifrey.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.620
In early years of the show, the Doctor carried
around an umbrella quite often so when Clara

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.400
goes into a room full of old props, like the
Doctor’s cot, she briefly picks up an umbrella

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.069
with a bamboo handle.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.329
Even though the Doctor’s umbrellas were
mostly remembered as being fancier in the

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.170
earliest of the shows episodes they looked
just like this one.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.552
Bravo Moffat and prop department!

00:04:08.552 --> 00:04:10.069
Season 7, Journey To The Centre Of The Tardis

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.069
Supergirl

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.549
Lena Luthor is the half-sister of the infamous
Lex Luther and is now the CEO of L-Corp in

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.380
the television show Supergirl.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.100
In season two before boarding a helicopter
she admits to not enjoying flying, even admits

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.220
that “statistically speaking, it’s the
safest way to travel.”

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.190
This is a nod to what Superman first says
to Lois Lane when they meet for the first

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.820
time in Superman.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:40.500
It’s a great way to tip your hat to Christopher
Reeves.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.750
Season 2, Episode 1

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.800
Friends

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.970
One of Lisa Kudrow’s big breaks came from
the NBC sitcom Mad About You, she played a

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.550
less pleasant twin sister Ursula to Kudrow’s
Phoebe Buffay in Friends.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.140
When Helen Hunt and Leila Kenzie make cameo
appearances in Friends, the stumble across

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.140
Phoebe.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.640
They mistake Phoebe for Ursula and Phoebe
doesn’t know what to make of it.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.960
Not surprisingly she’s confused.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.660
A pretty cool cross over from two great sitcoms
with the great Lisa Kudrow.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.660
The One With Two Parts, Part 1

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.660
Sherlock

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.500
The elder brother to Sherlock Holmes, Mycroft
quotes the work of Oscar Wilde in the season

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.070
4 episode entitled The Final Problem.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.020
The quote is from Wilde’s The Importance
of Being Earnest and it’s when he says,

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.660
"truth is rarely pure and never simple."

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.970
This is a nod to Wilde who inspired Arthur
Conan Doyle to write his second novel about

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.900
the famed detective, The Sign of the Four.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.860
Interestingly the encounter between the two
writers also convince Wilde to write The Picture

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.280
of Dorian.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.900
Talk about inspiration.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.110
Season 4, The Final Problem

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.110
Stranger Things

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.190
Eleven, the Eggo eating character from the
hit TV series Stranger Things has a lot of

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.540
resemblances to Spielberg’s ET character.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.620
She’s a weird outsider, who is alone on
a planet and helps the main character mature.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.460
But the creators of the show say she’s based
off the anima character Elfen Lied, both are

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.180
psychic, young girls being experimented on
by a secret agency.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.580
These organizations are both run by a father
figure to the little girls and on their breakout

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.770
scenes they kill guards.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.840
On top of all that they are both given numbers
as names, not to mention Elfen sounds a lot

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.840
like Eleven.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:33.680
There you have it ten Easter Eggs That Take
Popular TV Shows to Another Level.
