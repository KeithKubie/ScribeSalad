00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:48.180
- Welcome to a conversation with history.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.430
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.020
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.207
Our guest today is Svante P채채bo,

00:00:55.207 --> 00:00:58.005
who is director of the Max Planck

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:02.120
Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.519
He's a Swedish biologist specializing

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.770
in evolutionary genetics.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.126
One of the founders of paleo-genetics,

00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:14.800
he has worked extensively
on the Neanderthal genome.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.127
He is the author of Neanderthal Man,

00:01:17.127 --> 00:01:19.970
In Search of Lost Genomes.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.280
He is at Berkeley in the fall of 2014

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.590
to give the Forester Lectures

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.590
on the immortality of the soul.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.820
Professor P채채bo, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.660
- Thank you.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.030
- [Harry] Where were you born and raised?

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.520
- I was born in Stockholm,
Sweden, and grew up there.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.870
- And looking back, how did you parents

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.713
shape your thinking about the world?

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.480
- Well, maybe my background
was a little unusual

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.010
in that I was, when I
was born to my mother,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.714
my father was already married
and had another family.

00:01:57.714 --> 00:01:59.989
So we were sort of the secret family.

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.989
My mother was a chemist and,
I think, influenced me a lot.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.350
My father was a biochemist.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.565
He had less of an
influence, but he did have

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:13.280
some influence in the background.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.407
He spent, like, Saturdays with us

00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:16.940
and always took an interest

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.660
in what I did and things like that.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.050
But it was really my mother, I think.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.408
- And he was a Nobel Laureate.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:25.550
- Yes, he eventually
then got a Nobel Prize.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.550
- And she was very supportive
of all of your interests

00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:36.325
as you grew up, and must
have been a powerful force

00:02:36.352 --> 00:02:40.322
in shaping your interest in science.

00:02:40.322 --> 00:02:44.165
- Yes and, I think, one thing
that influenced me a lot

00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:47.240
was that sometimes when I was 13 or so,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.098
she took me to Egypt, and
that's really when I discovered

00:02:50.098 --> 00:02:55.098
the ancient history that
became a fascination to me,

00:02:56.066 --> 00:03:00.240
as for many young people, I think.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.600
And she really sort of encouraged that.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.806
But also encouraged, I
think, a very, sort of,

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:10.030
quantitative, rigorous attitude to things,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.030
from her chemistry background.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.290
- And did you have an interest in mummies

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.067
before you went to Egypt, or
only after you went to Egypt?

00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:20.460
- That's really after I went to Egypt.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.150
It was such an experience for me

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.090
to realize that, in
Egypt, you can walk around

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.491
in sort of old ruined
fields where the ground

00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:31.820
almost is composed of pot shards

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.420
that are thousands of years old.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.890
And there are, you know,
these dubious antique dealers

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.640
that will offer you mummies
or pieces of mummies

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.260
that they at least claim
is from Pharaonic times.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.267
That there was so much things preserved

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:51.260
from thousands of years ago
really blew my mind at the time.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.872
- So it was almost
inevitable that you would

00:03:53.872 --> 00:03:56.620
become a scientist of some sort?

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.560
Or not necessarily.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.581
I mean, was your education
as a young person

00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:04.470
very supportive of your
interest in science?

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.020
- Well, I think my interest was then

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.470
really in Egyptology and archeology.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.914
And I thought I would
become an archeologist

00:04:11.914 --> 00:04:14.800
and excavate in Egypt and started

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.860
studying those things at university.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.190
And then, I think, it sort of showed

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.870
that I had a too romantic idea

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.650
about what Egyptology would be.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.543
I thought it would be more
Indiana Jones like things.

00:04:28.543 --> 00:04:32.520
So, and it was, at least
in Sweden at the time,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.150
very linguistically-oriented.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.700
You ended up studying, you know,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.500
ancient Egyptian verb
forms and things like that.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.180
So then I didn't really know what to do.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.414
I pursued these studies for what

00:04:44.414 --> 00:04:47.400
amounted to almost two years.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.180
- This is as an undergraduate.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.390
- This is at the university, yes.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.510
And then, I think, it was probably

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.571
due to my father's influence that I then,

00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:57.060
when I didn't know what to do,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.050
decided to study medicine

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.513
with an eye towards doing research.

00:05:03.464 --> 00:05:06.566
- And was his influence, did it emerge

00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:10.940
out of conversation?
Or knowing what he did?

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.200
- More from diffusion,
I think, than really,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.210
I mean, both my parents were very good

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.534
in supporting me in the
things I wanted to do

00:05:19.534 --> 00:05:22.130
and not trying to prescribe anything,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.970
which is probably a recipe
for disaster for young people.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.680
- And you, an idea that
emerges in your book,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.579
which is a very good
account of doing science

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:38.377
and the research that you've done, is,

00:05:38.377 --> 00:05:43.170
you have an adventure,
you are an adventurer.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.725
In other words, there's a little
bit of Indiana Jones in you

00:05:46.725 --> 00:05:50.363
in terms of exploring new frontiers.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.070
- Maybe, yeah.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.048
I sort of sometimes say to students,

00:05:56.048 --> 00:05:58.706
if they wonder if they should pursue a PhD

00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:02.300
is that you should only do
it if you really enjoy it,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.570
if you think it's fun, you know?

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.368
We're, probably, if we
come that far in life,

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:10.990
all smart enough to work
in an insurance company

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.230
or in a bank and earn much more money.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.645
The only reason to really do research

00:06:15.645 --> 00:06:18.803
is that you're fascinated by what you do

00:06:18.803 --> 00:06:21.600
and enjoy it every day.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.376
- So after undergraduate work,

00:06:24.376 --> 00:06:27.350
and realizing that you didn't wanna

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.622
just be alone with mummies,
as an Egyptologist,

00:06:30.622 --> 00:06:33.711
you decided to go to medical school.

00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:35.185
- [Svante] Yeah.

00:06:35.185 --> 00:06:39.307
- As the career that
you would pursue first.

00:06:39.307 --> 00:06:42.070
And what was it about medicine

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.958
that convinced you you had to do more?

00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.034
- In Sweden, it's still the situation

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:52.391
that you rather often go to medical school

00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:54.830
when you want to do basic research.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.433
That was really why I started.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.940
Then I more discovered, as I went along

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.840
and did the more clinical courses,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.953
that I also enjoyed seeing
patients very very much.

00:07:04.953 --> 00:07:09.667
And liked interaction with
people from all walks of life

00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:12.810
that you get as a doctor.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.520
So I was actually, I had a
little mini crisis about,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.304
should I stay and finish my medical degree

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:21.617
and become an MD, or do research?

00:07:21.617 --> 00:07:24.450
And I said, let's try
research, I can always

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.110
come back and finish it later.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.613
And that's where it
ended, I never came back.

00:07:29.613 --> 00:07:32.480
- And the research you chose to do,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.710
or what you got your PhD in, is?

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.020
- Is sort of molecular
immunology, if you like.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.740
How the virus deals with viral

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.983
infections and interacts with viruses.

00:07:45.983 --> 00:07:49.744
- One of the interesting
themes that emerges

00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:54.744
is your many careers, in a way,

00:07:56.432 --> 00:07:59.404
in your formative years in education.

00:07:59.404 --> 00:08:03.607
Medicine, molecular biology,

00:08:03.607 --> 00:08:08.607
with this passion for
ancient beings and artifacts.

00:08:10.863 --> 00:08:15.844
You really were drawing on
all of these disciplines

00:08:15.844 --> 00:08:18.800
later in life, in a way.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.229
So your education gave you entree

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:24.830
to new worlds that were opening up

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.990
that you then applied to this passion

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.563
that you had for ancient things.

00:08:31.563 --> 00:08:33.584
- Yes, and I think it's sort of

00:08:33.584 --> 00:08:37.299
a good thing with a sort
of university system

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.540
if it allows you to study different things

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.590
that you can then bring together.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.370
It was, of course, quite obvious for me

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.170
once I started to learn to manipulate DNA

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.917
and clone it in bacteria,
as we did at the time,

00:08:50.917 --> 00:08:54.667
to say, well, might there
not be DNA preserved

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:58.290
in all these hundreds
and thousands of mummies

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.660
of humans and animals that I knew

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.080
were stored in museums around the world

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.750
and were found in Egypt every year.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.420
So I started looking in the literature

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.370
to see if anyone had done anything,

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:13.410
and to my amazement, seen
that no one had tried it.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.800
So then it was pretty obvious to say,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.563
let's see if this can be done.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.960
- Before we pick up that theme,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.210
I wanna ask you about the skills you think

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:30.210
are required to be an
accomplished scientist.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.922
Obviously, you've suggested

00:09:37.922 --> 00:09:41.494
learning many specialties, in a way.

00:09:41.494 --> 00:09:42.920
Anything else?

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.920
- In some sense, I would say
that science is wonderful thing

00:09:48.185 --> 00:09:50.611
because there are many many different

00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:52.730
ways of being a good scientist.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.940
There's not just one way.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.193
There are those that are
incredibly knowledgeable

00:09:58.193 --> 00:10:02.430
and thoughtful and really think very hard

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.600
and then come up and do
the crucial experiments.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.890
There are those that try many many things,

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.813
one of them turns out to work out.

00:10:10.813 --> 00:10:14.320
And, of course, one way of doing it

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.310
is to bring together knowledges that are

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.630
normally not combined with each other,

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.040
which might be particularly fruitful to do

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.232
especially if you're not incredibly smart.

00:10:25.232 --> 00:10:28.019
Because, of course, if
you're sort of moving

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:31.780
into a field where many
other very smart people work

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.602
and say, I'm going to really
make a contribution here,

00:10:34.602 --> 00:10:36.668
you have to be very very smart yourself.

00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:40.000
But if you bring things
together from different areas,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.727
you necessarily don't have
to, sort of, be super smart.

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:48.394
- So, in terms of temperament,
you're suggesting,

00:10:48.394 --> 00:10:53.394
you suggest in your book, in
a way, being an experimenter,

00:10:55.186 --> 00:10:59.505
testing not just in the scientific sense,

00:10:59.505 --> 00:11:04.505
but in the sense of
trying different options,

00:11:05.267 --> 00:11:09.850
but then really persevering when passion

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.064
comes together with knowledge, in a way.

00:11:14.064 --> 00:11:16.816
- Yes, and I think one
sort of driving force

00:11:16.816 --> 00:11:19.857
was this feeling that it's
sort of very frustrating

00:11:19.857 --> 00:11:24.857
to study history purely from,
say, archeological remains,

00:11:25.082 --> 00:11:28.994
or even texts that you would
have from ancient Egypt,

00:11:28.994 --> 00:11:32.100
but not being able to
really know what happened.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.680
So there was some feeling
there, I think, and still is,

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.210
that if we can bring some
kind of rigor to this

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.290
and at least study the
population history directly,

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.978
not by inferring from
present-day variation

00:11:46.978 --> 00:11:49.254
or from old texts or from archeology

00:11:49.254 --> 00:11:52.133
what happened in the past,
but actually go back in time

00:11:52.133 --> 00:11:57.133
and look at what were the genetic
variants in the population

00:11:57.392 --> 00:12:00.980
that actually existed here 1000 years ago

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.993
or 10,000 years ago or
even 100,000 years ago,

00:12:03.993 --> 00:12:07.180
that that would be fascinating to do.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.324
- It's interesting, because
what paleontology had

00:12:11.324 --> 00:12:14.935
before your work, and the work of others

00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:19.370
who were moving in this
direction, was really artifacts,

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:24.370
things that were left
by prior civilizations

00:12:25.175 --> 00:12:29.471
or prehistoric humans, or whatever.

00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:34.471
Whereas what you're really focusing on

00:12:34.927 --> 00:12:39.927
is an empiricism that relies on the data

00:12:40.698 --> 00:12:43.716
that lies in the bones, in a way.

00:12:43.716 --> 00:12:44.940
- Yes.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.940
And I think even today, where
one infers population history

00:12:50.264 --> 00:12:54.165
from studying variation
today, under certain models

00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:58.368
and ideas of how things change
in populations over time,

00:12:58.368 --> 00:13:01.201
it is still extremely valuable to actually

00:13:01.201 --> 00:13:03.710
go back and test those things.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.006
And you often, more often
than not, get surprised,

00:13:07.006 --> 00:13:11.510
that things have not been as
you had thought in the past.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.285
- A theme in your book,
again, is the moment

00:13:14.285 --> 00:13:19.285
where creativity leads to discovery.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.959
And there have been several
points in your career

00:13:21.959 --> 00:13:25.768
that one could call wow moments.

00:13:25.768 --> 00:13:29.343
And one of them is one you just described,

00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:33.754
namely, when the technology came along

00:13:33.754 --> 00:13:38.754
and evolved to replicate DNA.

00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:42.462
That was a wow moment for you which you

00:13:42.462 --> 00:13:47.462
attached to your passion
for studying ancient things.

00:13:48.116 --> 00:13:50.320
Talk about that moment.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.701
I mean, was it something
that came suddenly,

00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:57.811
or did it evolve after much research?

00:13:57.811 --> 00:14:02.811
- A sort of, a theme, all the
way, over 30 years had been,

00:14:03.813 --> 00:14:08.690
can we extract and study
DNA from ancient remains?

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.834
And this then started when
one extracted this DNA

00:14:12.834 --> 00:14:15.760
and multiplied it in bacteria.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.361
So that was the first sort of experiment

00:14:18.361 --> 00:14:21.937
I did in the early '80s.

00:14:21.937 --> 00:14:23.980
And it was very frustrating,

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.790
because it's a very inefficient process.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.900
And you, above all, you can sort of

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.863
retrieve some DNA
sequences and study them,

00:14:31.863 --> 00:14:34.777
but you cannot repeat your
experiments, since it's so,

00:14:34.777 --> 00:14:37.540
to find the same piece of DNA again,

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.910
from that specimen, is almost impossible.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:41.743
- And explain that.

00:14:41.743 --> 00:14:44.704
In other words, in a way,
science was using bacteria,

00:14:44.704 --> 00:14:47.699
to ride on the back of bacteria

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:51.914
and its processes to replicate DNA.

00:14:51.914 --> 00:14:52.810
- Yes.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.960
So, you take your DNA from, say,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.102
an ancient bone or from a blood sample,

00:14:58.102 --> 00:15:02.699
you link it up with a
piece of bacterial DNA

00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:05.900
that then gives it the ability to multiply

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.520
itself when it's introduced into bacteria.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.530
So you use the bacteria as a
copying machine, if you like,

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:15.064
to make thousands and millions of copies

00:15:15.064 --> 00:15:18.010
of these small pieces of DNA.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.390
But it's a random process.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.726
You just happen to pick up some molecules.

00:15:22.726 --> 00:15:26.433
And it's very hard to then
find the same molecule again.

00:15:27.819 --> 00:15:31.160
And as biologists in general, really,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.035
sort of driven by technological advances,

00:15:34.035 --> 00:15:38.156
so then came the
polymerase chain reaction,

00:15:38.156 --> 00:15:42.638
which was an invention by Kary
Mullis here in the Bay Area.

00:15:42.638 --> 00:15:47.638
That is a possibility in the test tube

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.357
to multiply a predetermined piece of DNA,

00:15:51.357 --> 00:15:53.911
that you decide which
piece you're interest in

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:57.011
by synthetic pieces of
DNA that you sort of

00:15:57.011 --> 00:16:00.600
use to make many copies of it.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.734
And it was obvious from day one

00:16:02.734 --> 00:16:04.340
when I heard about that thing

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.762
that it might be ideal for
studying ancient remains.

00:16:07.762 --> 00:16:10.919
So that's then what I started working on,

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:15.180
first back in Europe and
then over almost four years

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.269
as a post-doc here at
Berkeley with Alan Wilson,

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:21.670
which was a fascinating
time, because suddenly

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:25.037
we could go back and actually
reproduce our experiments.

00:16:25.037 --> 00:16:29.205
So we could amplify, for
example, a piece of a moa,

00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:32.550
an extinct flightless
bird from New Zealand,

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.320
and then repeat it again
from the same individual

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.646
and from other individuals
to really make sure

00:16:37.646 --> 00:16:41.160
that the DNA sequences
we got were correct.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.032
Up to that with these bacteria,

00:16:43.032 --> 00:16:45.087
one had never really been able to be sure

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:47.910
if this was a contaminating piece

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.940
of DNA that actually came from me

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.850
or some museum curator
or something like that,

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.713
and in many cases they actually were.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.677
- You quote Jared Diamond as saying

00:17:00.677 --> 00:17:05.157
"All specimens constitute
a vast, irreplaceable

00:17:05.157 --> 00:17:07.738
"source of material for
directly determining

00:17:07.738 --> 00:17:11.637
"historical changes in gene frequencies,

00:17:11.637 --> 00:17:13.841
"which is among the most important

00:17:13.841 --> 00:17:17.380
"data in evolutionary biology."

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.273
So that description, in a way,

00:17:19.273 --> 00:17:23.615
is what came to be, really, by your work.

00:17:23.615 --> 00:17:26.587
And interestingly
enough, but all this time

00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:31.587
you're keeping this passionate
focus on ancient things.

00:17:32.895 --> 00:17:34.436
- Yes, it's really this thing

00:17:34.436 --> 00:17:37.340
of going back and saying, we should try

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.140
to catch evolution
red-handed, if you like,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:45.023
to be able to actually
see what was in the past.

00:17:46.086 --> 00:17:51.086
- Now, in the case of ancient DNA,

00:17:51.415 --> 00:17:53.494
there are all kinds of problems,

00:17:53.494 --> 00:17:55.920
and I wanna talk about them.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.720
You touched on it a moment ago.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.121
So really, it's not as if, okay,

00:18:01.121 --> 00:18:04.999
let's take a DNA sample
from everybody who's living

00:18:04.999 --> 00:18:06.996
who's in the room with us.

00:18:06.996 --> 00:18:10.990
Let's talk about some
of, go into more detail

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.985
with the problems with ancient DNA.

00:18:13.985 --> 00:18:17.290
The first problem is really

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.720
the contamination that you talked about.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.960
- Yes, what really became clear

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.505
over the first years of work with this

00:18:23.505 --> 00:18:28.010
was that DNA in an ancient specimen,

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.274
even if it's just a few
hundred years old, actually,

00:18:30.274 --> 00:18:32.880
is always degraded to short pieces.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.460
It's chemically modified,

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.925
which makes it hard to make copies of it.

00:18:37.925 --> 00:18:42.012
And there's often very
very little of it there,

00:18:42.012 --> 00:18:45.585
So, in the beginning,
when we did, or I did,

00:18:45.585 --> 00:18:49.976
experiments, just on the
lab bench in my normal lab,

00:18:49.976 --> 00:18:52.217
extracted it from an ancient mummy,

00:18:52.217 --> 00:18:55.328
cloned it in bacteria,
and found some human DNA.

00:18:55.328 --> 00:18:58.970
In reality, that was almost always DNA

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:03.220
from myself or from some
other people in the room.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.580
It turned out, for example, that dust,

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.134
in a room like this
where people move around,

00:19:08.134 --> 00:19:10.607
is to a big extent small skin fragments

00:19:10.607 --> 00:19:13.521
that actually, each little dust particle

00:19:13.521 --> 00:19:15.797
can contain much much more DNA

00:19:15.797 --> 00:19:18.780
than what there is in a gram of tissue

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.880
from an ancient Egyptian
mummy, for example.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.410
So gradually I sort of came to be

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.941
more and more paranoid, if
you like, about contamination,

00:19:27.941 --> 00:19:31.842
separating this type of
work in a separate room.

00:19:31.842 --> 00:19:35.680
You have UV light at night to destroy DNA,

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.170
you wash everything in bleach,

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.250
started dressing in protective clothing

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.160
that you could discard
after each experiment.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.090
We started saying that you can only

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.300
go in there in the morning when
you come to the laboratory.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.658
You should not have entered
any other laboratory

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:57.450
where there are large
amounts of DNA being handled.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:02.170
And step by step, we slowly
got this under control.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.953
- And the pieces were
very short that you were

00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:08.010
able to extract from the ancient material.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.410
- Yes, so whereas, say,
from a blood sample

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.900
from someone today,
you can easily retrieve

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.948
10,000, 20,000 base pair long of these

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:18.990
letters in the code, long fragments,

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.939
here we have things that are 50, 60,

00:20:21.939 --> 00:20:25.515
hardly ever up to 150.

00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:29.834
- And through time there are
a lot of chemical reactions

00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:34.834
acting on the bone fragments,
say, that decompose the DNA.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.070
Water, for example, is one of the things.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.903
- Yes.

00:20:41.903 --> 00:20:46.540
So, DNA is a very hydrophilic molecule.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.260
It sort of absorbs water
molecules around it.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.241
So even in an environment
that we think is dry,

00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:55.670
there is water around the DNA molecule.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.610
And that leads to reactions, some of them

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.983
break the DNA into smaller pieces.

00:21:00.983 --> 00:21:03.259
There's others that modify one

00:21:03.259 --> 00:21:06.567
of the four letters in
the genetic code, the C,

00:21:06.567 --> 00:21:09.679
so that when we study
them, they turn up as,

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:14.679
they look as another base, another, T.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.660
So there are certain types of errors

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.896
that you can actually then
sometimes use to your advantage,

00:21:19.896 --> 00:21:23.600
to say, I really believe this DNA is old

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.793
because I see these types
of modifications in it.

00:21:27.883 --> 00:21:30.925
- And so the cleaning process,

00:21:30.925 --> 00:21:34.385
help our audience visualize
the cleaning process.

00:21:34.385 --> 00:21:39.180
It's one, we see now,
with epidemics emerging,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.431
the way the personnel treating

00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:47.365
those suffering from the illness,

00:21:47.365 --> 00:21:52.365
the outfits they wear, the
decontamination process

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.525
we see there, is what you brought

00:21:56.525 --> 00:21:59.416
to the process of looking at ancient DNA.

00:21:59.416 --> 00:22:00.810
- Yes.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.780
So it looks, on the surface
of it, very similar.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.906
You sort of dress up in a sort of,

00:22:05.906 --> 00:22:10.248
outside the room, you work
in this special clothing.

00:22:10.248 --> 00:22:12.900
You work in a hood.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.070
But what we really do is
protect our experiment

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.660
from ourselves, from
the DNA we would shed.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.240
But it looks very much like, say,

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.665
your chip factory where
you make computer chips.

00:22:26.665 --> 00:22:30.490
So the air is filtered so
there is no dust there.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.750
There is high pressure in the room

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.550
so that dust cannot come in,

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.623
but the air sort of flows out of it.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.977
- Now another problem that
you encountered in this work

00:22:42.977 --> 00:22:46.590
is, where are the bones, basically.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.478
And once you know where the bones are,

00:22:49.478 --> 00:22:53.472
getting the various bureaucracies at play

00:22:53.472 --> 00:22:55.875
that control the bones

00:22:55.875 --> 00:23:00.090
to give you some piece of the specimen.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.760
Talk a little bit about that.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.499
Because that was a, as you
describe it in your book,

00:23:06.499 --> 00:23:11.061
byzantine maneuvering
and political instincts

00:23:11.061 --> 00:23:13.476
were required on your part.

00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:15.930
- Yes, that's, of course, very different

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.110
in each place and in each country

00:23:19.946 --> 00:23:23.310
And my experience, it's generally easy

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.980
to deal with the people who have

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.790
actually excavated and
discovered the things.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.920
And, of course, I respect very much

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.246
that if you discovered
a bone, you sort of,

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:39.246
you feel a sort of
scientific ownership of it,

00:23:39.401 --> 00:23:41.423
which is totally appropriate.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.500
What often happens,
though, is that there are

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.990
museum curators that sort of inherit

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.960
the keys to the cupboard for things

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.600
that were found maybe
50, 60, 70 years ago,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.110
and then controls it as if it
were their private property.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:02.170
And that's what sometimes
makes me a little upset.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.620
So then it's, of course,
they need, of course,

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.110
to balance the sort of, that the specimens

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.200
are often valuable and should
be preserved for the future

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.857
against the scientific knowledge

00:24:13.857 --> 00:24:17.114
you could gain by actually studying them.

00:24:17.114 --> 00:24:19.170
But it's, of course, also the case

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.580
that we can often study fragments of bones

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.440
that have very little morphological value.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.370
For example, the bones
we first used to make

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.455
the first version of
the Neanderthal genome

00:24:29.455 --> 00:24:32.091
were from fragments that
one could not for sure

00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:34.380
tell if they came from a cave bear

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.860
or from a Neanderthal, for example.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.848
So then there is obviously
very little value

00:24:38.848 --> 00:24:42.377
from studying these bones morphologically.

00:24:42.377 --> 00:24:45.077
And then it can get frustrating sometimes,

00:24:45.077 --> 00:24:47.970
and it's still hard to get
access to these things.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.400
- And, in several cases, the bones were

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.150
actually in the countries that were

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:56.658
formerly part of the Eastern Bloc.

00:24:56.658 --> 00:24:59.618
The first important set, I
think, were in East Germany,

00:24:59.618 --> 00:25:03.050
when that country was still divided.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:08.010
And then there was a real find in Croatia.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.400
- [Svante] Yes, yes.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.621
- Which probably made the
bureaucracies even worse

00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:14.874
to the extent that they were remnants

00:25:14.874 --> 00:25:17.297
of the old Soviet system.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.740
- Yes, many of these
things have been found

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.638
in former socialist countries.

00:25:24.638 --> 00:25:27.610
And, of course, the
structure of how science

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.897
works there is partially different.

00:25:29.897 --> 00:25:33.406
The academies of science
are very influential,

00:25:33.406 --> 00:25:36.120
and things like that.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.793
- Talk a little about science itself,

00:25:38.793 --> 00:25:43.390
because it seems that
one element of science

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:47.558
is cooperation, international,
you're working with

00:25:47.558 --> 00:25:52.558
scientists all over the
world on the one hand.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.500
As you mentioned, you were here

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.621
in Berkeley for several years.

00:25:59.621 --> 00:26:03.325
But on the other hand,
competition, basically.

00:26:03.325 --> 00:26:05.403
Who's gonna get to the press first

00:26:05.403 --> 00:26:09.050
with whatever revelations emerge.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:14.050
- Yes, so, there is sort of
this tension all the time.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:20.020
And I think competition, to
some extent, is good, right?

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.920
It sort of keeps you on your toes

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.930
and makes things go faster
than they would otherwise.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:29.898
But above all, I think, what
is so great with science

00:26:29.898 --> 00:26:33.670
is the cooperation,
the fact that, sort of,

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.609
we're analyzing the
genomes we now produce.

00:26:36.609 --> 00:26:40.780
We work together with
people all over the world,

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.523
but particularly here
in the U.S., actually,

00:26:42.523 --> 00:26:46.300
particularly, say, Monty
Slatkin's group here at Berkeley

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.948
and David Reich and his
collaborators at the Broad Institute

00:26:49.948 --> 00:26:52.375
and at Harvard and many other places.

00:26:52.375 --> 00:26:55.910
And that you can really,
with today's technology too,

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:57.790
work very closely together.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.897
You can have video conferences every week,

00:27:00.897 --> 00:27:03.430
and actually really have a feeling

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.490
you work together towards the goal.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.660
And in this project it
was particularly nice,

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.830
because everyone involved
really had a feeling

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:15.830
this was a unique first view
on an extinct form of humans.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:20.140
So it was amazing how
everybody pulled together

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.230
and worked unselfishly to
sort of arrive at things.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.380
- You were fortunate in
the sense that you were

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.398
invited to be part of an institute

00:27:30.398 --> 00:27:35.398
that was being founded that
focused on evolutionary biology,

00:27:37.828 --> 00:27:40.440
the Max Planck Institute.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.340
Talk a little bit about that,

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.650
because in every great
scientific breakthrough

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.498
there is a team that's put together,

00:27:48.498 --> 00:27:51.075
and you were fortunate enough

00:27:51.075 --> 00:27:55.940
to be part of a process
putting a new team together

00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:00.940
that drew all sorts of disciplines
together on the one hand,

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.078
but also were focused, not on disciplines,

00:28:04.078 --> 00:28:08.600
but on the particular that
problem that interested you.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.300
- Yes, I was sort of very very lucky

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.223
to be in Germany, happened
to be in Germany then,

00:28:14.223 --> 00:28:17.750
at a time when there
was a political decision

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.420
to build up science in East Germany,

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.080
and particularly the Max Planck Institute

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.366
which was focused on basic research,

00:28:25.366 --> 00:28:27.860
to the same density in the East

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.042
as there was in the old West
German part of the country.

00:28:32.042 --> 00:28:35.293
And there was then the
will to focus on things

00:28:35.293 --> 00:28:39.430
where German science would
be particularly weak.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.790
And once such area was,
of course, anthropology,

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.710
because of the terrible history

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.450
in Germany with the Holocaust.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.910
And so, there had been
a sort of predecessor

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.430
organization to the Max
Planck Society before the war,

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.350
where many, Max Planck and other

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.176
very excellent scientists had worked,

00:28:58.176 --> 00:29:02.160
but it had gotten very
involved with the Nazi crimes

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.736
and had an institute in anthropology

00:29:04.736 --> 00:29:08.360
that was involved in the Holocaust.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.460
So since 1945, one had not
touched the subject, really,

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.083
for very good reasons.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.681
But now it was a feeling
maybe one should do it again.

00:29:17.681 --> 00:29:21.190
And I think it was maybe
even a little easier for me,

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:24.345
as an outsider working in Germany, to say,

00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:27.909
we cannot have, sort of,
what happened in the past,

00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:30.060
dictate what we can do now.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.530
We have to be able to go forward.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.315
And once one sort of made
that courageous decision,

00:29:36.315 --> 00:29:39.400
to found an institute in
evolutionary anthropology,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.160
it turned out to be almost an advantage

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.220
to have no traditions to fall back on.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.000
We could sort of sit down the people

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.790
that were involved in starting
this institute and say,

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:55.010
how would we today start it,
if we do it from scratch?

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.530
And what we ended up doing was sort of

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.290
focusing it on a question
rather than a discipline.

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.070
So sort of the question,
what makes humans unique

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.970
in comparison to other organisms?

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.197
So as long as you work on this

00:30:06.197 --> 00:30:08.080
and as long as you work empirically,

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.320
was the other sort of litmus test,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.230
you could work there, no
matter where you came from.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.680
So there are comparative
linguists, for example,

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.807
that study what's unique
about human language.

00:30:18.807 --> 00:30:21.512
There are primatologists
that study the behavior

00:30:21.512 --> 00:30:24.090
of our closest living relatives,

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.258
chimps and gorillas and
orangs, in the wild, in Africa.

00:30:28.258 --> 00:30:30.139
There are comparative psychologists

00:30:30.139 --> 00:30:34.280
that do experiments in the zoo in Leipzig,

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.730
on apes, the children during development,

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.700
and try to do the same experiments

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.870
in human children as they grow,

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.233
to find differences and
similarities in how they evolved.

00:30:44.233 --> 00:30:49.098
And there's paleontologists
that then excavate

00:30:49.098 --> 00:30:51.960
the remains of Neanderthals
and modern humans.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.392
And there is genetics, where we then focus

00:30:54.392 --> 00:30:58.463
on comparisons to our
closest extinct relatives.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.850
- So, in a way,
metaphorically, this is about

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.082
building bridges between disciplines,

00:31:07.082 --> 00:31:10.054
and then building a bridge to the past

00:31:10.054 --> 00:31:13.711
where you can come to understand

00:31:13.711 --> 00:31:18.711
the leaps that our ancestors,
the pre-human ancestors,

00:31:20.247 --> 00:31:23.568
made to make us what we are today.

00:31:23.568 --> 00:31:24.920
- Yes.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.470
And I think the problem is always

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.980
to get these bridges between disciplines

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.891
to really work, to really
understand each other.

00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:36.140
And I think a critical thing there

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.350
that sort of made this
work as well as it did

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:43.339
was really to focus on scientists
that do empirical work.

00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:47.298
Because I can actually
understand what a linguist does,

00:31:47.298 --> 00:31:49.423
although I'm not a linguist at all,

00:31:49.423 --> 00:31:51.670
if they just take the time

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.490
to explain to me what the data is,

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:56.134
what the hypothesis that
tests for this data is.

00:31:56.134 --> 00:32:00.460
And then one can have
a fruitful interaction.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.415
- Science, as you
describe it in your book,

00:32:02.415 --> 00:32:05.422
is a social process.

00:32:05.422 --> 00:32:09.787
And, on the one hand, there is the process

00:32:09.787 --> 00:32:12.121
of interaction with these colleagues

00:32:12.121 --> 00:32:14.628
that start in other disciplines,

00:32:14.628 --> 00:32:17.519
but on the other hand,
there is the interaction

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:21.095
with your own group, and
bringing to that group

00:32:21.095 --> 00:32:25.437
problems that are emerging
as you're doing the research,

00:32:25.437 --> 00:32:30.437
and through conversation and
discussion and criticism,

00:32:31.393 --> 00:32:33.773
really finding the way forward.

00:32:33.773 --> 00:32:38.773
- Yes, I think it's certainly
a social process, science.

00:32:38.812 --> 00:32:41.564
And really, in our case,

00:32:41.564 --> 00:32:44.431
the crucial thing is really the group.

00:32:44.431 --> 00:32:48.321
The group, as an entity,
is much much smarter

00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:51.223
than any individual in that group.

00:32:51.223 --> 00:32:54.625
And my role is then often just to sort of

00:32:54.625 --> 00:32:58.570
catalyze that lots of
ideas are put forward

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.800
in weekly discussions we
have about the projects,

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.410
and sort of maybe sort of identify

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:10.940
some ideas that come out as
particularly worth to pursue.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.224
But it's really, when
the groups works well,

00:33:13.224 --> 00:33:15.650
it's almost impossible to say even

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.030
who comes up with the idea,

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.016
because it's a process
that you do together.

00:33:20.016 --> 00:33:23.030
- And there also is another aspect here

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.580
that has both a positive
and a negative quality,

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:30.580
which is that there is the
word conventional wisdom

00:33:31.394 --> 00:33:36.394
about this domain and what we understand.

00:33:37.082 --> 00:33:41.692
When you're doing innovative
work like you are doing,

00:33:41.692 --> 00:33:45.453
then you have to overcome the obstacles

00:33:45.453 --> 00:33:50.453
of the conventional
wisdom about what we know.

00:33:50.852 --> 00:33:53.929
- Yes, I think that's, almost one quality

00:33:53.929 --> 00:33:58.130
that is good in a scientist is
a little bit of an anarchist,

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.233
to be able to sort of
almost take a delight

00:34:00.233 --> 00:34:03.193
in questioning this
sort of received wisdom

00:34:03.193 --> 00:34:06.393
and hope to overthrow it.

00:34:08.086 --> 00:34:11.080
You cannot believe in authority

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.990
or believe what is in the textbooks.

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:17.265
You must be able to go
back to first principles

00:34:17.265 --> 00:34:20.300
and say, how do we actually know the thing

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.480
that is there in the textbook?

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.673
Could it be wrong?

00:34:24.672 --> 00:34:28.230
Could the whole world be wrong
and we be right, actually?

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.020
There is some delusion of grandeur,

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.560
or what you like, there, that sort of,

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.250
to be able to instill in the students

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:36.940
and people in your group this feeling

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.890
that you actually might be right

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:40.763
and the whole world might be wrong.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:47.020
- You say at one point,
"I am driven by curiosity,

00:34:48.061 --> 00:34:51.723
"by asking the questions
where do we come from

00:34:51.723 --> 00:34:54.497
"and what were the important events

00:34:54.497 --> 00:34:58.540
"in our history that made us who we are."

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.450
So now that we've cut through the brush,

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.430
talked about all the obstacles,

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.444
talked about the impact of technology

00:35:06.444 --> 00:35:09.231
and the problems with the DNA,

00:35:09.231 --> 00:35:12.749
help us understand what you and your group

00:35:12.749 --> 00:35:17.749
were able to achieve with
regard to Neanderthal man.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.730
- So, there had, of course,

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:24.372
been a debate for decades in paleontology,

00:35:24.372 --> 00:35:28.890
what really happened when modern
humans came out of Africa,

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:31.530
starting around 100,000 years ago,

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:36.170
really seriously spreading from
around 50, 60,000 years ago,

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.550
when they met Neanderthals, what happened?

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.360
Did they mix with each other or not?

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.601
Is there a contribution from Neanderthals

00:35:42.601 --> 00:35:45.513
to people in Europe today?

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.530
And it had been a long long debate

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:52.853
with really no clear resolution of that.

00:35:52.853 --> 00:35:56.405
And when we then finally got a version

00:35:56.405 --> 00:35:58.080
of the Neanderthal genome,

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.340
I could then directly compare that genome

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.770
to people living in different
parts of the world today.

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.640
And what one found was that there were

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.510
pieces in the Neanderthal genome, or,

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.140
pieces in the genomes of people today

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.760
that were very close to
the Neanderthal genome.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.129
And you found those pieces in Europe,

00:36:17.129 --> 00:36:21.170
in Asia, and not in Africa.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.677
And by various sort of analyses,

00:36:23.677 --> 00:36:25.930
particularly then by people like

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.970
David Reich and Nick Patterson

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.500
at Harvard and Monty Slatkin here,

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.150
one could sort of show that the only way,

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.110
really, to explain that is that we mixed

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.410
with Neanderthals rather recently,

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:42.091
around 50, 60, 70,000 years ago.

00:36:42.091 --> 00:36:42.924
- That is, humans.

00:36:42.924 --> 00:36:43.920
- [Svante] Humans, yes.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.010
Modern humans mixed with Neanderthals.

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.717
And so that, in the order
of one or two percent

00:36:50.717 --> 00:36:53.030
of the genomes of everybody

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.674
outside Africa come from Neanderthals.

00:36:55.674 --> 00:36:59.413
So it was clear that we did mix,

00:36:59.413 --> 00:37:02.292
but it was also not that one found that

00:37:02.292 --> 00:37:06.290
Neanderthal contribution
only when Neanderthals

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.430
had existed in Western Asia and Europe.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.760
We found it even in China

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.880
and Papua New Guinea and Native Americans.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.028
So the model that has come out of that

00:37:15.028 --> 00:37:19.090
is that, when modern
humans came out of Africa,

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:21.808
they rather early mixed with Neanderthals,

00:37:21.808 --> 00:37:25.510
and those modern humans may then later,

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.260
here and there, have mixed
with Neanderthals again,

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.620
but overall, they become the ancestors

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.790
of everybody outside Africa.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:35.360
So that, no matter where people come from,

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.670
if they are from outside Africa,

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:41.520
they have at least, say, about
a percent of Neanderthal DNA.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.947
- So what surprised you,
when all the data came in

00:37:44.947 --> 00:37:49.260
and all these procedures
had been implemented

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:54.260
to find pure DNA, was
this, you were surprised

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.717
and your team were surprised
by this two percent

00:37:58.717 --> 00:38:02.478
of Neanderthal DNA in the human genome?

00:38:02.478 --> 00:38:06.630
- Yes, I was biased to
think it had not happened,

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:08.390
because we had, earlier in the '90s,

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.220
studied just a tiny part
of the Neanderthal genome,

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.252
the mitochondrial genome,

00:38:13.252 --> 00:38:17.610
which is inherited only
from mothers to offspring

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.240
and is a very small part of the genome.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.723
And there, we had found no
evidence of mixture whatsoever.

00:38:24.723 --> 00:38:26.580
So I was biased.

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.957
I sort of knew, of course, that
that wasn't the full story,

00:38:30.957 --> 00:38:34.180
but I was biased to
think we had not mixed.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.800
So, for the longest
time, I sort of thought

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.100
there might, after all, be
some mistake in what we do.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.798
We might have some
contamination we overlooked.

00:38:43.798 --> 00:38:48.330
But in the end, it was
sort of completely clear

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:50.390
that that was not the situation.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:55.269
- So you had to confirm by
analysts outside of your group

00:38:55.269 --> 00:38:57.498
that what you were doing

00:38:57.498 --> 00:39:00.490
and the conclusion you
had reached was right.

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:01.561
- Yes.

00:39:01.561 --> 00:39:03.490
I mean, the theoretical
analysis for a large part

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:06.460
done by these other groups I mentioned,

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.520
and actually by different approaches,

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.256
or at least three different,
independent approaches

00:39:11.256 --> 00:39:14.762
that came to the same conclusion.

00:39:14.762 --> 00:39:17.467
- What do you think this means,

00:39:17.467 --> 00:39:22.467
that we, that our ancestor
was, in some ways,

00:39:24.572 --> 00:39:29.150
and in some small parts, Neanderthal man?

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:32.363
Do you draw any larger
conclusions from that?

00:39:32.363 --> 00:39:36.410
Other than really impacting the theories

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:39.040
that were out there about the movements

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.021
of people in prehistoric times.

00:39:43.021 --> 00:39:46.713
- Well, so, it's beginning
now, in the years,

00:39:46.713 --> 00:39:49.583
in the few years since we've done this,

00:39:49.583 --> 00:39:51.363
it's already becoming evident

00:39:51.363 --> 00:39:54.149
that some of this
contribution from Neanderthals

00:39:54.149 --> 00:39:58.062
had some sort of real effects.

00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:01.835
So, for example, there's
a group at Stanford,

00:40:01.835 --> 00:40:05.585
Peter Parham has shown that some genes

00:40:05.585 --> 00:40:08.290
that are involved in
regulating the immune system

00:40:09.778 --> 00:40:12.345
have been contributed from Neanderthals

00:40:12.345 --> 00:40:16.573
and relatives of Neanderthals
in Asia to present-day people.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.181
And one can easily imagine
that that has to do with,

00:40:20.181 --> 00:40:24.036
that these modern humans
come out of Africa,

00:40:24.036 --> 00:40:26.360
meet these groups that have lived

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.192
for several hundreds of thousands of years

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:30.850
in other environments and have

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.400
adapted to infectious diseases there.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.938
When they then mix a little bit

00:40:34.938 --> 00:40:37.306
and genes come over that are advantageous

00:40:37.306 --> 00:40:41.193
to fight those infections,
they rise to high frequency.

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:46.850
There is a risk variant
that was found this January

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:50.031
for type two diabetes, a type of diabetes

00:40:50.031 --> 00:40:52.480
you get in old age that is high frequency

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.860
in Asia and in Native Americans,

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.770
that also comes from Neanderthals.

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.412
One can easily imagine
that is an adaptation

00:40:59.412 --> 00:41:04.000
to starvation, to store energy better.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.790
And today we get diabetes when we

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:09.512
store energy too well when
we eat well all the time.

00:41:09.512 --> 00:41:11.800
And there is a recent paper here

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.098
from Berkeley, from
Rasmus Nielsen's group,

00:41:14.098 --> 00:41:17.628
that has showed fascinatingly
that people in Tibet

00:41:17.628 --> 00:41:19.687
who live on the high plateau in Tibet

00:41:19.687 --> 00:41:23.955
and are adapted to living at
a low oxygen tension there

00:41:23.955 --> 00:41:28.773
have gotten a variant that
helps with that ability

00:41:28.773 --> 00:41:32.240
from relatives of Neanderthals
that we have discovered,

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.660
these Denisovans in Asia.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:38.830
And 80 percent of Tibetans
have that variant today.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.043
So one cat put this sort of,
it's beginning to emerge,

00:41:42.043 --> 00:41:47.043
picture of adaptive
introgression, as we say,

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.860
saying that genes come over
from these other groups,

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.260
some of them are
advantageous and will then

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.343
rise to high frequency
and actually have impact.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.188
- Another place where this
has great implications

00:42:01.188 --> 00:42:05.438
is the study of the brain and how

00:42:05.438 --> 00:42:08.210
it functions and how it evolves.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.498
And, as part of your collaboration

00:42:11.498 --> 00:42:16.014
with your colleagues at other disciplines,

00:42:16.014 --> 00:42:19.710
I guess you learned and focused a little

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.683
on what is called the FOXP2.

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.024
Tell us how genes became important

00:42:25.024 --> 00:42:29.470
in understanding a small
group of living humans,

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:33.673
and what it might point to with regard

00:42:33.673 --> 00:42:37.530
to the connection with Neanderthals.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:39.966
- Yes, so, there's one thing,
as we discussed so far,

00:42:39.966 --> 00:42:44.052
what came over in Neanderthals
to people outside Africa.

00:42:44.052 --> 00:42:46.456
But it's another set of questions

00:42:46.456 --> 00:42:49.207
that is even more
fascinating to me, almost,

00:42:49.207 --> 00:42:53.282
and that is to day, in
what part of our genome

00:42:53.282 --> 00:42:57.590
do all humans today, no matter
where we live on the planet,

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:59.770
in Europe, in Africa, or in Asia,

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:02.907
have something in common that's
not there in Neanderthals

00:43:02.907 --> 00:43:04.940
and where the Neanderthals look like

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.820
the chimpanzees and other apes.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.163
So those things that are actually unique

00:43:10.163 --> 00:43:12.427
to all present-day humans, that define

00:43:12.427 --> 00:43:15.527
modern humans genetically, if you like.

00:43:15.527 --> 00:43:19.380
And that list of things is not very long.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:23.445
It's a bit over 30,000
changes in our genome.

00:43:23.445 --> 00:43:27.810
So, to just expand on that a little bit,

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.950
so whereas, say, I differ from you

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.190
or from a Neanderthal at, say,

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:34.880
three million positions in the genome,

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.880
if we make the requirement that we

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.410
all today should share something

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.190
and be different from the
Neanderthal and other apes,

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:44.494
it's just 30,000 such changes.

00:43:44.494 --> 00:43:47.373
So a dream is that among these will hide

00:43:47.373 --> 00:43:50.170
some of the changes that are crucial

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:52.640
for what made modern humans so special,

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.640
that we expanded from being a
few hundred thousand people,

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.439
that's more like the Neanderthals,

00:43:57.439 --> 00:44:00.318
to being seven billion today that made us

00:44:00.318 --> 00:44:03.732
able to develop technology that today

00:44:03.732 --> 00:44:07.505
is incredibly different
from 100,000 years ago,

00:44:07.505 --> 00:44:12.505
to develop art, music, many
many other such things.

00:44:13.008 --> 00:44:16.839
Of course, we don't know
what those changes are.

00:44:16.839 --> 00:44:21.200
But they presumably have something to do

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.310
with how the brain functions.

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:24.570
There's special interest now,

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:26.685
we and others in the
world are particularly

00:44:26.685 --> 00:44:29.790
looking at this list of
things, thinking about,

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:33.680
are there things there that
might be important for this?

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.100
- And in the case of the FOXP2,

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:40.160
there was a family that
had difficulty speaking.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:40.993
- [Svante] Yes.

00:44:40.993 --> 00:44:44.610
- And you learned about that
from a colleague, I guess.

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:48.475
So then it becomes interesting to see

00:44:48.475 --> 00:44:51.856
if any of these differences in the genome

00:44:51.856 --> 00:44:55.223
can be attributed to that.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:00.869
- Yes, so, this gene, FOXP2,
is one of very few genes

00:45:00.869 --> 00:45:03.310
that we know have specifically

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:07.160
something to do with language
production in humans.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.890
Because Tony Monaco in
Oxford found this gene

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:13.353
in a family with a severe
language and speech problem.

00:45:13.353 --> 00:45:16.530
And that gene turns
out to encode a protein

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.530
that is very conserved among all mammals,

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.420
but humans have two amino acid differences

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.312
in the encoded protein compared to

00:45:24.312 --> 00:45:28.970
all other apes and primates.

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:30.160
So we were, of course, very interested

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.177
when we got the Neanderthal genome

00:45:32.177 --> 00:45:35.720
and this genome of the Denisovans in Asia,

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:38.410
to see, did they share these changes?

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:39.820
And they did.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.630
So they look like us.

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:43.120
So these are changes that happened

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.580
before our split from the Neanderthals,

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:48.307
but it's still, they are
very interesting, of course.

00:45:48.307 --> 00:45:50.408
So one thing we have done,

00:45:50.408 --> 00:45:53.140
which is a model for further work

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.820
on this type of human-specific gene,

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:58.040
is to put them into the mouse.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.970
So you then create a mouse that now

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:04.220
makes a human version
of this FOXP2 protein,

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.190
and study that mouse.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:08.089
And amazingly, that mouse actually

00:46:08.089 --> 00:46:10.070
vocalized slightly differently.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:12.300
There are some differences
in how it peeps,

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.530
subtle, small small differences.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:18.100
And you can also study
how the brain functions.

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:21.360
So how electrical signals
are transmitted in the brain,

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.660
particularly the part of the brain

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:27.028
that has to do with learning
muscle, motor, behaviors.

00:46:27.028 --> 00:46:29.640
And there's some recent unpublished work

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.630
that even suggests that these mice

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:36.118
are actually a bit quicker in
automating muscle movements.

00:46:36.118 --> 00:46:39.497
A little bit like when
you learn to bicycle, say.

00:46:39.497 --> 00:46:43.050
When you think about how
you bicycle early on,

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.800
it's very difficult.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.160
When you automate it,
you get very good at it.

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.010
And it's a little bit like articulation.

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.163
When we learn to speak, initially,

00:46:52.163 --> 00:46:55.426
as kids, it's very
difficult to form the words.

00:46:55.426 --> 00:46:58.352
And when you get sort of in our age,

00:46:58.352 --> 00:47:01.520
it comes rather easily to you.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.168
So you can speculate, of course,

00:47:04.168 --> 00:47:06.640
that these changes may have something

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:11.285
to do with this ability to
produce articulate speech.

00:47:11.285 --> 00:47:14.164
And there's some evidence
for it from the mouse.

00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:17.914
And I think that's how
you need to start working

00:47:17.914 --> 00:47:21.010
with many of these human-specific changes.

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:22.870
Try to find animal models that

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:25.260
give you some indications of it.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.220
Maybe introduce them in stem cells

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.198
to in vitro differentiate
cells, nerve cells say,

00:47:30.198 --> 00:47:32.780
and see how they function.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:35.527
- There's an irony here,
because you left medicine

00:47:35.527 --> 00:47:39.811
to go back to the past, to
make an important discovery,

00:47:39.811 --> 00:47:43.735
and now we're getting
feedback back into the future

00:47:43.735 --> 00:47:46.069
in medicine and understanding

00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:51.069
the genetic basis for some ailments.

00:47:51.347 --> 00:47:52.698
Fascinating.

00:47:52.698 --> 00:47:57.698
Let's briefly talk about this
discovery of the Denisovans.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:01.233
- Denisovans.

00:48:03.258 --> 00:48:07.020
- Because that came late in this process

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.400
that we've discussed, and
this was just a eureka moment.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.580
So this is another group of people

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.813
that was found in Russia, but who,

00:48:15.813 --> 00:48:20.813
their virtue was, the DNA
was really amazingly intact.

00:48:22.779 --> 00:48:26.425
- Yes, so, we're very
lucky to work with people

00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:29.560
in Novosibirsk, particularly
Anatoly Derevyanko,

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.646
a very influential archeologist in Russia,

00:48:33.646 --> 00:48:36.467
who excavated many sites in Siberia.

00:48:36.467 --> 00:48:40.519
And in 2008, his team had
found a tiny little bone

00:48:40.519 --> 00:48:43.422
in this cave called Denisova Cave,

00:48:43.422 --> 00:48:46.336
in the Altai Mountains in Southern Siberia

00:48:46.336 --> 00:48:49.703
on the border to Mongolia and China.

00:48:49.703 --> 00:48:54.324
And this was a piece of a
last phalanx of a pinky.

00:48:54.324 --> 00:48:58.399
And we got a sample of
that, and it turned out

00:48:58.399 --> 00:49:01.708
that the DNA was, there was a rather a lot

00:49:01.708 --> 00:49:05.864
of DNA relative to bacterial DNA in there.

00:49:05.864 --> 00:49:09.910
So we were able, then, in 2010 already,

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:13.039
to sequence a large part of that genome

00:49:13.039 --> 00:49:15.640
and compare it to the Neanderthal genome

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.760
and present day people's genomes.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.680
And we were very very surprised.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.470
I was sure that this individual

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:23.604
would be either a modern
human in that area

00:49:23.604 --> 00:49:26.870
or a Neanderthal sort of at the eastern

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:29.580
extension of the Neanderthal distribution.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.920
And it turned out to be something else.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.350
So it has a common
ancestor with Neanderthals,

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:39.920
but very far back, in the
order of 400,000 years back,

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.370
much older than any divisions

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:45.049
between present day living humans.

00:49:45.049 --> 00:49:47.610
And then a long independent history.

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:52.610
So these are some sort of
Neanderthal relatives in Asia.

00:49:52.886 --> 00:49:56.300
So we needed to come up
with a name for this group.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.350
So we said, yes, like Neanderthals
are called Neanderthals

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:02.940
after Neanderthal site
where they were first found,

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.330
we call these guys Denisovans after

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:08.025
the Denisova Cave where
they were first found.

00:50:08.025 --> 00:50:10.858
And it turns out that
they have contributed,

00:50:10.858 --> 00:50:13.726
also, to present day people,

00:50:13.726 --> 00:50:16.466
all over Asia to a small extent,

00:50:16.466 --> 00:50:19.220
but particularly in the Pacific.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:22.654
So people in Papua New Guinea,
Aboriginal Australians,

00:50:22.654 --> 00:50:26.137
contain up to four or five percent

00:50:26.137 --> 00:50:29.740
of DNA from these Denisovans.

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:32.511
- And in this cave, you found evidence

00:50:32.511 --> 00:50:37.062
that Neanderthals were
there, this group was there,

00:50:37.062 --> 00:50:39.640
but also humans were there at one time.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.762
- So we have also found
other bones in the cave

00:50:42.762 --> 00:50:45.150
that come from Neanderthals.

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:46.440
So this is an area where

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.533
at some times Neanderthals have lived

00:50:48.533 --> 00:50:51.540
and at some times Denisovans have lived.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:55.092
- In this work and as
you reflect on your work,

00:50:55.092 --> 00:50:59.643
have you done any thinking about

00:50:59.643 --> 00:51:03.301
the implications of all this

00:51:03.301 --> 00:51:08.301
for the position, the place, of humans

00:51:08.711 --> 00:51:13.285
in this whole picture of creation

00:51:13.285 --> 00:51:17.863
in terms of who we are
and where we're going?

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:23.470
- Well, of course, it
is fascinating to me,

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.210
in a way, that these groups of humans,

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:27.287
Neanderthals and Denisovans,

00:51:27.287 --> 00:51:30.010
humans who are not here
any more, that are extinct,

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:32.210
that they still live on a little bit

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:36.473
in many of us today, if we
have our roots outside Africa.

00:51:36.473 --> 00:51:39.340
So they're not totally
extinct, if you like.

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:42.563
They have contributed a bit to us.

00:51:44.161 --> 00:51:47.830
Of course, it's fascinating also to say

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:52.470
that Neanderthals were here
just 3000 generations ago.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:54.640
It's not that long ago.

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.760
So sometimes I like to sort of speculate

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:00.510
and say, what if they had
made it 3000 generations more?

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:03.282
What would that really
mean for our sort of

00:52:03.282 --> 00:52:08.135
ideas about human uniqueness?

00:52:08.135 --> 00:52:12.385
Would we, if you're sort
of pessimistically minded,

00:52:12.385 --> 00:52:14.550
you'd say we would just experience

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:17.261
even worse racism against Neanderthals,

00:52:17.261 --> 00:52:20.895
even worse that what we
experience among us today,

00:52:20.895 --> 00:52:24.099
because they were truly
a bit different from us.

00:52:24.099 --> 00:52:26.790
If you're more positively inclined,

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:30.322
you might say, if we had
other groups of humans here

00:52:30.322 --> 00:52:33.352
that were a bit different,
better in some respects,

00:52:33.352 --> 00:52:37.950
but also less sophisticated in others,

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:40.970
maybe we would not be able to make

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:43.120
this enormous dichotomy that we do

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.120
so automatically today
between humans and animals,

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.470
that we would see that there's

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:51.289
more diversity to life than that.

00:52:51.289 --> 00:52:52.590
Who knows.

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:56.300
It's sort of just something
you can speculate about.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.670
- One final question.

00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:02.517
How would you advise students to prepare

00:53:02.517 --> 00:53:06.174
for a future if they're
interested in science

00:53:06.174 --> 00:53:09.645
and are fascinated by the potential

00:53:09.645 --> 00:53:14.645
breakthroughs that you
just described to us?

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:21.220
How should they think
about their own future

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.612
and preparing for a future in which

00:53:23.612 --> 00:53:26.963
they are part of this
scientific discovery?

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.390
- It's sort of a difficult question,

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:31.890
because we cannot
anticipate the breakthroughs

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:33.390
of the future, of course.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:35.560
But I would, of course, say,

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.206
follow the things you are fascinated by,

00:53:38.206 --> 00:53:41.213
because it really comes
rather automatically

00:53:41.213 --> 00:53:43.550
that, if you really like something you do,

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:45.910
you tend to be good at it.

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:48.500
And just get a rigorous
training, at least,

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:52.881
in one discipline, so that you
really know the basics of it.

00:53:52.881 --> 00:53:56.131
And then you can bring in
other types of knowledge too.

00:53:56.131 --> 00:53:59.173
- Well, on that note, I
wanna thank you very much

00:53:59.173 --> 00:54:04.026
for taking us on this intellectual journey

00:54:04.026 --> 00:54:06.627
and helping us understand the remarkable

00:54:06.627 --> 00:54:10.110
discoveries that you and your team make.

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:11.445
Thank you very much.

00:54:11.445 --> 00:54:12.470
- Thank you, pleasure.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.240
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.723
for this conversation with history.
