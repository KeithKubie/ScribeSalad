00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.920
PROFESSOR: What we've
managed through badgering

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.320
the utilities relentlessly is
to get them to agree to measure

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.075
part or all of the
high-volume gas leaks

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:35.030
that they're going to
fix this next year.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.500
But we need a method to do that.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.356
So one part of
today is hackathon.

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:44.470
And you can choose which
group you want to go with.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.600
The part that I'm
going to be working on

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.300
is coming up with that method to
quickly, easily, using utility

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.400
common tools, measure
the emissions off

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.000
of high-volume gas leaks.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.680
And if we can do this--
if it's possible--

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.730
the state will enact
the regulations

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.120
that this must be done
with every high-volume gas

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.835
leak from now on.

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:14.260
So this is an incredible chance
to create a state-wide program

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.240
to allow for feedback
and transparency

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.390
in the system to allow them
to do their job much better

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.120
in terms of reducing emissions
from natural gas leaks.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.870
Does that somewhat make sense?

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.050
And we've got some of the cool
tools that the utilities use,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.300
and lots of information
about how to do that.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.410
PROFESSOR: So who knows
what a gas leak smells like?

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.080
That's the most kind of direct
sensor we have-- our noses.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.850
Who doesn't really
have a good idea

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.900
of what a gas leak smells like?

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.790
OK, great.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.260
Well, I have these
scratch and sniff cards,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.410
so you can find out.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.070
And so you open these things up.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.770
Does anyone want to
remind themselves

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.200
of what a gas leak smells like?

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.087
Well, this can be a little
reminder [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:04.429
OK, so, take one,
and pass them around.

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:05.262
You just open it up.

00:02:05.262 --> 00:02:11.293
And there's a little
teardrop shaped blue thing.

00:02:11.293 --> 00:02:13.145
And you just scratch
that, and you smell it.

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:13.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.240
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.845
So you smell that?

00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:18.774
OK, so when I got into
this, I didn't even

00:02:18.774 --> 00:02:20.190
know what a gas
leak smelled like.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.560
Like, six years
ago, I had no idea.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.660
And then once I smelled it,
it's like riding a bike.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.690
Now, if you haven't smelled it--

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.365
you're going to have that--

00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:33.156
AUDIENCE: What's the
chemical in the smell?

00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:36.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's a family
of compounds called mercaptans.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.300
They're all
sulfur-based compounds.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.210
And our noses are just very,
very sensitive to them.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.380
They're injected into
the gas because methane

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.540
itself is odorless.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.840
And it was actually
mandated by federal law

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.270
to be put in there after
a huge explosion happened

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.090
in New London, Texas, that
killed hundreds of kids

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.971
in that school.

00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:02.330
And no one smelled it.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.020
So this odorant is added at
the parts per billion range.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.030
It's like maybe five
to 10 parts per billion

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.900
of this odorant, mercaptan.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.080
So we use a number of techniques
to measure these gas leaks.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.360
As a citizen and as
community science,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.460
your nose is really a
very powerful sensor.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.500
The industry, what they do
is they use some sniffers.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.620
They've been around for decades.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.910
One of the things they do
is use this thing called

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.120
a combustible gas indicator.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.890
And I'll just turn it on.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.275
You can hear the noise.

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:46.750
That's a pump.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.680
And so it's pulling in air
through this little hole here.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.540
Often there's an
extension on this

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.590
so that it can go deeper down--

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.210
like a meter down
into the ground.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.020
So good thing-- right
now, we're measuring 0--

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.340
0% gas.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.930
OK?

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.130
This thing's pulling in about
a half a liter per minute.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.576
That's the pump.

00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:13.990
So you see the 0 there.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.620
And when we go out on our
drive-around on the 31st--

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.124
those of you who can make it--

00:04:21.124 --> 00:04:26.240
if we come upon a gas leak in
our very high precision, very

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.140
sensitive sniffer--

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.780
this one's a little
bit more coarse.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.475
But we can get out, and
poke around, and find out,

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:34.060
and pinpoint where is
it under the surface

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.780
that that gas is coming out.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.880
OK?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.970
So maybe I'll just--

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.750
oh, I don't know.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.874
I guess I'll turn this off.

00:04:41.874 --> 00:04:45.480
AUDIENCE: Might have to do a
controlled experiment where you

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.020
can match people against that.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.201
So send people and one of them.

00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:49.700
You know?

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.420
You know, that's a good idea.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.150
But I will tell you, the
lower limit on this thing

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.070
is about 500 parts
per million methane.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.200
That's the lower detection limit
on this, which is very high.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.890
Does anyone know what
the background methane

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.613
value is in our atmosphere in
units of parts per million?

00:05:10.613 --> 00:05:13.771
Any wild guesses?

00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:15.560
AUDIENCE: Two per billion.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, per million--

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.210
a little over two
parts per million.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.649
40,000 parts per million
is when it gets explosive--

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:24.485
40,000 parts per million.

00:05:24.485 --> 00:05:25.403
OK?

00:05:25.403 --> 00:05:27.239
AUDIENCE: That's 80
times [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:28.520
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.510
So there's different ranges
at which this problem

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.635
has different impacts.

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:37.500
Our global value of
two parts per million

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.360
now is about something
like 50% greater

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.750
than it was in the
pre-industrial condition.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.460
And so the greenhouse
gas impacts

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.042
of even two parts per
million is very big.

00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:53.950
The instrumentation
in our band--

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.710
GPS-enabled sniffer
detected a series of leaks

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.660
along about a 1/8 of a mile
portion of that street.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.200
So we've got this graph--
and I will show you later--

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.030
with these peaks that come out.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.410
They could be plotted right
out on Google Earth, OK?

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.790
It's probable that
those leaks are not

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.240
coming from the new pipe--

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.080
the new West Roxbury Lateral.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.130
But they're probably coming from
the adjacent pipes that are old

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.290
and leaking that have
already been there.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.820
The real lost opportunity
there, in addition

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.930
to the fact that we don't
need the new pipeline,

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:40.310
is that they paved brand-new
paving and brand-new sidewalks.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.540
They didn't fix the old
leaking pipelines when they

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.040
put in this brand-new pipeline.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.360
And Eversource, whose
territory that is, by the way,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.730
is a coinvestor in the West
Roxbury Lateral Pipeline.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.819
So apparently, they just
didn't care about maintaining

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:56.860
their own infrastructure.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.668
AUDIENCE: Why
wasn't it mandated?

00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.928
Why wouldn't the state--

00:06:59.928 --> 00:07:00.928
AUDIENCE: Working on it.

00:07:00.928 --> 00:07:01.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.930
So anyway, that's what happened.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.930
And so we took a
picture of this.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.990
We have the data set.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.830
And what you'll see
is peaks and valleys.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.830
There may be like
15 or 20 of them.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.290
But are there are
15 or 20 leaks.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.910
We don't know.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.545
And if you want to go
over to the section

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:29.430
that we're working at, you
will be able to think about,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.230
is like, what is a leak?

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:37.690
How many leaks are there when
you get this series of spikes?

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.080
If the spikes go like that-- tip
down, and come back up again,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.990
and go down, is that
one leak or two leaks?

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.680
And the fact of the
matter is we don't yet

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:57.410
have a very universal
definition of what a leak is.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.695
So you will help
do a leak count.

00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:03.690
And you'll help
determine, hopefully,

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.234
what an objective
leak analysis can

00:08:06.234 --> 00:08:11.053
be by looking at these Google
Earth images of gas leaks.

00:08:11.053 --> 00:08:12.905
PROFESSOR: And they're
gorgeous images.

00:08:12.905 --> 00:08:14.260
And it's just super fun.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.342
You feel like you're the only
one who knows this information.

00:08:16.342 --> 00:08:16.841
It's great.

00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:19.620
AUDIENCE: Do you know the
material of recent leak

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.870
types and [INAUDIBLE]?

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
the leak-prone pipe--

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.420
most of it is cast iron.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.520
And it goes back-- some
pipes are over 100 years old.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.230
I think Audrey might
have mentioned.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.500
There's also wrought iron.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.580
There's not much of that.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.340
But that's a very old
leak-prone pipe as well.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.770
Bare steel is another
leak-prone pipe.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.850
They're all being replaced--
well, when they're replaced,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.400
they're replaced
with plastic pipe.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:55.120
And that is not as leaky
because it's newer.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:01.290
AUDIENCE: This may be the
wrong question, wrong time.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.580
Three or four years ago,
there was a big issue here

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.220
with Google Maps.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.690
And then Google outfitted
every single car,

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.960
and tracked and published their
gas leaks all over the place.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.570
And rather
humorously, Wellesley,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.650
was one of the biggest centers
of the universe of gas leaks

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.650
that they found.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.650
As they did all the Google
drive-bys, they [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.316
They didn't know where that
fit into this town [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:29.316 --> 00:09:30.830
technology they were using.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.492
But they published this,
and all this, but that--

00:09:34.492 --> 00:09:35.720
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.370
So we published our
Boston data in 2013.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.960
And that was all of
the gas [INAUDIBLE]----

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.750
over 3,000 leaks in Boston.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.455
Very soon after that,
Google partnered

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:51.600
with the Environmental
Defense Fund

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.340
to basically take
this nationwide.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.880
And so part of doing
that was coming back

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.410
to the greater Boston area.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.202
And they did their own map.

00:10:00.202 --> 00:10:02.240
They got one leak
per mile in Boston.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.080
We got four leaks
per mile in Boston.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.214
So that's part of
figuring this out.

00:10:07.214 --> 00:10:10.660
So almost everything that's
under the streets and sidewalks

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.210
in Boston, Somerville,
Cambridge, Newton, Brookline,

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.930
is just about a half a
pound per square inch

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.940
of pressure under the
streets and sidewalks.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.850
But it's like a tree.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.170
You have these trunk lines.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.855
And you have the big branches.

00:10:25.855 --> 00:10:28.080
And then you have
the little twigs.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.860
So you have these intermediate
branches running down

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.710
Route 9 that--

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.960
it's either 22 or it's 40 psi.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.182
And it's leaking.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.100
PROFESSOR: So
today, you'll either

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.002
decide to work on visualizing
the data, looking at the data,

00:10:45.002 --> 00:10:50.432
or working on figuring out how
to measure the high-volume gas

00:10:50.432 --> 00:10:50.932
leaks.

00:10:50.932 --> 00:10:53.146
So you'll sort of self-select
into whatever group

00:10:53.146 --> 00:10:54.030
you want to do.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.042
Is there a question back here?

00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:57.960
AUDIENCE: Just a basic question.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.717
Do you know how deep
these lines were buried?

00:11:00.717 --> 00:11:02.610
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's variable.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.190
About three feet is
generally how deep they are.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:10.590
They put them deep
enough that it

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:15.534
will reduce the frequency
with which they freeze.

00:11:15.534 --> 00:11:18.900
But in frost conditions--
deep freezes--

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.580
you can get mechanical
disturbance due to frost.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.922
And you can have broken
mains, and things like that.

00:11:26.922 --> 00:11:29.500
But anything's possible.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.000
You know, one thing
I've learned is

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.155
that I mean, for the
most part, gas lines run

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:40.770
along the same axis as a street.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.620
But they'll run diagonal.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.257
And they'll be on both
sides of the street.

00:11:46.257 --> 00:11:47.590
And they'll run under sidewalks.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.600
And they'll go
this way and that.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.390
And I can just see
any configuration.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.496
There's a legacy effect of this.

00:11:56.496 --> 00:11:58.530
It can be like
spaghetti down there.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.130
AUDIENCE: Are there maps
of the existing pipeline?

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.190
PROFESSOR: Yes, and no.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:08.100
There are public
documents that show

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.660
the operating pressure for that
natural grid's service area.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:19.020
And I can share that graph.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.990
But there's not the
detailed information

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:26.470
on those maps that tell
you the diameter, the age,

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.780
and the material of
all of the pipes.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.940
There are selected
parts that we know of.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.202
I mean, some of these have,
obviously, these maps.

00:12:38.202 --> 00:12:40.470
But they're not public.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.453
Only some have been made public.

00:12:42.453 --> 00:12:44.191
And it's very selective.

00:12:44.191 --> 00:12:47.946
PROFESSOR: So you can look
at how to visualize the data,

00:12:47.946 --> 00:12:52.905
and get to figure out how many
leaks there are in Chelsea--

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:54.620
how exciting-- and
actually see where

00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:01.160
the leaks are, or figure out
how to measure the emissions.
