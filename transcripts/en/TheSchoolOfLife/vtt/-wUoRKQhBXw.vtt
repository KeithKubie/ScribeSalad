00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
Perhaps some nights you lie awake next to your partner.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.640
Probably they're not awful.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.760
But they are almost certainly a bit boring.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.720
After all it's been a long time.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.460
Sex with them is ok

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.720
but not great in every possible way.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.000
There's something so special about undressing someone for the first time

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.900
feeling their excitement in your hands

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.080
and hearing them say rude words to you in lust.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.060
But you don't want to give up the relationship you're already in

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.140
which is pretty good in some key ways.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.300
Maybe you've got children or a joint home you've put a lot of work into.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.860
You don't want to lose everything.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.660
You just want to enjoy a few new scenarios.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.820
At such points, like many people you think:

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.200
"What about polyamory"?

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.200
And you feel quite brave and adventurous for going this far.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.880
Part of the problem is that polyamory sounds so plausible.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.080
An ideal way out of our societies' collective hypocrisy around sexual desire.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.860
Maybe you know someone from the tennis club who said to be into polyamory.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.480
They seem normal, very sane and extremely cheerful.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.120
There was an article in a magasine describing how polyamory is becoming fashionable in Paris

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.120
and is gaining popularity in Vancouver.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.500
Apparently, plenty of others manage it. Why shouldn't you?

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.500
Polyamory looks like it could be, as its advocates suggest, the future of relationships in general.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.720
And, more urgently, of yours in particular.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.460
Like many aspects of existence, polyamory is convincing in principle.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.560
Big, general ideas, usually are.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.300
To take another exemple:

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.960
In principle, many people feel it would be nicer to give up on the rat-race in the city and relocate to the countryside.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.480
It's healthier, housing costs are lower.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.380
You'll be able to grow vegetables and reconnect with nature.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.380
Or, to take an exemple from politics:

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.140
In principle, many people feel that direct democracy with referendum every weekend

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.300
to determine every decision sounds like a great idea.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.300
We'd finally get the kind of government we want.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.640
It happens in Switzerland so it's obviously possible.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.480
And technology has made it much more possible to organise.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.500
But the problem with principles is that they are perilously prone to leave out the details.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.760
Which is where the problems are located

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.860
They encourage us to forget that if we move to the country, we'll be hampered in our plans to order sushi at short notice.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.820
The neighbor's tractor will wake us up at 5:30.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.180
Things will be surprisingly expensive.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.880
And we'll have a terrible sense of being left out of the party.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.800
Or when it comes to direct democracy we forget the whimsical and terrifying nature of mass public opinion

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.120
along with our own disinterest in the details of policy

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.620
and the entirely exceptional nature of Swiss society and public life.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.980
Things are no different with polyamory.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.440
When at certain times the general principle of polyamory strikes us as a mature and viable option for organising our sex lives

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.660
we'd be advised to hold a few details in mind:

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.400
- We should picture how challenging it can be

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.320
when at, an orgy, a partner gives us a wink as they disappear

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.740
into a softly lit bedroom with two other people.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.160
We make a sign to join them but are politely, yet firmly

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.820
rebuffed by one of the strangers who asks gruffly who the weirdo with the strange underwear might be.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.660
Hearing a partner orgasm at the hands of another is a complex experience.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.240
- We may forget too that once we sign up to polyamory

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.220
it won't be entirely straightforward to locate other people who excite us deeply.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.500
Of course, we may have offers from types we don't much fancy

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.760
except it will now be agony to explain why we don't want them.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.840
However, even if we do find someone we favor, it may turn out their sexual tastes don't quite match our own.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.420
They may share our love of spanking, but it could be harder or softer that we would ideally prefer.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.360
Or, they'll love dressing as a pirate, but they might refuse to wear an eyepatch

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.540
which is a deal breaker for us.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.240
Or, they might indeed shout obscenities but their repertoire risks being sadly unimaginative

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.240
and their accent grating.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.960
Our partner, on the other hand

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.580
might all the while be having no trouble at all locating some pretty amazing new friends.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.240
We had assumed we’d be in demand, but that’s not how it could turn out.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.380
We also tend to forget how nice it is when something is fully ours.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.720
As children, we never actually liked sharing our toys much

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.360
though borrowing them was pretty nice.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.540
When we were five

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.500
we deeply resented if other children took the fire engine

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.660
or started a cooking game with the miniature kitchen.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.680
A disavowed possessive streak runs quite deep in many of us.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.500
Furthermore, we’ve got a busy life

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.520
and polyamory takes a lot of time to organise.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.700
Our prospective partners may be busy just that night we’re free or more inclined

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.100
– exactly when we had a slot –

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.400
to hook up with that dentist who is slightly repugnant in our eyes.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.940
Despite the freewheeling atmosphere

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.480
even in polyamory

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.700
there will be some surprisingly tricky and intractable emotions to deal with.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.440
There will be splits, painful endings, feelings of abandonment and moments of rage.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.580
We’ll be exposed to the inner tribulations of a great many people

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.740
rather than just those of a single well-charted spouse.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.200
Certain partners will burst into uncontrollable sobs and talk urgently of their mothers

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.400
when all we were looking for was a rapid sexual thrill.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.340
Others will, as we stand at the bedside with a whip or a mask, accuse us of selfishness

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.100
pretend to read a magazine and refuse to explain what’s wrong.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.980
There’s no dispute at all that polyamory will work very well for some people

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.480
but like many alluring ideas, that doesn’t mean it will work for us.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.400
Mostly likely, if we become polyamorous

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.040
we will once again encounter almost all of the problems we’d once known so well in monogamy

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.640
only far more often

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.060
more chaotically

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.220
and with a greater sense of violated expectation.
