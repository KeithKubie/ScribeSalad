00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 align:start position:0%
drove her to this point and I normally
 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.950 align:start position:0%
drove her to this point and I normally
I'm<00:05:20.400><c> not</c><00:05:20.430><c> a</c><00:05:20.550><c> huge</c><00:05:20.850><c> like</c><00:05:21.120><c> oh</c><00:05:21.270><c> it</c><00:05:21.479><c> has</c><00:05:21.630><c> to</c><00:05:21.660><c> be</c><00:05:21.840><c> done</c>

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not a huge like oh it has to be done
 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.390 align:start position:0%
I'm not a huge like oh it has to be done
like<00:05:22.110><c> a</c><00:05:22.140><c> Christopher</c><00:05:22.590><c> Nolan</c><00:05:22.860><c> film</c><00:05:22.890><c> where</c><00:05:23.280><c> it's</c>

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
like a Christopher Nolan film where it's
 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.610 align:start position:0%
like a Christopher Nolan film where it's
backwards<00:05:24.120><c> and</c><00:05:24.390><c> out</c><00:05:24.479><c> of</c><00:05:24.630><c> order</c><00:05:24.780><c> and</c><00:05:25.020><c> a</c><00:05:25.200><c> lot</c><00:05:25.590><c> of</c>

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
backwards and out of order and a lot of
 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.590 align:start position:0%
backwards and out of order and a lot of
times<00:05:25.890><c> if</c><00:05:26.100><c> it</c><00:05:26.220><c> helps</c><00:05:26.610><c> yeah</c><00:05:26.820><c> a</c><00:05:27.030><c> lot</c><00:05:27.240><c> of</c><00:05:27.360><c> times</c>

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
times if it helps yeah a lot of times
 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
times if it helps yeah a lot of times
it's<00:05:27.810><c> a</c><00:05:27.870><c> cheap</c><00:05:28.110><c> gimmick</c><00:05:28.380><c> but</c><00:05:28.710><c> in</c><00:05:28.830><c> this</c><00:05:28.950><c> case</c><00:05:29.190><c> I</c>

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 align:start position:0%
it's a cheap gimmick but in this case I
 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
it's a cheap gimmick but in this case I
think<00:05:29.400><c> it</c><00:05:29.640><c> really</c><00:05:29.910><c> would</c><00:05:30.180><c> have</c><00:05:30.270><c> saved</c><00:05:30.600><c> this</c>

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 align:start position:0%
think it really would have saved this
 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.180 align:start position:0%
think it really would have saved this
season<00:05:31.380><c> a</c><00:05:31.440><c> lot</c><00:05:31.530><c> because</c><00:05:31.710><c> you</c><00:05:31.860><c> would</c><00:05:32.010><c> have</c><00:05:32.100><c> been</c>

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 align:start position:0%
season a lot because you would have been
 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
season a lot because you would have been
like<00:05:32.340><c> okay</c><00:05:32.669><c> how</c><00:05:32.910><c> did</c><00:05:32.970><c> we</c><00:05:33.210><c> get</c><00:05:33.330><c> to</c><00:05:33.510><c> this</c><00:05:33.600><c> point</c>

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 align:start position:0%
like okay how did we get to this point
 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
like okay how did we get to this point
and<00:05:33.990><c> then</c><00:05:34.110><c> you</c><00:05:34.229><c> can</c><00:05:34.410><c> see</c><00:05:34.680><c> the</c><00:05:35.430><c> crazy</c><00:05:35.880><c> decisions</c>

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%

I<00:05:42.210><c> mean</c><00:05:42.539><c> how</c><00:05:42.780><c> do</c><00:05:42.840><c> we</c><00:05:43.050><c> like</c><00:05:43.289><c> blame</c><00:05:43.680><c> the</c><00:05:43.710><c> show</c><00:05:44.250><c> for</c>

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 align:start position:0%
I mean how do we like blame the show for
 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.890 align:start position:0%
I mean how do we like blame the show for
that<00:05:44.760><c> that's</c><00:05:45.030><c> just</c><00:05:45.120><c> more</c><00:05:45.300><c> hate</c><00:05:45.450><c> one</c><00:05:45.630><c> it</c><00:05:45.750><c> than</c>

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
that that's just more hate one it than
 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.260 align:start position:0%
that that's just more hate one it than
cool<00:05:46.110><c> you</c><00:05:46.650><c> know</c><00:05:46.770><c> if</c><00:05:46.860><c> they</c><00:05:46.950><c> did</c><00:05:47.130><c> that</c><00:05:47.160><c> I</c><00:05:47.520><c> think</c>

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 align:start position:0%
cool you know if they did that I think
 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.610 align:start position:0%
cool you know if they did that I think
it<00:05:48.360><c> would</c><00:05:48.479><c> have</c><00:05:48.570><c> been</c><00:05:48.600><c> a</c><00:05:48.690><c> lot</c><00:05:48.900><c> better</c><00:05:48.930><c> because</c>

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
it would have been a lot better because
 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.430 align:start position:0%
it would have been a lot better because
I<00:05:50.039><c> the</c><00:05:50.729><c> linear</c><00:05:51.090><c> storytelling</c><00:05:51.630><c> this</c><00:05:52.200><c> time</c>

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
I the linear storytelling this time
 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.150 align:start position:0%
I the linear storytelling this time
