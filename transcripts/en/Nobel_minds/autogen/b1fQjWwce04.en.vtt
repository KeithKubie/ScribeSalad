00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
my name is Oliver touch panel from

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770
my name is Oliver touch panel from
 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.240
my name is Oliver touch panel from
Austria and I have a question for you do

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250
Austria and I have a question for you do
 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.169
Austria and I have a question for you do
you think that on the LHC start there is

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179
you think that on the LHC start there is
 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.009
you think that on the LHC start there is
the possibility that there come a little

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019
the possibility that there come a little
 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.090
the possibility that there come a little
black pole hi Oliver so you'd like to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
black pole hi Oliver so you'd like to
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.620
black pole hi Oliver so you'd like to
know if there is a possibility of a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630
know if there is a possibility of a
 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.240
know if there is a possibility of a
black hole being created from the Large

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
black hole being created from the Large
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.599
black hole being created from the Large
Hadron Collider the LHC so far we think

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609
Hadron Collider the LHC so far we think
 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.150
Hadron Collider the LHC so far we think
not the reason we think not is that

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
not the reason we think not is that
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.800
not the reason we think not is that
nature has already done this experiment

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
nature has already done this experiment
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.620
nature has already done this experiment
there are natural accelerators out there

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
there are natural accelerators out there
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.510
there are natural accelerators out there
in space that are far more powerful than

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
in space that are far more powerful than
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.250
in space that are far more powerful than
anything we can build here on earth or

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
anything we can build here on earth or
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.840
anything we can build here on earth or
even imagine every building here on

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
even imagine every building here on
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420
even imagine every building here on
earth and so the experiment has been

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
earth and so the experiment has been
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.819
earth and so the experiment has been
done already by nature and so if there

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829
done already by nature and so if there
 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.470
done already by nature and so if there
are black holes being made and they're

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
are black holes being made and they're
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.260
are black holes being made and they're
small and they don't bother anyone but

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
small and they don't bother anyone but
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.910
small and they don't bother anyone but
more likely there are no such black

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
more likely there are no such black
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.560
more likely there are no such black
holes being made by those particle

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570
holes being made by those particle
 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.869
holes being made by those particle
collisions now of course we would

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
collisions now of course we would
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.369
collisions now of course we would
certainly be very interested to find out

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379
certainly be very interested to find out
 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.569
certainly be very interested to find out
if there were but we're not expecting

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
if there were but we're not expecting
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.969
if there were but we're not expecting
any
