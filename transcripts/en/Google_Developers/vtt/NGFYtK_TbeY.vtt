[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.060
Rio au Vivo is a tool for
decision making regarding

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.540
sports, tourism, and nights.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.510
We install cameras in the
favorite spots of the city,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.510
and we broadcast them
through our website and app.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.780
And by the palm of their
hands, all Cariocas

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.420
can have a glimpse
of what is going

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:36.278
on in the best
spots of the city.

00:00:36.278 --> 00:00:40.000
I started out back on
Hermosa Beach in Los Angeles

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.580
when I lived there.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.200
Every time before
going out, I just

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.950
checked this camera, which
was installed in a restaurant

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.180
by the sea.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.400
And I came back to
Rio with the idea

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.890
to make something
bigger out of that.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.430
Rio is the center of the
attention of the world

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.739
right now, to the World Cup
and also to the Olympics.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.320
We started out just
installing cameras.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.220
And these cameras was for
surfing, was for night outs,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.740
and was also for tourist places.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.300
But one advice,
repeat piece of advice

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.030
that we got from the mentors, is
to start focusing on one niche,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.330
and when you're already
established on this one

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.520
to go to the other
one, and so on.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.390
In the beginning,
only one person

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.470
could see the video at one time.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.520
But as we went
along, we found out

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.250
solutions that allowed
us to have a better

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.040
quality of our services
and have a faster

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.230
initialization of the video.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.150
There was a lot of, let's say,
barriers for us to get here.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.460
An image is worth 1,000 words.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.539
And today we deliver 30 images
per second in real time.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.219
So this is something that
we're really proud of.
