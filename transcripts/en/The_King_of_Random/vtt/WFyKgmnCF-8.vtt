00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.560
These desktop rockets might be tiny, but they’re
impressively powerful, leave a cool trail

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.759
of smoke, and shoot up to 40 feet away. Surprisingly,
they’re only powered by one single match

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.199
head. In this project we’re using aluminum
foil and a box of matches, to make the ultimate

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.839
in desktop weaponry. Homemade, Matchbox Rockets.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.539
All we need to start this project is a box
of matches, aluminum foil and a wooden skewer.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.289
I’m using these green “strike on box”
matches, but the red ones will work just as

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:37.050
well. Ok it’s time to get to work, and the
first thing we need to do is grab a few of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.359
these matches and set them to the side, because
we’ll still need a bundle of those, for

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.359
our kit when it’s finished. Now amazingly,
these rockets are only powered by one single

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.359
match head. But they only work, if we get
rid of the stick first. Of course that’s

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.640
not much of a challenge as long as you have
a pair of scissors. And if you try lining

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.679
your container with something like a sock,
the match heads won’t bounce out. Instead

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.809
they just collect conveniently at the bottom.
Here are all the match heads I got from this

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.609
box, and to store them, why don’t we try
using one of these soda cap containers made

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.300
in a previous project? These things have all
kinds of applications, so look for for how

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.410
to make them in another project video. Alright,
to start making our assembly kit we’re going

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.590
to need a single bamboo skewer, and this template
which I’m going to give you for free. Just

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.750
look in the description for a link on where
to get that. Transfer the marks from the diagram

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.720
onto the skewer, then carefully cut the ends
off, so when it’s modified, it looks like

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.030
this. The next step is to tape the body template
to a piece of paperboard, like this one I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.140
got from a cereal box. Make sure to cut the
edges as cleanly as you can, because this

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.110
is going to be our tracing template. The little
square I’m cutting out now is the guide

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.590
for tracing the rocket’s fins. And for those,
I use aluminum foil tape I got at the hardware

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.090
store. Each square will make one set of rocket
fins, so cut as many as you want, then fold

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.000
them “point to point” from both directions.
Pinch them at the base and push your fingers

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.840
together, so that when you crease them down
it looks like a little x-wing. When you snip

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.470
off the point at the very tip, the rocket
fins are ready for application, and by now

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.630
you should have an idea of how this is going
to work. Now I made a whole bunch more and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.360
loaded them into the other side, of the soda
cap container, so I have them on hand whenever

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.129
I need one. Ok, let’s bust out the aluminum
foil, and tear off a sheet to start creating

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.430
the rocket bodies. I’m laying a sheet of
paper towel overtop, then carefully folding

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.959
the stack up 3 times, so it’s 4 layers deep
and just a bit larger than the cardboard template.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.099
You probably figured out already that we’re
going to trace around the edges, then cut

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.260
the shape out of all the layers, at the same
time. Normally the edges would stick together

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.069
after the foil’s been cut, but you can see
the paper towel solves that problem, and makes

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.620
it super easy to separate. I tried making
13 pieces at the same time, and it actually

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.590
worked, so you can see how quick and easy
it is to make a whole stack in no time flat.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.959
And check this out, the assembly station is
completely portable as well. I designed the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.909
patterns, and the template so they’d fit
perfectly inside the matchbox, and you can

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.939
see there’s a little place for the skewer
in there as well. Now to finish our rocket

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.310
factory the only thing left to do is make
a small hole in the top of the box, about

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.139
half an inch from the end. Now if we bring
back any matches we saved from earlier, and

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.540
add a candle, we’ve created a portable assembly
station, that you could take just about anywhere.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.069
Alright, let’s get to work and build some
rockets. Here you can see what the finished

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.799
rocket will look like. It’s light as a feather,
but surprisingly stable in flight. You might

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.069
have noticed there are two markings on the
template that indicate how to roll the body

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.299
tube. With the skewer in position, place a
single match head on top, and make sure it’s

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.900
pointing upward, without any gaps. Now slowly
and carefully roll the foil tube, as tightly

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.049
and neatly as possible. When you get to the
end, pinch the tube right above the match

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.719
head, then push the foil down flat. There
should be about half an inch of foil at the

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.900
top, and this gets rolled toward the match
head. The most important part here is crimping

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.430
the tip with something like a pair of pilers.
And you might want to crimp multiple times,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.359
and from different angles just to make sure
it’s completely sealed. At this point, let’s

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.170
attach the rocket fins we made earlier, by
peeling off the sticky stuff on the back,

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.060
then pushing the rocket body through the hole
in the center. Just work the fins around until

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.209
they stick firmly in place near the bottom
of the rocket, and with that final step, you’re

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.590
done. That’s how easy it is, to make a matchbox
rocket. So while you’re at it, why not make

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.689
a few more? I just made 13 of them, in about
10 minutes, and you can see they fit perfectly

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.469
into the kit as well. So now you have the
option of building rockets, on location, as

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.269
you need them, or creating them all in advance
so you can just show up and start shooting

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.690
within seconds. The rockets get loaded by
pushing the tapered end of the skewer into

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.970
the nozzle, then twisting upward until it
touches the match head inside. Push the skewer

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.640
through the hole in the matchbox, and now
if you push the box together, you can adjust

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.070
the launch angle to whatever you need it to
be. Now if you light a candle and position

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.060
the flame just under the tip of the rocket,
it will quickly warm the foil until the match

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.660
head reaches its auto-ignition temperature.
Which, you can see, shoots it off with an

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.320
impressive amount, of speed and power. These
rockets leave a satisfying trail of smoke

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.810
when they blast off, but you do need to be
careful because they get hot enough to burn

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.970
your fingers, and put scorch marks in your
carpet. Now of course the safer option is

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.570
to launch your rockets outdoors. But you’ll
probably find the flame on the candle won’t

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.350
hold still in the breeze. I use a wind resistant
BBQ ignitor to keep a steady flame, which

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.630
you can see works pretty well. These rockets
shoot from the front porch all the way to

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.060
the street, and in some cases up to 40 feet
away. So it’s important to use common sense,

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.140
and avoid the temptation to point them at
people or property. Well now you know how

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.560
to turn a box of matches and some aluminum
foil, into a fully portable rocket factory,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.850
so you can manufacture and launch, your very
own matchbox rockets. That’s it for now.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.200

Man, I love playing with rockets. Hey guys
I’m really excited about this project. I’ve

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.020
been playing with different prototypes for
matchbox rockets for over a year. So I’m

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.210
really excited, and proud, to finally be able
to present this design. I’m also excited

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.440
to give you the template I made, for free.
You can click right here to download the template

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.590
right now, and if you try making some of these,
I would love to see you post pictures on my
