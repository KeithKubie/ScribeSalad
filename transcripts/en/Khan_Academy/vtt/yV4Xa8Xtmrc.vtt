00:00:00.488 --> 00:00:03.305
Voiceover:Cosine of two theta is equal to C

00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:06.280
and theta is between zero and pi.

00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:11.492
Write a formula for sine
of theta in terms of C

00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:13.985
and so I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:15.771
and try to figure this out on your own

00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:17.278
before I work through it.

00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:19.485
So assuming you had a go,

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.484
so let's see if we can
work through it together.

00:00:21.698 --> 00:00:23.171
I'm going to get my scratchpad out,

00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:24.984
I have copied and pasted
the exact question

00:00:24.984 --> 00:00:27.402
right over here, and so
let's think about it.

00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:30.171
They're telling us that
cosine of two theta

00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:32.642
is equal to C, so let
me write it this way.

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:38.198
C is equal to cosine of two theta.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.432
Now, using my knowledge of
angle addition formulas,

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:47.820
we know for example that cosine of

00:00:47.820 --> 00:01:00.804
alpha plus beta is equal to cosine alpha

00:01:00.804 --> 00:01:10.423
cosine beta minus sine alpha sine beta.

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.409
Now why would this be useful here?

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.718
Well this is the sum of
just theta plus theta,

00:01:23.718 --> 00:01:26.361
and so I can rewrite this in terms of

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:28.281
cosines and sines and maybe I can rewrite

00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:30.332
the cosines in terms of sines

00:01:30.332 --> 00:01:32.128
and then solve for the sines.

00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:33.216
So let's try to do that.

00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:36.165
So I can rewrite cosine of
two theta that's the same

00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:45.985
as cosine of theta plus
theta, is of course the same

00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:48.336
thing as two theta, and I can use the

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:50.274
angle addition formula for cosine.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:58.191
This is going to be
equal to cosine of theta,

00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:02.652
times cosine of theta,
times cosine of theta,

00:02:02.652 --> 00:02:09.628
minus sine of theta, times sine of theta,

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:12.999
time sine of theta, which is of course

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:18.090
equal to cosine squared
theta, that's equal to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.533
cosine squared theta,
minus and what we have

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:24.932
right over here is sine squared theta.

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:30.979
So let's see, we've been able to rewrite C

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.014
in terms of cosine squared theta and

00:02:33.014 --> 00:02:34.732
sine squared theta, but ideally we just

00:02:34.732 --> 00:02:36.386
want to write it in terms of sine theta

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:38.639
so we can solve for sine theta.

00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:43.085
So if we can re-express
cosine theta in terms of sine.

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:45.501
Well we already know from
the pythagorean identity

00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:48.645
that cosine squared theta plus sine

00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:52.401
squared theta is equal
to one, or we could say

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:55.576
that cosine squared theta is equal to,

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:57.167
I'm just going to subtract
sine squared from both

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:00.802
sides, is equal to one
minus sine squared theta.

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:06.223
So let me rewrite this
as one minus sine squared

00:03:06.223 --> 00:03:09.241
theta, and then of course we have minus

00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:13.216
this yellow sine squared theta,

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:19.906
and all of this is equal
to C or we could get that C

00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:27.404
is equal to one minus
two sine squared theta.

00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:31.682
And what's useful about this is we just

00:03:31.682 --> 00:03:34.677
have to solve for sine of theta.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.240
So let's see, I could
multiply both sides by a

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.299
negative just so I can
switch the order over here.

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:44.443
So I could write this as negative C

00:03:44.443 --> 00:03:49.361
is equal to two sine squared theta

00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.258
minus one and just multiply both sides

00:03:52.258 --> 00:03:55.370
by a negative and then
let's see I could add

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.990
one to both sides, if I
add one to both sides,

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.371
and I'll go over here, if
I add one to both sides,

00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:15.479
I get one minus C is equal
to two sine squared theta,

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:20.427
I could divide both sides by two,

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.139
and then so I get sine squared theta

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.999
is equal to one minus C over two,

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:27.081
or I could write that sine of theta

00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:30.034
is equal to the plus or minus square root

00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:32.758
of one minus C over two.

00:04:36.544 --> 00:04:38.392
So that leads to a question,

00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:39.356
Is it both?

00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:40.573
Is it the plus and minus square root?

00:04:40.573 --> 00:04:42.373
Or is it just one of those?

00:04:42.408 --> 00:04:43.711
And I encourage you to
pause the video again

00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:45.190
in case you haven't
already figured it out,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.550
and look at the information here,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.750
and think about whether
they give us the information

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.173
of whether we should be looking

00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:51.957
at the positive or negative sine.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.248
Well they tell us that theta
is between zero and pi.

00:04:57.604 --> 00:04:59.871
So if I were to draw a unit circle here,

00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:01.701
between zero and pi radians.

00:05:02.372 --> 00:05:05.871
So, this angle right over
here is zero radians,

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:08.092
and pi is going all the way over here.

00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:14.733
So this angle places its terminal ray

00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:16.686
either in the first or second quadrants.

00:05:17.257 --> 00:05:19.107
So, it could be an angle like this,

00:05:19.107 --> 00:05:20.792
it could be an angle like this,

00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:22.813
it cannot be an angle like this,

00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:27.363
and we know that the sine of an angle

00:05:27.363 --> 00:05:29.260
is the Y coordinate, and so we know that

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.385
for the first of second
quadrant the Y coordinate

00:05:31.385 --> 00:05:33.431
is going to be non-negative.

00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.911
So we would want to take
the positive square root,

00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:42.635
so we would get sine of theta,

00:05:42.635 --> 00:05:45.448
is equal to the principal root,

00:05:45.448 --> 00:05:46.286
or we could even think of it

00:05:46.286 --> 00:05:47.482
as the positive square root

00:05:47.482 --> 00:05:50.547
of one minus C over two.

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:52.278
So let's go back to our...

00:05:52.493 --> 00:05:54.532
Make sure we can check our answers.

00:05:54.865 --> 00:05:58.180
So sine of theta is
equal to the square root

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:09.185
of one minus capital C,
all of that over two,

00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:10.923
and we got it right.
