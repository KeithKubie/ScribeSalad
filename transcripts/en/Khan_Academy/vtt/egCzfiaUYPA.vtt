00:00:01.295 --> 00:00:04.688
- [Narrator] So we've been
discussing the Seven Year's War

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:06.016
in North America.

00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:08.953
Also commonly called the
French and Indian War

00:00:08.953 --> 00:00:11.210
but, as I mentioned in the last video

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.851
I think Seven Year's War is a better name

00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:15.749
for this conflict because

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.999
it was the first global war

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.580
that happened more than 150 years

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.400
before World War I.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.765
And this global war was

00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:26.881
at its heart,

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:30.999
about who would be the
dominant empire in the world.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:32.510
Would it be England?

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.989
Or would it be France?

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.817
Now in the North American
theater of this war,

00:00:38.817 --> 00:00:42.385
England, France, their
Native American allies

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:45.912
on both sides were vying for territory

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:48.066
and particularly territory along the

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.585
Appalachian mountain range

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:52.667
in upstate New York, Canada.

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:55.908
This kind of western territory that was

00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:57.635
the border between

00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:01.933
the English settlement and
Indian country to the west.

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.790
In this video, let's
talk about how the war

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.496
actually progressed

00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:08.994
and what it's consequences were

00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:11.402
for North America and later,

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:12.902
the United States.

00:01:14.084 --> 00:01:16.260
All right, so we've got the English,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.098
the French, and

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:21.044
a number of Native American tribes

00:01:21.044 --> 00:01:24.936
all kind of jostling for
position in North America.

00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:28.314
Now what stresses the British out the most

00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:29.618
is

00:01:29.618 --> 00:01:31.986
the presence of the French

00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:33.884
in the Ohio River Valley.

00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:37.034
Both, the British and the French

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:39.867
have laid claim to this territory.

00:01:41.587 --> 00:01:45.733
And they're both eager to
strengthen their territorial

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:48.211
claims, by building forts,

00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:52.378
and otherwise having a show
of possession of the area.

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:58.390
They argue over who had
a presence there first.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.210
So to establish the English presence

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.996
in the Ohio River Valley

00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:06.767
the English send a young officer

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.389
named George Washington

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.984
to build a fort.

00:02:10.984 --> 00:02:12.987
George Washington is only

00:02:12.987 --> 00:02:15.070
22 years old at the time.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.853
And he and his men go out

00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:21.871
to

00:02:22.858 --> 00:02:26.271
this area and they run
into some French with their

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.112
Native American allies

00:02:28.112 --> 00:02:29.461
at Fort Duquesne

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.959
which is where the Alaganee,

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.681
Monhongahela, and Ohio
rivers come together.

00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:37.931
Which is today, Pittsburgh.

00:02:42.102 --> 00:02:44.670
So George Washington and his allies

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.904
get the jump on the French.

00:02:46.904 --> 00:02:49.587
But, that doesn't last very long.

00:02:49.587 --> 00:02:51.915
They're overpowered and

00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:54.191
they fall back and establish

00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:55.441
Fort Necessity.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.403
On account of it was necessary.

00:03:00.884 --> 00:03:02.901
And they managed to hold
out for a little while

00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:05.687
but eventually the French,
the Canadians, and their

00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:07.914
Native America allies

00:03:07.914 --> 00:03:09.681
forced Washington to surrender.

00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:11.783
And he goes back to Virginia.

00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:13.033
So that's 1754.

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:18.256
And we'll call that Fail number one.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.419
All right, so then

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.419
a year later

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:26.560
1755, the British

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.121
try to displace the French from

00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:31.969
Fort Duquesne once again.

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.552
And they send Major
General Edward Braddock

00:03:38.683 --> 00:03:39.516
with

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:43.041
George Washington, once again,

00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:44.291
now he's 23.

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.261
Back to Fort Duquesne

00:03:46.261 --> 00:03:48.995
and it's a complete disaster.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.765
This time, the French
and their Indian allies

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:53.596
get the drop on the English, and with

00:03:53.596 --> 00:03:56.919
a much smaller force, completely

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.703
desinate the English troops.

00:03:59.703 --> 00:04:02.010
And Braddock is killed.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.726
And George Washington

00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:05.879
has to take command

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.635
of the retreat.

00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:09.802
So that's Fail number two.

00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:15.339
In general, this war
does not go terribly well

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:16.861
for the British at the beginning,

00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:20.207
except in one area, Acadia, where

00:04:20.207 --> 00:04:22.725
the British manage to

00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:24.177
attain control

00:04:24.177 --> 00:04:25.927
and they kick out the

00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:28.578
French settlers,

00:04:29.723 --> 00:04:32.579
the Acadians, who are transported

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:36.329
down to the French
settlement of New Orleans.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.733
In Louisiana.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.725
Where eventually, their
name becomes garbled

00:04:43.725 --> 00:04:46.819
and they're known as the Cajuns.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.605
Not the Acadians, but the Cajuns.

00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:50.438
In 1756

00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:54.825
England finally gets around
to actually declaring

00:04:54.825 --> 00:04:55.992
war on France.

00:04:58.635 --> 00:05:01.915
But it's really not for another year

00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:05.035
that the war starts to actually go well

00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:05.868
in 1757.

00:05:07.424 --> 00:05:10.521
And the reason that the
war starts going well

00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:12.889
for the English, finally,

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.689
is that the Prime Minister, William Pitt,

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.574
decides that he is going to

00:05:19.574 --> 00:05:22.074
pour money into this endeavor.

00:05:23.463 --> 00:05:26.917
So he thinks that the
English have just not had

00:05:26.917 --> 00:05:29.163
enough men, materials, money,

00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:31.622
Indian allies, up until this point.

00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:33.500
So he is really going to

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.583
commit the British empire

00:05:36.457 --> 00:05:37.970
to

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.301
exiling the French from this area

00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:42.718
of North America.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.643
So between 1757 and 1760,

00:05:49.052 --> 00:05:52.720
things really start
looking up for the British.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.387
They finally capture

00:05:55.852 --> 00:05:57.506
Fort Duquesne.

00:05:57.506 --> 00:05:58.839
And they capture

00:05:59.861 --> 00:06:01.194
the Ohio Valley.

00:06:02.746 --> 00:06:03.746
Nova Scotia.

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.379
Upstate New York.

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:08.379
And, Quebec.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:10.686
So, by 1760

00:06:12.776 --> 00:06:15.975
pretty much all the fighting
is done in North America.

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:19.540
The English have more or less forced

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.606
the French

00:06:20.606 --> 00:06:23.736
out of the eastern seaboard and Canada.

00:06:23.736 --> 00:06:24.736
And in 1763,

00:06:25.951 --> 00:06:27.710
the English and the French

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.107
sit down to hammer out

00:06:30.107 --> 00:06:31.774
the Treaty of Paris.

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.699
So the Treaty of Paris, in 1763,

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.250
and I apologize, I cannot help the fact

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.241
that there are like a
million treaties of Paris.

00:06:43.241 --> 00:06:45.252
There's also the Treaty
of Paris that ended the

00:06:45.252 --> 00:06:46.442
Revolutionary War.

00:06:46.442 --> 00:06:48.901
There's the Treaty of Paris that ended the

00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:50.433
Spanish American War.

00:06:50.433 --> 00:06:52.404
Paris was the place
where you made treaties

00:06:52.404 --> 00:06:54.082
and they're all called
the Treaty of Paris.

00:06:54.082 --> 00:06:57.321
But this is the one that happened in 1763.

00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:00.238
In general, this was a big victory.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.973
For the English.

00:07:05.102 --> 00:07:06.019
The English

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:08.202
not only got

00:07:08.202 --> 00:07:10.535
most of France's possessions

00:07:12.234 --> 00:07:13.932
in the New World.

00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:16.057
They got New France,

00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:16.974
AKA Canada.

00:07:19.084 --> 00:07:20.271
They got

00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.604
Spanish Florida.

00:07:24.001 --> 00:07:27.159
Spain was fighting on the side of

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:28.053
France.

00:07:28.053 --> 00:07:29.312
So they lose that.

00:07:29.312 --> 00:07:32.145
They got a bunch of Sugar Islands.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.097
In the Caribbean.

00:07:36.301 --> 00:07:38.751
And they pretty much

00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:40.966
got recognized as

00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:43.383
the premiere power in Europe.

00:07:47.122 --> 00:07:50.300
And the premiere imperial power.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.883
So, the largest and

00:07:53.258 --> 00:07:55.554
most powerful empire

00:07:55.554 --> 00:07:56.637
in the world.

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:01.689
And let's not forget that
the colonial Americans

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:05.022
citizens of Massachusetts, and New York,

00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:08.455
Pennsylvania, Virginia,

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:11.372
they were on the winning side here.

00:08:12.763 --> 00:08:17.122
They fought alongside
the British regulars.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:21.450
They repelled the French and
their Native American allies.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.367
This was actually a pretty
big confidence boost

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:27.249
for

00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:29.838
young America.

00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:35.497
But there were some other
consequences of this war.

00:08:35.497 --> 00:08:37.277
On the not so good side,

00:08:37.277 --> 00:08:40.109
the Seven Year's War was
not particularly good

00:08:40.109 --> 00:08:42.859
for Native Americans, in general.

00:08:43.744 --> 00:08:47.327
Both those who had
allied with the British.

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:51.926
And those who had allied with the French.

00:08:51.926 --> 00:08:53.426
They no longer had

00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:55.874
two imperial powers

00:08:57.603 --> 00:09:00.570
vying against each other in North America

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.845
that they could play off of each other.

00:09:02.845 --> 00:09:05.201
Now, Native Americans were only dealing

00:09:05.201 --> 00:09:07.292
with the British.

00:09:07.292 --> 00:09:09.345
Who certainly were not giving them

00:09:09.345 --> 00:09:12.141
a fair seat at the table.

00:09:12.141 --> 00:09:14.385
Not long after the Seven Year's War,

00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:16.327
they will institute what's called

00:09:16.327 --> 00:09:17.660
the Proclamation

00:09:18.542 --> 00:09:19.375
of 1763.

00:09:22.849 --> 00:09:25.766
Which was basically a boundary line

00:09:27.488 --> 00:09:30.433
along the Appalachian mountains

00:09:30.433 --> 00:09:32.610
saying that that was going to be the

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.762
end of white settlement.

00:09:34.762 --> 00:09:36.694
That they would reserve

00:09:36.694 --> 00:09:38.697
all the lands west

00:09:38.697 --> 00:09:41.997
of the Appalachians for Native Americans.

00:09:41.997 --> 00:09:44.476
Well, you can imagine how much the

00:09:44.476 --> 00:09:46.986
American white settlers respected that.

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:48.957
Which is to say, they completely

00:09:48.957 --> 00:09:51.038
ignored this boundary line.

00:09:51.038 --> 00:09:54.025
So, the Native Americans
will continue to be

00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:55.692
pushed farther west.

00:09:59.786 --> 00:10:01.619
And to develop more of

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:05.068
what we call a race consciousness.

00:10:05.068 --> 00:10:08.259
The idea that they were all in

00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:10.238
one big group together

00:10:10.238 --> 00:10:12.685
who had to combine forces

00:10:12.685 --> 00:10:14.920
to repel English settlement.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.004
The other major outcome of the

00:10:17.004 --> 00:10:19.186
Seven Year's War was

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:20.019
taxation.

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:25.221
Remember that William Pitt won

00:10:25.221 --> 00:10:26.614
the Seven Year's War

00:10:26.614 --> 00:10:28.898
by pouring money into it.

00:10:28.898 --> 00:10:32.067
At the end of the Seven Year's War

00:10:32.067 --> 00:10:34.400
England is in a lot of debt.

00:10:35.522 --> 00:10:39.758
And, they have just
gone to a lot of trouble

00:10:39.758 --> 00:10:43.258
to protect their North American interests.

00:10:46.188 --> 00:10:48.938
Now, as they are looking for ways

00:10:50.118 --> 00:10:51.794
to make revenue

00:10:51.794 --> 00:10:53.938
to make up the deficit,

00:10:53.938 --> 00:10:56.388
the Seven Year's War has placed on them,

00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:59.232
they look at their
North American colonists

00:10:59.232 --> 00:11:02.149
and say, "You should pay your way."

00:11:04.575 --> 00:11:05.408
And,

00:11:06.311 --> 00:11:09.391
the American colonists, who have been used

00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:13.190
to more than century of called salutary,

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.690
or benign neglect,

00:11:16.897 --> 00:11:19.355
are shocked and outraged

00:11:19.355 --> 00:11:22.504
that the British empire is
now clamping down on them.

00:11:22.504 --> 00:11:25.686
And the colonists reaction
to those new taxes

00:11:25.686 --> 00:11:28.909
will propel the colonies into revolution.
