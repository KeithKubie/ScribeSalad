00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this problem, let M be a two-digit number.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The value of M is encrypted using RSA and Alice's private key using no padding--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
like this--given the values of Alice's public key and C the ciphertext

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
in the instructor's comments below, what is M?
