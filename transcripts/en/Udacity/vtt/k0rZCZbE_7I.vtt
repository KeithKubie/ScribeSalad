00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.920
So far, we have expressed specifications in first order logic. UML includes

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.980
a variant of first order logic, called the Object Constraint Language.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.980
We will be going into OCL in subsequent lessons, but

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.680
for now, I would like to show you, what it looks like.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.490
Here's the complete specification of ordered. That was the first part of

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.140
our sort routine, in OCL. That is the signature, the pre and post conditions.
