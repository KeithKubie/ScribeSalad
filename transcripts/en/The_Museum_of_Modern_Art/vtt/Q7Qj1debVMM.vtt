00:00:02.828 --> 00:00:04.913
- Everybody has their own signature,

00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:06.331
their own direction.

00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.458
And when you ask any one here in this room

00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:09.793
to write their name,

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:11.336
they're all gonna be very different.

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:12.629
And some people probably will probably

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.257
some calligraphy like,

00:00:15.257 --> 00:00:19.386
and that R starts to now sprout legs,

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.638
such as thing, you know, dance.

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:23.765
And then when it becomes radical,

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:27.728
the R is right there and it just

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.271
has a kick to it.

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:32.482
And then Renaldi brings
it to another level

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:34.860
where it becomes so abstract

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.571
it's still an R, but
it becomes an animals,

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:39.156
just morphs into a whole thing.

00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:42.325
And then when you add
another letter to that,

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:46.246
it just becomes this whole
abstract war machine.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.247
It's pretty amazing.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.291
You know Taki would write like this,

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:54.291
literally like this, crude, in 1970.

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.465
And if he probably
would have kept writing,

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:58.717
he probably would have
made that T like that

00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:01.678
and then the K and then the I

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:03.972
and then it becomes more stylistic,

00:01:03.972 --> 00:01:08.268
more calligraphy, and it becomes
more attractive, you know?

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.187
So that's what we're doing, but we were

00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:12.356
actually not realizing creating this like

00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:17.356
really kind of like new language. (laughs)
