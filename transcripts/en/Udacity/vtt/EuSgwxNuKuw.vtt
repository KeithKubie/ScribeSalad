Alright, here goes. There are three inherited methods, set text, set answer,

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:07.872
and check answer. And you can tell because they are over here, and they're not

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:12.734
over here. Because choice question extends question, it picks up all of those

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:17.474
methods automatically. It inherits them. Display, on the other hand, is both

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:22.646
here and here. Which tells us that the choice question was not happy with this

00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:28.620
display and provides its own. It overrides the one from the super class.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.610
Finally, there's add choice, which wasn't over here at all, so that's an added

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.217
method that only appears in choice question, but not in question. Next, you'll

00:00:36.217 --> 00:00:39.084
get to implement these two methods, but the good part is, you don't have to

00:00:39.084 --> 00:00:41.998
implement these because they are already in the question class and choice

00:00:41.998 --> 00:00:44.850
question just inherits them.
