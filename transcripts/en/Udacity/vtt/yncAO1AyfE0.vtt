00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.608
Personality disorders are maladaptive and inflexible patterns of cognition,

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:09.370
emotion and behavior. And they generally develop in late childhood or

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.492
adolescence and continue into adulthood. Now there are three distinct clusters

00:00:14.492 --> 00:00:19.430
of personality disorders. There's odd and eccentric personality disorders.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.017
There's dramatic and emotional personality disorders. And anxious fearful

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:29.770
personality disorders. Now we're going to examine the first two in more detail.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.710
Let's first start by looking at the odd and eccentric personality disorders.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.560
First we have schizoid personality disorder. We see that people with this do

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.922
not want to be close in any of their relationships. They're reclusive,

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:48.200
emotionally aloof, and humorless. And they also want to live solitary lives,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.610
therefore we see them engage in solitary activities. They have no interest in

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.301
sex, they don't have close friends. And they don't seem to react to praise or

00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:03.030
criticism from others. Another odd-eccentric diagnosis is schizotypal

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.598
personality disorder. Here, we see these individuals being isolated and

00:01:07.598 --> 00:01:11.694
asocial, but we also see they have odd thoughts, perceptual distortions and

00:01:11.694 --> 00:01:18.052
beliefs. And we may see that these people dressed, act, or appear in peculiar

00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:23.430
or eccentric ways. And finally let's look at paranoid personality disorder.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.770
People with paranoid personality disorder are extremely suspicious and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.386
mistrustful of other people in ways that are unwarranted and not adaptive. They

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:38.560
may often test the loyalty of their friends and lovers. Because they believe

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.460
others are trying to harm them. People with paranoid personality disorder may

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.177
be regularly suspicious of their spouses' faithfulness even if there's no

00:01:46.177 --> 00:01:51.698
evidence that the spouse has been unfaithful. But remember, these are extremes

00:01:51.698 --> 00:01:55.752
of personality. So questioning the faithfulness of a significant other doesn't

00:01:55.752 --> 00:02:00.544
necessarily mean you have a personality disorder. Remember, you would have to

00:02:00.544 --> 00:02:04.140
be extremely paranoid to the point of it interfering with your day life, to

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.389
consider this a personality disorder.
