00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.847
f is a linear function whose
table of values is shown below.

00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:07.430
So they give us different values
of x and what the function is

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.250
for each of those x's.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.210
Which graphs show
functions which

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.860
are increasing at
the same rate as f?

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.900
So what is the rate at
which f is increasing?

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.700
When x increases by 4, we have
our function increasing by 7.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.140
So we could just look
for which of these lines

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.500
are increasing at a rate of
7/4, 7 in the vertical direction

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.780
every time we move 4 in
the horizontal direction.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.820
And an easy way to eyeball
that would actually be just

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.670
to plot two points for f, and
then see what that rate looks

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.070
like visually.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.390
So if we see here when
x is 0, f is negative 1.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.760
When x is 0, f is negative 1.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.210
So when x is 0, f is negative 1.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:08.010
And when x is 4, f is
6, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.480
so just like that.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.350
And two points specify a line.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.924
We know that it is
a linear function.

00:01:13.924 --> 00:01:15.090
You can even verify it here.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.660
When we increase by 4 again,
we increase our function by 7

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.280
again.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.655
We know that these
two points are

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:24.790
on f and so we get a sense
of the rate of change of f.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.290
Now, when you draw it
like that, it immediately

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.160
becomes pretty
clear which of these

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.290
has the same rate
of change of f.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.510
A is increasing faster than f.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.980
C is increasing slower.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.690
A is increasing
much faster than f.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.800
C is increasing slower than f.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.580
B is decreasing, so
that's not even close.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.970
But D seems to have the
exact same inclination,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.970
the exact same slope, as f.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.100
So D is what we would go with.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.480
And we could even
verify it, even

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.360
if we didn't draw
it in this way.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.830
Our change in f for
a given change in x

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.590
is equal to-- when
x changed plus 4,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.700
our function changed plus 7.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.090
It is equal to 7/4.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.690
And we can verify that on D, if
we increase in the x-direction

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.220
by 4, so we go from 4 to 8,
then in the vertical direction

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.160
we should increase by 7,
so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.794
And it, indeed, does increase
at the exact same rate.
