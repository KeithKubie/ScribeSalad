00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.939
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, Susan, you say savory uses MSG. Can you describe this for us please?

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.790
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's a great question Lauren, I'm glad you asked. This flavor is actually

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.693
called Umami, which means pleasant savory taste. You'll find this Umami taste

00:00:14.693 --> 00:00:18.660
in things such as aged meats and cheeses. It's a very difficult flavor to

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.320
describe, but it's also found in MSG, or monosodium glutamate, which is a

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.000
flavoring. So, savory is really a combined sense of both MSG as well as the

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.785
perceived savory odors by your nose.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:36.238
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Interesting. So, what's expected of our sensthletes after they're presented

00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:37.726
with this sample?

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:41.443
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, our senseletes will be presented with five samples, and each of these

00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:46.939
will have a very light version of the flavor. Then, they'll have to correspond

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:51.242
and taste each one and correctly identify the basic favor.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:54.695
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now, do we have a projected winner for this event?

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:59.946
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, Lauren. I'm not sure what the stats are for these senseletes. So, we'll

00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:00.895
just have to wait and see.

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:03.610
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Actually, Susan. If you don't mind, I can interject here. I was speaking to a

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.368
senselete earlier, Alex, who I suspect may win.

00:01:06.368 --> 00:01:07.102
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Why is that?

00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:09.690
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Lauren, stick out your tongue.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.592
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Like this?

00:01:10.592 --> 00:01:12.756
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. Now, do you want to feel the surface for me?

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:13.534
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mm-hmm.

00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:15.822
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can you feel tiny little bumps?

00:01:15.822 --> 00:01:16.386
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:19.226
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now, those bumps are actually clusters of taste buds. And we call these

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:20.325
clusters papilla.

00:01:20.325 --> 00:01:22.235
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Huh. That's interesting.

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:26.235
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It is. You can actually stick your tongue back inside now, yeah. So, anyways,

00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:30.833
humans, on average, have about 10,000 taste buds. Alex, with 10,000 plus

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:35.255
another extra thousand, 11,000 taste buds, just may take home the golden brain

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:36.835
today.

00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:40.000
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's interesting, Andy. Well, I'm actually getting word that our senseletes

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.169
are ready to begin. So, back to you Susan, with coverage of the event.
