00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.737
Now let's look at the process of how light is converted to data.

00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:06.885
And look at the digital process in parallel to what we just looked at

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:09.710
which was the process for doing it for films.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.821
The foundational device, foundational technology if you will, for

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:20.460
converting light to data is a CCD, right, Charge-Coupled Device.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.090
It's an electronic device that basically converts electrical charges into

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.700
a digital value.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.756
So in essence, a pixel on a output that comes out from

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:36.604
the charge coupled device, or a CCD, is basically, are different capacitors.

00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:41.575
Which can work and store incoming photons as electron charges.

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:45.400
Photons are the ones that basically have photoelectric value.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.300
And once they have these capacitors these are converted into electron charges.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.170
And it's this electron charge which is stored and given a digital value.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.228
It's important to note here that Dr. Boyle and Dr. Smith in 1969.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:06.103
While they were working at Bell Labs invented the concept of a CCD,

00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:08.202
a Charge-Coupled Device.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:12.730
And of course, they were awarded with the Nobel prize in 2009.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.929
And actually you know, being person who works in the photography field this was

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:20.014
an amazing piece of technology that they have developed.

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:24.912
&gt;From 1969 to 2009 and of course it's one of the most common pieces of

00:01:24.912 --> 00:01:27.588
technology in our homes, our businesses.

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:30.896
And everybody has one nowadays is basically a camera that is

00:01:30.896 --> 00:01:34.750
somehow the other related to this concept of charge coupled device.
