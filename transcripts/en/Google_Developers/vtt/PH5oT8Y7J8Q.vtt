One of the things I really
love about being a developer

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.580
is that it's this
constant churn of puzzles.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.950
You're constantly trying
to solve a new thing

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.750
or fit new pieces
into a box that

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.780
won't allow them to fit there.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.090
For the analytical mind, it's
just this amazing playground

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.130
that you can just run as
far as you want to in it.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.980
And what's really great about
that is that it's not just

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.490
about solving these problems
and putting them together,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.640
but it's also about having the
ability to influence people,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.330
and make apps for people, and
change the way people's lives

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.350
work, while also still
getting a chance to solve

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.420
these puzzles every day.
