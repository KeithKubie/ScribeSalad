00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.690
And that's just the beginning of what you can

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.580
do with MapReduce. Recommendation systems,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.260
fraud detection, item classification are

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.020
all great problems for MapReduce. These all have some

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.480
basic characteristics in common. They have a lot of data,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.840
and the work can be parallelized rather than slogging

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.990
through in serial. Perhaps one of the more difficult things

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.310
to learn when you're new to Hadoop. Is how to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.620
think about solving problems in terms of MapReduce. It can

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.580
be very different than how you're used to working. And

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.220
frankly, it takes a lot of practice. So in the next

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.840
lesson, we're going to write the code for the sales by

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.490
store problem, and we'll also start talking about other MapReduce problems.
