&gt;&gt;Rachel: My name is Rachel
Arthur, I teach ninth grade English,

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:12.000
and I'm also the ninth
grade level chair.

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:16.146
&gt;&gt;Friar Lawrence is
really upset, right?

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.086
Why would Friar Lawrence be so upset?

00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:19.936
&gt;&gt;The students really got
into, "Romeo and Juliet."

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.716
I just started with teaching
them about Shakespeare,

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.976
William Shakespeare, the person,
and then also we just talked

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:28.616
about Elizabethan terms,
versus contemporary terms,

00:00:28.616 --> 00:00:30.716
so they can get familiar
with that language.

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:34.346
&gt;&gt;What do you think are some
problems that might arise in the fact

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:36.786
that Romeo has not
received the letter yet?

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:40.116
&gt;&gt;As we were reading through the
story, we were collecting evidence,

00:00:40.116 --> 00:00:43.506
whether it was characterization
or just different events

00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:45.016
that happened throughout the play,

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.616
so that they can piece
together an analysis paper

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:49.956
by the end of the unit.

00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:52.056
&gt;&gt;Tell me a couple of
predictions that you guys had.

00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:54.696
&gt;&gt;And we also had some
creative outlets for them,

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:58.346
where they were able to translate
it into contemporary terms.

00:00:58.426 --> 00:01:00.816
&gt;&gt;Student: What means the world
to you, being lost for a guy,

00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:01.966
or being lost for a girl?

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:05.796
To the world, you just mean somebody,
but to somebody, you mean the world.

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:07.556
&gt;&gt;Rachel: They created
their own sonnets.

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:10.956
A lot of people made poems
or raps, or you know,

00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:15.166
just visual representations, just
to show their artistic expression.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.086
&gt;&gt;You connect one or two
of them to, you know,

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:18.976
the tragedy that happened at the end?

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:22.426
&gt;&gt;Each year I feel like I've figured
out a way to kind of make it relevant

00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:23.766
to what's going on in their life.

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:26.386
&gt;&gt;Student: Every time that she
looked at Romeo, she saw love.

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:30.256
So there's a heart in the eye,
to signify love at first sight.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.736
&gt;&gt;Rachel: I think one of the
great things that we do at YES,

00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:34.386
is build positive relationships.

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:37.116
We take time, whether it's
during the school day or outside

00:01:37.116 --> 00:01:38.936
of the school day, to really
get to know our students,

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:43.026
and the students know the
expectations and they recognize

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:46.746
that they need this education to get
to the place that they want to go to.

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:50.596
A lot of them are going back
home to, you know, neighborhoods,

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:52.276
where they see the other side.

00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:54.696
They see what happens if they
don't go to a school like YES,

00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:57.746
and they don't get to go off to
college and get that successful job.

00:01:57.846 --> 00:02:00.376
They love being in an environment
where they have teachers who care

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:03.826
about them, and care about their
success, and they feed off of that,

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:06.336
so when you walk into a classroom,
you will see students, you know,

00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:08.426
engaged and participating
and what not,

00:02:08.426 --> 00:02:11.136
because they know this is their
ticket to something great.

00:02:11.286 --> 00:02:14.066
&gt;&gt;Have you ever seen someone who's
in love, and they lost someone,

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:17.436
and they just commit suicide?

00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:18.216
Frequently?

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:20.006
&gt;&gt;This job is absolutely worth it.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.496
It's challenging, I'm not going
to say that it's not challenging.

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:26.006
We definitely have long hours,
and we put a lot of work,

00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:28.516
even when we go home at the end
of the day, we're still thinking

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:32.956
about YES, but it's worth it, because
we see the change that's happening,

00:02:33.196 --> 00:02:36.146
not only to individual
students and to their families,

00:02:36.196 --> 00:02:39.216
but even just our city is starting
to transform, as they realize,

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:42.576
we have a problem with the
education system, and at YES,

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:45.176
we're doing something to change it.

00:02:46.116 --> 00:02:47.306
