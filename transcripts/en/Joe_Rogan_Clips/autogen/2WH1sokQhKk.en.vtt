animal virus into people and so there's

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
animal virus into people and so there's
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.710
animal virus into people and so there's
this big protest a hundred thousand

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.729
he actually washes his hands so so
people were sending that to me because

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739
people were sending that to me because
 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.789
people were sending that to me because
again like this shirt right and and I I

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799
again like this shirt right and and I I
 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.949
again like this shirt right and and I I
always tell people you know it is that

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959
always tell people you know it is that
 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.020
always tell people you know it is that
idea of what you can't see it's hard to

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030
idea of what you can't see it's hard to
 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.630
idea of what you can't see it's hard to
convince people and with Lister you know

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640
convince people and with Lister you know
 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.009
convince people and with Lister you know
if you think about it here's this young

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019
if you think about it here's this young
 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.539
if you think about it here's this young
guy and he's coming along he's saying

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549
guy and he's coming along he's saying
 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.160
guy and he's coming along he's saying
there's these invisible little creatures

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170
there's these invisible little creatures
 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.350
there's these invisible little creatures
and they're killing your patients and

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360
and they're killing your patients and
 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.190
and they're killing your patients and
trust me

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200
trust me
 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.960
trust me
I have this really weird instrument

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970
I have this really weird instrument
 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.340
I have this really weird instrument
called a microscope and I can see them

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350
called a microscope and I can see them
 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.810
called a microscope and I can see them
and it was a leap of faith

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820
and it was a leap of faith
 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.880
and it was a leap of faith
he was also accusing the older surgeons

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890
he was also accusing the older surgeons
 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.949
he was also accusing the older surgeons
of inadvertently killing their patients

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959
of inadvertently killing their patients
 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:55.970
of inadvertently killing their patients
because if they weren't washing their

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980
because if they weren't washing their
 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.930
because if they weren't washing their
hands they were leading to higher

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940
hands they were leading to higher
 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.910
hands they were leading to higher
mortality rates so they probably fought

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920
mortality rates so they probably fought
 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.560
mortality rates so they probably fought
against it as well yeah so there was

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570
against it as well yeah so there was
 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.300
against it as well yeah so there was
there was huge pushback so what Lister

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310
there was huge pushback so what Lister
 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.890
there was huge pushback so what Lister
ultimately does is he turns to the

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900
ultimately does is he turns to the
 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.600
ultimately does is he turns to the
younger generation and he changes their

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610
younger generation and he changes their
 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.000
younger generation and he changes their
minds and so it's a slow burn it's not

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010
minds and so it's a slow burn it's not
 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.009
minds and so it's a slow burn it's not
like you know the movie moment

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019
like you know the movie moment
 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.840
like you know the movie moment
unfortunately where it just happens all

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850
unfortunately where it just happens all
 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.210
unfortunately where it just happens all
in once and it takes quite a long time

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220
in once and it takes quite a long time
 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.029
in once and it takes quite a long time
on and it's it's weird that it takes so

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039
on and it's it's weird that it takes so
 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.440
on and it's it's weird that it takes so
long because if you think about him

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450
long because if you think about him
 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.009
long because if you think about him
coming in 1876 to America it's after the

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019
coming in 1876 to America it's after the
 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.260
coming in 1876 to America it's after the
Civil War people were dying soldiers

were dying of high infection rates they
 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.150
were dying of high infection rates they
were packed

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160
were packed
 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.420
were packed
wounds with mud I mean they couldn't get

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430
wounds with mud I mean they couldn't get
 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.070
wounds with mud I mean they couldn't get
worse than that right and so people were

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080
worse than that right and so people were
 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.450
worse than that right and so people were
dying of all the all these kinds of
