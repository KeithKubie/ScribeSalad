00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
Sean&gt; How do Bitcoin miners mine?

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.600
Mike&gt; There's no actual digging involved. Think back to

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.050
our video on hashing - so a hash function
takes a message of any length and

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.519
returns a fixed length hash which
hopefully looks quite random right so if

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.880
you change even a little bit of your
message the whole hash changes, so this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.680
is how Bitcoin mining works right in
brief... So we have a block and at the top

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.869
of the block is the hash of the previous
block and a number right which we're

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.080
going to call our nonce this is a number
we're making up let's start at 1 and go

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.130
up and then here we've got all the
transactions so transactions - one of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.100
which will give me some bitcoins because
I'm the miner. The way this works is I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.329
start with a random number here and then
I hash this entire thing and I get a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.739
hash out the bottom here. To mine
successfully this hash needs to be very

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.289
very small so let's say for example it
has ten leading zeros as an example if I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.670
successfully pick a number where when I
hash this entire thing including the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.010
number it has ten leading zeros I've
successfully mined that Bitcoin. Now

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.369
that's quite unlikely you've got to
think that each zero &amp; one has a roughly

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.020
50% chance of being a one so to get one
leading zero it's going to be about 50%

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.729
of the time two leading zeros about 25%
of the time and so on the more leading

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.810
zeros we require the harder this process
is. So it doesn't happen yeah the first

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.369
time I pick a one I hash it and it
doesn't work so what I do is I go to 2

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.909
and I hash it again and I get a
totally different hash which maybe has a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.009
different number of leading zeroes and I
go "does this does this work?" no, ok so 3, 4

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.350
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and so on and I just keep
churning away with these random numbers

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.610
in this "nonce" field here incorporating
any transactions I've received in the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.860
meantime until I get this kind of golden
hash that I've been looking for which is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.250
very very small so lets say 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 some

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.759
numbers say 1 0 1 1 and something like
that right now

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.610
this is sha-256 in the case of Bitcoin
so it's 256 bits long now as soon as I've

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.619
done that I go well brilliant I've got
some bitcoins i transmit this to the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.670
network and everyone sees this and goes
cool and then they take this hash and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.660
they put it in the next block and start
mining on that one as well with new

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.470
random numbers
so every time someone stumbles across a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.820
hash which is small enough that's when
they've mined the Bitcoin right and so

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.850
that's how the difficulty of a network
is changed - you just change the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.010
threshold of number of zeros or size of
your hash that you need to be below in

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.360
order to be successful every couple of
thousand blocks the network will look

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.810
at how long it took and if like a bunch
more miners have appeared so it's

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.720
actually starting to get a little bit
too easy they'll they'll increase this

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.660
difficulty
such that hopefully a Bitcoin is mined

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.630
roughly every ten minutes
now of course this process is random so

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.840
it might be less, might be more but on
average... If a bunch of miners

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.560
disappeared
suddenly it's taking 50 minutes to mine a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.700
Bitcoin (Block?) they'll just reduce this
threshold so that you can mine that

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.180
little bit more easily. The number of
bitcoins that a miner is awarded is halved

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.870
every so often as well - so I think is it
at 12.5 at the moment so I will have

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.560
sort of plus 12.5 for Mike in here as
sort of my benefit of being the miner so

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.050
this will only ever get actually put
into the blockchain if I'm the one that

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.720
finds this hash otherwise unfortunately
it'll be someone else's name in here

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.610
Sean&gt; we've sat here and watched Beast churn
through billions of password hashes -

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.411
How hard can it be to come up with this
number?

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.140
Mike&gt; As hard as they need it to be

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.230
you've got to think that for all the
miners on earth at least a lot of them

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.510
have got dedicated hardware many
trillions of hashes and they're still

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.600
only doing it every 10 minutes right
it's not easy to do

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.770
and they can just keep making this more
difficult until it takes about ten

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.040
minutes. In some ways you can't make the problem more easy by buying more and

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.640
more hardware because it will just make
itself more difficult for you.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.400
For now most of my contact with it is via a terminal and I ask it to do things it

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.230
does them very, very fast. This particular
server has four Titan X graphics cards

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.100
in it a Titan X is one of the foremost
graphics cards there are new....
