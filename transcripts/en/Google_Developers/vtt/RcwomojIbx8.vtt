[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.680
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So here
we are in the Sandbox.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.170
I'm so glad that you'll be
here with us for the next three

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.040
days, as we explore everything
on the ground at Google I/O.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.460
First off is the Mocktail Mixer.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.320
It's not getting started early,
because there's no alcohol.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.042
Chris, would you
tell me about this?

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:22.750
CHRIS: Excellent.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.470
Thanks, Timothy.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.285
So this was a
do-it-yourself mixer

00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:27.910
that has the Google
Assistant built in.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.610
It was part of a collaboration
between the Assistant team

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.830
and Deeplocal, these
guys behind you.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.630
It's a creative agency
out of Pittsburgh.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.490
And what they've done is they've
used the Google Assistant

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.500
SDK, which we launched
three weeks ago,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.990
and Actions on Google to
customize the drink, the drink

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.629
ingredients, and the code, as
well as services like API.AI,

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.420
to create a conversational
interface so you

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.060
can have a natural
interaction with the mixer.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.440
So it's a super demo.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.540
It shows you how to go
from zero to prototyping

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.860
in a matter of hours.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.068
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now, I want
to talk a little bit more

00:00:56.068 --> 00:00:58.330
about this demo and the
SDK and all the things

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.110
that we can do with it, but
first let's make a drink.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.443
CHRIS: You want to make a drink?

00:01:02.443 --> 00:01:04.120
Let's give it a shot.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.504
Let's talk to Mocktails Mixer.

00:01:06.504 --> 00:01:07.170
SPEAKER 1: Sure.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.690
Here is the test version
of Mocktails Mixer.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.280
SPEAKER 2: Hi.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.321
I'm your Mocktails Mixer.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.660
CHRIS: What's on the menu?

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.840
SPEAKER 2: On tap today, I have
a pairing mode and Mang-I/O.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.797
What can I get you?

00:01:21.797 --> 00:01:23.130
CHRIS: Let's get a pairing mode.

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:28.940
SPEAKER 2: Coming right up.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.872
Initiating ones and zeros.

00:01:30.872 --> 00:01:34.490
Beep boop, bop, boop boop.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.210
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Is that the
robot sounds it's making?

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.757
CHRIS: Yeah, so
it's actually like--

00:01:38.757 --> 00:01:40.840
it's going from my voice,
going through this mike,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.210
through the Assistant SDK,
running on a Raspberry Pi

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.650
device-- which I think Oscar
will talk a little bit more

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.280
about--

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.339
going back to the
Assistant services server

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.630
running in the cloud, and
figuring out what I'm saying,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.220
doing natural language
understanding and speech

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.870
recognition, and then
basically coming back

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.036
and controlling the devices.

00:01:54.036 --> 00:01:57.070
And now you see we've started
making the pairing mode drinks

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.600
for everybody around here.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.720
OK, there's a bunch of drinks.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.130
So, we have some other
friends joining us.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.339
Let's start with Oscar.

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:07.630
Oscar, you're one of the guys
that actually built this.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.171
OSCAR: Yeah, so I
work for Deeplocal.

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.670
We worked, like Chris said, with
the SDK team on the project.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.200
And basically,
the way this works

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.520
is there's a Raspberry Pi inside
the device that runs the SDK.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.370
And when you speak with
it, it runs up to API.AI,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.250
where you can program your
conversational interface.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.990
From there, there's
a web hook that's

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.970
called that, when
you call a drink,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.810
it pushes a message over Google
Pub/Sub down to the devices,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.680
and actually sends a serial
command to the Arduinos inside.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.630
That is actually what
controls the motors

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.356
and dispenses the liquid.

00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:41.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That was, like,
a design doc in five sentences.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.540
Thank you.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.060
OSCAR: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.800
And everything is open
source and online,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.290
so you can find it on GitHub
if you search for Mocktails

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.400
Mixers, or if you go to
Deeplocal.com/mocktailsmixers,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.090
there's a write-up and a
video and DIY instructions

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.462
so the home builder
can make it themselves.

00:02:56.462 --> 00:02:57.670
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's Wayne.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.140
Wayne, you're the home builder.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.820
WAYNE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.565
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
So Wayne, you are

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:04.690
one of the developer
advocates working on Assistant

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.210
and the SDK and all these APIs.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.590
Is this what you
do all the time?

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.510
WAYNE: Well, I made a dog feeder
one time, but this is new.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.410
I've got to get into this now.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.060
I can imagine something
where you can, like,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.350
mix up custom food or
something like that.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.890
That'd be kind of cool.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You
made a dog feeder.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.050
They made a human feeder.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.600
WAYNE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're
gonna merge them together now,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.120
right?

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.670
That's the cool thing
is, because this SDK is

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.290
available to the public, anyone
can build devices like this

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.927
now.

00:03:24.927 --> 00:03:26.260
I'm quite excited about it, too.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.540
So I need to go home and
work out my next plan

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.890
for some kind of dog feeder.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well,
that's the really cool thing

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.260
about this recent release.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.044
Like, the SDK just came
out a few weeks ago, right?

00:03:35.044 --> 00:03:35.710
Three weeks ago?

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.560
And it's really giving
the ability for people

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.810
to bring the Assistant
into their own hardware.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.860
WAYNE: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.620
I mean, you can take any
crazy idea that you've got,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.870
and you can embed the
Assistant SDK into it,

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.852
run it on-- runs on most Linux
operating systems and so forth.

00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:51.560
And it's just really
easy to get started.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.185
And we've got a whole
bunch of samples.

00:03:53.185 --> 00:03:54.180
People can try it out.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.630
All the demos here--
we have other demos,

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.004
as well-- they're
all open source

00:03:57.004 --> 00:03:58.361
so people can try them out.

00:03:58.361 --> 00:03:59.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
again, just like

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.100
sort of taking a look at the
value of that, it's really--

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.390
this is something that people
have been doing before,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.081
but they had to build the
whole stack themselves, right,

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.580
which includes a
lot of technologies

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.040
that they don't want to
really be experts in.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.677
But Google can be
the expert for them,

00:04:13.677 --> 00:04:15.260
and you can just use
the APIs instead.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.170
WAYNE: You can focus on
what you're good at, which

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.430
is making these
kinds of devices,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.929
and leave all the
speech recognition

00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:22.780
and the natural language
understanding to us,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.150
and we take care of it for you.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.150
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.360
Are the drinks ready?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.110
Oh, I see they're
getting poured out.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.580
CHRIS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK,
well while we're

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.560
waiting for the drinks, Vera,
tell me about some of the ways

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.435
that people are using
the Assistant today.

00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:38.380
VERA: Awesome.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.710
So today at I/O, we announced
that the Assistant is

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.940
fundamentally conversational.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.440
So everything that
we're seeing here

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.550
that Wayne mentioned, that it's
natural language processing,

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.170
you're able to actually, as a
user, talk to the Assistant,

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.330
and the Assistant can
do things for you.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.020
And so the Assistant is live
across devices like this

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.770
through our open SDK, but
it's also live across Android.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.950
And we announced an iOS app, so
you can get it on your iPhone.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.500
And it's also live on wearables,
and soon TVs, cars, et cetera.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.290
And the Assistant can--

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.320
so as a part of our developer
platform, Actions on Google,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.320
the Assistant can
order cows for you,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.740
or make table reservations,
or even up your smart home

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.720
so it can clean your apartment.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.580
And so we're really
excited about what

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.539
developers will build on top
of the platform to help users.

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:28.830
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.100
I think the drinks are ready.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.510
CHRIS: Do you want to drink it?

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I sure do.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.700
VERA: Yeah.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This is the--

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.550
which drink is this?

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.682
CHRIS: Pairing mode.

00:05:36.682 --> 00:05:37.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Pairing mode.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:38.593
I get it.

00:05:38.593 --> 00:05:39.384
VERA: Cheers, guys.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.687
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
pretty fantastic.

00:05:44.687 --> 00:05:45.270
I'm impressed.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.380
WAYNE: It tastes better because
it was made with technology.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What was that?

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.110
WAYNE: It tastes better because
it was made with technology.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
absolutely right.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.393
CHRIS: We're putting artificial
intelligence into your drinks.

00:05:53.393 --> 00:05:53.964
Done.

00:05:53.964 --> 00:05:56.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So I'm gonna
drink a little bit more

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.350
of this, but maybe while
I do that, can you talk

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.740
about where you see this going?

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.740
Like, what are you most
excited about developers

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.004
doing with this technology?

00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:04.420
CHRIS: Yes, it's
a great question.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.590
So what we envision is a
ubiquitous system experience

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.630
so that, when you need
help or need something

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.150
to be done in your life, that
you can just ask the question

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.420
and it will happen, right.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.869
So for that experience
to really surface,

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:17.910
you need to have the
Assistant in multiple places

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.515
in your life.

00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:19.890
And we don't expect
a Google Home

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.030
to be in every
corner of your house,

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.400
and we also don't expect Google
to build all the appliances

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.750
in your house.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.041
It just doesn't make any sense.

00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:28.146
So what we need to do is we need
to empower a diverse ecosystem

00:06:28.146 --> 00:06:29.520
of device
manufacturers embedding

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.170
the Assistant in their devices.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.210
Then you can have the
Assistant available to you

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.300
when you need it, wherever you
need it, however you need it.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.466
So that's really where we
see this going longer-term

00:06:37.466 --> 00:06:39.840
in the Assistant SDK, and
Actions on Google and API.AI

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.150
are just the beginnings
of where we're going.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.600
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.600
Well, thank you so much.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.060
Thank you, everybody.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.530
And to you all
out there, cheers.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.880
