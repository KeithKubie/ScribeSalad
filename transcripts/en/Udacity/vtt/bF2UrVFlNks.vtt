00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.280
So, according to the western views of the sexual response, what comprises the

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.985
three phase sexual response, and what comprises the four phase sexual response.

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:13.953
Now what I want you to do is write the corresponding number in the appropriate

00:00:13.953 --> 00:00:19.090
box for each phase. So, for the three phase sexual response, you might write 1,

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.301
2, 3, or whatever the answer actually is.

00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:22.730
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.934
Same with phase four. You write a number in each one of these boxes. Now, some

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:32.340
of the phases you might repeat and use in both. That's okay. Give it a try.
