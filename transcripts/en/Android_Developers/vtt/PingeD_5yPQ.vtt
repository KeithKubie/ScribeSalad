Ringgold: I was born
in 1930 in Harlem,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.600
and now my work
is all over the world.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.400
Isn't that something?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.080
Wiberg: It's really
a wonderful feeling

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.120
to make something
that makes a difference

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.920
for other people.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.960
Bokkers: I've done
over 150,000 kilometers,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.360
and maybe someday,
I will look back at it

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.160
and feel like,
"Yeah, I've had a good life."

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.120
Ringgold: The most important
thing to me in life

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.840
is inspiration.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.000
It's 1973.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
