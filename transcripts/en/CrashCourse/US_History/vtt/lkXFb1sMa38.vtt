00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.540
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
US History and today we’re gonna talk about

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.440
the 1960s.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green. Great. The decade made

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.980
famous by the narcissists who lived through
it.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.920
Hey, Me From the Past, finally you and I agree
about something wholeheartedly.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.169
But while I don’t wish to indulge the baby-boomers’
fantasies about their centrality to world

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.150
history, the sixties were an important time.
I mean, there was the Cold War, Vietnam, a

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.169
rising tide of conservatism (despite Woodstock),
racism.

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.880
There were the Kennedy’s and Camelot, John,
Paul, George, and to a lesser extent, Ringo.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.140
And of course, there was also Martin Luther
King Jr.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.140
intro
So, the 1960s saw people organizing and actively

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.370
working for change both in the social order
and in government. This included the student

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.430
movement, the women’s movement, movements
for gay rights, and a push by the courts to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.870
expand rights in general.
But, by the end of the 1960s, the anti-war

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.460
movement seemed to have overshadowed all the
rest.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.719
So as you’ll no doubt remember from last
week, the civil rights movement began in the

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:09.170
1950s if not before, but many of its key moments
happened in the sixties.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.030
And this really began with sit-ins that took
place in Greensboro North Carolina. Black

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.590
university students walked into Woolworths
and waited at the lunch counters to be served,

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.270
or, more likely, arrested.
After 5 months of that, those students eventually

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.950
got Woolworths to serve black customers.
Then, in 1961 leaders from the Congress On

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.090
Racial Equality launched Freedom Rides to
integrate interstate buses. Volunteers rode

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.520
the buses into the Deep South where they faced
violence including beatings and a bombing

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.439
in Anniston AL.
But despite that, those freedom rides also

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.719
proved successful and eventually the ICC desegregated
interstate buses.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.979
In fact, by the end of the 60s over 70,000
people had taken part in demonstrations, from

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.340
sit-ins, to teach-ins, to marches.
But they weren’t all successful. Martin

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.549
Luther King’s year-long protests in Albany,
GA didn’t end discrimination in the city.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.539
And it took JFK ordering federal troops to
escort James Meredith to class for him to

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.399
attend the University of Mississippi.
The University of Mississippi: America’s

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.319
fallback college. Sorry, I’m from Alabama.
So, the Civil Rights movement reached its

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.540
greatest national prominence in 1963 when
Martin Luther King came to my hometown of

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.250
Birmingham, Alabama, where there had been
more than 50 racially-motivated bombings since

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.599
WWII.
Television brought the reality of the Jim

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.569
Crow South into people’s homes as images
of Bull Connor’s police dogs and water cannons

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.250
being turned on peaceful marchers, many of
them children, horrified viewers and eventually

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.959
led Kennedy to endorse the movement’s goals.
Probably should mention that John F. Kennedy

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.349
was president of the United States at the
time, having been elected in 1960. He was

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.319
assassinated in 1963 leading to Lyndon Johnson.
Alright, politics over.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.290
Anyway, in response to these peaceful protests,
Birmingham jailed Martin Luther King where

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.689
he wrote one of the great letters in American
history (doesn’t have a great name): Letter

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.390
from Birmingham Jail.
1963 also saw the March on Washington, the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.560
largest public demonstration in American history
up to that time where King gave his famous

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.750
speech, “I have a Dream.”
King and the other organizers called for a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.260
civil rights bill and help for the poor, demanding
public works, a higher minimum wage, and an

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.439
end to discrimination in employment.
Which eventually, in one of the great bright

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.920
spots in American history, did sort of happen
with the Civil Rights Act.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.870
So, one reason American history teachers focus
on the Civil Rights Movement so much is that

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.659
it successfully brought actual legislative
change.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.549
After being elected president, John F. Kennedy
was initially cool to civil rights, but to

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.909
be fair, the Cold War occupied a lot of his
time, what with the Cuban Missile Crisis and

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.900
the Bay of Pigs and whatnot.
But the demonstrations of 1963 pushed John

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.219
F. Kennedy to support civil rights more actively.
According to our dear friend, the historian

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.969
Eric Foner, “Kennedy realized that the United
States simply could not declare itself the

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:51.150
champion of freedom throughout the world while
maintaining a system of racial inequality

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.060
at home.”[1]
So that June he appeared on TV and called

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.590
on Congress to pass a law that would ban discrimination
in all public accommodations.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.489
And then he was assassinated. Thanks, Lee
Harvey Oswald. Or possibly someone else. But

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.239
probably Lee Harvey Oswald.
So then, Lyndon Johnson became president and

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.790
he pushed Congress to pass the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.359
The law prohibited discrimination in employment,
schools, hospitals, and privately owned public

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.250
places like restaurants, and hotels and theaters,
and it also banned discrimination on the basis

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.620
of sex.
The Civil Rights Act was a major moment in

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.210
American legislative history, but it hardly
made the United States a haven of equality.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.509
So, Civil Rights leaders continued to push
for the enfranchisement of African Americans.

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.860
After Freedom Summer workers registered people
in Mississippi to vote, King launched a march

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.020
for voting rights in Selma, Alabama in January,
1965.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.370
And television swayed public opinion in favor
of the demonstrators. Thank you, TV, for your

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.389
one and only gift to humanity. Just kidding.
Battlestar Galactica.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.919
So, in 1965 Congress passed the Voting Rights
Act, which gave the federal government the

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.229
power to oversee voting in places where discrimination
was practiced.

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.490
In 1965, Congress also passed the Hart-Cellar
Act, which got rid of national origin quotas

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.160
and allowed Asian immigrants to immigrate
to the United States. Unfortunately the law

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.669
also introduced quotas on immigrants from
the Western Hemisphere.

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.060
Lyndon Johnson’s domestic initiatives from
1965 through 1967 are known as the Great Society,

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.110
and it’s possible that if he hadn’t been
responsible for America escalating the war

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.270
in Vietnam, he might have been remembered,
at least by liberals, as one of America’s

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.720
greatest presidents.
Because the Great Society expanded a lot of

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.520
the promises of the New Deal, especially in
the creation of health insurance programs,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.770
like Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid
for the poor.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.630
He also went to War on Poverty. Never go to
war with a noun. You will always lose.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.569
Johnson treated poverty as a social problem,
rather than an economic one. So instead of

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.630
focusing on jobs or guaranteed income, his
initiatives stressed things like training.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.550
That unfortunately failed to take into account
shifts in the economy away from high wage

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.720
union manufacturing jobs toward more lower-wage
service jobs. [2]

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.940
Here’s what Eric Foner had to say about
Johnson’s domestic accomplishments: “By

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.690
the 1990s […] the historic gap between whites
and blacks in education, income, and access

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.789
to skilled employment narrowed considerably.
But with deindustrialization and urban decay

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:17.370
affecting numerous families and most suburbs
still being off limits to non-white people,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.750
the median wealth of white households remained
ten times greater than that of African Americans,

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.910
and nearly a quarter of all black children
lived in poverty.”

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.479
While Congress was busy enacting Johnson’s
Great Society programs, the movement for African

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.210
American freedom was changing. Let’s go
to the ThoughtBubble.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.900
Persistent poverty and continued discrimination
in the workplace, housing, education, and

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.650
criminal justice system might explain the
shift away from integration and toward black

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.139
power, a celebration of African American culture
and criticism of whites’ oppression. 1964

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.659
saw the beginnings of riots in city ghettoes,
for instance, mostly in Northern cities.

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:58.889
The worst riots were in 1965 in Watts, in
southern California. These left 35 people

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:05.069
dead, 900 injured, and $30 million in damage.
Newark and Detroit also saw devastating riots

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:11.599
in 1967. In 1968 the Kerner Report blamed
the cause of the rioting on segregation, poverty,

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:15.300
and white racism.
Then there’s Malcolm X, who many white people

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.930
regarded as an advocate for violence, but
who also called for self-reliance. It’s

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.599
tempting to see leadership shifting from King
to X as the civil rights movement became more

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:30.580
militant, but Malcolm X was active in the
early 1960s and he was killed in 1965, three

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.669
years before Martin Luther King was assassinated
and before all the major shifts in emphasis

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:39.080
towards black power.
Older Civil Rights groups like CORE abandoned

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.440
integration as a goal after 1965 and started
to call for black power. The rhetoric of Black

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.449
Power could be strident, but its message of
black empowerment was deeply resonant for

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:54.270
many. Oakland’s Black Panther Party did
carry guns in self-defense but they also offered

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.789
a lot of neighborhood services. But the Black
Power turned many white people away from the

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:03.280
struggle for African American freedom, and
by the end of the 1960s, many Americans’

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.939
attention had shifted to anti-war movement.
Thanks, ThoughtBubble. So it was Vietnam that

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:12.509
really galvanized students even though many
didn’t have to go to Vietnam because they

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:17.750
had student deferments. They just really,
really didn’t want their friends to go.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.439
The anti-war movement and the civil rights
movement inspired other groups to seek an

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:26.319
end to oppression. Like, Latinos organized
to celebrate their heritage and end discrimination.

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:31.580
Latino activism was like black power, but
much more explicitly linked to labor justice,

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.690
especially the strike efforts led by Cesar
Chavez and the United Farm Workers.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.890
The American Indian Movement, founded in 1968,
took over Alcatraz to symbolize the land that

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:45.430
had been taken from Native Americans. And
they won greater tribal control over education,

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.600
economic development, and they also filed
suits for restitution.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.000
And in June of 1969, after police raided a
gay bar, called the Stonewall Inn, members

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.810
of the gay community began a series of demonstrations
in New York City, which touched off the modern

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.880
gay liberation movement.
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.980
The rules here are pretty simple.
I read the Mystery Document, guess the author,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.339
I’m either right or I get shocked.
Alright, what have we got here.

00:09:09.339 --> 00:09:13.750
If the Bill of Rights contains no guarantee
that a citizen shall be secure against lethal

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.690
poisons distributed either by private individuals
or by public officials [I already know it!],

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:23.560
it is surely only because our forefathers,
despite their considerable wisdom and foresight,

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.940
could conceive of no such problem.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.950
Rachel Carson! Silent Spring. YES. I am on
such a roll.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.810
Silent Spring was a massively important book
because it was the first time that anyone

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.690
really described all of the astonishingly
poisonous things we were putting into the

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.610
air and the ground and the water.
Fortunately, that’s all been straightened

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:46.680
out now and everything that we do and make
as human beings is now sustainable. What’s

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.550
that? Oh god.
The environmental movement gained huge bipartisan

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.860
support and it resulted in important legislation
during the Nixon era, including the Clean

00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:00.410
Air and Water Acts, and the Endangered Species
Act. And yes, I said that environmental legislation

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:05.310
was passed during the Nixon administration.
But perhaps the most significant freedom movement

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:10.820
in terms of number of people involved and
long-lasting effects was the American Feminist

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.690
movement.
This is usually said to have begun with the

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.950
publication of Betty Friedan’s book The
Feminine Mystique, which set out to describe

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.160
“the problem that has no name.” Turns
out the name is “misogyny.” [3]

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.070
Friedan described a constricting social and
economic system that affected mostly middle

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:30.130
class women, but it resonated with the educated
classes and led to the foundation of the National

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:34.980
Organization of Women in 1966.
Participation in student and civil rights

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.260
movements led many women to identify themselves
as members of a group that was systematically

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.269
discriminated against.
And by “systemic,” I mean that in 1963,

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:51.269
5.8% of doctors were women and 3.7% of lawyers
were women and fewer than 10% of doctoral

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.500
degrees went to women. They are more than
half of the population.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:00.339
While Congress responded with the Equal Pay
Act in 1963, younger women sought greater

00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:05.420
power and autonomy in addition to legislation.
Crucially, 60s-era feminists opened America

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:11.279
to the idea that the “personal is political,”
especially when it came to equal pay, childcare,

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:13.850
and abortion.
Weirdly, the branch of government that provided

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:18.870
most support to the expansion of personal
freedom in the 1960s was the most conservative

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:24.170
one, the Supreme Court. The Warren Court handed
down so many decisions expanding civil rights

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.740
that the era has sometimes been called a rights
revolution.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.010
The Warren court expanded the protections
of free speech and assembly under the First

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.510
Amendment and freedom of the press in the
New York Times v. Sullivan decision. It struck

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:40.610
down a law banning interracial marriage in
the most appropriately named case ever, Loving

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.930
v. Virginia.
And although this would become a lightning

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.130
rod for many conservatives, Supreme Court
decisions greatly expanded the protections

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.029
of people accused of crimes.
Gideon v. Wainwright secured the right to

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:56.380
attorney, Mapp v. Ohio established the exclusionary
rule under the Fourth Amendment, and Miranda

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:01.529
v. Arizona provided fodder for Channing Tatum
in his great movie, 21 Jump Street, insuring

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:05.589
that he would always have to say to every
perp, “You have the right to remain silent.”

00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:09.000
But you can’t silence my heart, Channing
Tatum. It beats only for thee.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.399
But, the most innovative and controversial
decisions actually established a new right

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:18.660
where none had existed in the constitution.
Griswold v. Connecticut, dealt with contraception,

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.060
and Roe v. Wade, guaranteed a woman’s right
to an abortion (at least in the first trimester).

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.070
And those two decisions formed the basis of
a new right, the right to privacy.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.860
Protests, the counter culture, and the liberation
movements continued well into the early 1970s,

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.019
losing steam with the end of the Vietnam war
and America’s economy plunging into the

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:41.389
toilet. For many, though, the year 1968 sums
up the decade.

00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:46.380
1968 began with the Tet Offensive in Vietnam,
which stirred up the anti-war protests. Then

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.790
racial violence erupted after the assassination
of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:56.110
Then, anti-war demonstrators as well as some
counter culture types arrived in large numbers

00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:01.470
at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago
where they were set upon by police and beaten

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.760
in what was later described as a “police
riot.”

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.589
1968 also saw the Prague Spring uprising in
Czechoslovakia crushed by the Soviets. And

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:13.690
student demonstrators were killed by the police
in Mexico City where the Olympics were held

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.290
and Parisian students took to the streets
in widespread protests against, you know,

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.889
France.
All this unrest scared a lot of people who

00:13:20.889 --> 00:13:25.930
ended up voting for Richard Nixon and his
promises to return to law and order.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:31.480
Ultimately, like any decade or arbitrary historical
“age,” the 60s defies easy categorization.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.449
Yes, there were hippies and liberation movements,
but there were also reactions to those movements.

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:39.870
On this one, I’m just gonna leave it up
to Eric Foner to summarize the decade’s

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.180
legacy:
“[The 1960s] made possible the entrance

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.870
of numerous members of racial minorities into
the mainstream of American life, while leaving

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.820
unsolved the problem of urban poverty. It
set in motion a transformation of the status

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:57.060
of women. It changed what Americans expected
from government – from clean air and water

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.380
to medical coverage in old age.
And at the same time, it undermined confidence

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:07.079
in national leaders. Relations between young
and old, men and women, and white and non-white,

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:11.269
along with every institution in society, changed
as a result.”

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:15.199
But there’s one last thing I want to emphasize.
All of this wasn’t really the result of,

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:20.350
like, a radical revolution. It was the result
of a process that had been going on for decades.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:25.769
I mean, arguably a process that had been going
on for hundreds of years. Thanks for watching,

00:14:25.769 --> 00:14:29.459
I’ll see you next week.
Crash Course is made with the help of all

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:33.910
these nice people and it’s possible because
of generous support from the Bluth Family

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.839
Frozen Banana Stand. Just kidding. We don’t
have corporate sponsors. We have you.

00:14:38.839 --> 00:14:42.470
