LOUIS GRAY: And welcome back.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.000
Thanks for doing those
Sandbox interviews.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.430
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.900
My pleasure.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.470
LOUIS GRAY: It was a lot of fun
to see exactly what the

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.655
developers are seeing,
especially with Google+, since

00:00:13.655 --> 00:00:16.650
it is a fairly new platform
in terms of Google.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.200
I wanted to ask you real quick,
what did the developers

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.790
say to you that really
struck you?

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.360
What was it about their initial
interaction with

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.425
Google+ and Google+ sign in that
they're finding, and how

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:27.350
are their users responding?

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.430
DANIEL SIEBERG: You know,
universally, first of all,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.749
they said that their experience
with the Google+

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.860
team on the development side was
fantastic, that they were

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.720
there with them every step of
the way, understanding new

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.035
ways that they can kind
of iterate on Google+.

00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:41.230
And as you say, it is a
relatively new way for

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.670
developers to think about
including it in any site,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.890
whether it's the sign in, or
Hangouts, or whatever it is.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.100
And they were really kind of
pushing what was possible, and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.970
thinking of new ways to do it,
which I thought was really

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.010
cool, and they were extremely
complimentary

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.380
of the Google+ team.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.770
LOUIS GRAY: And one thing I
think that's really been

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.040
highlighted, not only in our
discussion of Google I/O, what

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.980
we're focused on at this entire
conference-- but even

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.760
the press response has been
absolutely solid this year--

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.470
is seeing how closely
we're focused

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.836
on a developer community.

00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:09.860
You know, obviously we have a
lot of really interesting

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.030
services that impact consumers,
but this is all

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.400
about developers at
this conference.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.740
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.280
Almost every story that I've
read about this has referenced

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.130
that in some way, that it is a
huge acknowledgement to that

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.430
developer community.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.810
That yes, of course there are
things here that consumers are

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.130
interested in, however, the bulk
of the announcements and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.940
the conversations here are
really targeted at developers.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.060
LOUIS GRAY: As someone who works
in developer relations

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.650
and runs Google Developers
Live, that's

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.000
like music to my ears.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.020
And so I'm really excited to
see that the developers are

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.220
hearing what we've been saying,
and making their

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.240
applications better for users
with the APIs and the tools

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.380
that we've given them.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.940
And one thing I wanted to look
at, when you look at

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.320
yesterday's keynote, we had a
really interesting updated to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.210
Google Play.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.750
And not only did Google Play
get a refresh-- and like we

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.590
said, it looks the same
across mobile,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.000
and tablet, and desktop.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.090
DANIEL SIEBERG: From a
design standpoint.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.510
LOUIS GRAY: From a design
standpoint.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.390
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, the UI.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.800
LOUIS GRAY: But one of the
things that was especially

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.510
important was really what Google
takes to the heart of

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.680
everything we do, is data, and
making sure that they have the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.260
analytics of that data.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.955
And so you look about a Google+
sign in user, and you

00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:14.530
look at really any Android
application development user,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.200
you basically have a situation
where you can count exactly

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.910
how many installs you
have, whether

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.390
that's going up or down.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.890
And, to improve the type of
analytics, to help you do a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.380
better job of marketing your
devices, marketing your

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.310
applications, and seeing what's
working and what's not.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.660
I thought it was especially
important to take the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.820
learnings that we have from
Google Analytics, where we can

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.720
really tell you what's happening
on your website in

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.370
real time, and tell you ways to
improve your campaigns from

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.610
a marketing perspective.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.915
But to do that on Google
Play just make sense.

00:02:42.915 --> 00:02:46.500
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, and to be
able to do that rapidly and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.070
strategically, and get that
feedback through Google

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.620
Analytics, I think that was
something that a lot of these

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.270
developers were craving for
a long time, frankly.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.970
And now that they have that
ability, as you say, to kind

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.910
of make those changes
very quickly, I

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.565
think that's very powerful.

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:02.550
I mean, this is, ultimately at
the end of the day, we're

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.560
talking about building your
revenue, and making sure that

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.090
you're targeting those people,
and that you're hitting all

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.725
the right places to
get those results.

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:11.990
LOUIS GRAY: And especially
for those people for whom

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.320
development is not a hobby.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.710
It's their lifeblood.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.330
You know, they make profit or
they don't make a profit

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.630
depending on how well they
market their applications, how

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.140
well they build their
applications, and how well

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.890
they get them in the hands of
consumers who can give you

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.510
immediate feed back in Google
Play as to whether that's

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.600
working or not.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.430
And so I think the real sweet
attention to detail, and being

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.720
able to help people promote it
and get that right, I think we

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.220
have incredible tools including
Translation.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.380
How do you go ahead and
translate your application.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.350
There's a way even with
integration with Google

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.680
Wallet-- it was really quick
they did that demo-- but you

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.870
can go in and say, I need this
application translated into

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.520
Russian, or French, or whatever
those ones that you

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.290
need to knock out.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.040
And with a quick payment through
Google Wallet, you can

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.920
go ahead and get that translated
and shipped off

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.020
through the Google Play store,
and that really seemed like

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.850
good attention to detail.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.040
You take and harness, as we said
yesterday, you harness

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.340
the data center of Google,
you harness the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.900
internationalization, and the
real depth and scale that only

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.390
Google can offer through Google
Play, and bring it to

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.910
developers so they can really
make more money, and have

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.530
happier users.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.650
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, and
including in the game space

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.080
too, with the game services.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.350
You know, when we talked to Greg
and Duncan from the game

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.990
side yesterday, what they're
working on, and I believe it's

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.380
30 launch partners that they
have got right now, and the

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.450
kinds of innovative games that
they're working on with that

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.070
community is amazing to me.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.500
I mean, the--

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.730
LOUIS GRAY: You know,
30 doesn't sound

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.660
like a lot to us today.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.730
When you look at the growth of
Google, every time I look at

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.150
this I/O, you see the
numbers go up.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.080
You look at the 100 million, to
400 million, to 900 million

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.820
Android, you've got to think
when you start to set the

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.380
foundation, and you
do that right--

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.870
you know, today we've got a
Sandbox of Google+ partners,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.810
and we've got a Sandbox full
of games partners, what is

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.660
that really going to look
like next year?

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.790
When you set the foundation and
you build out the correct

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.810
tools so developers can do a
better job for users, and it's

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.770
really and incredible thing.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.130
Next year, how many different
people we're going to be

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.180
talking to, and what
those numbers are

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.920
going to look like.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.900
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, and I want
to just reference numbers

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.530
little bit, because you and I
yesterday talked to the cloud

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.330
folks, and the numbers that
they're talking about in terms

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.640
of the latency and the--

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.900
LOUIS GRAY: Milliseconds.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.630
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
milliseconds, and then the

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.260
storage capabilities that's
possible today, those numbers

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.610
are heading in some amazing
directions.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.720
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.760
You've got milliseconds down
at the latency side, and

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.350
you've got trillions and
trillions of numbers--

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.290
DANIEL SIEBERG: That are
being processed.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.390
Yeah, I mean, this is kind of
mind blowing kind of stuff.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.894
LOUIS GRAY: Right, and that's
the type of thing, when you

00:05:37.894 --> 00:05:39.810
look at Google scale, this isn't
something that's very

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.740
simple to replicate, and you
have to really spend.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.430
I think Greg talked about
it yesterday.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.780
They spent $2.6 billion dollars
on infrastructure, and

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.730
that's a little bit of money,
and is the right thing to do,

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.760
because it makes everybody's
experience better.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.990
We talked about moving the
bottleneck around.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.190
That's something that
I have experience.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.560
You know, I have a long history
in IT, and working on

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.650
network storage, and things
like that, and so you know

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.890
you've got to move that
bottleneck around, be it the

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.420
infrastructure and the
computation to the network.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.450
And this Google continues to
follow that, and make sure the

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.250
bottlenecks get out of the way,
so you can focus not only

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.760
on your applications, but the
user experience is really

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.320
incredible.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.190
And I wanted to transition
to something else.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.920
We had an opportunity yesterday
to talk with Nicolas

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.480
Garnier for Drive.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.830
Google Drive is one year old
at Google I/O this year.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.440
They had incredible growth,
incredible API development to

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.200
work with developers so
they can do real time

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.210
collaboration, a lot of really
interesting things.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.390
And even use Drive as a hosted
website platform, and you had

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.490
an opportunity go talk to the
Drive Sandbox yesterday.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.470
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
that's right.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.000
They're in the Google partner
apps area, and there are a

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.200
couple of companies, and we
talked to FedEx about what

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.690
they're doing, and we
talked to a group of

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.390
HelloSign and HelloFax.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.670
In both cases, I felt like
I really need to

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.880
have both of these.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.150
I did not know about
them ahead of time.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.630
And I think that the way that
Drive is integrating with

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.860
these types of--

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.200
in one case, they're a somewhat
traditional company

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.580
with FedEx, and a relatively
new company.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.270
And the way that they're
thinking about how Drive can

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.470
integrate with their services
is fascinating.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.450
LOUIS GRAY: One thing, and
you mentioned HelloFax.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.590
Here we are in 2013, and we're
bringing new ways to

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.500
communicate still.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.070
DANIEL SIEBERG: Fax is
not dead at all.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.115
LOUIS GRAY: No, faxing is a very
traditional business, and

00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:20.140
a tradition way of
communicating.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.130
How do you take that into a
connected web way, and so I'm

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.950
looking forward to that.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.880
If we could go ahead and take
a look at the Sandbox video

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.190
from yesterday with Daniel
talking to Drive.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.140
DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.780
I'm Daniel Sieberg with
Google Developers

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.720
Live here at I/O 2013.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.530
We're at the Google Apps
partners showcase, and I am

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.620
talking right now with Joel from
HelloFax and HelloSign,

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.630
and we'll get into
both of those.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.470
So tell me a little bit about
what HelloFax is, first of

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.010
all, and how it ties into Drive,
because that's really

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.210
what we're going to talk
about in a second.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:54.390
JOEL ANDREN: Sure.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.470
So HelloFax turns Drive
into a fax machine.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.120
It allows you to send and
receive faxes as easy as it is

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.490
to send and receive an email.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.150
So you don't have to worry
about the whole printers,

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.340
scanner, toner, all
that stuff.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.485
JOEL ANDREN: Is that fax sound,
that dialing sound, is

00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:11.960
that optional?

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.390
JOEL ANDREN: We might do that as
a plug-in later, but right

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.240
now we don't have that.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.530
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right,
OK cool.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.610
So walk me through how this
works within Drive.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.250
JOEL ANDREN: Sure, and actually
what I'll do is show

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.120
you HelloSign, because it's
the same process.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.030
All you do is you upload a
document, and then you can

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:24.520
mark it up.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.340
So if you take a
document here--

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.240
let me see here--

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.580
upload a document, and what you
do is you edit and sign a

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.480
document, and then you add in a
fax number, or you add in an

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.820
email address.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.379
So what you do here is you see
the markups of the document--

00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:41.805
let me find one here--

00:08:41.805 --> 00:08:44.510
and it allows you to add a
signature, it allows you to

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.390
add a check box.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.020
And what I'll do is I'll show
you how to do a signature,

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.390
because what happens a lot,
people and they need to sign a

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.180
document, they need to get a
contract signed, an invoice.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.770
You basically bring in your
signature and you drop it in,

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.740
and you insert it there.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.040
You can draw that with a mouse,
but I actually am going

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.370
to go with one that I've already
uploaded it in terms

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.000
of an image file, so I'll
use my saved one.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.250
And you insert that into a
document, and then you can

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:08.865
move that around.

00:09:08.865 --> 00:09:09.750
DANIEL SIEBERG: So
this is great.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.930
I mean, previously you would
either have to print it out,

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.940
or scan it, or something like
that, all of those things.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.730
JOEL ANDREN: So everything is
online, and everything is

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:16.470
within Drive.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.200
So you can turn around a
contract or send out a fax in

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.920
about 30 seconds, rather than
driving to Kinko's, walking

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.820
over to the printer, and
everything like that, so it's

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.550
all self-contained, and it's
all Google integrated.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.100
We also have a great integration
with Gmail, so you

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.880
can actually see here, view,
download, or sign.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.320
So you can sign a document in
Gmail, never need to leave

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.440
Gmail, never need to leave the
services you like to go ahead

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.255
and sign a document.

00:09:42.255 --> 00:09:43.790
DANIEL SIEBERG: And then you
can see all those documents

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.560
within your Drive.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.400
JOEL ANDREN: They show up
automatically in your Drive,

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.280
your Sent and Receive folder,
so all your important

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.735
documents are where you care
about them the most.

00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:52.980
DANIEL SIEBERG: So tell me
about the experience of

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.810
working with Drive team, and
HelloFax, and HelloSign,

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.890
working with those folks.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:58.365
How's that been?

00:09:58.365 --> 00:09:59.520
JOEL ANDREN: Yeah, the Drive
team has been awesome, and

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.460
what we've really found is the
they're really responsive to

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.340
what we've been looking for
and looking to do, and we

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.650
actually have a new service
coming out which allows you to

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.590
upload documents directly from
your mail, and send them off

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.370
to Drive, and it's really
sort of seamless.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.470
So they've really responsive,
and we use Google Drive as a

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.680
proxy for our service, and in
many cases you don't even need

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.170
to come to our site to do it.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:22.993
DANIEL SIEBERG: This
is fantastic.

00:10:22.993 --> 00:10:24.390
I have to sign up
for HelloSign--

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:24.610
JOEL ANDREN: Please do.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.140
DANIEL SIEBERG: --and HelloFax.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.625
All right.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.750
Joel, thank you so much.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.275
JOEL ANDREN: Thanks a lot.

00:10:27.275 --> 00:10:28.525
DANIEL SIEBERG: I
apprecite it.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.070
The next partner that we're
going to deliver to you is one

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.392
that's no stranger to
deliveries, and that is FedEx.

00:10:41.392 --> 00:10:44.290
But in this case, we're talking
about FedEx Office,

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.670
and how that ties into Drive,
and documents, and the ability

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.795
to make these really cool
presentations, and then have

00:10:50.795 --> 00:10:51.500
them delivered to you.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.120
So I'm joined right now by Lee
from FedEx, so Lee, talk to me

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.006
about how it integrates with
Drive, how FedEx Drive.

00:10:57.006 --> 00:10:59.170
LEE HUNT: Yeah, we've just
recently introduced a new

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.760
Google Drive app that basically
allows you to port

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.910
any and drop a wider range of
file types directly from

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.450
Google Drive directly into our
print online interface.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:13.560
Which is a really high end,
designing type application

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.020
that allows you to create
finishing options for your

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:22.430
documents, including binding,
coils, covers, tabs, anything

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.250
that you want to associate with
creating physical print,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.150
we're able to do and transport
your Google Drive file into

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.890
that type of document.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.210
DANIEL SIEBERG: And then it
gets delivered to you.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.250
That final product gets
delivered to you.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.320
LEE HUNT: You can actually
choose to have it delivered to

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.370
you, or you can actually have
it chosen to be picked up in

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.860
any of our 1800 locations
nationwide.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.600
DANIEL SIEBERG: So walk
me through what

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.680
it looks like here.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.135
LEE HUNT: So we have a variety
of supported file types with

00:11:45.135 --> 00:11:48.130
our app, so it's just a matter
of being within the Drive

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.480
interface after you install the
app, and selecting those

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.050
files and just right
clicking, selecting

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.880
Open with FedEx Office.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.480
And essentially what that does
is it launches up our print

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.790
online application, and it
grabs those documents and

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.130
ports it into that
particular tool.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.110
I'm going to jump ahead a little
bit and show you kind

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.580
of what it looks like.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.780
So this is a file that we pulled
in earlier, and it was

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.100
a plain, basically Google
document, that we're able to

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.480
show right now as we're
building it.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.230
You can almost see a soft proof
of what it'd look like

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.830
to be produced and finished
at FedEx Office.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.060
You can see with the coil
binding, and we can change

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.690
that to add binders, spines, a
number of various options that

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.180
people find useful when they're

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.620
producing such documents.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.420
DANIEL SIEBERG: And then folks
can pay for all of this right

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.150
here, and select the option
that want to get it?

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.370
LEE HUNT: Yeah.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.350
They can choose their closest
FedEx Office location through

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.690
the interface, and like you
said, yeah, choose to ship it

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.070
to their house if they
don't even want

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:48.990
to leave their couch.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.980
They can sit in their
pajamas and do all

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.260
this right from there.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.810
DANIEL SIEBERG: Now, there's
even a tie in with mobile too,

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.450
as people want to access to
these documents, and have a

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.140
similar experience on
a mobile device.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:58.690
JOEL ANDREN: Exactly.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.710
So recently we actually
introduced our new FedEx

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.700
Office mobile app, and our
mobile app also ties into

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.810
Google Drive.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:11.140
Basically allowing you to
directly grab a file from

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.430
Google Drive within our mobile
app, and pretty much do

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.050
exactly the same that's within
our full-fledged e-commerce

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.240
application.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.240
Really offering customers a
subset of those particular

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.960
options, like if they want to
create a flier, or a poster, a

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.300
presentation, give them
some basic options.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.630
And once again, through the
app, they can pay for the

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.450
finished product, and
have it shipped or

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.200
picked up from any location.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.650
DANIEL SIEBERG: And just
quickly, how was the

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.230
experience working with Drive
team from FedEx's standpoint?

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.750
LEE HUNT: Fantastic,
really supportive.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.660
They were really there to
answer any questions

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.850
that we need to.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.750
Just a really great experience
overall.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.080
DANIEL SIEBERG: Great.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.070
Lee, thank you so much.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:47.790
We appreciate it.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.670
And that's going to do for the
Google Apps partner showcase.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.690
I'm Daniel Sieberg with Google
Developers Live.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.050
Stay tuned for lots
more content.
