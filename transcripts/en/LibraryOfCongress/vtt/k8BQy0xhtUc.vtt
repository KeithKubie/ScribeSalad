00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.030
&gt;&gt; Nanette Gibbs: Good morning
and welcome to the second

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.300
of the eight lectures
in our series this year.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.700
I am Nanette Gibbs from
the Library of Science,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.500
Technology and Business Division.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.690
Today we'll hear about
NASA's mission to send groups

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.300
of astronauts, engineers, and
scientists to live and work

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.980
in Aquarius, an undersea research
station off the coast of Key Largo.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.490
Crew members encounter
conditions and challenges similar

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.080
to what they might experience on
asteroids or a moon or on Mars.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.910
They are able to simulate living
on a spacecraft and contest

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.510
and develop tools and techniques
for future space missions.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.130
Doctor Young, who is a research
scientist and planetary geologist,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.690
is a graduate of McLean
High School and earned a BS

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.540
in Environmental Geosciences
from Notre Dame and an MS and PhD

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.440
in geological sciences from
Arizona State University.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.610
She spoke here last
October on developing tools

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.390
and training astronauts for
planetary surface exploration.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.010
Please help me welcome Kelsey
Young back to the library.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.870
[ Applause ]

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.810
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Okay hi
everyone, thanks Nanette and thanks

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.750
to the library for having
me back a second time.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.540
So I'm going to be
talking about NEEMO today,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.490
which is NASA's underwater
analog project.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.010
But first, I was going
to introduce myself,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.660
but Nanette pretty
much covered that.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.320
So I am a field geologist and I
do field geology here on Earth

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.110
to prepare for when human beings
go back beyond low Earth orbit.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.150 position:56%
So I spend a lot of time out in
analog environments, I just got back

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.320
about thirty-six hours
ago from California

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.900
where I was doing fieldwork
with this instrument here.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.280
So we're testing instruments
and operational concepts

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.260
for human beings when they
go and conduct science

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.660
on other planetary surfaces.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.720
So I'll talk to you a little bit
about solar system exploration

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.610
and the role that the NEEMO project
in particular will play in it.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.430
So here's our solar system.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.260
Human beings have never ventured
beyond our planet and its moon,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.690
but we have sent orbiters, rovers,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.550
and landers out to the far
reaches of the solar system.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.020
Most recently the new horizons
mission went out even past the end

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.420
of our solar system and just
last week Cassini actually went

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.720
through Saturn's rings.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.850
So there's a lot going on in solar
system exploration, but what I want

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.860
to focus on today is human
exploration in particular.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.590
So we've only ever sent human
beings beyond our planet

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.210
on six different missions
from 1969 to 1972.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.670
Twelve people walked on the surface
of the moon, collecting samples,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.160
deploying surface science
experiments,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.460
and on the later three missions,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.870
actually using the lunar
roving vehicle pictured here

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.040
to travel even farther away
from where they landed.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.990
The scientific experiments they
were doing were pretty basic,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.410
they were using basic tools like
rakes, shovels, scoops, to collect

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.860
and store samples for
return to Earth

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.750
and those samples are
still being studied today

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.710
at the Johnson Space Center.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.760
And then they also
deployed science experiments

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.740
like basic seismic packages to
look at the seismic structure

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.080
of the upper lunar crust.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.250
And the lunar roving vehicle
was used to transport all

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.640
of these samples and experiments
as well as store samples

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.460
to bring back to the Lander.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.040
To do this, to practice
for what they were going

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.150
to be doing during Apollo,
the twelve Apollo astronauts

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.720
who actually ended up walking
on the moon spent a great deal

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.450
of time learning geology
and field testing technology

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.630
that they were going
to use on Apollo.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.690
Geologists like to say that the
Apollo astronauts essentially had

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.740
earned the equivalent of a
Master's degree in geology

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.150
by the time they flew to the moon.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.630
So they really knew what they were
doing, they were highly trained

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.460
by a group of skilled field
geologists, and so they learned

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.240
about geology and analog
sites here on Earth,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.970
and then they also field tested
the technology that they were going

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.630
to use once they got to
the surface of the moon.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.370
So this is the Apollo 17 crew
actually using the cameras

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.660
and technology that they'd
eventually used during Apollo 17,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.610
as well as doing things
like testing the suits

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.770
and the lunar roving vehicle
in relevant environments

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.840
to the landing site that they
were going to be visiting.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.370
So this idea of field testing
technology in preparation

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.230
for exploration has
been around a long time

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.700
and it was incredibly successful
in the Apollo generation.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.910
In fact, the Apollo astronauts

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.700
who received the most training
toward the later Apollo missions

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.520
were actually incredibly
successful in collecting samples

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.830
that are a really robust part of
the Lunar Science Community today.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.840
Today we continue that
tradition of testing technologies

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.290
and operational procedures
in relevant environments.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.500
Here are just some of the
environments that we're working

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.070
on today, we have aquatic,
terrestrial,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.250
and laboratory environments.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.150
For aquatic, I'll talk to you today
a lot about the NEEMO experiment,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.110
but we also have the
Neutral Buoyancy Lab

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.570
at the Johnson Space Center
where there's full-size mockups

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.180
of the International Space
Station for the astronauts

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.790
to actually practice
EVAs or spacewalks on.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.780
ESA, the European Space Agency
also has their own neutral

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.330
buoyancy facility.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.640
Terrestrially, we do a lot.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.180
Here is another analog project
similar to NEEMO called Desert Rats

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.320
where rovers actually drive around
in analog environments to prepare

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.300
for when we're back on
either the Moon or Mars.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.400
We actually train astronauts
in relevant field areas,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.810
just like we did in Apollo.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.600
So we take out all the astronauts
today into places like New Mexico

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.610
and Arizona to train them for
what they're going to be viewing

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.590
from orbit and what they're
hopefully going to be seeing

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.280
when they go past low Earth orbit.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.910
And we also go to extreme
environments from Antarctica

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.900 position:56%
up to the Arctic to test
procedures and learn about processes

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.490 position:56%
that shape other planetary surfaces.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.610
In the laboratory we have things
like the ARGOS environment,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.780
the Active Response
Gravity Offload System,

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.610
which actually simulates
what it's like to work

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.260 position:56%
in lower gravity than here on Earth.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.340
We use virtual reality
and hybrid reality

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.640
to actually immerse
ourselves in environments

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.940
like we see on other planets.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.250
So we can actually put ourselves
on Mars and offload our gravity

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.010
to experience what it
would be like on Mars,

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.750
to simulate what astronauts
are really going

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.270
to be feeling once they get there.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.170
And then we have the
International Space Station.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.190 position:56%
So human beings are living every day
up in space, a couple hundred miles

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.510 position:56%
above our heads, and that's a really
robust laboratory to learn what it's

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.890
like to work in microgravity.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.080
So we're learning about the health
effects of long-term spaceflight,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.340
which is going to be really
important on the journey to Mars.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.150
And the ISS is the most robust
laboratory environment we have

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.670
to really prepare for
long-term spaceflight.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.430 position:56%
But what we really want to spend a
lot of time doing and what I'm going

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.730
to be talking about for the rest

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.840
of today are conducting highly
integrated operational tests.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.730
So what I mean by that
is, operational tests sort

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.670
of combine science operations and
equipment or technology together

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.300
in a mission-like environment to
really simulate what it's going

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.100
to be like to be on
the Moon or Mars.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.840
So the types of things
that we're evaluating

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.160
in these operational tests
include concept of operations.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.460 position:56%
So what is it actually going to look

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.040
like when human beings are
operating on the surface.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.010
During Apollo, we had two
human beings operating together

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.310
at one time.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.030
For three of the six missions
they had the lunar roving vehicle.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.540 position:56%
When we go back beyond Earth, things
are not going to look the same.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.100
Technology has come a long way,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.490
operational concepts have come a
long way, and we need to practice

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.110 position:56%
to understand what these operational
concepts are going to look

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.170
like when we hopefully
head back to the moon.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.010
We also want to test
relevant hardware and tools

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.410
for both pioneering and science
tasks, and what I mean by that is,

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.940
you know, I'm a geologist,
I'm looking forward

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.160
to when astronauts bring back
samples from other planets,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.790
so that's sort of a
science task similar

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.250
to what the Apollo guys were doing.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.310
So they were actually
picking up rocks based

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.950
on their geology training
and returning them to Earth.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.250
We're also going to have
pioneering tasks, so what I mean

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.520
by that is basically if we
have long-term spaceflight

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.570 position:56%
and human beings are living on
another planetary surface for longer

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.570
than the couple days they
were there on Apollo,

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.800 position:56%
they'll have pioneering tasks to get
ready for that long-term habitation.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.450
So they'll set up habitats, they'll
set up communication structures,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.710
they'll deploy sort of
weather monitoring stations

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.010
on the surface of Mars.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.940
So we need to simulate what those
pioneering tasks look like now

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.430
because we've never done that
on another planetary surface.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.320
So we need to test the
relevant hardware and technology

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.710
that they're going to be
using when they're doing that.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.710
And we also want to look
at the tools and techniques

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.870
that enable the communication
between Earth,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.570 position:56%
which will have a mission control
center, MCC, and a science team just

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.790
like they had on Apollo,
and the crew.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:39.040
And something I'm going to
talk a lot about today is sort

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.780
of the difference between
IV and EV crew.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.240
So EVA is an Extra
Vehicular Activity, spacewalk,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.840
it's what the Apollo astronauts
did when they spent, you know,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.790
eight hours at a time
roving over the surface.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.540
We're hoping we'll get, you
know, more than two crew members

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.420
to another surface in the future,

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.000
and if that's the case we'll
likely have an IV crew member

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.500
or an intra-vehicular
activity crew member,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.690
who's sitting inside a habitat
and helping to get eyes on an EVA

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.230
and sort of quarterback the EVA.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.740
So I'll talk about that later
in the context of NEEMO.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.570
But we want to sort of stress these
tools and techniques that are going

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.130 position:56%
to enable this communication between
Earth and the supporting teams

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.890
and the crew who are
actually doing the science.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.270
And we want to do this over an
appropriate communication delay.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.390 position:56%
So Mars is far enough away that when
you send up communication to Mars,

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.170
it's going to take a long
time for it to get there,

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.890
it doesn't get there right away.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.450
So actually a communication loop
between if I am sitting here

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.460 position:56%
on Earth sending a communication to
somebody on Mars, it's going to take

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.790
as much as thirty minutes
to get there and back.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.170
So if you say, oh wow, I see this
amazing rock in your video screen,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.850
you know, that was
fifteen minutes ago, right,

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.790
so you need to understand how to
flux the scientific operations

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.110
over this long communication delay.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.600
And what we want to do is do

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.430
that using a flexible execution
methodology, and what we mean

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.310
by that, and I'll talk about
that a lot in this talk,

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.770
is basically you go in
with a traverse plan.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.870
The Apollo astronauts had their
eight hours pretty much scripted

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.750
and they knew exactly where
they were going to go,

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.090
when they were going to go there.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.120
What we want to do is give
astronauts the technology

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.470
and the training to be able

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.040
to actually flexibly
execute those traverses.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.270
So if they're driving down the
dotted line on their traverse map

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.500
but they see something to the left
off the traverse map we want them

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.500
to be able to be empowered
to go and investigate it.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.470
The extreme example we use is if
an astronaut is on Mars and they're

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.670
on this traverse path and
they see a dinosaur bone off

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.440
to the left that's not
on the traverse path,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.040
we want them to turn left
and pick up the bone, right?

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.430
So that's sort of flexible
execution.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.860 position:56%
So we call it flexicuting [phonetic]
a traverse plan, so I'll talk a lot

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.720
about that today with NEEMO.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.640
So basically all of this together,
we want to combine science,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.000
operations, and technology in
a mission-like environment.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.810
So to do this, we go
out on the field,

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.890
we go out on relevant
analog environments.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.020
So these analog missions allow for
really early end-to-end testing

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.220
of operational concepts
and hardware.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.390
So these are just a couple examples
of the analog missions NASA's run,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.290
here's NEEMO which
I'll talk a lot about.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.520
Here are those desert rats
missions where we simulated being

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.820
on the surface of the Moon.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.110
And the types of things we're doing
are we're evaluating objectives

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.500
that map to specific
knowledge or technology gap.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.840 position:56%
So we're not ready go to Mars, NASA
is not ready to send humans to Mars.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.780
We have knowledge and technology
gaps before we can get there.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.390
Analog missions are
hoping to close some

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.560
of these knowledge
and technology gaps.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.710
We want to put the crew in
a flight-like environment,

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.670
and also the ground team in
a flight-like environment.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.290 position:56%
So it's not just the crew that's
going to be involved in exploration,

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.290
it's all of us here on Earth and
we need to be trained for that.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.960
These types of operational
tests, they drive out results

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.000
that aren't found when you're just
testing one tool or one technique

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.540
at a time, you need
to really put this

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.660
in a robust stressing
environment that's going

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.830
to stress the entire system and
stress the participants involved.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.850
And this has benefits right now on
ISS, I'll talk to you about this

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.960
but last year we were
deploying experiments on ISS

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.090
that a couple months later, or
excuse me, deploying experiments

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.290
on NEEMO that a couple months
later were deployed on ISS.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.340
So the types of testing we're doing
in these analog missions have,

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.740
you know, current relevance
to ISS as well

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.700
as to NASA's future
exploration goals.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.300
So bit of an [inaudible], but
this is just to show you the types

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.240
of things that we're
doing to prepare for,

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.830
for hopefully sending humans to
Mars and the types of experience

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.420
that teams working
here on Earth have.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.060
So Apollo is a big part of
our experience, you know,

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.370
we learned a lot from
the Apollo missions.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.060
There are still people that
I work with today that were

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.130 position:56%
around in the Apollo age, but that's
not going to continue forever,

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.430
these people are retiring.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.980 position:56%
So we need to learn all we can now
from the people who really did this,

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.190
the only time we've ever sent
human beings to another surface.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.020
We have Mars robotic missions.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.900
So we have two functioning rovers
on the surface of Mars right now,

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.000
they're obviously not human
beings but they require constant,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.060
constant supervision and sending
up new traverse plans every day.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.960
There are Mars rover
planners working every day

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.910 position:56%
to develop the new ops plans for the
two rovers that are up there now,

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.060
and that's under this
communication delay.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.190
So right now we're
learning how to do science

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.950 position:56%
under a communication delay and
it's incredibly valuable experience.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.890
We have NEEMO which I'll
talk about that's been run

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.590
since the early 2000s, we have the
desert rats rover missions which,

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.090
similar to NEEMO but above water.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.120
We have a number of
science field campaigns

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.910 position:56%
and other relevant environments that
are considerably smaller in scale

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.080
than NEEMO, I just got back from
one of them a couple days ago.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.760
So all of these things together
are really, we're hoping,

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.580
going to together prepare us

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.350
for hopefully putting boots
on the ground on Mars.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.540
But NEEMO, the rest of
the day I'm going to talk

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.550
about the NEEMO Analog
Project in particular.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:36.360 position:56%
NEEMO stands for the NASA Extreme
Environment Mission Operations test,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.050
it's been run in the Aquarius
habitat since the early 2000s.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.770
And it's run through the
Aquarius Reef Base Facility,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.960
that's run by Florida
International University.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.700
So I'll talk to you a little bit

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.210
about the Aquarius Reef Base
Facility and then sort of jump

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.420
in to the recent NEEMO missions and
sort of what we're learning today

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.830
and what we'll deploy in NEEMO
22 in a couple of months.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.670
So this is the shore facility
that we use for the NEEMO tests.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.250
It's located in Islamorada,
Florida in the Florida Keys,

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.350
so sort of all the operation
centers are in this building.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.820
There's a watch desk which I'll
show you a picture of in a second

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.730
where whenever a crew is in
saturation in the habitat,

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.040
there's somebody sitting at the
watch desk twenty-four seven

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.020
to monitor the health of the
habitat and the health of the crew.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.090
There's a mission control center
where the NASA team sets up to sort

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.150
of pretend like we're in the
mission control center in Houston,

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.430
and there's a number of dive
lockers for the support staff

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.830 position:56%
that support the crew in saturation.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.020
So here's sort of a map
of the Florida Keys,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.080
like I said the mission
control center in the building

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.620 position:56%
on the previous slide is run by FIU,
Florida international University,

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.230
and it's about an hour
and a half south of Miami.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.860
Here's the watch desk, that's
again manned twenty-four seven

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.680
and it's situated right here on one
of these canals, the ARB facility.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.290
If you just go six
miles offshore you get

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.960
to the Aquarius habitat
which is pictured here.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.680
So this is sort of a model
of Aquarius Reef Base itself.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.100
The bottom of the habitat sits
at sixty-two feet of water

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.410
but the bottom of the
habitable volume, which is here,

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.360
sits at a little shallower
at fifty feet.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.630
So this is the, these are the
dimensions of the habitable volume,

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.490
nine feet in diameter and
forty-three feet long.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.440
And here's sort of a
sketch of the volume

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.230
that the crew spends
all of their time in.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.530
So they basically come in through
the wet porch, they just swim down

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.890
and up into the habitat, and this
is sort of the size of the space

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.890
that they're living in,
sort of like a big RV.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.940
So they have sort of areas
to do science experiments,

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.710
they have a dining room
table to eat dinner at,

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.280
and then they have bunks back
here, as well as several viewports

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.110
where they can actually look
outside at what's around them,

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.200
including one at the
back right by their beds.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.590
So here's a view from the bunk
room looking sort of down,

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.620
looking from the bunks
down this way.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.870
So here's the outside of the
hab, and this is the viewport

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.160
that they can see from their beds
and here are the bunks themselves,

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.770
there are six bunks,
three on each side.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.550
And here are just some
pictures to give you an idea

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.340
of what it looks like
inside Aquarius.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:09.620
We've got, sort of, it's a very
small working space and they can,

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.290
you know, sort of eat and do
science on either side of it.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.850
This is the wet porch that
they can swim up and in,

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.520
and in general it's
a lot like, you know,

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.180 position:56%
living on the International Space
Station, it's a cramped environment,

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.870
you're in there with a lot of
people, so hopefully you get along

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.940
with the other five
people in the habitat.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.910
Here are the onshore
facilities that we have,

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.170
that the ARB, the ARB facility has.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.860
There's a fleet of boats to take
divers to and from the dive site,

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.020
there's the NASA office and
the mission control center

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.530
like I mentioned, Internet,
conference meeting area, labs,

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.690
you know, computers, a
workshop area in case, you know,

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.060 position:56%
they actually need to machine
anything, dive lockers, a rest area,

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.320 position:56%
and they actually have a hyperbaric
chamber and safety equipment in case

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.790
of an incident or accident
happening during a mission,

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.710
which has never happened,
not to worry.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.060
And there's also a life-support
buoy out at the site itself.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.240
So Aquarius sits underwater
underneath the life-support buoy,

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.260
it's got generators,
compressors, communications

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.400
to bring back the comps
from the crew directly

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.230
to the facility onshore, and again
it sits directly above the habitat,

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.110
and here's a human
up here for scale.

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.910
So Aquarius sits in
the Carpenter Basin,

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.610
so Aquarius is actually
labeled AQ right here,

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:24.990
that's where the habitat is, and
this is just to give you an idea

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.190
of the scale of the sort
of the exploration area

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.050
of the crew during a mission.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.570
These are all sort of landmarks
that the team has worked

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.750
out over a number of years,
some of these are sampling sites

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.330
from previous NEEMO missions
which I'll talk about.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.090
This data or this map is
overlain on bathymetry data,

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.860
so you can actually see the
sort of dimensions of the bottom

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.770
of the sea floor here, you can
see sort of lots of striations

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:50.050
in the floor and that's actually,
you know, coral features that are

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.350
on the bottom of the sea floor

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.940
which is actually what the
astronauts are exploring

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.620
when they're out on simulated EVA.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.590
So all of this together
really enables NASA to operate

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.240
in a high fidelity environment.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.970
So we can test operational
concepts and procedures

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.090
in a space-like environment,

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.920
we can play with usability
and design trade-offs.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.530
So it enables us to
be in an environment

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.450
where we can really test different
types of technology year after year

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.860
after year and experiment with
the trade-offs that are involved

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.930
with one technology over another.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.770
It enables us to build up a
workforce that's knowledgeable

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.460
and experienced in this type of
exploration, which is really,

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.470
really important as we, you know,
hopefully build past the Earth.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.870 position:56%
It builds these workforce
knowledge gaps, like I said earlier,

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.930
on how to execute really
complex operational procedures.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.510
It has early and relevant
and operator input.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.470
So the astronauts are the
ones that are going to be

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.500
out on these other
planets doing exploration,

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.460
and it enables these people, these
astronauts to get in this habitat

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.610
and get their hands on
developing technology.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.420
So it gets them experience,

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.360
but it also enables them
to give us experience.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.760
So if there's a technology that
they really just don't like

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.410
or don't think is going to work in
spaceflight, this is a way for us

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.880
to work that out early
rather than when, you know,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.180
we're on our way to Mars.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.980
And lastly, and I think it's really
important, it's a proven PAO tool,

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.400
a public outreach tool, for
keeping the public inspired

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.560
and engaged in space exploration.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.540
We may not have humans beyond
Earth and ISS right now,

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.920
but we are working toward,
you know, sending humans,

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.110
putting boots on the ground on
Mars and it's really important

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.580
that the public be
engaged in that effort.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.780
So diving into NEEMO 21,
diving puns [laughter].

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.660
So NEEMO 21 was this
past year in 2016,

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.750
the mission was actually sixteen
days long, living and working

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.300
in the Aquarius Reef Base Facility.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.630
We had completed a variety of
objectives which I'll talk to you

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.690
in the next slide, we had
an international crew,

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.150
which actually a part of the
crew rotated out mid-mission.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:51.370
So here are the crew here, we had
Americans, one from South Africa,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.140
one from Germany, and
one from Ireland.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.530
So we had an engineering week
where we actually tested a lot

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.860
of the technology that we are going
to be using during the missions,

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.210
that was well in advance of
the mission to sort of iterate

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.530
on any design requirements
that needed to be changed.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.990
We had a crew training week
at the Johnson Space Center

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:11.180
where all the crew members
flew to Houston and enabled all

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.540
of the mission operators
to train them on the types

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.780
of technology they
were going to be using.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.550
We had a test readiness review
which is actually where we sit

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.610
with the safety officers
at the Johnson Space Center

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.630
to make sure everyone's comfortable

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.370
with putting these test
subjects in this environment.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:27.880
We had a training week actually

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.510
down in Florida just the week
before the mission to, you know,

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.000
get hands-on training
and teach the divers,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.930
teach the crew members how
to do saturation diving.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.600
And then we had the mission
which was sixteen days long.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.150
So I want to talk to you about
the science and operations

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.310
and technology advancements
from the mission.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.170
Do not worry about
reading this slide,

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.520
this is just to show
all the partners

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.820
that we had for the mission.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.700 position:56%
So a really unique and exciting
thing about NEEMO is that, you know,

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.430
it's run by NASA at NASA, but we
have a lot of external partners

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.050
that enables a big part of
the community to get involved,

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.780
and that's contributed a lot
to the success of this program.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.600
So this is just a graphic
to show you all the partners

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.450
that we had involved
in this mission,

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.260
and I'll talk about the
contributions from several of them

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.770
over the course of this talk.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.200
Suffice it to say we had a
lot of NASA centers involved,

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.610
we had PIs from different
research institutions involved,

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.640
we had several academic
institutions,

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.800
private research institutions,
we had the military involved,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.390
and we had a number of
different contributors

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.660
from industry across the country.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.500
So our science objectives,
I'll give a high-level overview

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.710
and then I'll dive into a
little bit of detail there.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:37.160
One of our objectives was
nursery construction and science,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.980
and I'll talk about that
in the next couple slides.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.130
But we partnered with the
Coral Restoration Foundation,

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.580
which is a nonprofit based in
the Keys, it's actually working

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.720
on exploring why corals
are dying off.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.970 position:56%
You might've heard in the news,
there are corals all over the world,

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.390
including the Great Barrier
Reef, that are really struggling.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:54.510
So the Coral Restoration
Foundation is trying

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.250
to understand why this is happening
and perhaps more importantly figure

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.690
out how to repopulate
some of these reefs.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.640
So NEEMO has a big
part in that research

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.440
and I'll talk about that in a bit.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.310
We have follow-up science,
and that's because, you know,

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.890
NASA has been working in this
area for a number of years,

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.910
specifically in NEEMO
20 was the first year

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.340
that we had really
integrated science objectives,

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.510
coral science objectives,
with the NEEMO program.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:22.670
So the crew in NEEMO 20 back in
2015 collected a bunch of samples,

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.670
and we went back in NEEMO 21

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.440
to investigate how those
sites have changed over time.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.770 position:56%
We also had new exploration, so this
is sort of an exploration zone map

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.690
of the Carpenter Basin
around Aquarius.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.680
We had five exploration zones
that the crew could go in

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.430
and those are sort of just, those
exploration zones were defined

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.910 position:56%
so that, you know, both the ground
control team and the crew could sort

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.610
of reference something on
a map and have something

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.210
to track back to for
mission planning.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.730
So now through from NEEMO
20 to NEEMO 21 last year

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.450
through NEEMO 22 this year,

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.900
we have really authentic robust
coral science that's fully

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.980
integrated into NEEMO
EVA operations,

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.210
so that's really exciting,
it's something, you know,

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.090
the NEEMO team is really proud of.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:05.810
And we're doing this under, you
know, a lot of hours of EVA.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:09.130
So we had over 60 hours of
science-based EVA last year

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:13.490
and we were able to get a lot of
really exciting coral science done.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.670
So here's the Coral
Restoration Foundation, again,

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.650
they're a nonprofit organization
and they're dedicated to creating

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.450
and maintaining these
offshore nurseries

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.610
for threatened coral species.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.270 position:56%
So they want to build these coral
nurseries and restoration techniques

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:29.760
and understand what the best
way is to restore these reefs

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.630
and empower others and train others

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.640
to do the same thing
around the world.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.500
So here are some of the types of
nurseries that CRF is working with

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.440
and they're spread over a
number of different locations,

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.740
and I'll talk to you specifically

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.130
about the nursery work that's
going on in the NEEMO area.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.640
So for NEEMO we work
extensively with CRF,

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.700
CRF is able to prepare the
astronauts, process the corals,

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.730
train the astronauts, and
train the ground control team

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.350
to support the mission.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.250
So the corals are actually
put on these little sort

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:05.480
of like credit card or playing
card size little pieces of plastic

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.280
and they're sort of cultivated
in the CRF facility in the Keys.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:14.130
This is actually Ken Nedimyer who
runs CRF and he's a big partner

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:17.510
of NEEMO and we've really
enjoyed working with CRF.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.910
And so here they are
sort of training the crew

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:21.320
in the onshore facility on how

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.410
to actually physically
construct the trees

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.810
because in NEEMO 21 the crew
actually took these cards

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.740
that the coral scientists
prepared and mounted them

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.500
on the coral trees
themselves underwater

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.420
where they've been
since last August.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.320
So once the sort of
cards were constructed

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.520
and the crew was trained, we
had to physically transport them

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.730
to the site, so took them out
on a boat and put them here

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.520
in these sort of milk crates here.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.920
And the crew actually took them
to the two sites designated

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.830
in the Carpenter Basin and deployed
five of these trees at each site,

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.510
and each tree has 100
coral cards on it.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.670
So we really do have
a lot of coral colony

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.690
or coral species growing underwater
now and they've been under there

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.860
for almost a year, so this year
we're going to be able to go back

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.500
and see how they're doing.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.890
So these are just some
of the process

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:12.060
of the crew last year actually
setting up the nurseries.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.740
And one of the cool fun facts
from last year that we actually

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.080
on purpose did not tell the crew
until the day of this relevant EVA,

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.330
but they built the deepest coral
nursery in the world last year,

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.740
so that's really exciting.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.970 position:56%
And they're comparing the, the coral
scientists are comparing the shallow

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.480
nurseries and the deep nurseries to
compare which species grow the best

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.830
at which depths and in
which water conditions.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.470
So then we actually wanted to
conduct science and operations

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.220
on the nurseries, so here's Ken and
our science team mission control,

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.800
this is the science team here
in our little trailer outside

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.450
in the parking lot of
the onshore facility.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.640
And so they're actually, they
mounted all the coral cards

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.250
and then took pictures of all of
them so the coral scientists back

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.210
in the trailer could evaluate
which corals even survived the trip

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.110
because corals are fragile that's,
you know, one of the reasons we're

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.870
in this situation and we wanted
to make sure that that journey

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.050
out to Aquarius and
underwater, they made it through.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.800
So that a year from now, we'll
know that any of the corals

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.390
who died off actually occurred in
the year since they were planted,

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.180
not the initial effort of
getting them out there.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.270
So for marine exploration
science, we've partnered

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.890
with the Images Lab at FIU.

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:23.360
So it's the Integrative Marine
Genomics and Symbiosis Lab at FIU,

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.090
just a really robust
coral science facility.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.940
And they have a lot of science
objectives, we've partnered

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.700
with them since NEEMO 20, and
they're doing real science

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.540
on these coral colonies
with the samples

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.560 position:56%
that the NEEMO crews are collecting.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.260
So in NEEMO 20 they were sampling
the Siderastrea type of coral,

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.850
I've learned a lot about coral
in the last couple years.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:47.630
And then in NEEMO 21 they were
looking at the Agaricia species

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.830
and the Orbicella species
as well as, again,

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.230
actually doing some science on
the coral colonies themselves.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.360
So they wanted to genetically
characterize the types of corals

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.050
from the depths that they're,
that they're collected from.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.250
They want time and
depth constraints.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.980
So precisely when they
were collected

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.610
and from what depth
is really important

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:05.910
when you're thinking
about coral science.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.670
So we have to train the
crew to really pay attention

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.000
to their depth gauges
and making sure

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.900
that the corals they're
collecting are

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.350
at relevant depths
for the science team.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.400
And we want to provide
a natural baseline

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.110 position:56%
for those coral restoration efforts.

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.490
So they're exploring the
local corals to figure

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:24.490
out how they might relate to the
corals that are on the nurseries.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:27.030
And so this ultimately,
they want to influence

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.780
and inform the coral
restoration efforts as well

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.180
as understanding this, you know,

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.290
really this reef environment
that's really in flux.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.920
So that's sort of the
science we're doing,

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.950
but moving on to the science
operation, so what it's actually

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.060
like to conduct science in
this relevant environment.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.150
Again, I'll go into a couple,
into detail about some of these,

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.130
but we looked at integrated
EVA science operations.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.980
So what the communication
structure between a crew on EVA,

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.730
their supporting crew member
who's sitting inside the habitat,

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.620
the mission control center, and
the science team back on Earth.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.120
So that's, you know, four
variables who, you know,

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.420
all want to get their
opinions heard.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.130
So flexing this communication
structure became, you know,

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:11.000
really important to test
and last year, in NEEMO 21,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.410
we did this under a fifteen minute
one way communication delay.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.010
So again if I'm sitting
in the science trailer

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.400
and I send a communication
to the crew,

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.390
it gets there fifteen
minutes later, they read it,

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.690
they have to send a response

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.200
and fifteen minutes later
I see their response.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.530
So we're flexing this
communication structure

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.680
under this high communication
latency.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.970
So then we had navigation map

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.930
and traverse planning
science operations objectives

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.230
that we were testing.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.640
We used different navigation
technologies as well

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.640
as crew training and sort of IT
assets to have actually on EVA,

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.690
I'll talk about that in a bit.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:50.270
Just to briefly mention, we had an
optical communications experiment

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.740 position:56%
deployed by a student group from
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:59.230
with us last year, and we had a
remotely operated vehicle, an ROV,

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.820
from the Naval postgraduate school
that was also tested last year.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.200
But to dive into this sort

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.700
of communication structure
a little bit more,

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.220
this is sort of just an
image to show, you know,

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.500
here's us in the science
trailer last year

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.440
who were actually communicating
directly with the intra-vehicular,

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.150
the IV crew member here which
I'll talk about in a bit,

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.590
who then could communicate
with the EV crew member.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.450
And things to think
about is that, you know,

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.240
there's a communication delay
between science team and IV,

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.010
but there's no communication delay
between the habitat and the people

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.570
who are boots on the ground.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.420
So experimenting with this
communication delay where it occurs

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.320
and where it matters
became really important

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.420
in developing the technology
to support that delay,

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.670
to support communication
over the delay,

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:46.840 position:56%
is something that's iteratively
tested from year to year with NEEMO.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.740
So our objectives with looking

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.480 position:56%
at this integrated science operation
structure last year were just

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.030
to figure out how this works,

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.880
operate it under a
communication delay,

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.290
and there are definitely kinks but
those kinks are results, right?

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.380
So we want to determine
what functions

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.310 position:56%
and capabilities are needed by every
part of that communications loop

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.760
to enable them to do their job.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.680
For example, this IV person,

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.420
one of the things we found
was they are very busy,

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.770
they are extremely busy,
they have mission control

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:19.040
and science team saying, ooh go
collect that coral, that was great,

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.810
and mission control
saying, okay EVA,

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.620
one hour left, you've
got to hurry up.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.530 position:56%
And then you have the EV crew
streaming back all this data to them

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.520
that they're trying to
keep control of and manage.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.900
So giving them the technology
that they need to manage all

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.910
of those different variables is one
of the main takeaways from NEEMO.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:38.210
And then one of the other things

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:41.380
that I mentioned earlier is this
flexicution [phonetics] idea.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.560
Flexicution [phonetics], it
sounds sort of straight forward,

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.350
flexible execution, not something
that NASA's really done before.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.650 position:56%
We operate under scripted timelines.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.630
And being able to go to
NASA and say, you know,

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:56.650
scientists really need astronauts
to be able to be flexible,

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.070
is like this whole new language,
but it's a language we're starting

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.260
to learn and we're
starting to understand.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.010
So this is, you know, something
I spend a lot of my time thinking

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.120
about and I think it's
not straight forward

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.390
but it's definitely a big hurdle,
but it's an exciting one I think.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:16.560
So the takeaways from this
sort of study last year was

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.600 position:56%
that we successfully exercised these
full comm loops with passing a bunch

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.940
of data back and forth,
communications from the crew

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.720
to the science team and
back to the EV via the IV,

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.560
we sort of stressed this whole
loop over the sixteen-day mission

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.020
and really felt like we
had a number of situations

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.810 position:56%
that presented themselves where we
got to stress that system and put it

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:40.060
under pressure a little bit, which
is important in tests like this.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.160
And so we also observed
the criticality

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.980
of these flexicution
[phonetics] flight rules.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:47.960
So being able to be flexible is
important and training a crew

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.730
so that they feel confident
enough in a science

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:55.130 position:56%
to be flexible is important and it's
something we did last year in NEEMO,

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.680 position:56%
but we also want to have flight
rules, right, like unbreakable rules

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.780
that no matter what, no matter if
there's a dinosaur bone over there,

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.600
there are rules that
you cannot break, right?

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.450
So developing those flight rules is
really important and it's something

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:08.890 position:56%
that we'll certainly have, you know,

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:12.450
nailed down when we send
human beings beyond Earth.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:16.740
So another objective we had
was, again, assessing the tools

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.610 position:56%
and technology needs, and this
includes both hardware and software,

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:22.670
so the tools that the
astronaut are actually holding,

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:25.110
what that hardware looks like,
as well as what's displayed

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.820
on screens and things like that.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.370
So we're assessing the tools needs
for both short distance navigation

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:34.990
from site to site to site to
support this type of geology

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:36.410
or in this case coral science.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:41.420
So the takeaways are that the crew
successfully used digital maps,

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.400
digital traverse plans,
and an active system

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.420
to locate pertinent sampling zones.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.680
So they had this this navigation
equipment they were using

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.930
and they also had basically an
underwater iPad that they were able

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:56.460
to actually view traverse plans
with and sampling procedures with.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.260
So here's a traverse for
one of the days last year

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.990
that they're actually able
to navigate with underwater.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.850
So they were actually able
to successfully do that,

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:09.120
but one of the key lessons learned
for us on the shore side of things,

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.940
the science team side of
things, is under this sort

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.320
of time latent planning cycle, so
with a high communications delays,

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.740
we need to make sure that we update
the plan, we keep them apprised

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.760
as our plans evolve from one day
to the next in a timely manner

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.130
so that they can sit down
before they go EVA and say,

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.020
okay here's the plan, we know
this plan is not going to change.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.180
Here's the flight rules,
here's the traverse plan,

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.070
if we see this we deviate
from the traverse plan,

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.370
but only if it's within
the [inaudible].

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:37.580
They have to have that information
with enough time to feel confident

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:42.830 position:56%
that the crew can really effectively
and efficiently operate the plan.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.800
So technology too, sort of similar
to the last slide I just talked

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.370
about but, what we're looking
at is digital cue cards.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.730
So here's that underwater
iPad we are testing

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.340
and they were actually able
to pull up all sorts of things

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:58.960
on these underwater iPads and
I'll about that in a second.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.700
The IV support system, like I
mentioned, it was really important

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.600
to give the IV person the assets
they needed to be successful

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.080
in a really busy position.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.490
We also had science sampling
tools and a geology sampling kit

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:15.570
that the EVA tools group at the
Johnson Space Center is developing.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:19.660
So they tested that extensively
and NEEMO as well last year.

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:23.930
So here's sort of the digital
cue card, they had mission maps,

00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:26.220
they had the images
and traverse plans,

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.160
they had the Marine science
procedures as well as sort

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.150
of a guide to help them identify
coral, they had procedures for how

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.920
to build the coral nurseries, they
had procedures for how to operate

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.140
that sampling kit I just mentioned,
procedures for optical comm,

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.220
a list of equipment and how to
use it, and then a number of sort

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:47.680
of operationally minded things to
enable them to flip back and forth

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.460
between all of those assets.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.000
So they had procedures
that they could pull up,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.760
this is the geoscience sampling
procedure that with one click

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.970
of a button they can get
there on the underwater iPad.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.750
And so that enables
them to really pull

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.750
up what they need at
a drop of a hat.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.150
It also implies that they're highly
trained in how to use the iPad

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.490
which is really important.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:10.840
But we were able to really operate
these digital cue cards effectively

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.060
and the crew had a lot
of really solid feedback

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.040 position:56%
that said it was really helpful for
them to say, okay, if it's this type

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.420
of coral we want to sample
with this specific technology

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.480
and here's the procedure
for how to do that.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.020
Toward the end of the mission
they didn't need those procedures

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.320
as much, but in the beginning
it really helped them sort

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.100
of refresh their memory
from the training they got

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.140
from the coral scientists.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.710
And if there was a particularly
complex piece of machinery,

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.030
they could pull up the procedure.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.890
If anything ever malfunctioned
we had procedures for that

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:38.130
in the cue cards which
they could pull them up.

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.160
And that increases this autonomy
and the feeling for the crew

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.420
that they can really do this
under a communication delay

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.690
and if they have a problem they
don't have to wait thirty minutes

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:51.700
for a troubleshooting procedure
on how to fix it from the shore.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.670
And this is also a really efficient
way for the science team back

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.550
on Earth or on the shore

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:00.640
to iteratively evolve those
traverse plans from day to day.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.910
So part of the procedure
was at the end

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:06.040
of every EVA the science team would
go and refine the traverse plan

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.410
for the next day and we could
upload that new traverse plan

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.800
to the cue card so it was waiting
for the astronauts the next day,

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.770
and which is something that
you can't do with pen and ink.

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:20.490
So from the IV support
station, or IV support sort

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:22.890
of workstation perspective,

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:26.110
we wanted to evaluate what assets
the IV crew member would need

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.650
to be successful in
helping the EV crew sort

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:31.530
of operate their traverse plan.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.580
So this is Matthias, he's one
of the European astronauts,

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.360
he was a crew member last year,

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.490
and for that particular EVA he
was this IV person and he had

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:43.140
to monitor all of these
things at one time.

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.510
The EVAs are about four hours
long, so he's sitting at that desk

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:51.000 position:56%
for four hours helping the EV crew
to operate the plan and get the data

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.730 position:56%
from the science team as it evolves.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:56.660
So we want to learn what
they need to be successful,

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.540
how many monitors is
too many monitors?

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.560
Is there a monitor where you can
put multiple things on one monitor

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.810
so you can minimize the sort of
desk space that the IV crew needs?

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.000
And what we really
have learned from NEEMO

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.430 position:56%
and from the rover test before it is

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:14.450
that this IV role is
absolutely crucial.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.540
They're really, really critical
especially under a time delay

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.080
in helping the EV crew
be successful.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.100
And the reason for that is
that under a time delay,

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.360
I've sent a message up to the
crew and it doesn't get there

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.220
for fifteen minutes,
what if they're involved

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.340
in something really detailed with
their, you know, that they're doing

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.660
on the surface when that
communication comes through?

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.570
They get kind of annoyed when
someone's squawking in their ear,

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:38.590
that was something that was
relevant fifteen minutes ago,

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.260
that they're getting when they're
busy, but having this IV hub

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.200
as someone who can
receive that communication

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.520
and when there's a minute,
when there's a down minute,

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.930
they can pass it on to the
EV crew, is really important.

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:51.340
Especially when we're
doing reef exploration

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.890
where the coral scientists are
saying, ooh we want that coral,

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:55.900
we want that coral, pick that one.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.550
We can use this IV person as a way
to streamline that communication.

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.220
And the way we do that is
through assets like this

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.900
that are displayed
on these computers.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.780
So this is actually the mission
log that the IV crew member sees.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:12.820
So this is a communication I
wrote last year to Matthias

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.200
and what it says is basically
we saw this view in one

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.740
of the EV crews cameras,
you know, half an hour ago,

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.450
we screenshotted it, drew a box
around it and said tell them

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.810
to go back to where you put
this number down and pick

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:27.340
up that coral, sample that coral.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.980
And we can do that through the
IV person, so when Matthias sees

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.920
that come on his screen he says,
okay go back to where you put

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:37.320
down this tag number and then go
up an inch and sample there, right,

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.940
which is just not possible
if you're sending

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.760
that communication directly
to the EV crew member.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.570
So we need to explore
these assets and figure

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:46.340
out exactly what the best thing
is for this person to have.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.310
And then we have the
geology sampling system,

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:51.590
just a couple of photos
to show you the types

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:53.420
of samples that they could pick up.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.160
It enables them to pick up loosely
adhered particles on the floor,

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.700
chip samples as well as
to take core samples.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.130
So last year we were really
able to utilize this system,

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.140 position:56%
it worked really well for taking and
storing samples which is relevant

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:10.150
for doing that and curating and
storing samples for return to Earth

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.390
in a Mars or Moon environment.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:15.770 position:56%
We also just briefly, I'll skim
through these, we had IV activities.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:19.810
So we had a crew of four last
year, typically during the day,

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:23.140
two people would be on an EVA, one
person would be supporting them

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.780
from the IV position, which left
the fourth crew member to do things

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.140
like all of these really
exciting IV activities.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.260
So we had a number of studies
which I won't dwell on but just

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.300
to highlight a couple,
this was the timeline tool

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.320
that NASA Ames deployed
for the mission

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.430
where the crew could keep
track of their own timeline

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.940
and you could actually get
into procedures from here.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.030
So they're testing this
playbook timeline tool

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.780
and they're doing it
again this year for NEEMO.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.520
Johns Hopkins ran sort of a
sensorimotor study, really exciting

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:56.480
and I'll have a slide on it in a
bit, is the mini DNA sequencer.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.420
So Matthias is there actually
sequencing DNA underwater

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.920
and two months later Kate Rubins
sequenced DNA for the first time

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.300
in space on ISS, so that was
just really exciting to be a part

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.680
of last year and this is like
really cutting edge science

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.820
that is happening on
ISS, you know, today.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:17.370
We also use the hollow lens, so
sort of augmented reality to figure

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.780
out for crew where they should
store and get a piece of gear.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.900
So in a volume that's small,

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.610
everything is packed
really carefully

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.590
which means it's packed
really tightly

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.900
and sometimes you forget
where you put something.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.070
But hollow lens can actually enable
you to say, okay ten days ago

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:35.490
where did I pack this little thing,
and you can actually put it on

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:40.000
and find it with augmented
reality in the habitat.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.230
We are also testing
miniaturized exercise devices,

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:44.970
so one thing we're finding

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:47.800
with long-duration spaceflight
is it's really, really important

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.910
for astronauts to stay
fit and stay in shape,

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:54.590
and so we had an exercise team from
the Johnson Space Center with us.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:58.170 position:56%
We had a number of European Space
Agency Evaluations and we had things

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:02.240
like EVA swab tool which looks at
forward contamination by astronauts

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.990 position:56%
in a spacesuit to make sure we're
not contaminating our working space.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:10.010
Here's just a highlight
on the DNA sequencing,

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.060
so all the crew members
were able to get

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.950
through it last year,
Reed was very excited.

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.480
It's exciting!

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:21.030
So we had members of the mini ion
DNA sequencing team down in Florida

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:24.950 position:56%
with us last year, here's Kate
after she successfully sequenced DNA

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:26.830
in space for the first time.

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:29.390
She was actually a molecular
biologist by training,

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.380
so this is really a
cool thing for her

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.290
to be able to actually get to do.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:37.640
So this was just a real highlight
of last year and to working

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.910
out the procedures and how
to use it operationally

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:42.820
in a flight-like environment
during NEEMO actually prepares,

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.380
there's Matthias using in NEEMO,

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:49.160
prepared Kate to be
able to do it in space.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.590
So that was NEEMO 21 briefly I'll
skim through - what time is it?

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.180
How much time do we have?

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.480
12:15, okay.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.160
So NEEMO 22 is coming
up this summer,

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.210
so I'll just briefly highlight
some of the things we're going

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.350
to be doing that builds on
the success of NEEMO 21.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:07.860
One is we're going to take cores

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.070
with a new breakaway core bit
technology that was developed

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.190
by Honeybee Robotics
which builds a lot

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:14.500
of the drills for the Mars rover.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.010
So they're drilling
experts and so we're playing

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.930
with this new breakaway core bit
technology and deploying it in,

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:21.950
again, a mission flight-like
environment.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:25.570 position:56%
And it has relevancy to that geology
sampling system just with a sort

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:29.040
of a new core technology
and it's got a lot

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:34.110
of [inaudible] implications for
future sample storage on Mars.

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:37.270
Briefly again, I know this is sort
of hard to see, but we're playing

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:39.650
with tool transport on EVA.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:44.570
So there's a lot of tools to sample
corals and also rocks on Mars.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:47.920
So managing all these
tools in an environment

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.860
where if you drop something it'll
float away, is a nontrivial issue.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.670
So what we're finding last year
is there were some frustrations

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:57.950
with managing, for
example; to sample corals,

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:00.920 position:56%
you can chip them away or drill them
away and then you have to put them

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.310 position:56%
in these small syringes and you
would imagine you're doing something

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.060
with both your hands, where are
you going to put the syringe,

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.370
you can't just put it down
because it will float away.

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:13.620
So managing all these tiny little
tools becomes a nontrivial problem.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.610
So we're playing with equipment
transport and storage this year

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:20.860
and the EVA tools group at JSC
has done just an outstanding job

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.040
with thinking through this what
we're calling a modular equipment

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.010
transport system that's stored in
this cart that the crew has to pull

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:29.730
around with them while
they're on EVA and store all

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.860
of these sampling technologies.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:36.030
One thing I'm really excited
about is I look at instruments

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.430
for astronauts to use on Mars,
so something that they'd hold

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:41.190
in their hand to actually
analyze the rocks real-time.

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:44.350
We have analogs for those
underwater, so we have sort

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:46.540
of two instruments that we're
deploying this year to look

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:51.210
at the photosynthetic state and
the metabolic state of corals.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:53.480
So we're actually deploying those
instruments this year as well

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.640
and they can all, all this
stuff will fit both on the cart

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.900
and on the astronauts themselves

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.510
through a wrist storage
unit and a leg storage unit.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.350
So they can pull out a syringe
from their wrists without having

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.020
to carry it long distances
from the cart.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:11.980
So this is sort of the operating
strategy for every EVA, and again,

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:14.290
this was all sort of thought
up and then constructed

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:16.400
by the EVA tools group
that actually, you know,

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.850
builds tools for human spaceflight.

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:23.090
So the crew will egress from the
Aquarius habitat and they'll head

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:24.650
to the staging area
where their cart,

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:28.300
their modular equipment transport
system is waiting for them.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.070
They'll arrive at the staging
area and pick the modules

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:34.370 position:56%
from the staging area that they know
they're going to need for that EVA.

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:36.830
So if today's a day where I
need to deploy the instruments,

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:38.970
I'm going to make sure I get the
instrument modules and put them

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.230
on the cart because I
need them for that day.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:44.580
You traverse through all these
coral towers and get to your zone

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:45.960
where you're going to
be exploring that day,

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.340
which the science team has
suggested as a plan for that day.

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.480
And here potentially in zone
"A" is three sites of interest

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.320
where we think, the science
team thinks they might be able

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.610
to find interesting coral colonies,
and they'll take the cart with them

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.970 position:56%
to the zone and then take those
small modules with them to each site

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:05.500
so they don't have to drag
this big honking heavy cart

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.300
with them wherever they go.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.090
Then they'll collect their samples,
return to the cart, and then return

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:11.960
to the staging area
at the end of the EVA.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:15.500
So here's just some of
the types of the tools

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.160
that the tools group has
worked on in the modules

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.460
that we're going to be using.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.820
We've got a drill for
sampling coral.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.130
One of things that I thought has
been really interesting is this

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:26.430
pre-sampling module.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.550
So if you have a crew
member who gets to a zone

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:32.360
that they've never been to before,
they take these little tags,

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:36.280
these little tags which are
about this big and they'll walk

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.530
around the zone and actually put

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.420
down a tag every time they think
there might be a coral of interest

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.540 position:56%
and then they can come back later
and pick the most compelling samples

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:48.080
from those couple that
they've temporary tagged.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.540
So we have the small tool module
for the little dexterous tools

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.600
that you need to actually put
the coral in the syringes,

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.980
and then you have the
actual syringes themselves

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.280
and where they're stored.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.650
So these are some of the types
of modules that I'm talking

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:02.510
about that go in this cart.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:05.060 position:56%
For the IV support system this year,

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.310 position:56%
we're evaluating a couple
different tools that will be running

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.910
in the background of
some of these monitors

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:13.060
that the IV person's
responsible for monitoring.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.700
We're also want to minimize, I mean
this is ridiculous, like, you know,

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.780
this crazy for the IV person
to have to pay attention

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.600
to what the ground control
team is telling them

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.020
and what the EV crew
is telling them.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.140
So we're trying to minimize the
number of computers and monitors

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:29.200
that are required for this IV
person to handle but, you know,

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.280
what we're finding is that all of
this software is just vital to,

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:36.920 position:56%
you know, both mission safety and
the scientific success of a mission.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.050
So we're playing with
the types of software

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:42.370
that the IV person
needs to be running.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:46.230 position:56%
For a science perspective, we're
retrieving the coral cards from both

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:49.610
of the nurseries, we call them
the Mercury and Atlas nurseries,

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:53.630
where the crew is going to retrieve
all the cards, transport the cards,

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:55.640
and, you know, document
any that may have died off

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:59.050
and potentially sample them if the
science team deems it's necessary.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:02.070
They, then they'll take them
back, do the documentation

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:05.840 position:56%
and the potential sampling, and then
they'll return the coral cards back

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.430
to the nursery and reconfigure
the cards in sort of this way.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:12.280
So what it's been done
before is that each arm

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.990
of the coral nursery has the
cards hanging down off of them.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.690
The Coral Restoration Foundation
found that they actually want

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:21.300
to flip them up and mount them
in a more stable configuration,

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.110
and that's one of the results

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.590
from actually being
able to do this study.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.850
So it's exciting that we're seeing
a year later sort of a new action

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:30.830
that needs to be done for
this type of coral nursery.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:35.490
For re-follow-up, we're going to
follow up on NEEMO 20 and NEEMO 21

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:38.240
to create this robust
three-year temporal assessment

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.610
of how the corals do
over a three-year period.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:44.060 position:56%
There actually have been disease
that's developed throughout the Keys

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.620
and one of the examples

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.160
of that disease development is
unfortunately around Aquarius.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.610
So, but it's exciting that we get
a chance to potentially help figure

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:54.660
out what's going on with this
disease development around the Keys

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.320
and one of the areas that they're
going to do that is this year

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.860
at NEEMO around Aquarius.

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.880
And then they're just going
to explore new coral colonies

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.510
that they've already sort of
resampled from previous years

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.130
and tagged in previous
years and resample and look

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:10.010
at how they've developed overtime.

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:13.510
And then explore and
expand into new sites.

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:15.920
So we haven't covered this
entire Carpenter Basin

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.820
over the last couple years,
so we're going to explore

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:21.670
into newly explored sites
and deploy the instruments

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.130
to measure respiration

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:25.470
and photosynthesis using
these new instruments.

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.870
And then we're also going to
look at corals as they relate

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:31.560
to the colonies that are
deployed in the nurseries.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.700
I'll skim through these, these
are just my last couple slides,

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.640
they're hard to read
so I can read them.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.210
These are our science operations
objectives and they're split

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:42.250
into 4 Ts: tools, techniques,
technology, and training.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:47.380
So for tools, we want to understand
how this modular transport system

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.230
relates to science driven EVAs,
does it help, does it hurt,

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:52.080
how operationally does
the crew use it,

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.900
how is the core sampling tool
going to be incorporated,

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.850
is it a timeline hit, is
it going to take longer

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:59.660
than the alternate
methods of sampling corals?

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.580
We're going to look at deploying
handheld instruments, like I said,

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:06.370
into science driven EVA which is
not something we've done before.

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.520
Technologies, what's
the role of informatics?

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.480
So those digital cue
cards, what's the role

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.090
that they play in science
driven EVAs?

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:17.440
What happens if you have a camera
mounted for situational awareness?

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.640
So if I'm working at this computer
as an outcrop and there's a camera

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.800
over here, how useful is that
camera for situational awareness

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.800
for the IV crew member and the
mission support team on Earth?

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.770
And again, the role
of the IV workstation,

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:33.310
because that's not something we've
done before past analog missions

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.610
like this.

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:37.530 position:56%
Flexicution [phonetics], operational
flexibility is really important

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:40.060
so we're going to continue to
play with that and what tools

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.670
and technologies do
you need to develop

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:43.350
to support this flexible execution?

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:46.160
And what does the communication
flow look like?

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.650
I mentioned that's a
big deal especially

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:48.950
under communication delays.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:53.250 position:56%
So playing with the structure of
how data flows from one support team

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:56.650
to another to the crew is something
we'll need to continue to test.

00:49:56.650 --> 00:50:00.560
And then training, we're not
only training the astronauts,

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.640
but we're also training
ourselves, the ground team.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.530
So anybody who's involved in this
test gets a better understanding

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:07.660
of a flight-like environment
through a test like NEEMO,

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:10.200
and that's really important to
capture those lessons learned

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:14.390
as they evolve to make sure
that when we do this for real,

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.200
we're ready as a ground
team and as a crew.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.540
And again, just to leave
you with a couple thoughts,

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:21.780
I think for outreach
this is really important,

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.660
we had a lot of excitement
over this image last year,

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:27.710
here's the six people who
are living in the habitat,

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:30.890
they're reading 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea.

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:34.490 position:56%
And the reason they're wearing these
masks is that's what needs to happen

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.600
when you're in saturation, you want
to come back up to the surface,

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.630
you need to decompress
in a specific way,

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:39.930
so that's what they're doing here,

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:42.130
this is the last day
before they came up.

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:45.000
We had a lot of social media
following, we are excited

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.610
that Ellen Ochoa, the center
director of JSC got really

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:48.910
into it and tweeted something.

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.780
And one of the things that I
thought was especially cool

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:57.050
about last year was the EVA tools
group at Johnson Space Center works

00:50:57.050 --> 00:51:00.800
with college students from around
the country to develop new ideas

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.810
for sampling in different
gravity environments.

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.970
So every year they run this
program, it's called Micro-g Next,

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:08.770
and they have university students,
you know, propose these ideas

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:11.450
and build these tools for
sampling in lower gravity.

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:14.540 position:56%
And one of the tools that one of the
groups came up with last year was

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.250
to build this different type of
coring [assumed spelling] tube,

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.830
and the EVA tools group liked
it so much that they asked

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:21.300
and actually used it
in NEEMO last year,

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.380
so that was a pretty exciting
example of really fast

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.530 position:56%
and testing from a university group.

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:31.370
And just sort of to leave you with
a sort of above and below life,

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:34.190
it really is a robust analog
project, you can see the LSB,

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:35.680
the life support buoy here.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.810
This was a day where we had
two female crew members on EVA,

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:40.800
so we staffed mission control
with all the women there

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.100
which I thought was really neat.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:46.450
A team picture from NEEMO 21 last
year, the two NASA astronauts

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:48.710
who were our crew last year,
Reid Wiseman and Megan Behnken.

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:52.570
And then this is Roger Garcia
who runs the entire facility,

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:56.370
and so he really enables
all of this stuff to happen.

00:51:56.370 --> 00:51:59.810
So I'll leave this and I'll
take questions, thanks.

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:05.530
[ Applause ]

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:06.830
Yeah.

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:11.260
&gt;&gt; You said that the IV
role was really critical,

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.310 position:56%
and this is the international group?

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:15.820
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah, this
is an international group.

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.640
&gt;&gt; This is an international group,

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.590
so we were seeing Matthias,
he was French or German.

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:22.890
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah, German.

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:24.190
&gt;&gt; German.

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:26.620
So, is he the only one or do
people rotate through the role?

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.130
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah,
so the question is,

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:30.500
we work with international
partners and is Matthias,

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.330
the astronaut from last
year, is he the only one

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:34.490
or do we have we other
international participation?

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:35.930
We definitely do.

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:39.280
So both of the two active Canadian
astronauts, David Saint-Jacques

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.580
and Jeremy Hansen have been
crew members already for NEEMO.

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:44.790
We've had most if not
all of the [inaudible],

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:49.870
the Japanese crew members, been
crew members on NEEMO and most

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:53.940
of the ESA, the European Space
Agency crew members have gone

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:55.490
through already.

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:57.740
And then we also have,
especially from ESA,

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:01.330
we've had support team
members come as well.

00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:05.190 position:56%
So we have the Capcom role, which is
the traditional role of the person

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:07.320
who sits in mission control in
Houston that communicates to ISS.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:13.760
That Capcom role is filled by a
rotating cast of people for NEEMO

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:17.050
and we have international
Capcoms that come as well.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:19.820
So we have a lot of international
participation with our sort

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.500
of partner or space agencies
and it's been I think one

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:25.910 position:56%
of the more successful parts of the
mission, it's beenn exciting to see.

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:27.910
In the back.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:30.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you, this is super awesome.

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:31.790
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Oh, good.

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:36.140
&gt;&gt; You talk about the
nurseries, the coral nurseries.

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:41.680
What about any kind of prototyping
of nurseries for growing food

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:45.400
in this underground or aquatic -

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.700
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah.

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.420
&gt;&gt; station, and then what
are, what are they eating

00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:50.310 position:56%
and how are they preparing the food?

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:53.870
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah, so lots of
questions about food, which I love.

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:55.800
So, do they grow food
and what do they eat?

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.500
So they don't grow food in NEEMO,

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.860
we've done that with the rats
testing, the Rover testing.

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:04.400 position:56%
We tested a habitat lab for rats and
we actually grew lettuce and ate it

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.890
at the end, it was delicious.

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:08.900
And they're doing that
on ISS of course.

00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:10.900
They're growing vegetables
or lettuce

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.280
up on the International
Space Station.

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:15.160
In fact I think I saw this
morning or yesterday morning,

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.980
they were eating Chinese
cabbage, yeah.

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.840
So, yeah. What they, for here,

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.080
so one of the tricky
things operationally

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:29.150
about NEEMO is getting things
underwater is nontrivial.

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:32.880 position:56%
So getting, for example, if you have
a bag of food that's not punctured

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.880
and you bring that volume
of air down sixty feet,

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.600
it doesn't react very well.

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.720
So any food that they get down
there is very carefully prepared.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.550
For example, they have to
puncture all of their, like,

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:49.190
K cups for coffee before they
bring them down otherwise.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:53.710
So, they eat, I mean they don't
eat anything out of the ordinary.

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:56.950
So they'll eat, I think one
crew in particular got really

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:59.570
into Pringles from what I hear.

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:04.940
They'll do dehydrated food, they
eat pretty normally down there.

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.410
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:10.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You mentioned you're a geologist.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.860
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yes.

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:20.360
&gt;&gt; And you're talking a lot about
the exciting things that lead

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:29.020
to the ISS and hopefully
boots on the ground.

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:37.160
Can you tell us a little bit about
where we are technology wise,

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.710
the radiation aspects on Mars?

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:44.410
And you talk about EVAs
that are four hours, if,

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:48.670
regardless of how long they were
there for a year or two years,

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:53.860
could they last for four hours at
this current status of technology?

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:55.160
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:00.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; What do we need to do to overcome
that so that it's a reality?

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:07.230
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah, so basically
what are the technological hurdles

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.530
to doing this on Mars.

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:11.210
There are a lot, radiation
you mentioned is a huge one.

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:14.200
So radiation shielding
and protecting

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.460
from space weather is huge.

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.160
We, you know, we got
lucky with Apollo,

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:26.550
we didn't have any major radiation
events while the astronauts were

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:33.080
on the surface, we can't guarantee
that that's going to happen again.

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:35.180
So protecting from radiation,

00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:42.210
especially for the long durations
it'll take to get to Mars,

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:46.180
stay on Mars, and get back,
is extremely nontrivial.

00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:50.000
So that's a major area of ongoing
technology development right now.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.430
Launch and landing is
a big deal as well.

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:55.130
So landing that much
mass on the surface

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:56.670
of Mars is really challenging.

00:56:56.670 --> 00:57:01.040
The most we've landed is the
MSL rover, the curiosity rover,

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.570 position:56%
that's up there right now and we did
that with this incredibly complex

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:11.980
and really cool sky train
technology where it sort of braked

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.800
and then thrusters fired and
it hovered above the ground

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.700
and a crane actually
lowered down the rover,

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:25.170
which like blows my mind
every time we think about,

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:28.570
we did that successfully.

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:33.560
But the mass required for
human habitation is, you know,

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:37.240
orders of magnitude
larger than that rover.

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:43.230
So figuring out how to, you
know, get human beings to Mars

00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:47.180
and land them safely is another
ongoing area of research.

00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.850
Of course you may have
heard in the news

00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:57.330
about the SLS rocket launch system,
this, the heavy launch vehicle

00:57:57.330 --> 00:58:05.070
that NASA's developing, that's
an ongoing area of research

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:09.610
that NASA is heavily
involved in right now.

00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:14.210
So from a big picture, you know,
we have the rockets, we have launch

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:17.680
and landing, we have
radiation, we have human health

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.020
for long-term spaceflight.

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:22.400
So what happens to a
human body when they're

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.210
in low gravity for that long.

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:30.660
So those are sort of the
big picture questions

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:35.830
that NASA is doing a really good
job of investigating right now.

00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:39.200
From a geology standpoint,
which is the stuff

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:45.000 position:56%
that I spend my days thinking about,
a lot of the stuff I mentioned,

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.470
even though NEEMO is
underwater and they're looking

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:50.770
at corals, is incredibly relevant.

00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:52.070
Operationally, you know, yes
we've done before like, you know,

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:53.640
humans collected a lot of really
interesting science samples

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.530
from Apollo but technology has come
a long way since then and hopefully

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:57.420 position:56%
when human beings do this for real
they'll have more robust instruments

00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:58.720
that they're able to use.

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.020
And figuring out how to incorporate
those into EVA is important,

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.320
figuring out how to design
the hardware and software

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.700
for EVA is important, and that's,
you know, the types of people

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.000
that I work with are working
on that right now, so.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.300
&gt;&gt; [ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:06.600
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: So I do not claim
to be any a member of their team,

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:07.900
I was thrilled to work
with them, next to them,

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.200
but I'm definitely not
on the team for that.

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.500
But to answer your question as best
I can which was about, you know,

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.800
operating the mini DNA sequencer.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.100
They basically get the sample,
and the instrument itself is

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.400 position:56%
like this big and they actually feed
the sample in and it runs, I mean,

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.700
pretty quickly in a
matter of an hour or two,

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.000
at least the sequences they
were running on NEEMO last year.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.300
And they do, they download the
data locally and then they have

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:19.600
to send it up in a big chunk.

00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.900
Yeah.

00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.200
&gt;&gt; As a diver I'm just
curious about the decompression

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.500
that they have to go through.

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:24.800
You said sixteen days
was the longest?

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.100
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yeah.

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:27.400
Well I, I don't know if
that's the longest ever,

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.700
that was what NEEMO 21 was.

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.000
Yeah.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.300
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if that was

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.600
because of decompression
Earth [inaudible].

00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.900
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: No that was,
so why the sixteen-day duration

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:35.200
in terms of saturation diving?

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.500
Definitely not the limit, it was
just what we had available to us

00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.800
in terms of scheduling
for NASA last year.

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.100
I'm pretty sure there
have been longer missions.

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:40.400
It doesn't have to do with
the saturation limits at all.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.700
We do have to be careful,
and they have this

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:43.000
down to an absolute
science at this facility.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.300
We don't want to go too deep
on the EVA's for too long.

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:45.600
So planning the EVA's revolves
of course around safety first

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.900 position:56%
and so the crew at the Aquarius Reef
Base facility basically gives us our

00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.200
unbreakable flight rules
and they monitor every EVA

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.500
to make sure the crews aren't
staying too deep too long.

00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:50.800
&gt;&gt; And they all train divers?

00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.100
&gt;&gt; Kelsey Young: Yes,
yes saturation divers do,

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.400
they go through special
saturation dive training.

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.700
