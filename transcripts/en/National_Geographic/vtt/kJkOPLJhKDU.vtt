JOE SIENKIEWICZ: So I
started out 28 years ago.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.266
Just imagine, forecast
information came in the form

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.667
of paper, piles of paper.

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.700
It limited the
amount of information

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.399
that we could look at.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.533
We see things now in the
models that we're actually,

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.767
in some ways, learning,
and confirming

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:23.266
using other information,
observation satellite data.

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.666
So things have changed
enormously in my career.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:28.600
NARRATOR: Today forecasters
can rely on a vast array

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.433
of weather sensors
on the ground,

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:35.734
at sea, in the air,
and even space.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.600
This information is
fed into computer

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.000
models that build on
our deep knowledge

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.500
of environmental physics.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.967
WILLIAM LAPENTA: The atmosphere
is basically a fluid,

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:47.266
just like water, fish tank.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.567
And fluids are defined
by mathematical equations

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:52.367
in terms of their
structure and how

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:53.532
they would evolve with time.

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:01.233
So we go for the major
terms in an equation,

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:03.400
and then we put them
into a computer model.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.867
And we try to get a solution of
how the atmosphere will evolve.

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.934
NARRATOR: Dr. William Lapenta
is the director of NOAA's nine

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:15.667
weather prediction centers.

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:19.100
When a tornado is forming
or a hurricane is brewing,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.934
the accuracy of his models can
be a matter of life and death.

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:27.433
But because there are so many
variables in the atmosphere,

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:31.066
no model spits out the
right prediction every time.

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:35.300
NOAA compensates by running
their models dozens of times,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.834
introducing random
variations in the data.

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:43.300
The result is a cluster
of possible futures

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.233
called an ensemble.

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:48.066
WILLIAM LAPENTA: So let's
just say that my putt

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.500
was a hurricane track.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.166
OK?

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.700
So I put once.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.867
You see the ball roll and you
see it roll a certain way.

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:54.900
OK.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.433
That's one piece of information.

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:02.867
So an ensemble means you would
do that many times over, maybe

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:04.600
20 times, maybe 40 times.

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:11.299
And the thing is, every time
you put it down and stroke

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.467
it, something changes.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.633
So then if the
trajectories of the balls

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:18.600
are very close to each other,
that means you either have

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.266
a very good model, or there's a
high level of predictability in

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:26.433
that hurricane track, or both.

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:28.632
These are called
spaghetti plots.

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:31.433
And it's essentially just
deterministic guidance overlaid

00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:33.367
with a bunch of
ensemble guidance.

00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:36.667
So you can really see a lot
of information on one screen.

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:39.033
When they're closer together,
you know you have higher

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.399
confidence in your forecast.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.533
There's more certainty
in your forecast.

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:45.799
And then as you go out in time,
solutions begin to diverge.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.367
We become more uncertain
about the forecast.

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:51.000
And really just the
slightest difference can make

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.567
a huge change in the forecast.
