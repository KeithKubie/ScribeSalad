00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:54.903
- Hey, I'm Kim, and welcome to our

00:00:54.903 --> 00:00:58.986
AP US History live study
session at Khan Academy.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.812
So, the exam is this Friday, May 5th,

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:10.129
and I would like to
take some time with you

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:12.061
over the next hour to talk through

00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:15.424
some of the major ideas that will kind of

00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:17.507
help you manage the exam.

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:22.779
So I am a former US history
professor, I got my PhD

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.495
in US History and then
taught at the college level

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:28.828
for eight years.

00:01:29.743 --> 00:01:33.350
So I've kind of been on
the opposite side of this,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.717
seeing what students are like
when they come into college,

00:01:36.717 --> 00:01:39.115
having taken the AP exam.

00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:43.091
Now before this livestream
started, I looked through

00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:46.852
your chats and it seem like a
lot of you are really nervous

00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:49.763
about the exam, and so
I just wanted to share

00:01:49.763 --> 00:01:53.895
with you that I have been
a reader for the AP exam.

00:01:53.895 --> 00:01:57.667
I went to Louisville with
all the other teachers,

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:01.346
about a thousand people go to
read these exams ever year.

00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:05.037
And I met all of the
people who grade the exams,

00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:07.839
we sit together, it
takes about eight days,

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:10.936
everybody reads about six thousand exams,

00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:13.424
and what I want you to know
about that is the people

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:16.933
who are reading these
exams are your teachers,

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:19.701
they're ordinary people who teach history,

00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:23.775
and I think we have this sense
that teachers are reading

00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:26.279
these exams and thinking,
(growls) "Where can I find

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:30.033
a place to take off
points," and it's completely

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.190
the opposite of that.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.058
The teachers who are
grading these exams are

00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:36.155
rooting for you,

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:39.352
they are giving you every
possible opportunity

00:02:39.352 --> 00:02:41.740
to score points, they're
looking for a chance

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.393
to give you a point for anything.

00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:47.952
So just keep in mind
when you're writing these

00:02:47.952 --> 00:02:51.627
that you're not writing
them for grumpy people

00:02:51.627 --> 00:02:54.739
who are looking down on
you, you are writing them

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.425
for your teachers, who
want you to succeed,

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:00.489
and they're gonna help you
succeed however they can.

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.224
All right, so that said,
I first wanna tell you

00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:07.290
a little bit about some
other resources that we have

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.798
at Khan Academy to help
you prepare for the exam,

00:03:10.798 --> 00:03:13.330
in case you wanna do a
little bit more than just

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.049
sit here with me.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.216
So one of the first things
is that at Khan Academy

00:03:20.196 --> 00:03:24.283
we've put together a
complete resource with

00:03:24.283 --> 00:03:28.432
articles and exercises
and videos from every part

00:03:28.432 --> 00:03:30.375
of US history.

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:33.315
So what's most important
about this for you is

00:03:33.315 --> 00:03:37.148
that we have practice
quizzes for every period

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.243
from Native American
societies before contact

00:03:41.243 --> 00:03:45.410
to the US after 2000, so
you'll see that I actually

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:48.876
need to do a little
bit more studying here,

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:52.385
I've only gone through
seven of these, myself but.

00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:54.654
If you are just wondering, how am I doing,

00:03:54.654 --> 00:03:57.510
is there something that I
could do to do a little bit

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.638
of extra preparation to
make sure that I've got

00:04:00.638 --> 00:04:03.557
my ducks in a row, check out the quizzes.

00:04:03.557 --> 00:04:07.724
And the second thing is a
guide to the US history exam

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:17.069
where I go through some
very detailed examples

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.584
of how to tackle these questions.

00:04:19.584 --> 00:04:21.845
So I'm going to do that
a little bit today,

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:24.891
but if you're hoping to
see some other examples,

00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:27.356
you're wishing you could do
this just a few more times

00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:31.404
to feel confident, check out
our exam practice section,

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:34.418
and I will take you
through some more questions

00:04:34.418 --> 00:04:37.345
on the long essay, the DBQ, short answer,

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:40.185
multiple choice, and
hopefully that will help you

00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:43.677
get a little bit more
confident about your skills.

00:04:43.677 --> 00:04:46.427
Okay, so what are we doing today?

00:04:49.462 --> 00:04:52.565
Here is our preview of coming events.

00:04:52.565 --> 00:04:55.892
So I'm going to take about
an hour, talking with you,

00:04:55.892 --> 00:04:58.836
and I'm gonna go pretty much step-by-step

00:04:58.836 --> 00:05:00.264
through the exam.

00:05:00.264 --> 00:05:03.020
We'll first talk about
multiple choice questions,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.940
tips, and strategies, and
then short answer questions,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.015
and we'll talk about
the long essay question,

00:05:09.015 --> 00:05:12.997
and then if we have time,
I'd like do a little

00:05:12.997 --> 00:05:16.145
primary document analysis
and try to help you use

00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:20.372
that primary document
analysis to think about how

00:05:20.372 --> 00:05:23.475
you might strategize at the DBQ.

00:05:23.475 --> 00:05:26.033
So I want to encourage
you throughout the session

00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:29.005
to ask questions that you might have,

00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:32.307
I'm gonna pause in between
each of these sections

00:05:32.307 --> 00:05:34.852
to answer some questions,
and then hopefully we'll

00:05:34.852 --> 00:05:37.740
leave a little time at
the end to answer any

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.855
general questions you
might have about the exam.

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:43.963
All right, sound good?

00:05:43.963 --> 00:05:48.046
Okay, let's start at the
multiple choice section.

00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:52.972
So I've got some practice
questions for us here,

00:05:52.972 --> 00:05:56.108
and these are official practice questions

00:05:56.108 --> 00:05:58.570
from the College Board.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.737
And, all right, so here is
a typical multiple choice

00:06:04.462 --> 00:06:07.545
question from the AP US History Exam,

00:06:08.742 --> 00:06:12.768
and what is important about this is that,

00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:17.553
every single multiple choice
question will have some

00:06:17.553 --> 00:06:20.974
kind of what they call
"stimulus material" with it,

00:06:20.974 --> 00:06:25.205
and so the stimulus material
might be something like

00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:28.705
a photograph like this, or a graph, a map,

00:06:31.797 --> 00:06:35.880
a set of quotes, so it
will be a primary document

00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:42.162
that kind of serves as the
background for the question.

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:47.574
And I think what's really
nice about this is that

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:51.219
unlike the old AP US
History Exam, this one is

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:54.314
not so much just kind of
a like a laundry list of

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:56.704
facts that you're supposed to memorize,

00:06:56.704 --> 00:07:00.530
in fact, the whole AP US
History Exam is designed to

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.969
kind of reward you for
having a sense of what's

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:06.757
going on in each historical time period,

00:07:06.757 --> 00:07:09.198
and being able to reason from that.

00:07:09.198 --> 00:07:11.940
So if you're panicking
about how you're supposed to

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.545
memorize all the names
and dates and places and

00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:18.894
important people from
500 years of history,

00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:23.061
stop panicking and just
think about overall themes.

00:07:25.937 --> 00:07:28.672
So some important overall
themes might be like

00:07:28.672 --> 00:07:31.803
the Gilded Age, that was
a time when there was a

00:07:31.803 --> 00:07:35.352
lot of wealth inequality, and immigration

00:07:35.352 --> 00:07:37.574
and maybe industrialization.

00:07:37.574 --> 00:07:41.288
So if you have that kind
of sense of what the

00:07:41.288 --> 00:07:45.260
major themes and ideas
were from each time period,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.755
that's really gonna help you on the exam,

00:07:47.755 --> 00:07:51.410
because you'll be able to use
that intuition for history

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.410
to help you answer questions
with reason instead

00:07:56.953 --> 00:07:58.556
of just memorization.

00:07:58.556 --> 00:08:03.054
Okay, so here is our first
question, and it's based

00:08:03.054 --> 00:08:06.938
on this stimulus material of a photograph

00:08:06.938 --> 00:08:11.105
and this photograph is by
the journalist, Jacob Riis

00:08:14.409 --> 00:08:17.213
and it's from the late 19th century, okay.

00:08:17.213 --> 00:08:20.771
So that's pretty much all
the information they give us.

00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:24.048
Now you may have heard
of Jacob Riis before,

00:08:24.048 --> 00:08:28.215
he was I think one of the
first muckraking photographers.

00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:33.861
Muckraker, there we go.

00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:36.796
And if you remember your
muckrakers, they were the

00:08:36.796 --> 00:08:41.376
journalists who tried to
expose bad working conditions

00:08:41.376 --> 00:08:45.365
or corruption in industry or politics,

00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:49.780
let's see, he's from
the late 19th century,

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.032
and what is this photograph telling us?

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:54.233
Well, I think if we just take some time to

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:58.400
examine it, we can tell that
it's a whole lot of people.

00:09:00.074 --> 00:09:03.741
In fact if I count,
there's one, two, three,

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:09.473
four, five, at least six
people, this might be

00:09:09.473 --> 00:09:12.162
somebody's legs, so six or seven people

00:09:12.162 --> 00:09:14.530
in a pretty small room.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.199
And you can tell that the
room's pretty dirty and dingy

00:09:18.199 --> 00:09:21.791
and it doesn't look like a nice place

00:09:21.791 --> 00:09:23.599
to hang out, basically.

00:09:23.599 --> 00:09:26.209
All right, so we've noticed
some things about our

00:09:26.209 --> 00:09:31.102
primary document, so let's look
at the questions themselves.

00:09:31.102 --> 00:09:34.357
All right, so I think one
thing that is really important

00:09:34.357 --> 00:09:37.775
about this exam all the
way through is that you

00:09:37.775 --> 00:09:41.000
need to read the questions
really carefully,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.171
'cause the questions
tell you a lot about what

00:09:44.171 --> 00:09:48.148
time period is it, for
example, that you should

00:09:48.148 --> 00:09:49.330
be focusing on.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.638
So if it asks you a
question about what happened

00:09:52.638 --> 00:09:55.144
in the Great Depression,
you wanna make sure that

00:09:55.144 --> 00:09:58.227
you're not talking about
something from the Gilded Age,

00:09:58.227 --> 00:09:59.985
or the post-war era.

00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:02.677
So especially make sure
that you're in the right

00:10:02.677 --> 00:10:04.724
time period, but also,
read to make sure there

00:10:04.724 --> 00:10:07.758
aren't any kind of little
tricks in the questions,

00:10:07.758 --> 00:10:09.289
'cause they can be there.

00:10:09.289 --> 00:10:12.151
All right, so it says
"Conditions like those

00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:15.746
shown in the image contributed
most directly to which

00:10:15.746 --> 00:10:17.246
of the following?"

00:10:18.355 --> 00:10:21.106
Okay, so conditions, I
think that they're talking

00:10:21.106 --> 00:10:25.189
about the dirty room, the
dirty overcrowded room.

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:32.429
And this is where I would
kinda go through the

00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:35.960
process of elimination, so
let's read each of the answers,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.243
and decide whether we
think it's a candidate,

00:10:38.243 --> 00:10:40.137
if it's not, we'll cross it out.

00:10:40.137 --> 00:10:42.999
Right, so conditions shown
in the image contributed

00:10:42.999 --> 00:10:46.053
most directly to which of the following?

00:10:46.053 --> 00:10:49.443
All right, the passage of
laws restricting immigration

00:10:49.443 --> 00:10:53.293
to the United States, okay,
I don't know about that

00:10:53.293 --> 00:10:56.372
one, so I'm gonna leave it for now,

00:10:56.372 --> 00:10:59.481
an increase in progressive
reform activity,

00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:02.307
all right, that is a good
candidate, 'cause you remember

00:11:02.307 --> 00:11:06.451
that Jacob Riis was a
muckraker, a decline in efforts

00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:09.909
to Americanize immigrants,
I don't think that's a

00:11:09.909 --> 00:11:13.231
good choice, because I
don't think there were many

00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:16.894
declines in efforts to
Americanize immigrants,

00:11:16.894 --> 00:11:19.408
usually the melting pot was the way that

00:11:19.408 --> 00:11:22.215
people thought about that,
and then the weakening

00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:26.382
of labor unions such as the
American Federation of Labor.

00:11:27.907 --> 00:11:30.364
All right, well I assume that
these are working people,

00:11:30.364 --> 00:11:34.892
but it doesn't really say
anything about labor unions,

00:11:34.892 --> 00:11:37.260
so I'm gonna cross that one out.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.431
All right, so that leaves us with two.

00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:41.880
The passage of laws
restricting immigration to

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.142
the United States or an increase

00:11:44.142 --> 00:11:46.915
in progressive reform activity.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:50.376
Well I think the laws are going to happen,

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.154
but maybe not for a little
while, in fact, I don't think

00:11:53.154 --> 00:11:56.769
those happen until after
World War I, so I think

00:11:56.769 --> 00:11:59.967
that an increase in
progressive reform activity

00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:01.967
is our best answer here.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.532
So we know that these
are people who are in

00:12:05.532 --> 00:12:08.899
bad conditions, and Jacob
Riis is exposing them,

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:11.986
he's a muckraker who's
trying to improve things,

00:12:11.986 --> 00:12:15.069
so I think it's a good answer with B.

00:12:16.212 --> 00:12:19.023
Cool, all right, let's try the other one.

00:12:19.023 --> 00:12:22.322
The conditions shown in
the image depict which

00:12:22.322 --> 00:12:26.033
of the following trends
in the late 19th century?

00:12:26.033 --> 00:12:31.011
All right, so we are looking
at conditions and also

00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:35.094
depicting trends, so this
shows us what something

00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:38.678
was like in the time period.

00:12:39.657 --> 00:12:43.157
So the growing gap between rich and poor,

00:12:43.157 --> 00:12:46.338
I think that is a possible, definitely.

00:12:46.338 --> 00:12:49.364
Okay, the rise of the settlement house

00:12:49.364 --> 00:12:51.281
and populist movements.

00:12:53.402 --> 00:12:56.436
Well, the settlement
houses were trying to make

00:12:56.436 --> 00:12:59.297
things nicer for immigrants,
and the populists,

00:12:59.297 --> 00:13:03.771
I believe were mostly farmers,
so I'm gonna cross that out.

00:13:03.771 --> 00:13:07.021
Increased corruption in urban politics,

00:13:08.864 --> 00:13:10.958
I don't think so, I
don't think we're looking

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.605
at anything political here.

00:13:13.605 --> 00:13:16.190
And then migration of African-Americans

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.610
to the North in the late 19th century.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.277
Well, I don't think
most of the men shown in

00:13:25.167 --> 00:13:28.520
this picture are
African-American, so I'm gonna

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.468
take this one off, and
that leaves us with the

00:13:31.468 --> 00:13:34.262
growing gap between rich and poor.

00:13:34.262 --> 00:13:36.152
And I think that's a good answer too,

00:13:36.152 --> 00:13:38.956
because we can see that
these people are facing

00:13:38.956 --> 00:13:41.538
a great deal of poverty
and we know that from

00:13:41.538 --> 00:13:44.218
this time period there
are people kind of working

00:13:44.218 --> 00:13:48.863
in factories, trying to deal
with a growing wealth gap,

00:13:48.863 --> 00:13:50.780
so I'm gonna go with A.

00:13:52.378 --> 00:13:55.550
All right, so how do you feel
about the multiple choice?

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.411
Should we do another
example of multiple choice,

00:13:58.411 --> 00:14:01.504
or do you wanna move onto
the short answer questions,

00:14:01.504 --> 00:14:03.337
what do you all think?

00:14:10.202 --> 00:14:13.869
All right, so I think
maybe let's move on to

00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:20.260
short answer, but I do wanna
give you an opportunity

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.436
to ask any questions that might have about

00:14:22.436 --> 00:14:25.530
the multiple choice section.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.363
Anything?

00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:43.962
All right, let's do short answer.

00:14:43.962 --> 00:14:45.641
You might have more questions about that,

00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:48.808
'cause I think it is a touch trickier.

00:15:04.246 --> 00:15:08.329
Okay, so here is a typical
short answer question,

00:15:09.914 --> 00:15:13.042
and you'll notice a
couple of things about it,

00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:16.792
one is that it has three
parts, so in each of

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.973
these questions, you're
gonna have a sheet of paper,

00:15:20.973 --> 00:15:23.582
it'll just kind of be
the front of one side

00:15:23.582 --> 00:15:26.790
of a page, and in that
you should answer all

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.790
three parts here, so part
A, part B, and part C.

00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:35.610
And you should answer them
in complete sentences,

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.460
you don't have to make
it a beautiful paragraph,

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.710
you can just kind of write A, B, and C,

00:15:44.063 --> 00:15:45.646
which I'm gonna do.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.843
But make sure that in this A, B, and C,

00:15:49.843 --> 00:15:52.343
you do include full sentences.

00:15:53.234 --> 00:15:57.401
All right, so using the graph
above, answer A, B, and C.

00:16:00.792 --> 00:16:04.590
So it looks like we
have a bar graph that is

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.423
talking about immigration
to the United States

00:16:09.517 --> 00:16:11.850
by decade from 1820 to 1859.

00:16:12.909 --> 00:16:16.365
So this is good to know,
because this is before

00:16:16.365 --> 00:16:19.726
the Civil War and it's not
until after the Civil War

00:16:19.726 --> 00:16:22.192
that we're gonna get
the really big explosion

00:16:22.192 --> 00:16:25.751
in immigration that we see
with the new immigrants

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:28.598
coming from Southern and Eastern Europe.

00:16:28.598 --> 00:16:32.265
And it's in millions,
so pretty good amount.

00:16:35.556 --> 00:16:39.723
So A, briefly explain how
one major historical factor

00:16:41.907 --> 00:16:45.720
contributed to the change
depicted on the graph.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.803
So it looks like the change
depicted on the graph

00:16:51.659 --> 00:16:54.576
is that there's a fairly high trend

00:16:56.086 --> 00:16:58.253
of increasing immigration.

00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:02.100
I'm not a mathematician,
but it looks like the

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.670
rate is increasing over time.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.891
So we need to talk about one
factor that contributed to

00:17:08.891 --> 00:17:12.924
an increase in immigration
from the early part

00:17:12.924 --> 00:17:15.424
of the 1800s to the mid-1800s.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.188
We need to explain one
specific historical effect

00:17:20.188 --> 00:17:24.391
that resulted from the change, and another

00:17:24.391 --> 00:17:26.641
specific historical effect.

00:17:28.012 --> 00:17:31.680
So we need one factor and two effects.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.579
So what I wanna emphasize
here is that there are

00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:38.579
many right answers to this question.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.602
You could come up with probably five or 10

00:17:43.602 --> 00:17:46.951
different things that would
count either as a factor

00:17:46.951 --> 00:17:50.618
or an effect here, and
any of those is okay.

00:17:51.796 --> 00:17:54.835
There isn't a single
right answer, so I would

00:17:54.835 --> 00:17:57.026
play to your strengths.

00:17:57.026 --> 00:17:59.606
If you remember something
about this, use it.

00:17:59.606 --> 00:18:02.581
So okay, one major historical factor.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:05.998
If you have any ideas, feel free to shout

00:18:08.076 --> 00:18:12.027
them out in the comments, I'm gonna say,

00:18:12.027 --> 00:18:16.179
so major factors leading
to increase in immigration

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:20.273
before the Civil War, I
think there's a big one here

00:18:20.273 --> 00:18:22.514
that you probably would know well,

00:18:22.514 --> 00:18:24.376
and I would say that would be like the

00:18:24.376 --> 00:18:26.168
Irish potato famine, right?

00:18:26.168 --> 00:18:28.513
So what are some of the
reasons that people are

00:18:28.513 --> 00:18:31.486
coming to United States in larger numbers?

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:34.357
The Irish potato famine was kind of a,

00:18:34.357 --> 00:18:37.600
we call that like a "push factor,"

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.350
something that was
pushing people from Europe

00:18:42.975 --> 00:18:45.468
to come to the United States.

00:18:45.468 --> 00:18:48.677
There were also political
revolutions, right?

00:18:48.677 --> 00:18:52.351
The revolutions of 1848 that sent a lot of

00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:55.601
German immigrants to the United States.

00:18:57.959 --> 00:18:59.790
So I'm just kind of outlining this here,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.856
but remember, you wanna
do this in full sentences.

00:19:02.856 --> 00:19:05.856
So another thing you
might talk about would be

00:19:05.856 --> 00:19:09.939
the fact that there were
a lot of jobs to be had.

00:19:10.956 --> 00:19:15.375
As US industrial production
started to ramp up,

00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:17.468
there were a lot of
opportunities for people

00:19:17.468 --> 00:19:20.475
to come from Europe or
elsewhere in the world

00:19:20.475 --> 00:19:24.504
to work in the United
States, so I think that would

00:19:24.504 --> 00:19:26.337
also be a good answer.

00:19:28.328 --> 00:19:31.756
All right, let's talk about our effects,

00:19:31.756 --> 00:19:34.978
so something that this caused.

00:19:34.978 --> 00:19:37.430
I think a big one here
would be kind of an increase

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.597
in anti-immigrant sentiment
or nativist sentiment.

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:46.714
And if you wanted to
give a specific example,

00:19:46.714 --> 00:19:49.191
you could say something
like the rise of the

00:19:49.191 --> 00:19:53.916
Know-Nothing Party, right,
those were a whole political

00:19:53.916 --> 00:19:57.499
party that was based
on nativist sentiment.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.730
Know-Nothing Party, and
then another effect,

00:20:05.477 --> 00:20:08.443
let's see, we could say,
this was one of the things

00:20:08.443 --> 00:20:11.719
that led to the early Temperance movement,

00:20:11.719 --> 00:20:15.797
there was a sense that new
immigrants to the United States

00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:19.703
like the Irish were drinking
too much and that it

00:20:19.703 --> 00:20:22.286
was important to curb drinking.

00:20:25.758 --> 00:20:27.927
See, anything else that
we could talk about,

00:20:27.927 --> 00:20:32.279
maybe, oh, I would say,
how about divisions

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:34.946
between the North and the South?

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.746
Remember, this is before the
Civil War, so all the the

00:20:38.746 --> 00:20:42.500
immigrants coming into
the North who are working

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.483
in industrial jobs really
changed the system of labor,

00:20:47.483 --> 00:20:52.323
even more starkly, to say
the North was industrial,

00:20:52.323 --> 00:20:55.990
and then the South was
based on slave labor.

00:20:56.912 --> 00:20:59.710
So you could say that this
was something that led

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.543
to a more divided nation
before the Civil War.

00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:13.240
All right, so I'm seeing
one question saying,

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.545
"What's the difference
between a historical factor,

00:21:16.545 --> 00:21:19.489
and a historical effect,"
that's a good question.

00:21:19.489 --> 00:21:23.006
So I think what they were asking here is,

00:21:23.006 --> 00:21:26.853
a factor is kind of
something that goes before,

00:21:26.853 --> 00:21:30.632
so something that led up to an event,

00:21:30.632 --> 00:21:33.855
so what was a factor that
led up or caused something

00:21:33.855 --> 00:21:38.022
to happen, and then an effect
would be something that

00:21:39.072 --> 00:21:41.072
happened after the fact.

00:21:48.891 --> 00:21:50.820
I'm seeing another question
that says, "What wouldn't be

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:55.422
a good example for this
question, a bad example answer?"

00:21:55.422 --> 00:21:58.406
I would say one thing that
you might be really tempted

00:21:58.406 --> 00:22:02.265
to do here is talk about something after

00:22:02.265 --> 00:22:05.328
the Civil War, because when
you think about immigration

00:22:05.328 --> 00:22:08.328
to the United States I
think we tend to focus

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:12.711
on that 1880-1920 period
when more than a million

00:22:12.711 --> 00:22:16.779
people were coming per
year, so make sure that if

00:22:16.779 --> 00:22:19.601
you're talking about
immigration you realize this

00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:22.927
is earlier than we would think of say,

00:22:22.927 --> 00:22:26.677
many people coming from
Russia or from Italy.

00:22:30.689 --> 00:22:33.293
All right, any other questions about this?

00:22:33.293 --> 00:22:35.632
Ooh, okay, what's the
best option if you can't

00:22:35.632 --> 00:22:37.215
think of an answer?

00:22:38.426 --> 00:22:42.343
I would say that if you're
stuck for an answer,

00:22:45.076 --> 00:22:47.973
take a moment to just
kind of brainstorm what's

00:22:47.973 --> 00:22:49.990
going in this time period.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:54.138
All right, we know this is 1820 to 1860,

00:22:54.138 --> 00:22:58.305
so this is kind of our, what
we call antebellum period.

00:23:02.568 --> 00:23:05.651
So it's kind of before the Civil War,

00:23:06.842 --> 00:23:10.586
the time that we kind of
think of a lot of US history

00:23:10.586 --> 00:23:14.118
coming together as a political force.

00:23:14.118 --> 00:23:16.820
So just say to yourself,
"Okay, what's going on

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.577
in this time period," and
you might say something

00:23:19.577 --> 00:23:22.775
like, "Oh yeah, wasn't that the time that

00:23:22.775 --> 00:23:27.213
there were lots of canals
and railroad spills,

00:23:27.213 --> 00:23:29.822
right, the market revolution.

00:23:29.822 --> 00:23:33.989
Or wasn't that the time with
the women's rights movement

00:23:35.746 --> 00:23:38.785
or it's before the Civil
War, so there's probably

00:23:38.785 --> 00:23:41.483
some kind of conflict
about slavery going on

00:23:41.483 --> 00:23:43.951
in the United States,
'cause there was pretty much

00:23:43.951 --> 00:23:45.263
always some kind of conflict going

00:23:45.263 --> 00:23:47.240
on politically about slavery."

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.240
So just consider how this
might have contributed

00:23:52.897 --> 00:23:56.317
to one of the major
themes or important ideas

00:23:56.317 --> 00:23:59.337
of the era, and then maybe
you can find something

00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:01.967
that would connect up with that.

00:24:01.967 --> 00:24:04.366
Cool, all right, we
also have some questions

00:24:04.366 --> 00:24:07.207
just about form, so do you
have to restate the question

00:24:07.207 --> 00:24:10.927
in your answer, and how
long should the answer be?

00:24:10.927 --> 00:24:14.985
You do not, although
sometimes it's just helpful

00:24:14.985 --> 00:24:18.210
to do that, 'cause it
kind of gives you basis

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.452
for your question.

00:24:19.452 --> 00:24:22.396
So it's not required,
but if you're nervous

00:24:22.396 --> 00:24:24.753
and you're just trying to
think about what to write,

00:24:24.753 --> 00:24:27.349
maybe you just write the
answer with the question

00:24:27.349 --> 00:24:29.266
at the beginning of it.

00:24:30.434 --> 00:24:33.906
And then how long, I would
say probably just a sentence

00:24:33.906 --> 00:24:38.255
or so for each part, so
I would say just kind of

00:24:38.255 --> 00:24:40.641
get to the meat of it, and
so you'd say for example,

00:24:40.641 --> 00:24:44.163
"One major historical factor
that led to an increase

00:24:44.163 --> 00:24:48.330
in immigration before the
Civil War were push factors

00:24:49.607 --> 00:24:54.454
from Europe, for example,
the Irish potato famine,

00:24:54.454 --> 00:24:57.059
which made it very
difficult for Irish people

00:24:57.059 --> 00:24:59.814
to continue to survive in
Ireland, so they emigrated

00:24:59.814 --> 00:25:02.280
to the United States," done.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.819
In reading these, I would
often find people who

00:25:06.819 --> 00:25:10.012
wrote an entire page but never mentioned

00:25:10.012 --> 00:25:13.294
anything specific, and
that was very frustrating,

00:25:13.294 --> 00:25:14.935
'cause you knew that had
spend a lot of time writing,

00:25:14.935 --> 00:25:17.651
but they never mentioned
a fact, and so it was hard

00:25:17.651 --> 00:25:19.401
to give them a point.

00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:23.178
So throughout this entire
exam, I think the best thing

00:25:23.178 --> 00:25:26.512
you can do for yourself is
mention a specific example

00:25:26.512 --> 00:25:30.679
and then explain how it
relates, explain what it is

00:25:31.719 --> 00:25:33.302
and how it relates.

00:25:38.674 --> 00:25:43.130
All right, so that is one
short answer question.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.304
Should we try another
short answer, or would you

00:25:45.304 --> 00:25:48.887
like to move on to the
long essay question?

00:25:55.776 --> 00:25:58.664
All right, I'm seeing
that the consensus is to

00:25:58.664 --> 00:26:02.831
move on, so let's head to
the long essay question,

00:26:10.915 --> 00:26:12.332
if I can find it.

00:26:17.239 --> 00:26:19.489
There we go, getting close.

00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:29.334
Okay, so this is a typical
long essay question

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:33.717
from the exam, so let me
tell you a little bit about

00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:35.967
the timing for these exams.

00:26:39.143 --> 00:26:42.568
So the first part of the exam
that we just talked about,

00:26:42.568 --> 00:26:45.588
section one, has the
multiple choice section and

00:26:45.588 --> 00:26:49.125
the short answer questions,
and for that you get

00:26:49.125 --> 00:26:53.292
an hour and 45 minutes, and
that's 55 multiple-choice

00:26:54.528 --> 00:26:58.276
questions and four short answer questions.

00:26:58.276 --> 00:27:01.910
I'm not sure if you're
allowed to move on to the

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:06.721
short answers right away,
I honestly don't know.

00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:09.425
I might have to check
that out, but I would say

00:27:09.425 --> 00:27:13.550
budget maybe a minute or
so per multiple choice

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.286
question and then move on to
the short answer questions,

00:27:17.286 --> 00:27:20.474
and maybe budget about five
minutes apiece for those,

00:27:20.474 --> 00:27:22.307
see how that gets you.

00:27:23.244 --> 00:27:26.245
All right, so after
section one is section two,

00:27:26.245 --> 00:27:29.870
and section two is the essay
portion, and there's a long

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.269
essay question and there's
a DBQ, and the DBQ is the

00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:36.496
document-based question.

00:27:36.496 --> 00:27:38.841
I think you usually do the
document-based question

00:27:38.841 --> 00:27:42.653
first, and that section is
also an hour and 45 minutes

00:27:42.653 --> 00:27:45.552
long, they start out by
giving you a 15 minute

00:27:45.552 --> 00:27:48.947
reading period just to
check out the documents

00:27:48.947 --> 00:27:51.864
in the DBQ, but it's about the same

00:27:52.747 --> 00:27:55.830
amount of time for writing.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.997
Okay, so let's think about
the long essay question,

00:28:05.871 --> 00:28:08.416
and then I will turn to
some of your other questions

00:28:08.416 --> 00:28:12.583
about periods and just like
a general review, okay.

00:28:14.544 --> 00:28:17.007
All right, so this is
a long essay question,

00:28:17.007 --> 00:28:21.174
and it says, "Evaluate the
extent to which the ratification

00:28:23.315 --> 00:28:27.482
of the 14th and 15th
Amendments to the Constitution

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.658
marked a turning point in
the history of United States

00:28:32.658 --> 00:28:34.408
politics and society.

00:28:35.782 --> 00:28:38.266
In the development of your
argument, explain what changed

00:28:38.266 --> 00:28:42.585
and what stayed the same
from the period immediately

00:28:42.585 --> 00:28:45.041
before the amendments to the period

00:28:45.041 --> 00:28:47.374
immediately following them."

00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:52.760
All right, so how would we go
about answering this question?

00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:58.691
I think the first thing that
I would do would just be

00:28:59.539 --> 00:29:03.292
to brainstorm some things
that you can talk about.

00:29:03.292 --> 00:29:06.705
So off the top of my head, I would say,

00:29:06.705 --> 00:29:10.650
we're talking about the
14 and 15th amendments,

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.567
and if you recall, the
14th is equal protection

00:29:15.725 --> 00:29:18.642
under the law and equal citizenship

00:29:19.694 --> 00:29:21.777
for African-American men.

00:29:23.914 --> 00:29:28.031
And then the 15th was the right to vote,

00:29:28.031 --> 00:29:30.114
for African-American men.

00:29:38.584 --> 00:29:42.751
Okay so what else might we
talk about, just general facts?

00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:46.457
I would say I mean, since
we're already talking

00:29:46.457 --> 00:29:49.045
about the 14th and 15th
amendments, we might talk

00:29:49.045 --> 00:29:52.795
about the 13th, which
was the end of slavery.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:59.093
We might talk about Jim Crow laws.

00:30:04.843 --> 00:30:08.426
We might talk about
the KKK or black codes.

00:30:13.667 --> 00:30:17.046
We could talk about
Supreme Court cases like

00:30:17.046 --> 00:30:20.963
Plessy versus Ferguson,
or the Dred Scott case,

00:30:31.553 --> 00:30:35.759
all right, so what I would
do then is just kind of

00:30:35.759 --> 00:30:38.926
get a sense of what these all tell me.

00:30:41.038 --> 00:30:44.501
Like is there is a theme among these,

00:30:44.501 --> 00:30:48.668
so in case you are struggling
with the time period here,

00:30:52.755 --> 00:30:55.434
remember the 14th and 15th
amendments were kind of

00:30:55.434 --> 00:30:59.969
right after the Civil War,
so around about like 1870.

00:30:59.969 --> 00:31:04.137
The 13th was right at the
end of Civil War in 1865.

00:31:04.137 --> 00:31:08.304
So our question would be,
was the granting of equal

00:31:11.437 --> 00:31:15.778
citizenship and the vote
for African-American men

00:31:15.778 --> 00:31:19.195
actually a turning point, or not so much?

00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:24.075
So it seems like there are
some good things to start

00:31:24.075 --> 00:31:26.766
with here, right, there's
the end of slavery,

00:31:26.766 --> 00:31:30.275
there's equal citizenship,
but then things start to

00:31:30.275 --> 00:31:32.364
kind of go pear-shaped, right?

00:31:32.364 --> 00:31:36.114
You have the implementation
of Jim Crow laws,

00:31:38.182 --> 00:31:41.657
Plessy versus Ferguson, a
court case that legalized

00:31:41.657 --> 00:31:45.824
separate but equal accommodations,
legalized segregation,

00:31:50.852 --> 00:31:55.270
and the KKK, you had a
group that was dedicated

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:58.584
to terrorizing African-Americans and their

00:31:58.584 --> 00:32:02.751
white allies, terrorizing
Republicans in the South.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:11.080
So if I had to say whether
they were a turning point,

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.226
my feeling would be that
I would want to say that

00:32:14.226 --> 00:32:17.976
they marked a turning
point kind of on paper,

00:32:22.614 --> 00:32:26.697
turning point on paper,
but none of these aspects

00:32:33.224 --> 00:32:35.694
of Civil Rights and
equal voting rights were

00:32:35.694 --> 00:32:38.361
actually protected in real life.

00:32:40.906 --> 00:32:44.073
So it as on paper, but not in reality.

00:32:47.135 --> 00:32:51.302
So I think that kind of counts
as our thesis statement,

00:32:57.698 --> 00:33:00.732
and then we might want to talk about

00:33:00.732 --> 00:33:04.292
politics and society,
and we want to talk about

00:33:04.292 --> 00:33:06.998
what changed and what stayed the same.

00:33:06.998 --> 00:33:09.081
So politics, and society.

00:33:14.107 --> 00:33:15.763
And remember, we're
making this argument that

00:33:15.763 --> 00:33:19.203
it's a turning point on
paper, but not in reality.

00:33:19.203 --> 00:33:22.121
So I think that's actually
a good way of structuring

00:33:22.121 --> 00:33:27.079
your essay, where you might
talk about what seemed

00:33:27.079 --> 00:33:30.152
like a turning point, or
at least a turning point

00:33:30.152 --> 00:33:33.485
on paper was not really a turning point,

00:33:34.664 --> 00:33:38.831
because none of the statutes
were actually enforced.

00:33:41.522 --> 00:33:45.605
Okay, so if I started with
an intro, I would say,

00:33:51.003 --> 00:33:54.690
let's see, let's see,
there's a question about how

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.650
we should approach writing an
intro, that's a good question.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:02.060
I mean, being flowery never hurts, right.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.609
I would just kinda maybe give some context

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:08.776
to the time period, and say
there had been 200 years

00:34:11.533 --> 00:34:15.153
of slavery in the United
States up until this point

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:18.320
in the Civil War, with things like the

00:34:19.428 --> 00:34:23.287
Emancipation Proclamation,
and a 13th Amendment,

00:34:23.287 --> 00:34:27.454
seemed as though they were
really important points

00:34:28.477 --> 00:34:31.228
in African-American
citizenship, that this was gonna

00:34:31.228 --> 00:34:35.195
be the time, and it really
didn't seem like that early on,

00:34:35.195 --> 00:34:39.362
there were important moves
forward like the 14th amendment

00:34:40.734 --> 00:34:44.901
and the 15th Amendment but by
the end of the 19th century,

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:51.037
Jim Crow was the law of the
land, and a lot of the advances

00:34:52.483 --> 00:34:57.254
that had been made on paper
had very little tangible

00:34:57.254 --> 00:35:00.524
meaning for African American
citizens because they

00:35:00.524 --> 00:35:04.884
still experienced relatively
little change in status

00:35:04.884 --> 00:35:08.217
than before the 14th and 15th Amendment.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.742
Okay, so if I wanted
that to be my intro and

00:35:14.742 --> 00:35:19.060
my thesis statement, then
I might write a paragraph

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.143
about politics and one about society,

00:35:23.796 --> 00:35:27.879
where I could say
something about how before

00:35:27.879 --> 00:35:31.546
the Civil War, so this
is our turning point,

00:35:32.455 --> 00:35:36.038
before Civil War,
decisions like Dred Scott

00:35:36.933 --> 00:35:41.100
said that African-Americans
weren't citizens at all,

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:53.914
but the 14th and 15th
Amendment were a brief moment

00:35:55.073 --> 00:35:58.906
where African-Americans
had the right to vote,

00:36:01.007 --> 00:36:04.479
African-American men, and
they had equal protection

00:36:04.479 --> 00:36:08.479
under the law, but at the
end of Reconstruction,

00:36:13.409 --> 00:36:16.793
when the Northern military forces stopped

00:36:16.793 --> 00:36:19.876
occupying the south, white Democrats,

00:36:23.538 --> 00:36:27.416
often known as the Redeemers,
the Redemption Era,

00:36:27.416 --> 00:36:31.550
retook political power in
the South, and that was

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:35.529
kind of the end of the
African-American political

00:36:35.529 --> 00:36:39.696
voice until the Civil Rights
movement, the end of the vote.

00:36:42.327 --> 00:36:46.271
And then we might talk about
society, where say before

00:36:46.271 --> 00:36:50.438
the Civil War, slavery, you
might talk about slave codes,

00:36:54.226 --> 00:36:58.504
for example, that said
it was all right to kill

00:36:58.504 --> 00:37:02.119
an enslaved person, you
had no legal recourse

00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:06.286
for the murder of your family
member, if you were enslaved,

00:37:07.967 --> 00:37:11.801
so something that said
slaves really had no status

00:37:11.801 --> 00:37:15.760
in society, and the 14th
Amendment was a moment

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.412
that said, "All right, you
should have due protection

00:37:18.412 --> 00:37:21.032
under the law, it should
matter if someone murders you,

00:37:21.032 --> 00:37:25.444
for example," but by
the late 19th century,

00:37:25.444 --> 00:37:29.611
you had lynch law, for example,
where African-Americans

00:37:31.409 --> 00:37:34.913
who were killed by white
mobs, really there was

00:37:34.913 --> 00:37:37.996
no justice for that, or the KKK here.

00:37:40.916 --> 00:37:43.775
And you could even say things
like Plessy versus Ferguson

00:37:43.775 --> 00:37:47.663
really showed that
African-Americans were still

00:37:47.663 --> 00:37:51.163
second-class citizens because it legalized

00:37:52.094 --> 00:37:54.927
separate but equal accommodations.

00:37:58.814 --> 00:38:00.765
So the last thing that
you want to do in these

00:38:00.765 --> 00:38:04.015
long essays is what's called synthesis,

00:38:05.815 --> 00:38:09.071
you get a special point for
this, and that means you

00:38:09.071 --> 00:38:12.738
kind of draw a parallel
with some other time

00:38:13.851 --> 00:38:16.857
in the United States, some other time,

00:38:16.857 --> 00:38:19.942
some other theme,
something that's a little

00:38:19.942 --> 00:38:22.566
outside your essay, that you might say,

00:38:22.566 --> 00:38:25.122
"Yeah, this is relevant,"
and I think a good example

00:38:25.122 --> 00:38:28.205
of that here might be something like,

00:38:30.154 --> 00:38:31.520
the Civil Rights movement.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.473
You could say, "You
know, the 14th and 15th

00:38:34.473 --> 00:38:36.635
amendments weren't much
of a turning point,

00:38:36.635 --> 00:38:40.302
but you could suggest,
for example, that the

00:38:42.321 --> 00:38:46.153
Montgomery bus boycott
was a real turning point,

00:38:46.153 --> 00:38:50.320
because it showed that if
African Americans organized

00:38:51.957 --> 00:38:54.404
together that they could affect change

00:38:54.404 --> 00:38:57.812
on the system of Jim Crow, so kind of take

00:38:57.812 --> 00:39:01.062
something from a different time period,

00:39:02.377 --> 00:39:05.407
a different idea, you
could even use something

00:39:05.407 --> 00:39:07.772
from outside the history
of the United States,

00:39:07.772 --> 00:39:10.169
if you know something about that,

00:39:10.169 --> 00:39:14.002
and kind of extend your
argument a little bit.

00:39:15.227 --> 00:39:19.071
So yeah, and then I would
conclude, and your conclusion

00:39:19.071 --> 00:39:22.261
can really just be a
restatement of what you said,

00:39:22.261 --> 00:39:26.030
it doesn't have to be anything special.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.238
The only other thing that
I should mention is that

00:39:28.238 --> 00:39:30.772
your thesis statement
really needs to be either

00:39:30.772 --> 00:39:33.675
in your introduction or your conclusion.

00:39:33.675 --> 00:39:36.880
So you have to put it in
one of those paragraphs,

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.934
and that's just to make it really obvious

00:39:38.934 --> 00:39:40.887
to the readers where it
is, so they're not kind of

00:39:40.887 --> 00:39:43.381
just looking through your essay wondering,

00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:46.075
is that a thesis statement?

00:39:46.075 --> 00:39:48.072
In fact, you could probably underline it

00:39:48.072 --> 00:39:51.829
if you want to, and
that might help as well.

00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:55.185
Okay, so I'm seeing one
question about this,

00:39:55.185 --> 00:39:57.561
it says, "Is there a
specific formula to follow

00:39:57.561 --> 00:40:00.996
for the structure of the essay?"

00:40:00.996 --> 00:40:05.077
I wouldn't say that you
have to do it a certain way,

00:40:05.077 --> 00:40:08.328
I think there are a couple
of tried and true ways

00:40:08.328 --> 00:40:10.411
to do this sort of essay.

00:40:11.318 --> 00:40:14.705
On is your very standard
five paragraph essay,

00:40:14.705 --> 00:40:17.770
where you would write an
intro and a conclusion

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:20.480
and three body paragraphs,
and each of those

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.327
body paragraphs might
address something like

00:40:23.327 --> 00:40:27.087
differences in politics,
differences in society,

00:40:27.087 --> 00:40:30.521
differences in gender roles, for example,

00:40:30.521 --> 00:40:33.352
and then you could conclude.

00:40:33.352 --> 00:40:36.722
You can also do something
more like a four paragraph

00:40:36.722 --> 00:40:40.257
essay, and that works pretty
well if you're kind of

00:40:40.257 --> 00:40:44.319
comparing and contrasting
something, and so you might

00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:48.152
do one paragraph were
you compare and contrast

00:40:49.505 --> 00:40:51.921
something before a certain time period,

00:40:51.921 --> 00:40:54.763
and one paragraph where
you compare or contrast

00:40:54.763 --> 00:40:57.669
something after a certain time period.

00:40:57.669 --> 00:41:00.765
So I wouldn't force yourself
to do the five paragraph

00:41:00.765 --> 00:41:05.011
essay, if that just doesn't
seem like it would work.

00:41:05.011 --> 00:41:07.430
But if you're just feeling
lost, and you think,

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:09.922
how should I do this, a
five paragraph is a good

00:41:09.922 --> 00:41:11.818
place to start.

00:41:11.818 --> 00:41:14.646
Okay, I see one question
that asks, "How much does

00:41:14.646 --> 00:41:17.589
spelling and grammar
and punctuation matter?"

00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:19.652
The answer is, not much at all.

00:41:19.652 --> 00:41:23.440
Because this is something
that they know is written

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.326
off the top of your head,
it's just supposed to

00:41:26.326 --> 00:41:28.250
be kind of a first draft.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:30.812
Now, I will say that if
you spell something so

00:41:30.812 --> 00:41:33.681
abominably bad that there's just no way of

00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:36.185
telling what you're
saying, you're probably

00:41:36.185 --> 00:41:40.352
not gonna do yourself any
favors, but you don't need

00:41:41.768 --> 00:41:45.044
to write the most
beautiful essay ever here.

00:41:45.044 --> 00:41:47.218
It doesn't need to be a
final draft that you've

00:41:47.218 --> 00:41:50.759
gone through multiple
revisions, it really is supposed

00:41:50.759 --> 00:41:52.764
to be something that's
more or less written off

00:41:52.764 --> 00:41:55.062
the top of your head, and
so it does not need to

00:41:55.062 --> 00:41:58.162
be beautiful, it does
not need to be perfect.

00:41:58.162 --> 00:42:00.110
In fact, it's even okay
for you to have some

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.580
minor errors, as long
as those factual errors

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:06.346
aren't deeply tied to what your essay is

00:42:06.346 --> 00:42:08.263
all about, for example.

00:42:10.487 --> 00:42:13.181
And another thing that you
should know is that all

00:42:13.181 --> 00:42:16.521
of the points are scored
independently of each other,

00:42:16.521 --> 00:42:19.922
so even if you don't do
well on the thesis and

00:42:19.922 --> 00:42:21.987
they don't wanna give a point for that,

00:42:21.987 --> 00:42:23.563
that doesn't mean that
you can't still get points

00:42:23.563 --> 00:42:25.722
for all the evidence or synthesis,

00:42:25.722 --> 00:42:27.633
so it's not like you kind
of have to rack up one

00:42:27.633 --> 00:42:31.800
to get the other, they're all
scored on their own, cool.

00:42:33.824 --> 00:42:37.724
All right, so we've got
about 20 minutes left,

00:42:37.724 --> 00:42:42.377
I was thinking we might do
a primary source analysis

00:42:42.377 --> 00:42:45.743
for a few minutes, and
I wanted to do this a

00:42:45.743 --> 00:42:48.517
little bit in lieu of
the DBQ 'cause the DBQ

00:42:48.517 --> 00:42:51.753
was just really big, and
I think it would take up

00:42:51.753 --> 00:42:55.253
our entire hour if we tried to do the DBQ.

00:43:01.295 --> 00:43:04.184
So, I wanted to take a
look at a primary source

00:43:04.184 --> 00:43:07.931
with you, and kind of take
you through how you might

00:43:07.931 --> 00:43:12.098
analyze a primary source and
that kind of primary source

00:43:13.925 --> 00:43:16.223
analysis will be the
thing that really gets you

00:43:16.223 --> 00:43:17.556
through the DBQ.

00:43:21.718 --> 00:43:22.801
So pardon me.

00:43:24.103 --> 00:43:28.270
The DBQ is an essay very
similar to the long essay,

00:43:30.405 --> 00:43:33.341
except that they're
going to provide you with

00:43:33.341 --> 00:43:35.999
seven primary documents
and you're gonna need

00:43:35.999 --> 00:43:40.895
to work all but one of those
into your answer somehow.

00:43:40.895 --> 00:43:45.766
So what you should do, I
think, as you go through

00:43:45.766 --> 00:43:48.721
and you read these primary
documents in preparation

00:43:48.721 --> 00:43:52.059
for the DBQ, is analyze
each one as you go along.

00:43:52.059 --> 00:43:55.226
And there's a useful acronym for this,

00:43:57.794 --> 00:44:01.719
and many of you might have
seen this in your AP class,

00:44:01.719 --> 00:44:04.250
your teacher may have said this to you,

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.417
and it's called SOAPSTONE,

00:44:12.678 --> 00:44:15.465
do I have any SOAPSTONE love out there?

00:44:15.465 --> 00:44:16.835
SOAPSTONE.

00:44:16.835 --> 00:44:20.503
And this is an acronym
that just kinda helps

00:44:20.503 --> 00:44:23.894
you remember what you might
look at in a primary document,

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:27.727
and so SOAPSTONE stands
for speaker, occasion,

00:44:32.439 --> 00:44:35.856
how do you spell that, audience, purpose,

00:44:40.293 --> 00:44:42.710
subject, and tone, SOAPSTONE.

00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:51.432
So the primary documents
that you read might be

00:44:51.432 --> 00:44:54.682
political cartoons, they might be maps,

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.699
they might be quotes from
individuals, they could

00:44:59.699 --> 00:45:03.507
be posters, so I was thinking it might be

00:45:03.507 --> 00:45:07.617
interesting if we did
as our primary document,

00:45:07.617 --> 00:45:09.700
the Vietnam War Memorial.

00:45:13.364 --> 00:45:16.364
So I guess it's kind of a sculpture.

00:45:20.097 --> 00:45:23.930
So if we did this speaker,
well that's maybe a

00:45:25.252 --> 00:45:27.528
tough one to answer.

00:45:27.528 --> 00:45:30.853
We could say that maybe
the speaker here is

00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:32.753
the architect, and if
you're familiar with this

00:45:32.753 --> 00:45:35.670
at all, the architect was Maya Lin,

00:45:37.507 --> 00:45:40.341
and she was just, I
think in her early 20's

00:45:40.341 --> 00:45:43.822
when she came up with the
design of the Vietnam Memorial.

00:45:43.822 --> 00:45:47.655
And the occasion was,
it was finished in 1982,

00:45:50.307 --> 00:45:53.308
so it wasn't very long at
all after the war ended.

00:45:53.308 --> 00:45:56.648
So the occasion I guess
here is to memorialize

00:45:56.648 --> 00:46:00.398
those who fought and
died in the Vietnam War.

00:46:02.246 --> 00:46:06.236
So her audience I guess
would be people who came

00:46:06.236 --> 00:46:09.653
to visit, maybe veterans or folks who had

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:13.447
lost people in the war.

00:46:14.647 --> 00:46:18.565
Her purpose, again, kind
of that memorialization,

00:46:18.565 --> 00:46:21.982
to give people a place to maybe grieve or

00:46:24.626 --> 00:46:28.793
feel proud of the people
who had fought in the war.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.333
And then the subject is
the war, the veterans,

00:46:38.447 --> 00:46:40.780
people who lost their lives.

00:46:41.769 --> 00:46:44.717
And then the tone I would
say is kind of somber,

00:46:44.717 --> 00:46:47.717
respectful, it's even kind of quiet.

00:46:53.749 --> 00:46:55.816
I really like this memorial.

00:46:55.816 --> 00:46:57.697
If you've never actually
been to see this memorial,

00:46:57.697 --> 00:46:59.857
I highly recommend it, it's beautiful,

00:46:59.857 --> 00:47:03.095
it's very long, and everything
is organized by year,

00:47:03.095 --> 00:47:05.580
the people who were killed in action or

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:08.529
missing in action, and
as you can see here,

00:47:08.529 --> 00:47:11.710
it's also reflective, so
you can kind of go and see

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:15.657
the names maybe, of someone
that you might have lost,

00:47:15.657 --> 00:47:18.560
but also see yourself reflected in those,

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.021
and you can kind of see
here that people also

00:47:21.021 --> 00:47:25.848
leave things at the memorial,
so it has this sense

00:47:25.848 --> 00:47:28.326
that you can kind of interact with it,

00:47:28.326 --> 00:47:32.187
or that maybe it's like
a proxy for getting to

00:47:32.187 --> 00:47:34.104
talk to your loved one.

00:47:35.153 --> 00:47:40.052
So if I saw this on a DBQ,
I would see it maybe as

00:47:40.052 --> 00:47:43.721
an example of how people
tried to come to terms

00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:47.888
with the Vietnam war, which
was a very unpopular war.

00:47:52.243 --> 00:47:56.410
Might be an example of some of
the controversy over the war.

00:48:01.902 --> 00:48:05.525
So you might then use that
in an essay that's about

00:48:05.525 --> 00:48:09.192
for example, I don't
know, US involvement in

00:48:10.755 --> 00:48:15.550
overseas battles against
communism, for example,

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:18.354
and show how that was a
very difficult period,

00:48:18.354 --> 00:48:21.471
coming to terms with that after the war.

00:48:21.471 --> 00:48:24.670
So for every document
in the DBQ, you want to

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:28.501
mention something I guess,
at least four of the

00:48:28.501 --> 00:48:32.332
documents in the DBQ, you
want to talk about the

00:48:32.332 --> 00:48:36.165
point of view of the
author, their purpose for

00:48:38.137 --> 00:48:41.554
writing, the context in which they wrote,

00:48:42.642 --> 00:48:46.392
and there's one more,
I'm trying to remember,

00:48:50.508 --> 00:48:54.508
and ooh, their purpose,
and their point of view,

00:48:57.363 --> 00:48:59.633
context, audience, purpose.

00:48:59.633 --> 00:49:01.891
That's what I'm missing, audience.

00:49:01.891 --> 00:49:04.161
So kind of identify those.

00:49:04.161 --> 00:49:08.328
Okay, so I've got a bunch
of questions about the DBQ

00:49:11.289 --> 00:49:15.372
here, some people are
asking which period the DBQ

00:49:17.065 --> 00:49:18.784
will cover?

00:49:18.784 --> 00:49:21.175
The answer is, I don't know.

00:49:21.175 --> 00:49:25.342
Usually the essays will
cover more than one period,

00:49:26.545 --> 00:49:31.050
I believe, but neither of
them, nothing on the exam

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:34.886
will concentrate exclusively
on the period before

00:49:34.886 --> 00:49:39.298
1607, or the period after
1980, 'cause those are kind

00:49:39.298 --> 00:49:42.715
of less emphasized periods in US history,

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.147
just 'cause we don't have
quite as much about them.

00:49:47.147 --> 00:49:50.252
So I think the bulk of what you'll see

00:49:50.252 --> 00:49:54.270
on the exam is material that's after 1607,

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:57.660
so the start of Jamestown,
and before 1980,

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.160
so end of Vietnam.

00:50:00.725 --> 00:50:04.440
Okay, and I see one question
that says, "How many

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.901
documents should we include in the DBQ?"

00:50:06.901 --> 00:50:11.406
And the answer is, you
should include six of them,

00:50:11.406 --> 00:50:13.592
there'll be seven documents
on there, and you can

00:50:13.592 --> 00:50:15.259
include all but one.

00:50:17.815 --> 00:50:20.508
Other things, what should we focus on most

00:50:20.508 --> 00:50:22.008
when writing DBQs?

00:50:22.987 --> 00:50:25.820
Well, I think the thing
that I would say you wanna

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.987
focus on throughout the exam
is using specific evidence

00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:38.276
and that means, instead
of saying "there were some

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:43.374
protests before the American revolution,"

00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:46.787
you might wanna say something
like the Boston Tea Party,

00:50:46.787 --> 00:50:49.037
so name something specific.

00:50:53.106 --> 00:50:56.606
And then describe or explain what that is,

00:50:59.848 --> 00:51:03.436
so you're not just
namedropping Boston Tea Party,

00:51:03.436 --> 00:51:07.603
you're saying, "that was
an event in 1773," I think,

00:51:09.787 --> 00:51:13.954
possibly 1774, in which a
group of the Sons of Liberty

00:51:15.156 --> 00:51:18.323
dumped tea in protest of taxes on tea.

00:51:23.672 --> 00:51:26.505
You don't need to know
the date, I'm just hoping

00:51:26.505 --> 00:51:28.484
that I know that one.

00:51:28.484 --> 00:51:31.734
Dumped tea, and then connect it back up

00:51:33.128 --> 00:51:35.628
to your thesis, connect it up.

00:51:38.423 --> 00:51:42.271
Would say, "and that shows
that there was an increasing

00:51:42.271 --> 00:51:46.438
amount of tension between
the colonies and the crown."

00:52:01.074 --> 00:52:05.416
So use the names, the
specific names of things,

00:52:05.416 --> 00:52:08.202
to show that you have a
command of important events

00:52:08.202 --> 00:52:10.896
and people, then actually
say what those things are,

00:52:10.896 --> 00:52:14.383
and then connect them
back up to your thesis,

00:52:14.383 --> 00:52:17.072
and I think if you did
that across the exam,

00:52:17.072 --> 00:52:20.950
you'd be very well
placed to do quite well.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.200
All right, so other things.

00:52:25.687 --> 00:52:29.101
We've got people asking
if there are study guides,

00:52:29.101 --> 00:52:30.268
and there are.

00:52:31.962 --> 00:52:36.129
At the beginning of this
program I shared some AP review

00:52:37.343 --> 00:52:41.726
that we have on Khan
Academy, it's under the,

00:52:41.726 --> 00:52:45.893
I think it's just General
AP Strategies and Skills,

00:52:46.834 --> 00:52:49.296
and there I have more videos
where I talk about how

00:52:49.296 --> 00:52:53.754
to do these essays in
detail, but I also have a

00:52:53.754 --> 00:52:58.653
study sheet there that
outlines the major themes,

00:52:58.653 --> 00:53:01.736
important takeaways from each period.

00:53:02.674 --> 00:53:06.525
So if you wanna go take a
look at that, I think that's

00:53:06.525 --> 00:53:10.263
a really good just overall
sense of what's happening,

00:53:10.263 --> 00:53:13.607
and that's broken down
by themes or things like

00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:17.440
American national identity,
work and exchange,

00:53:20.672 --> 00:53:24.195
so just kind of a sense
of what was going on,

00:53:24.195 --> 00:53:25.695
work and exchange.

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:31.555
All right, anything else?

00:53:33.878 --> 00:53:37.239
What should you focus on
memorizing in this week,

00:53:37.239 --> 00:53:39.156
besides the amendments?

00:53:40.745 --> 00:53:44.912
Honestly, I would go back to
the general gist of things,

00:53:47.665 --> 00:53:51.582
and that would just be
to say, "Okay, in period

00:53:52.442 --> 00:53:56.609
two, right, this was the
1607 to 1754, just a sense

00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:04.186
like, yeah, there were
some colonies happening,"

00:54:04.186 --> 00:54:09.178
and the colonies had different
reasons for being founded,

00:54:09.178 --> 00:54:12.615
different ways of
organizing their societies.

00:54:12.615 --> 00:54:15.703
You might say, "Yeah, I
remember that the English

00:54:15.703 --> 00:54:19.620
were more into trying to
have religious refuge,

00:54:21.462 --> 00:54:25.629
whereas the Spanish were more
into trying to get gold."

00:54:28.384 --> 00:54:30.889
And do that for each of the
periods, just break it down

00:54:30.889 --> 00:54:33.791
into a few important things
that you wanna take away,

00:54:33.791 --> 00:54:37.958
and then stop worrying
about memorization, I think.

00:54:40.229 --> 00:54:41.396
Anything else?

00:54:42.574 --> 00:54:45.324
Okay, tips for document citation.

00:54:48.324 --> 00:54:52.491
I think you can actually just
say like, "In document one,"

00:54:54.411 --> 00:54:55.328
in the DBQ.

00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:59.467
You don't need to quote
from the document at length,

00:54:59.467 --> 00:55:03.634
you might just say like,
"In document three, Barbara

00:55:05.417 --> 00:55:10.177
Erinreich talks about the
importance of good cancer

00:55:10.177 --> 00:55:13.840
treatment," that was just
something off the top of my head.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:18.007
So you don't need to do into
a full Chicago-style citation

00:55:19.715 --> 00:55:22.965
or put every single thing
that is included on the

00:55:22.965 --> 00:55:25.895
explanation of what that is
in the DBQ in your essay,

00:55:25.895 --> 00:55:30.062
I would just kind of a gesture
toward it, toward the author

00:55:31.348 --> 00:55:32.848
and their subject.

00:55:34.268 --> 00:55:37.333
All right, basic fallbacks
if you don't know something

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.500
about a particular period.

00:55:42.441 --> 00:55:46.435
You know, I think there
are some large things

00:55:46.435 --> 00:55:49.895
that go across American
history, like things that are

00:55:49.895 --> 00:55:53.029
characteristic of
American history, perhaps,

00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:56.977
and that might be the United
States, up until about

00:55:56.977 --> 00:56:01.551
the turn of the 20th century
tended to be isolationist

00:56:01.551 --> 00:56:04.918
I their foreign policy, so before then,

00:56:04.918 --> 00:56:08.517
you could be pretty much
sure that that was all that

00:56:08.517 --> 00:56:10.630
the United States was,
they were not interested

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:12.256
in foreign wars.

00:56:12.256 --> 00:56:14.647
And you can kinda have
a big sense, like eh,

00:56:14.647 --> 00:56:17.387
after World War II, the
United States wanted to

00:56:17.387 --> 00:56:20.522
defeat communism, so they
got into many wars abroad

00:56:20.522 --> 00:56:23.587
with the goal of containing communism.

00:56:23.587 --> 00:56:27.674
So I think there's som broad
strokes that carry across

00:56:27.674 --> 00:56:31.841
time periods, and your instinct
there is probably good.

00:56:36.985 --> 00:56:41.492
All right, oh okay, can
you go over how to get

00:56:41.492 --> 00:56:44.160
the contextualization point, and that's on

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.994
the DBQ, I'm assuming.

00:56:45.994 --> 00:56:50.161
So the contextualization
point on the DBQ is I think

00:56:51.497 --> 00:56:54.533
similar to what your
introduction might be,

00:56:54.533 --> 00:56:57.291
and that is just kind
of setting the stage for

00:56:57.291 --> 00:57:01.401
what's going on, so for
example, the DBQ last year,

00:57:01.401 --> 00:57:03.932
I believe, was about the
rise of the women's rights

00:57:03.932 --> 00:57:08.099
movement, and so you could
kind of set the stage there,

00:57:09.644 --> 00:57:13.893
I think it was from 1945
to 1970, so it's after

00:57:13.893 --> 00:57:17.312
World War II, so that
would be a place where you

00:57:17.312 --> 00:57:20.075
would say for example,
"Well, during World War II,

00:57:20.075 --> 00:57:23.372
many women worked in
factories, and they had a

00:57:23.372 --> 00:57:27.059
experience to earn wages
for themselves for the

00:57:27.059 --> 00:57:29.613
first time, they found
that very liberating

00:57:29.613 --> 00:57:32.910
and then after the war,
many of them lost their jobs

00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:35.766
and white women back to the suburbs,

00:57:35.766 --> 00:57:38.738
and many African-American
women and minority women

00:57:38.738 --> 00:57:41.757
had to go back to prior
occupations that weren't

00:57:41.757 --> 00:57:43.243
as well-paid.

00:57:43.243 --> 00:57:45.820
So over the course of the 1950s more and

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.049
more discontent bred."

00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:51.323
So it's kind of showing
that you know something

00:57:51.323 --> 00:57:53.901
about this period, and about this topic,

00:57:53.901 --> 00:57:57.454
outside of just what
the documents tell you.

00:57:57.454 --> 00:57:59.776
All right, anything else?

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:03.421
General tips for time
management on the exam.

00:58:03.421 --> 00:58:07.338
I think this is something
where practice helps,

00:58:10.089 --> 00:58:12.198
and knowing yourself a bit helps.

00:58:12.198 --> 00:58:15.635
I am, I think I'm a fast
writer myself, but I'm a

00:58:15.635 --> 00:58:19.718
slow planner, so knowing
that it's not gonna take

00:58:20.583 --> 00:58:24.621
me as long to write
something down means that I

00:58:24.621 --> 00:58:27.249
can spend a little bit more time planning,

00:58:27.249 --> 00:58:29.451
but you might find that
you're the opposite,

00:58:29.451 --> 00:58:31.755
you can plan super-fast
but you know you wanna

00:58:31.755 --> 00:58:33.723
take some more time to write.

00:58:33.723 --> 00:58:36.417
So maybe use a little
bit about what you know

00:58:36.417 --> 00:58:38.460
of your own learning style.

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.898
Also, you're not gonna be on your own,

00:58:40.898 --> 00:58:44.335
during the exam the proctors
will tell you how much

00:58:44.335 --> 00:58:46.587
time you have left and they'll also say,

00:58:46.587 --> 00:58:50.836
during the essay portion,
"At this point, it might be

00:58:50.836 --> 00:58:53.739
a good idea to move onto
the second essay," so given

00:58:53.739 --> 00:58:57.739
the amount of experience
that they have in this,

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:01.912
I would trust their judgment.

00:59:01.912 --> 00:59:04.072
All right, well I think we're at about the

00:59:04.072 --> 00:59:05.563
end of our time here.

00:59:05.563 --> 00:59:08.344
I'm so glad that you
took the time to join me,

00:59:08.344 --> 00:59:11.247
and I'm really rooting
for you on the exam,

00:59:11.247 --> 00:59:13.174
let me know how it goes.

00:59:13.174 --> 00:59:17.028
And again, if you have
any questions or concerns

00:59:17.028 --> 00:59:20.674
about the AP exam, check out
our Khan Academy resources,

00:59:20.674 --> 00:59:23.878
I read the comments in those all the time,

00:59:23.878 --> 00:59:27.083
so I will probably answer
you if you leave a comment

00:59:27.083 --> 00:59:29.753
on any of those articles or videos.

00:59:29.753 --> 00:59:33.306
And I also wanted to let
you know that we'll be

00:59:33.306 --> 00:59:36.347
doing another livestream pretty soon,

00:59:36.347 --> 00:59:39.505
and it will be in a
couple of weeks with our

00:59:39.505 --> 00:59:41.201
SAT tutor, Eric.

00:59:41.201 --> 00:59:45.284
So we'll be doing a live
SAT prep on SAT material

00:59:47.934 --> 00:59:50.186
in just a couple of weeks.

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:53.762
So thank you again so much,
good luck on the exam,

00:59:53.762 --> 00:59:56.095
and let me know how it goes.
