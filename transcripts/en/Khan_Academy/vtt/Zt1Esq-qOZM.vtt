00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.410
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.700
is talk a lot about money.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.780
And in particular,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.870
we're gonna talk about
the market for money.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.450
And this might seem a
little bit counterintuitive,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.320
because we're used to thinking

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.690
about the market in other things,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.290
and we use money as a
way to think about price,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.970
we use money as a way to
facilitate transactions.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.690
But now, the market is money itself.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.150
So the first question is,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.630
how do we somehow come
up with a cost of money?

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.780
And to help us with that,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.760
I'll give you a little bit
of a thought experiment.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.560
Let's say that we had a
very, very simple world

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.430
where you had two options.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.950
You could have your cash money.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.480
You could have a hundred
dollars in cash, just like that.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.030
Or, you could lend that hundred
dollars to the government,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.610
and the government would pay you back,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.550
in a month, 101 dollars.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.210
So your other option,
we'll call that a bond,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.090
a bond, which is really,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.800
you're lending in this situation,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.840
you're lending this
money to the government.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.440
Let's assume that it is risk-free,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.670
that the government is good for the money.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.730
You can also have bonds

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.780
where you're lending to other entities,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.090
like states, or to corporations.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.750
But let's say that this is
a federal government bond,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.840
and in one month,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.160
it costs a hundred dollars.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.990
It costs 100 dollars.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.483
And in one month, in one month,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.530
the government will pay back...

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.333
Government pays back 101 dollars.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.640
So my question to you is,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.190
if you decide, instead
of buying this bond,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.450
and then having the
government pay you back

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.920
in a month for 101 dollars.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.240
Instead of that, if you decide,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.400
'Hey, you know what,
that sounds interesting,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.410
'but I just like the feel of cash.'

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.563
What is the opportunity
cost of holding the cash?

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.020
Pause the video and think about that.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.760
Well, if you decide to hold this cash

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.060
instead of buying this government bond,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.950
instead of lending it to the
government for that month,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.380
you are foregoing one dollar.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.280
So your opportunity cost right over here,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.280
you could view it as one
dollar over the month.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.550
Or, if you think about it

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.560
in terms of how much money this is,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.980
you have a one-percent opportunity cost.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.900
Opportunity cost.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.940
And as we are about to see,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.410
we think about the opportunity cost

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.200
of holding the money as its cost

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.300
in the money market.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.520
So let me draw some axes here,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.440
to start thinking about this money market.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.440
Alright?

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.510
So let's call this vertical axis

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.367
the nominal interest rate.

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:49.367
Nominal interest rate.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.830
Sometimes you'll see
NIR, it's abbreviated.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.720
But we'll just write it out,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.020
the nominal interest rate in that axis.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.160
And the reason I'm focusing
on the nominal interest rate

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.440
is, we don't know, in this situation,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.760
what inflation is.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.870
We don't know how to calculate
the real interest rate

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.770
in this situation,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.060
and that's what people look at

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.360
when they're making these decisions.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.160
People aren't constantly
calculating the real interest rate

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.910
because they know
exactly what inflation is

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.320
in exactly that moment.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.210
They can just see,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.850
'Hey, I could either keep this
hundred dollars in my pocket,

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.523
'or I could lend it to the government

00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:23.590
'and a month later get 101 dollars.'

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.290
So we're gonna have the
nominal interest rate

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.130
on this axis, right over here.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.310
And then in the horizontal axis,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.680
I am going to have the quantity of money.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.010
Quantity of money.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.680
And there is multiple ways

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.580
of thinking about which
measure of money supply,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.110
and we're gonna think about
that in future videos,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.700
but we'll get to that in a second.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.040
The first thing I wanna do

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.040
is construct a demand curve for money.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.470
So let me ask you a question.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.990
If nominal interest rates are really high,

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.790
so instead of getting 101
dollars back after a month,

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.740
if you were to get, I'll
say something extreme,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.579
if you were to get 200
dollars back in a month,

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.270
would you want to keep a lot of money?

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.103
Or would you say,

00:04:11.103 --> 00:04:13.907
'Hey, no, I would rather lend
that money to the government.'

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.300
Well, yes, common sense would tell you,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.710
is if the nominal interest
rate is quite high,

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.140
then people will perhaps choose
to forego holding the money,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.610
and so the quantity of
money might be lower.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.200
So we might be in a situation like this.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.660
High nominal interest rate,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.380
hey, that's a high-opportunity
cost from holding this cash.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.080
I might wanna lend it to the government,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.020
or to somebody else.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.250
Now, what if the nominal
interest rate were really low.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.250
Let's say the government says,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.880
'Hey, you let me borrow a
hundred dollars right now,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.213
'in a month I will give
you a hundred dollars

00:04:49.213 --> 00:04:51.260
'and a tenth of a penny.'

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.093
Well then you're like,

00:04:52.093 --> 00:04:53.260
'Gee, that doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.510
'I would really like to
keep my hundred dollars.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.790
'I might need it,

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.980
'I might need to do some
transactions with it,

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.477
'I might want it to be around

00:05:02.477 --> 00:05:05.573
'in case the ATM system
goes out, whatever.

00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:08.450
'You know, there's a hurricane,
whatever it might be.'

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.790
And so at a low nominal interest rate,

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.100
it makes sense that
people would wanna hold,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.930
or more likely to hold their cash.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.810
And so you would have
higher quantity of money.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.400
And so that explains
why economists assume,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.710
often abbreviated as MD,

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.620
so this is the demand curve for money,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.810
is downward sloping.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.730
And if we wanted to get a
little bit more technical,

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.380
some terms that you might
see in an economics class,

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.190
the famous economist John Maynard Keynes

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.450
came up with three particular motives

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.430
for this downward-sloping curve,

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.380
some of which I've already talked about.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.100
The first he calls the
transactions motive.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.693
Transactions.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.490
And that's the idea that
one of the primary reasons

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.710
you would wanna keep cash is,

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.660
well, you might need to use it

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.310
if you wanna go buy a candy bar,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.600
or a buy a pet iguana,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.060
that you want that money around.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.520
If you have it lent to the government

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.570
and then all of a sudden
you see your dream iguana,

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.120
then you have to wait a
month in order to do it.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.430
So that would be your transactions motive.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.770
A reason, a motivation to hold money.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.250
But once again, the reason why we have

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.510
this downward-sloping curve is,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.150
if nominal interest rates are really high,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.690
if the government is willing to pay you

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.690
a lot back in a month, then you might say,

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.470
'You know what, I'm
willing to take the risk.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.140
'Even if I see that dream iguana,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.150
'if I lend the money
to the government now,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.750
'in a month, I might be
able to buy two iguanas,

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.920
'even if they aren't
quite my dream iguana.'

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.820
And likewise, if nominal
interest rates go really down,

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.653
you could say, 'Well you know what,

00:06:33.653 --> 00:06:34.904
'it's not worth it for me to risk

00:06:34.904 --> 00:06:38.380
'not being able to buy that
perfect iguana when it shows up,

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.340
'so I'm not going to lend
it to the government.'

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.250
And so the overall quantity of money,

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.840
more people are going to
keep cash in their pockets.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.870
Now another motive that Keynes talks about

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.763
is the precautionary motive.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.100
And this is the idea

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.500
that you might wanna just keep cash around

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.360
in case there's an emergency.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.530
Let's say the lights go
out, there's an earthquake,

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.090
there's a hurricane,
the ATM system goes out.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.510
Maybe there's a banking
holiday for some reason,

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.470
and you're going to need some
of that cash for transactions.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.280
But once again, it's more precautionary

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.820
for that rainy day.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.930
For that bad situation.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.330
And once again, if nominal
interest rates are high,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.270
then you might say, 'Well yeah,

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.770
'I wanna be cautious but boy,

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.150
'I could get a lot back
if I lend that money.'

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.590
But if your nominal
interest rates are low,

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.640
you're like, 'You know, it's not worth it,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.940
'I'd rather keep some more money.'

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.170
And a lot of people do this,

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.500
and so that's why, in
general, in that economy,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.720
you're going to have a
high quantity of money.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.130
Now the last motive
that Keynes talked about

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.283
is the speculative motive.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.650
And speculation in general is this idea

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.630
of buying something, or selling something,

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.010
or waiting to buy something

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.540
based on some speculation you have

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.860
about whether the price
will go up or down.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.580
And so, for example,

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.410
you might say, 'Hey, if
I wait a couple of days,

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.460
'or if I might wait a week,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.090
'the government might give
me an even better deal.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.870
'So let me hold onto this.'

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.710
And in aggregate, when
interest rates are high,

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.390
nominal interest rates are high,

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.890
people might be willing to
forego the ability to speculate.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.480
And when interest rates are low,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.410
they might say, 'You know what,

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.990
'I'm just gonna keep my cash for now,

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.480
'because there's not a lot to be gained

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.237
'by lending that money.'
