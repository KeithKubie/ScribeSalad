00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.230
DAVE OVERSTROM: Hey, everyone.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.189
My name is Dave Overstrom
from the Google Maps team.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.855
I'm down here in
lovely Atlanta, Georgia

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:12.550
with the Weather Channel for
the Code the Road Hackathon.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.034
CROWD: Storm the Road!

00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:16.605
Whoo!

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:17.980
CHRIS HUFF: Right
now, developers

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.740
are hacking upstairs, coming
up with innovative ideas

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.032
around safety and preparedness.

00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:23.614
CAMERON CLAYTON: As
you're presenting,

00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:25.700
always remember, what's
the problem in the market?

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.570
And then how does my
solution solve that problem?

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.880
MALE SPEAKER: We're trying to go
from idea to an actual runnable

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.250
app in 24 hours.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.670
It's a pretty hard challenge.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.300
MALE SPEAKER: I expect it to
probably get kind of crazy.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.160
CROWD: Aaron, Aaron!

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.312
[CHEERS]

00:00:40.312 --> 00:00:41.520
BRYCE: Hey, my name is Bryce.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.180
I just won the rock,
paper, scissors contest

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.620
at the Weather
Channel Hackathon.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.260
Puts you in a
unique environment.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.679
You're just in some random
room with a bunch of people

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:50.137
you don't know,
and you're supposed

00:00:50.137 --> 00:00:51.220
to come up with something.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.721
It's cool.

00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:54.178
MALE SPEAKER: I wrote a whole
bunch of code, and none of it

00:00:54.178 --> 00:00:55.280
made it into the project.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.620
JAMES MCGILL: Watching
those presentations,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.940
I would have bet any amount
of money that you had not,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.460
in fact, stayed up
for nearly 24 hours.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.526
MALE SPEAKER: Third place, EDS.

00:01:03.526 --> 00:01:05.009
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.467
FEMALE SPEAKER: My
team was working

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:08.930
on an Android mobile app that
helps with emergency delivery

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.300
services.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.169
MALE SPEAKER: Second
place, Watchtower.

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:13.960
MALE SPEAKER: When you
go somewhere abroad,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.020
language is a barrier.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.560
And that was really our
goal, to connect people

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.685
with the people who could
be the most help to them.

00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:20.854
MALE SPEAKER: First
place, Beforecast.

00:01:20.854 --> 00:01:23.270
MALE SPEAKER: We built pretty
much a calendar application.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.877
When you made an appointment,
it would tell you the weather.

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:27.335
So if you wanted
to go on a picnic,

00:01:27.335 --> 00:01:29.120
you would know if
it's going to rain.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.290
JAMES MCGILL: Getting to
judge these applications

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.110
and participate in this
event was worth every hour

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.633
of sleep I didn't
get last night.

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:38.706
Everyone, pat on the back,
congratulations, and well done.

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:42.794
