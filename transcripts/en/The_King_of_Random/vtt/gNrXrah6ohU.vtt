00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.150
What do you get when you combine parts from
an old battery pack with some common household

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.730
ingredients? Mix them together and you get
these .. A batch of super cheap, and easy

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.450
to make, smoke flares.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.769
Most hardware stores have recycling bins for
disposing of old batteries. That's where I

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.019
got this one for free. I'm going to start
by removing the screws, and these ones require

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.850
a torx bit, so once I've found the right size,
the 6 screws get removed and then with a little

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.479
wiggle, the top assembly pulls right out.
With that removed I've got access to the 15

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.499
cells that make up the battery pack, and I'm
gonna need to get them apart. So the tape

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:02.710
comes off and the connector bands are all
removed so that I'm left with a total of 15

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.170
sub C Ni-Cd batteries. They're just over 1
volt each and some of them are still good,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.250
but it's actually the casing that I'm after.
The battery easily pushes out now, leaving

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.390
me with a clean casing that should work great
for the body of my smoke flare. It even has

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.340
a flat bottom that will come in handy later
on. Ok, all the batteries are shelled, and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.210
I'm gonna use some cardboard for the next
step, but before I do, I'll pack these batteries

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.530
back into the casing, and send them back for
recycling. Alright, to finish these casings,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.600
I'll add a bead of hot glue to the flat part
on the bottoms, and press them down on the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.789
cardboard to cool down. That gets repeated
with all the other casings, and I'm leaving

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.789
a bit of a gap because these will need to
be cut individually later on. Now it's time

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.210
to make the composition that will give us
our smokey flare. I'm using 60% KNO3 stump

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.929
remover and 40% table sugar, being very careful
to not mix them too much. This is poured very

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.670
gently into a pan set on medium heat, and
I've made about 400 grams of the composition

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.499
in hopes that it will fill all the containers.
After a few minutes, I'll begin to fold the

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.999
mixture into itself because you can see the
sugar on the bottom is beginning to caramelize.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.289
I'll continue folding in gently until the
mixture has melted and absorbed all the white

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.600
powder, and at this point it should be runny
enough to pour into the casings. Ok I've readied

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.580
this casing, as well as a piece of home made
fuse cord that I made in a different project.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.110
Using a small spatula, the liquid is poured
into the casing, and the edge of the pan wiped

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.390
clean to prevent too much dripping. The last
step is to add the fuse, making sure to push

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.720
it all the way to the bottom, and now we can
let this cool until it hardens. The same thing

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.280
is done with all the others, and when they're
cooled and cut apart, the batch is complete.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.170
This is a fairly slow burning fuse and will
give me plenty of time to get away, so when

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.990
it's lit I'll watch from a distance to see
if our smoke fountain will work. Alright it

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.160
looks like it is working, and now here comes
the smoke. For it's size it actually puts

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.480
off quite a bit of smoke, burning for around
15 seconds, until all the fuel is used up.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.660
The casing is completely toasted as well,
but the cardboard base is intact, and its

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.880
prevented the concrete from getting any scorch
marks. Here goes another one, and you probably

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.280
noticed I'm doing this outside in an open
area. That's because there's plenty of ventilation

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.450
for when the smoke starts to get thick. You
don't want these going off in a confined area

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.270
because you can see how a thick smoke could
build and linger. Just for fun, I tried making

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.290
another batch with a 60% ratio of sugar to
see if it would burn slower. Unfortunately

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.230
it burned so slow it was painful to watch.
There was some smoke, but all in all, it kind

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.680
of looked more like one of those black snake
fireworks instead. Next I tried making a batch

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.620
where the ingredients were mixed together
extremely well, and experimented with various

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.680
home-made fuses. I even tried adding saw-dust
to see what that would do. Well it wasn't

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.580
a good idea. I think the sawdust added air
pockets that made them go completely ballistic.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.470
These were more like unguided rockets than
anything, because they burned so fast I couldn't

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.450
get them to stay still. So remember, to get
a nice balanced burn with plenty of smoke

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.430
like this, it's important that you have the
right ingredients, the right ratios, and the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.440
right mix. Every batch is a little different,
so be careful and be safe. Well there's the

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.940
technique I used for some cheap home-made
smoke flares. If you liked this project, perhaps

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.980
you'll like some of my others. Check them
