00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.436
[tense music]

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.340
[spray paint sound]

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.207
What are you doing?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.210
[muffled]

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.613
What's up is I thought we agreed
bike parades are stupid.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:15.848
[muffled]

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:16.982
Don't lie, Kenny!

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:19.252
You saw that Larry kid scoring
chicks with his bike,

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.920
heard about the cash prize,and
you decided to do the

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:22.255
bike parade behind our backs.

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.890
I know, 'cause I thought the
same thing!

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.324
Me too.

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:30.663
Jesus. Is this really what it's
come down to, you guys?

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:32.498
Whatever happened to us?

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.267
What do you mean?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.802
It used to always be the four of
us.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.336
Always.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.706
Now Stan's moved to a farm, I
have anxiety, 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.642
Kenny, nobody really talks to
Kenny,

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.310
and then there's just Kyle.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.413
We used to do everything
together.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.415
What if we did this like the old
days?

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:52.018
Four bikes. One common theme.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.020
We could totally own the bike
parade.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:54.821
Yeah!

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.089 line:92%
If we order everything online we

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.123
can have it delivered tomorrow!

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:58.858
we need props, pyrotechnics, the
works!

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.626
Yeah, and we gotta order some
badass spokes

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:01.860
and those wheel bumpers.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:04.230
I'll start looking for costumes.
What theme are we thinking?

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:05.798
Kenny, get on your moms laptop
and start ordering

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.033
streamers, sparklers and
rockets!

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.601
Make sure everyone ships next
day delivery

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.637
This is going to be just like
the old times, you guys.
