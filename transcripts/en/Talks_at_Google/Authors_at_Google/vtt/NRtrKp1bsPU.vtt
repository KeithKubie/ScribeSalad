[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.670
HARRY: I have to say I
personally believe that

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.700
the timing cannot be any better
to have Congressman John Lewis

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.300
here.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.970
With tensions in the
country running high

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.640
and individuals
looking for guidance,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.950
I believe Congressman John
Lewis is the perfect person

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.210
to hear from at this time.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.770
Congressman Lewis served as
chair of the SNCC or Student

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.400
Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.900
when he was a student at
Fisk, during the Civil Rights

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.240
Movement, and led
several marchings,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.180
including the march
across the Edmund Pettus

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.640
Bridge in Selma, Alabama,
which is known today

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.360
as Bloody Sunday.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.030
Serving in the United
States Congress,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.230
Congressman Lewis has
made his life-long goal

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.940
to fight for civil and
human rights for all.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.010
A true champion
for us all, please

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.095
welcome Congressman John Lewis.

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:55.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:04.390
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: Good morning.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.230
I'm delighted, very
happy, and very pleased

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.510
to be here at Google.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.620
Thank you so much.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.420
You look good.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.780
Thank you, Harry, for those
kind words of introduction.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.210
I'm happy and pleased to be
here with my co-author, Andrew

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.380
Aydin.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.610
It was his idea that got
me involved in this effort.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.875
And we're so grateful that
you ally two guys that

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:45.027
were born-- one born in
Atlanta, one in rural Alabama--

00:01:45.027 --> 00:01:45.985
to come from the South.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.780
Andrew would tell you that
I've been his congressperson

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.440
since he was only
three years old.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.220
So the people in Georgia
have been very good to me.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.430
Now I didn't grow up in
a big city like Atlanta.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.620
I grew up in rural Alabama,
50 miles from Montgomery.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.889
My father was a sharecropper--
a tenant farmer.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.500
But back in 1944 when I
was only four years old--

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.920
and I do remember
when I was four--

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.080
my father had saved $300.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.500
And with the $300 he
bought 110 acres of land.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.225
My family still owns
this land today.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.030
On this farm we raised a lot of
cotton and corn, peanuts, hogs,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.363
cows, and chickens.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.270
I'll be very frank and
very honest with you,

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.380
I didn't like working
out in the field.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.100
I didn't like being
out in the hot sun.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.370
And I did everything possible
to escape working in the field.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.340
I used to say to
my mother when I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.830
would fall behind picking
cotton or gathering peanuts,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.900
she would say, "Boy, catch up.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.880
You're lagging behind.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.030
Catch up."

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.280
And I would say,
"This is hard work."

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.505
And she would say, "Boy, hard
work never killed anybody.

00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:03.340
It won't kill you."

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.840
I said, well, it's
about to kill me.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.890
So during my early days
in school, especially

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.880
middle school, I would get
up early in the morning,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.640
pack my book bag and hide
under the front porch

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.640
and wait until the
school bus come along

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.940
to get off to school.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.730
Somehow I discovered that
education was important.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.750
Now you heard me say
it earlier that we

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.060
raised a lot of chickens.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.910
I know here at Google
you're just smart.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.580
I can tell.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.580
But do you know anything
about raising chickens?

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.180
You know something about
raising a chicken, brother?

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.920
AUDIENCE: Not much.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.090
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: Not much?

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
my grandmother's farm.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.420
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS: OK.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.175
Well, why don't we
compare notes here?

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.360
AUDIENCE: We used to go out
and grab the eggs [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.503
We were kids.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:57.370
We'd just run in there and
grab what we would want.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.494
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS: Oh.

00:03:58.494 --> 00:04:00.840
Well, let's just
compare notes here.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.210
And let's have fun here.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.710
Well, on the farm really
was my responsibility

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.240
to care for the chickens.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.410
And I became very good, really
good at raising chickens.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.100
When the setting hen was set,
I would take a fresh eggs,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.370
mark them with a pencil, place
them under the setting hen,

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.060
and wait for three long weeks
for the chicks to hatch.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.680
You may be saying,
"Now John Lewis,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.380
why did you mark those
fresh eggs with a pencil

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.600
before we placed them
under the setted hen?"

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.370
well, from time to
time, another hen

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.556
would get on that same nest.

00:04:32.556 --> 00:04:36.030
There would be some
more eggs-- fresh eggs.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.430
Had to wait until the fresh eggs
for the eggs that were already

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.623
under the setting hen.

00:04:40.623 --> 00:04:41.573
Do you follow me?

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:42.280
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.660
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS: OK.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.670
Good.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.372
When the little
chick would hatch,

00:04:45.372 --> 00:04:46.580
I would fool the setting hen.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.038
I would cheat on
their setting hen.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:52.590
I would take these little chicks
and give them to another hen

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.550
or put them in a
box with a lantern,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.155
raise them on their own.

00:04:56.155 --> 00:05:00.120
I was never quite
able to save $18.98

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.740
to order the most
inexpensive incubator

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.700
or hatcher from the
Sears and Roebuck Store.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.750
Most of you in here are so
young you don't know anything

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.980
about the Sears and
Roebuck catalog, do you?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.490
You really do?

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.020
Really?

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.950
That big book?

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.430
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: That thick book?

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.486
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: That heavy book?

00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:19.090
Some people called
it the wish book.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.020
I wish I had this.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.470
I wish I had that.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.030
So I just kept on
wishing as a little boy.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.160
But as a little child, I
wanted to be a minister.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.880
I wanted to preach the gospel.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.590
So from time to time to
helping my brothers and sisters

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.120
and cousins, we would
gather all of our chickens

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.875
together in the chicken
yard like you're

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:40.310
gathered here in this room.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.470
The chickens, along with
my brothers and sisters

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.050
and cousins, would make up the
audience, the congregation.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.717
And I would start
speaking or preaching.

00:05:47.717 --> 00:05:49.800
And when I look back on
it, some of these chickens

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.270
would bow their heads.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.720
Some of these chickens
would shake their heads.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.066
They never quite said Amen.

00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:58.607
But I'm convinced that some of
those chickens that I preached

00:05:58.607 --> 00:06:01.260
to in the '40s and
the '50s tended

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.660
to listen to me much better
than some of my colleagues

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.172
listen to me today
in the Congress.

00:06:06.172 --> 00:06:08.755
And some of those chickens were
just a little more productive.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.880
At least they produced eggs.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.720
So that's the chicken story.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.516
And that's enough of that story.

00:06:17.516 --> 00:06:19.515
But if we were to visit
the little town of Troy,

00:06:19.515 --> 00:06:24.285
or visit Montgomery, visit
Tuskegee, visit Birmingham,

00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:28.410
I saw those signs that said
white men, colored men,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.885
white women, colored women,
white waiting, colored waiting.

00:06:31.885 --> 00:06:33.900
And I didn't like it.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.980
To go downtown to the theatre
on a Saturday afternoon,

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.900
all of us little black
children had to go upstairs

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.100
to the balcony.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.300
All of the little white
children went downstairs

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.890
to the first floor.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.920
I would come home and
ask my mother, my father,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.342
my grandparents, my
great-grandparents why.

00:06:51.342 --> 00:06:53.050
And they would say,
that's the way it is.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.970
Don't get in the way.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.105
Don't get in trouble.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.410
But one day I heard
about Rosa Parks,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.130
15 years old in the 10th grade.

00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:06.310
I heard the words of
Martin Luther King, Junior,

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.040
on our radio.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.440
The action of Rosa Parks,
the words and leadership

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.880
of Dr. King inspired
me to find a way

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.560
to get in the way to get in,
what I called, good trouble,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.460
necessary trouble.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.550
So in 1956, at the
age of 16, with some

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.564
of my brothers and
sisters and cousins,

00:07:25.564 --> 00:07:26.980
we went down to
the public library

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.760
in a little town
of Troy Alabama,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.240
trying to get a library card
to check out some books.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.150
And we were told
by the librarian

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.625
that the library was for
whites only and not for colors.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:46.100
I never went back to that
library to that building

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.130
until July 5, 1998,
for a book signing

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.070
of my first book,
"Walking with to Wind."

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.337
And hundreds of black and
white citizens showed up,

00:07:54.337 --> 00:07:55.670
and they gave me a library card.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.220
It says something about
the distance we have come

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.535
and the progress we have made in
laying down the burden of race.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.605
I don't know how many of you
have heard of Troy University.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.450
It was called Troy State
when I was growing up.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.935
Only 10 miles from my home.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:20.330
Age of 17, 1957, I applied
to go to the school.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.340
Submitted my application,
my high school transcript.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.900
I never heard a word
from the school.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.640
So I wrote a letter to Dr.
Martin Luther King, Junior.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.160
I didn't tell my
mother, my father,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.960
any of my sisters or
brothers, any of my teachers.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.330
I told Dr. King I
needed his help.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.120
Martin Luther King,
Junior, wrote me back,

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.289
sent me a round trip
Greyhound bus ticket,

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.580
and invited me to come to
Montgomery to meet with him.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.149
In the meantime, I
had been accepted

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.940
at a little school in
Nashville, Tennessee.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.650
So in September,
1957, an uncle of mine

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.845
gave me a $100 bill-- more
money than I ever had.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.280
Gave me one of these
big foot-lockers,

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.570
these up-right trunks
that you can open up then

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.270
bring it back together,
that had to drawers

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.977
that you could put things in.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.040
And then a compartment
where you can hang-- Andy,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.850
you remember that foot locker?

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.940
I still have that foot locker.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.110
It's big and old.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.575
But I boarded that
bus-- a Greyhound bus.

00:09:21.575 --> 00:09:27.850
And I put everything that
I own in that foot locker,

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.040
except those chickens, and went
off to school to Nashville.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.210
And after being in
Nashville for a few weeks,

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.609
I told one of my
teachers that I'd

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:38.900
been in contact with Doctor
Martin Luther King, Junior.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.960
This teacher knew Doctor King.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.095
Both had studied at Morehouse
College, the same school

00:09:45.095 --> 00:09:46.590
that Harry Johnson studied.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.100
And he informed Dr. King
that I was in Nashville.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.870
Martin Luther King,
Junior, got in touch

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.460
and suggested when I went
home for Spring Break

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.480
to come and see him.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.240
So in March of 1958-- by
this time I'm 18 years old--

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.560
my father drove me to the
Greyhound bus station.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.615
I boarded the bus and
traveled to Montgomery.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.970
And a young lawyer--
I'd never seen a lawyer

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.680
before-- a young man by
the name of Fred Gray,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.780
who had been a lawyer
for Rosa Parks,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.295
for Dr. King, and the
Montgomery Movement,

00:10:22.295 --> 00:10:26.480
and became our lawyer during
the freedom rides and the march

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.510
from Selma to Montgomery,
met me at the bus station

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.210
and drove me to the
First Baptist Church

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.850
in downtown Montgomery,
pastored by the Reverend Ralph

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.656
Abernathy, and then ushered me
into the office of the church.

00:10:38.656 --> 00:10:40.030
I saw Martin Luther
King, Junior,

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.640
and Ralph Abernathy
standing behind a desk.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.040
I was so scared.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.050
I didn't know to
say or what to do.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.060
And Dr. King said, "Are
you the boy from Troy?

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.810
Are you John Lewis?"

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.360
And I said, "Dr. King,
I am John Robert Lewis."

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.060
I gave my whole name.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.630
And that was the beginning
of my involvement

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.325
with Martin Luther King, Junior.

00:11:01.325 --> 00:11:04.680
And it changed my life forever,
and I have not looked back.

00:11:05.961 --> 00:11:08.500
I had a discussion
with my parents.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.015
They were so frightened
when I got back home.

00:11:11.015 --> 00:11:13.240
They thought our
house would be bombed,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.635
that we would lose the land.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.050
And so I continued to
study in Nashville.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.400
So it was in Nashville
that we started

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.606
studying the way of
peace, the way of love,

00:11:22.606 --> 00:11:23.606
the way of non-violence.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.100
That we start sitting
in, be sitting there

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.020
in an orderly, peaceful,
nonviolent fashion,

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.690
waiting to be
served, and someone

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.540
would come up and spit on us
or put lighted cigarettes out

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.595
in our hair or down our
backs, pour hot water,

00:11:38.595 --> 00:11:41.180
hot coffee, hot chocolate on us.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.120
We just stayed there,
looking straight ahead.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.600
And Andrew Aydin will tell
you that the first time

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.590
I was arrested on February
27, 1960, just turned 20.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.150
He discovered, a few
weeks ago, a photograph

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.030
of my first arrest.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.920
In Nashville during the '60s and
many other parts of the South,

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.150
we wanted to sort of dress
up, put on our Sunday

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.110
best when we went to
participate in a protest.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.252
I didn't have much or any money.

00:12:18.252 --> 00:12:19.085
I wanted a new suit.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:26.170
So I went to used men's
store in downtown Nashville,

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.070
and I bought a suit.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:32.460
Now to tell you how much
a suit costs, it was $5.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.194
I wish I still had it.

00:12:35.194 --> 00:12:36.735
I don't know what
I would do with it.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.900
I just don't know what
I would do with it.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.770
But maybe I would give
it to some museum.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.450
Maybe the Smithsonian
or someplace.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.980
I don't know.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.810
But I looked good.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.650
If you come to Washington,
we have a photograph

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.060
of that suit and I
me being arrested.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.760
And you can see it.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.150
So I would invite
any of you who want

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.270
to be in Washington
any time to come

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.800
by my congressional office.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.520
It looks like a working museum.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.335
But we didn't give up.

00:13:09.335 --> 00:13:10.620
We didn't give in.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.430
We kept the faith.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.436
We kept our eyes on the prize.

00:13:15.436 --> 00:13:16.435
We didn't become bitter.

00:13:16.435 --> 00:13:18.440
We didn't become hostile.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.390
Many of us accepted the way
of peace, the way of love,

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:26.860
the way of non-violence as a
way of life, as a way of living.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:32.510
So during the '60s I was
arrested 40 times, left beaten.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.820
Just think, 1961, the same year
that President Barack Obama was

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.870
born, black people
and white people

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:44.810
couldn't leave together
on a bus or train

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:49.050
with white people seated
together traveling to the south

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.080
to Virginia through
North Carolina,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.217
through South Carolina, through
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,

00:13:55.217 --> 00:13:56.300
on our way to New Orleans.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.491
Many people came from
the state of California

00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:01.490
during the freedom riot.

00:14:04.569 --> 00:14:05.360
They came to Selma.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.755
50 years ago this summer,
many came to Mississippi.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.290
I'm going to cut it short and
leave some time for Andrew.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.430
But during the
March on Washington,

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.580
I was the youngest speaker.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.490
I spoke number six.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.470
Dr. King spoke number 10.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.130
There was 10 of us.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.980
Out of the 10 people
that spoke that day,

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.230
I'm the only one still around.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.230
When the March on
Washington was over,

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.790
President Kennedy invited us all
back down to the White House.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.120
He stood in the door of the Oval
Office greeting each one of us.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.962
And he kept saying he was
beaming like a proud father.

00:14:51.962 --> 00:14:53.420
He kept saying,
you did a good job.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.215
You did a good job.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.310
And when he got to Dr. Martin
Luther King, Junior, he said,

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.429
"And you had a dream."
it was my last time

00:15:01.429 --> 00:15:02.470
seeing President Kennedy.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:09.000
Those of us that organized
the march to leadership,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.395
we emerged black
and white as a circa

00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:16.215
of trust, a band of
brothers and sisters.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.520
But 18 days after the
March on Washington

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.900
was a terrible bombing of
the church in Birmingham

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.970
where four little girls were
killed on a Sunday morning

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.580
because of what happened.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.620
We intensified our efforts
to gain the right to vote.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.340
Just think, in a state
like Mississippi in 1964,

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.610
the state had a black
voting age population

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.680
of more than 450,000,
and only about 16,000

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.580
registered to vote.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.080
And there was one county in
a state of Alabama-- Lowndes

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.700
County.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.230
Between Selma and Montgomery--
the county was more than 80%

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.630
African American, but there
was not a single registered

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.540
African American
voter in the county.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:03.000
In some parts of the South,
in Alabama and Mississippi,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
people were asked to count
the number of bubbles

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.470
in a bar of soap, count the
number of jelly beans in a jar.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.200
The [INAUDIBLE] section
of the Constitution

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.390
of Mississippi or the state of
Alabama or the US Constitution.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.730
People were beaten, people were
arrested, people were jailed.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.860
Three young men-- Andy Goodman,
Mickey Schwerner and James

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.570
Chaney-- went out on a summer
night of June 21, 1964,

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:35.782
to investigate the burning of
an African American church,

00:16:35.782 --> 00:16:37.990
the church which would be
used for voter registration

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.200
workshop.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.760
These three young men were
detained by the sheriff,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.890
arrested, taken to jail,
and later that evening

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.940
taken out of jail,
turned over to that Klan

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.077
where they were beaten,
shot, and killed.

00:16:55.077 --> 00:16:57.660
These three young men didn't die
in the Middle East or Eastern

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.505
Europe.

00:16:58.505 --> 00:17:03.529
They didn't die in Vietnam,
Central South America.

00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:05.195
They died right here
in our own country.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.800
And that's why I say to young
people today and those of us

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.210
not so young, the
vote is precious.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.819
And a democracy such as
ours is almost sacred.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.940
And that's why we
all must participate

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.004
in the political process.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.530
President Lyndon Johnson signed
the Civil Rights Act of '64

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.490
on July 2.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:38.270
Dr. King received the Nobel
Peace Prize in December, 1964.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:42.010
He come back from Europe, hold
a meeting at the White House

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:46.120
and said to President Johnson,
we need a Voter Rights Act.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.749
President Johnson
said, I cannot do it.

00:17:47.749 --> 00:17:49.540
We don't have of the
votes in the Congress.

00:17:50.857 --> 00:17:51.815
I cannot get it passed.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.670
Dr. King made a
decision to go to Selma

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:02.100
and join the students in the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:02.600
Committee.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.300
In Selma, only 2.1% of
blacks of voting age

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.050
were registered to vote.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.730
You could only
attempt to register

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.282
to vote on the first and
third Mondays of each month,

00:18:13.282 --> 00:18:14.990
and you had to go down
to the courthouse.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.410
And in Selma you had a sheriff
who was a very big man, tall,

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.410
he was mean.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:22.200
He got up mean.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.890
He would sleep mean
and dream mean.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.800
He was just mean.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.860
He work a gun on one side, a
night stick on the other side,

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.730
and he carried an electric
cow prodder in this hand.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.185
And he didn't use it on cows.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.840
Many of us were arrested
by him for standing in line

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.460
and encouraging people to
stay in line and attempt

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.510
to get their literacy test
or attempt to pass their test

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.260
to become a registered voter.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:52.900
But on March 7, 1965,
600 of us attempted

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.860
to walk from Selma to
Montgomery, Alabama,

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.410
50 miles away, to dramatize
to the state of Alabama,

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.280
to the nation, and to the
world, that people wanted

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.175
to participate in a
democratic process.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.020
We were orderly.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.620
I was wearing a
backpack before it

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.030
became fashionable
to wear backpacks.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.990
And in this backpack
I had two books.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.570
I wanted to have
something to read in jail.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.380
I had one apple and one orange.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.150
I wanted to have
something to eat.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.702
Now one apple and one orange
wouldn't last that long.

00:19:24.702 --> 00:19:26.160
And since I was
going to be in jail

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.660
with my friends and my
colleagues and neighbors,

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.710
I wanted to be able
to brush my teeth, so

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.035
toothpaste and toothbrush.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.210
We get to the highest point
on the Edmund Pettus Bridge,

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.830
crossing the Alabama River.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.980
Down below we saw a sea of
blue Alabama State Troopers.

00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:45.125
Continued to walk.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.140
We came within hearing
distance of the state troopers.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.120
A major spoke up and said, "I'm
Major John Cloud of the Alabama

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.745
State Troopers.

00:19:54.745 --> 00:19:56.322
This is an unlawful march.

00:19:56.322 --> 00:19:57.780
It will not be
allowed to continue.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.600
I give you three minutes
to disperse and return

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.280
to your homes or
to your church."

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.230
A young man from Dr.
King's organization

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.530
leading the march with
me said, "Major, give us

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.350
a moment to kneel and pray."

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.725
And the major said,
"Troopers, advance."

00:20:13.725 --> 00:20:16.195
You saw these guys putting
on their gas masks.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.530
They came toward us, beating
us with night sticks and bull

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:24.167
whips, trampling us with horses
and releasing the tear gas.

00:20:24.167 --> 00:20:25.750
I was the first
person to be attacked.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.690
Hit in the head by a state
trooper with a night stick,

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.464
had a concussion at the bridge,
I thought it was going to die.

00:20:33.464 --> 00:20:34.380
I thought I saw death.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.930
Next year will be
the 50th anniversary

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.060
of the march from
Selma to Montgomery.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.640
Finally, we made it there.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:47.590
The next day, Dr. King
came and said to me,

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.830
"We'll make it from
Selma to Montgomery.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.695
The Voting Rights
Act will be passed."

00:20:51.695 --> 00:20:54.700
He issued a call for religious
leaders to come to Selma.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.760
On the following Tuesday, more
than 1,000 ministers, priests,

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.075
rabbis, and nuns came and
walked across that bridge.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.590
President Johnson made one of
the most meaningful speeches

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.940
that any American president
had made in modern time

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.450
on the whole question of
Civil Rights or voting rights.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.450
And the near the end
of that speech after he

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.720
had introduced the
Voting Rights Act,

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.430
he used the theme song to
the Civil Rights Movement

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.390
and he said, "And
we shall overcome."

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.000
I was sitting next to
Martin Luther King, Junior,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.650
in a home of a local family
there in Selma, Alabama,

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.990
as we witnessed and
listened to Lyndon Johnson.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:36.090
And when President Johnson
said, we shall overcome,

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.515
I looked at Dr. King.

00:21:37.515 --> 00:21:40.420
And tears came down this face.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.097
And we all cried
a little to hear

00:21:42.097 --> 00:21:44.555
the President of the United
States state we shall overcome.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:50.260
So because of the action
and the marching feet

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.445
of so many people, America's
a different America.

00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:55.050
It's a better America.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.360
We're not there yet.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.450
We still have a distance to go.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.665
But in the final
analysis, we all

00:22:00.665 --> 00:22:04.770
must keep in mind that we're
one people, we're one family,

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.200
we're one house.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.810
It doesn't matter whether
we're black or white or Latino,

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.230
Asian American or
Native American.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.896
It doesn't matter whether
we're straight or gay,

00:22:14.896 --> 00:22:17.600
we're all a member
of the human family.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.015
We must look out for each
other and care for each other.

00:22:20.015 --> 00:22:25.060
In closing I say thank you,
Google-- the Google family--

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.750
for all that you do to
bring this little spaceship,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.190
the members of the human
race, a little closer

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.620
together as one
people and one family.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:43.310
And now let me pause and yield
to my friend, my brother,

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.000
and someone acts
almost like he's

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.930
my son, Andrew Aydin,
the co-author on "March."

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.742
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:05.589 --> 00:23:07.130
ANDREW AYDIN: How
do you follow that?

00:23:12.084 --> 00:23:14.250
Perhaps some of you are
asking, why would John Lewis

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.240
write a graphic novel?

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.090
And it's a fair question.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.930
But what I hope to
tell you real quickly

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.310
is a story about how Dr. King,
himself, used one as well.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.010
When I was on the
campaign in 2008,

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.160
I was going to a comic
book convention afterwards.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.980
And I admitted it.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.865
I said it out loud
to my colleagues,

00:23:34.865 --> 00:23:36.790
and they laughed at me.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.369
And Congressman
said, "Don't laugh.

00:23:38.369 --> 00:23:40.160
There was a comic book
during the Movement,

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.462
and it was incredibly
influential."

00:23:42.462 --> 00:23:44.420
And right off the bat it
started a conversation

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.440
with me wondering why doesn't
John Lewis write a comic book?

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.550
Why doesn't he tell
his story because he's

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:53.180
lived so much of the seminal
moments of the Movement.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.400
If they used a comic book
once to help teach people

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.625
about nonviolence, why
can't we do it again?

00:23:59.625 --> 00:24:02.380
And at the same time I
went back to Washington

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.480
after this campaign was over.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.080
I went to grad school
at night and started

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.800
working on my graduate thesis.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.950
And I decided to write
about Martin Luther

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.540
King and the Montgomery
story-- this comic book.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.860
You might not know
it, because it

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.780
is sort of one of those
under-told stories,

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.255
but what we found out
was Dr. King edited it,

00:24:26.255 --> 00:24:28.791
it was endorsed by
A. Philip Randolph,

00:24:28.791 --> 00:24:30.290
and it was used
throughout the South

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.810
by people like Jim
Lawson, Congressman Lewis'

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.889
mentor in Nashville, to
educate and, in fact,

00:24:35.889 --> 00:24:37.430
inspire some of the
earliest sit-ins.

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.654
And so, it seemed almost
self-evident to me

00:24:42.654 --> 00:24:44.070
that perhaps we
could do it again.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.340
That we're facing
the same struggles--

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:53.510
we see police brutality,
attacks on voting rights--

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.300
how do we get a young
activist generation to step up

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.000
again and fight
that fight with us?

00:24:59.877 --> 00:25:01.710
There's three things
you need in a movement.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.395
You need financing.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.240
You need adequate
tools and strategy.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.790
And you need activists
willing to give everything

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:13.470
that they can.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.920
And it has to be young people.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.040
They're the most free.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.165
They're the most liberated.

00:25:19.937 --> 00:25:21.020
They don't have mortgages.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.890
They don't have families.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:22.765
They don't have kids.

00:25:23.487 --> 00:25:25.320
They're the only ones
who can put themselves

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.940
on the line as young radicals,
as they called the Congressman,

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.870
for believing simply that a
sixth grade education should

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:35.350
not be a requirement to
vote, as was proposed

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.780
in the original
Civil Rights Bill.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.470
So, when I asked the
Congressman why don't you

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.550
write a comic book, he
sort of looked at me

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.246
and said, you know, oh.

00:25:46.246 --> 00:25:47.465
Maybe a nod.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.500
But I kept asking and asking.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:53.670
And finally he said, OK.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.250
Let's do it, but only
if you write it with me.

00:25:57.596 --> 00:25:59.470
And it was one of those
challenges in my life

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.660
that you rarely get.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.020
And if you let it
go, you've missed

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.230
this incredible opportunity.

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:09.592
But more importantly, perhaps
missed your own life's mission.

00:26:09.592 --> 00:26:10.550
And I couldn't do that.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.390
I grabbed onto it.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.360
And for five years--
Harry knows this.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.570
He saw me at night and
on weekends-- worrying

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.160
about that dad gum comic book.

00:26:18.537 --> 00:26:20.370
Because that's when we
had a day job, and so

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.220
we were doing it at
night, on the phone,

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.390
when we could get together.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.690
And we put our heart
and soul into it.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:33.040
It grew from one book to three,
because what do you leave out?

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.010
Whose story don't you tell?

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.930
What key part of the
Civil Rights Movement

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:38.900
is not worth telling?

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.990
And low and behold,
it started to seem

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.344
like it was going to work.

00:26:46.344 --> 00:26:48.260
There were some surreal
moments along the way.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.590
One of them was I was on the
pilgrimage with the Congressman

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.280
and I get on an
elevator, and there

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.540
is Ethel Kennedy,
Robert Kennedy's widow,

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.620
and John Seigenthaler,
who was Robert Kennedy's

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.237
aid during the Freedom
Rides and later

00:27:00.237 --> 00:27:01.945
the publisher of the
National Tennessean.

00:27:03.651 --> 00:27:04.864
And this is a theme.

00:27:04.864 --> 00:27:06.780
Again, I was young and
didn't know any better.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.200
And so I asked.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.240
I said, I'm sorry to
bother you, but I just

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.120
thought you'd want to know.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.920
You're in a comic book
that I'm working on

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.795
with the Congressman.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.550
And Ethel Kennedy looked up at
me with these beautiful eyes

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.380
and she just said,
"That's nice dear."

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.990
So it was a tremendous thrill
when she called me about

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:30.100
a year-and-a-half later
to say that "March"

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.740
book one would be the first
graphic novel ever to receive

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.868
the Robert F Kennedy Book Award.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.860
The moment, though,
I think when we

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.360
knew that this book
was really going

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.940
to be something special,
that it was actually

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.510
going to work as a
tool for nonviolence

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.430
and teaching another
generation was right

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.185
after we had the first
advance copies out.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.865
And I got a phone
call from a reporter.

00:27:56.851 --> 00:27:58.350
And he said I don't
usually do this,

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.224
but I gave your book to
my nine-year-old son.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:04.567
And he's gone and put
on his Sunday suit,

00:28:04.567 --> 00:28:06.150
and now he's marching
around my house,

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.610
demanding equality for everyone.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.470
Imagine if we could develop
a social consciousness

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:14.886
in every nine-year-old
in America.

00:28:15.697 --> 00:28:17.530
What that would mean
for the next generation

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.980
and what they would be
capable of doing, particularly

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.350
if they were well-informed and
capable of using nonviolence

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.400
in a disciplined
and orderly way.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.590
It's not just a philosophy.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:27.820
It's a tactic.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.155
And it's the only tactic
that truly will work.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.385
There was a reviewer
in France, and he

00:28:37.385 --> 00:28:39.220
used a phrase that
stuck with me.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.265
He called it a weapon
of mass instruction.

00:28:49.234 --> 00:28:51.150
I never thought I would
be able to participate

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:52.530
in creating something like that.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.136
But as we stand here now, about
13 months after it's released,

00:28:57.136 --> 00:28:58.510
the Washington
Post said it needs

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.700
to be in every school
and library in America.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.050
NPR called it the next mouse.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:04.900
I called it beginner's luck.

00:29:07.426 --> 00:29:09.550
But it's because John Lewis'
story is so important.

00:29:11.412 --> 00:29:12.870
We see a generation
of young people

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.279
who don't know how to make
a difference sometimes,

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:18.070
and particularly, with
all the resources we

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.944
have with technology.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.130
And we have to teach
them that nonviolence

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.880
is the viable path forward.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:30.242
I handle tech and telecom issues
in the congressman's office.

00:29:30.242 --> 00:29:32.700
And I also do his social media,
so I'm basically head nerd.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.500
And we're taking over the world.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.647
We have to admit now, we
almost have a hegemonic state.

00:29:38.647 --> 00:29:39.230
We're winning.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.380
But what I'm constantly
struggling with

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.795
is the concept of
what would Dr. King

00:29:44.795 --> 00:29:47.335
or what would Gandhi have
done with these tools?

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.860
It's a profound question.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.205
And more importantly,
where is Google Organize?

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.540
Where is a Google March?

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.190
These technologies allow
people to be reached

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.656
in such a broad way that
we've never had access before,

00:30:07.656 --> 00:30:09.780
and we're just starting to
see the beginning of it.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.655
You think about the
Tahrir Square Revolution.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.160
I'll draw this
connection for you.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.721
It was Facebook that
helped them organize,

00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:18.970
but it was Martin Luther
King and the Montgomery story

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.269
translated into Arabic that was
distributed just before they

00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:23.060
started organizing.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.470
So we can connect those pieces.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.670
If we can get them
to ask the questions

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.920
and then use the
technology to organize,

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.070
the potential to remake
our society is limitless.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.714
And I think that's exactly
what you're trying to do here.

00:30:37.714 --> 00:30:39.880
So that's why I appreciate
you having us and letting

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.550
us bring "March."

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.920
Because we want to
be that first step,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.080
so that the young people
ask the questions,

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.390
and then they use your
tools to make it a reality.

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:51.890
So I'll be brief.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.723
I just thank you guys
so much for having me.

00:30:53.723 --> 00:30:54.960
This is a real thrill.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.410
I was in college and
started a television station

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.770
using Google Video
back in the day.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.830
So it's a real honor to be here.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.209
Thank you guys so much.

00:31:08.209 --> 00:31:11.702
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:13.604 --> 00:31:15.020
AUDIENCE: Congressman,
what really

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.970
struck me was the story that
you mentioned about your father

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:22.640
having been a tenant farmer and
buying the land for $300 that's

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.460
still in your family today.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.960
And when I think
about that, I think

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.190
about the incredible
upward mobility

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.430
that's afforded to
people and to families

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:34.540
by being able to go
from working just

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.097
for their monthly income to
actually generating value

00:31:37.097 --> 00:31:38.430
for themselves and their family.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.270
So my question for
you is what do you

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:43.530
see as the biggest opportunity
for the Federal Government

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.480
to help people who currently
are only living paycheck

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.244
to paycheck to actually
be able to develop some

00:31:49.244 --> 00:31:51.160
of that equity for
themselves and their family

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.115
for the long term?

00:31:52.115 --> 00:31:54.615
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS: Well,
I think the Federal Government

00:31:54.615 --> 00:31:57.880
needs to do more to help people
that have been left and left

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.340
behind.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:06.360
To make small loans available
with very low interest, maybe

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:14.260
in some instances
probably not any interest.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:19.146
People just need a little help--
just need a helping hand--

00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:21.343
to help make people a
little more independent.

00:32:23.144 --> 00:32:24.060
We don't do it enough.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:33.140
We should see that every
child receive the best

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:38.660
possible education, especially
in poor neighborhoods

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.485
in rural America.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.710
That's why I've taken
such a strong stand

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.370
for comprehensive
immigration reform.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:51.830
To help people move
up, and the people

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:58.530
will not live in a state
of want, a state of need.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.450
You know, we're one of
the wealthiest countries

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:09.330
on the planet, and we need
to use some of our resources

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:14.720
to help and not continue
to make more bombs

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.650
and missiles and guns.

00:33:17.197 --> 00:33:18.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:21.699 --> 00:33:22.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.380
Thank you, Congressmen
and Andrew, for coming.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.970
I'm actually going to Ferguson
at the end of the week

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.305
to support group there
called Amplify Ferguson.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.690
It's a team of media people
who are using technology

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.600
to give voices to the people
outside of this regular news

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.410
cycle, now that no one's really
focusing on people in Ferguson.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.870
I'm helping with some
civic engagement workshops

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:46.740
that they have on Saturday.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.570
I, myself, and not trained
in civic engagement.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.720
I just was really
drawn to this cause.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.880
And so I'm wondering
from you all, what

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.570
do you think about communities
like Ferguson and Ferguson?

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:00.120
What's missing there
in terms of how people

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.780
are using government
or getting involved?

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.300
Honestly, what would you
teach, if you were me,

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.894
when I go there this weekend?

00:34:07.894 --> 00:34:09.810
And what you think is
most effective for youth

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.320
versus adults in that community?

00:34:13.415 --> 00:34:15.540
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS:
Andrew may want to respond,

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.704
but I would say
prepare yourself.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.550
Before we've been on
any sit-in, the Freedom

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:26.080
Ride, the march from Selma to
Montgomery, the Mississippi

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.120
Summer Project, we studied.

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.280
And today there's all
type of literature.

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:36.409
Watch "Eyes on the Prize."

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:40.590
There's an NBC white paper that
came out many, many years ago,

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:44.889
which the late Chad Huntley
narrated the white paper

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:46.865
about the Nashville
sit-in story.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.310
And in the book you'll
see the do's and don'ts

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:55.245
Back then we didn't have
a website, Facebook.

00:34:57.419 --> 00:34:58.335
We didn't have Google.

00:35:00.567 --> 00:35:01.900
We need even have a fax machine.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:05.865
We had the old
mimeograph machine.

00:35:05.865 --> 00:35:09.285
But we used what we
had to change America.

00:35:09.285 --> 00:35:10.285
You have to be creative.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.630
I think in Ferguson
people have got

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:20.200
to become active in
the political process.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.570
It doesn't make sense
that so few people get out

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.240
and vote there.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.490
As I've said many, many times
to my colleagues and to people

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:33.040
all around the country
that the vote is powerful.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.059
In this precious.

00:35:34.059 --> 00:35:34.850
It's almost sacred.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.745
And we have to use it
to get things done.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:44.970
The more young people,
more minority, more women,

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:48.840
get out and turn
out-- all of us just

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:54.880
turn out and show up and cast
a vote-- we can remake America,

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.480
make it better for everybody.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.940
ANDREW AYDIN: I think
the most important thing

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.630
to keep in mind is
to look to our past

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:07.920
and see what worked before.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.160
I think it would be very helpful
if many of the organizations

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.326
there modeled themselves
after the Nashville Student

00:36:12.326 --> 00:36:14.390
Movement, which was
largely believed

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:16.950
to be the most
disciplined and orderly

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.450
of the individual
student movements.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.180
Read Emerson.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.520
Read Thoreau.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.290
Read Gandhi.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.940
Study nonviolence, because
the most important part

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.270
is the details.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.770
Right?

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:31.320
Where is the
statement of demands?

00:36:32.417 --> 00:36:34.000
Before they left on
the Freedom Rides,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.860
they mailed a specific letter
to the Attorney General,

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.450
to the President and the press
with their specific demands

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.991
for what they were
trying to achieve.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:42.210
Right?

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:45.400
There is a way that
has worked in the past,

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.860
and it's going to work again.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.459
We just have to make sure that
everybody knows how to do it.

00:36:50.459 --> 00:36:51.750
That's why we're doing "March."

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.375
That's why you should use Martin
Luther King and the Montgomery

00:36:54.375 --> 00:36:55.850
story or "March" or these tools.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:58.520
I mean, we're not
doing something

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.240
that hasn't worked before.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.331
And, as you look out there,
you see people who are thirsty.

00:37:04.331 --> 00:37:05.080
They want to know.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.646
They want to know
how do I do this?

00:37:06.646 --> 00:37:08.562
And we've just got to
get it into their hands.

00:37:09.732 --> 00:37:10.565
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:10.565 --> 00:37:11.730
And just so you know,
I'm going to try

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.155
to get some of these
books to give out

00:37:13.155 --> 00:37:14.050
while I'm down there as well.

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:14.390
ANDREW AYDIN: Great.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:15.130
Thank you.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:16.338
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS: Good.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.511
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:37:20.511 --> 00:37:21.260
Thanks for coming.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.760
My question is about
the forms of racism

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.580
that are a little bit
more harder to detect,

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.110
more insidious.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.220
So, I mean, there's
instances like Ferguson,

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.940
which are like forms of violence
that we can physically see.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.440
But there seems to
be like a lot of I

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.840
can call quote, unquote,
invisible racism,

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.120
structural conditions or
economic stratification

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.610
that makes life on certain
minorities very difficult.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:52.900
And so, how do things
like nonviolence,

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:57.220
per se, actually prevent things
like structural blockages

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.950
that prevent people from
voting in the first place?

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:03.920
And how do people like
us who are privileged

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.040
do something substantive
to actually help

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.790
people who are
structurally disadvantaged?

00:38:09.417 --> 00:38:11.375
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS:
Well, you have a voice.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:13.570
You're smart.

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:14.454
You have the ability.

00:38:14.454 --> 00:38:15.370
You have the capacity.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.840
You could use the
new technology.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.015
You could communicate.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.670
And you have to help
inform and educate people.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:30.700
When Martin Luther King, Junior,
would be preaching sometime

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:34.727
in Atlanta at his
father's church later when

00:38:34.727 --> 00:38:36.660
they co-pastored, he
would be preaching,

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.450
and his father would
say-- Daddy King,

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:41.010
we called him-- would
say, "Make it plain, son.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.180
Make it plain."

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.280
And he just kept
saying make it plain.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.090
I think you can
help make it plain.

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:52.980
People like to hide stuff-- like
to hide it in the dark corner

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.570
or some place under
the American rug.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:58.480
We have to help bring it out,
bring it out into the open

00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.660
into the light.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:06.150
So in a sense, why would members
of Congress and 200 citizens

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:09.150
go and deliberating
court getting arrested?

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:11.840
We want to put a face on it.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.730
We want to make it real.

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.880
We want to send it to
the Speaker of the House.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.140
You bring this
bill to the floor.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.630
The Senate passed it.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:21.480
We have the votes to pass it.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:26.970
So you have to help put
the spotlight on it.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.100
And just one day
will not necessarily.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.800
I tell people all the time
that the struggle is not

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.910
a struggle that
lasts for a few days

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.800
or a few weeks or a few years.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.770
It is a struggle of a lifetime
to create what Dr. King called

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:45.860
a beloved community or to create
an America community, a war

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.325
community at peace with itself.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:51.640
Be creative.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.770
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:54.186
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: Thank you.

00:39:56.992 --> 00:39:59.200
AUDIENCE: Just want to thank
you both for coming out.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.744
My question pertains to
sort of piggybacking off

00:40:01.744 --> 00:40:02.910
of other people's questions.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.710
We talked a lot about how
working at a place like Google

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:11.620
sort of empowers us to have the
ability to send out a message

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.810
or whatever about bringing
the country together

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.860
and all that stuff,
but Congressman Lewis,

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.660
you probably know
this better anyone,

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.630
I feel like within the past
10, 20 years has actually

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.260
become more fragmented,
the messages,

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.860
because before 20 years ago,
there was only three news

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.635
channels you could go
to-- ABC, NBC, or CBS.

00:40:30.635 --> 00:40:33.010
It had to be more centrist
view that was being displayed.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:35.020
It had to reach out
and appeal to everyone.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.457
Now with everything
fragmented you

00:40:36.457 --> 00:40:39.240
have your Fox News and your
MSNBC and your Drudge Report

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.520
and so on and so forth.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.250
Everyone is sort of
siloing themselves

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:44.690
in a particular message.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:48.060
There was a lot of reports
about the difference

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.790
in African American
responses to events

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.540
at Ferguson versus
white responses.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.230
And one of the key insights
into that was well,

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.953
the Caucasian Americans
mostly hang out

00:40:57.953 --> 00:41:00.490
with Caucasian Americans,
and therefore, only

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.370
reinforce the views
that they already had.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:07.290
And so, with that being said,
how, even though the technology

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:09.289
and opportunity
is there, it seems

00:41:09.289 --> 00:41:11.330
like it's being used for
the opposite of bringing

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.204
the country together.

00:41:12.204 --> 00:41:13.670
It's used to pull people apart.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:17.050
So, sort of, how do we actually
go about fixing those gaps

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:19.350
and those divides
given that everybody

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.870
has the opportunity
and the source to a,

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:24.700
find the true message, but
also listen to the message

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.370
that they want to
hear and sort of try

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.620
to reconcile both
of those facts.

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:31.640
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS:
Well, I've said to Andrew

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.100
and I've said to some of my
colleagues in the Congress

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.390
from time to time, I've
said in the Congress we

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:40.040
need to conduct some
nonviolent workshops.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.580
Just bring in members
of Congress together.

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.420
Because the American people
think we're so divided,

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.050
into a larger sense,
we are divided.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.620
So one of the things I've been
doing with an organization

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:54.100
called Faith and Politics
for the past 15 years,

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:58.600
taking members of Congress,
taking business executives,

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:04.570
taking students and others,
to Selma, to Montgomery,

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:07.910
to Birmingham, to meet
some of the people,

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:09.690
to meet some of
the foot soldiers,

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:13.180
to meet the family of the
four little girls that

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.600
were bombed and killed.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:20.895
To go-- and you have people,
Southerners, black, white.

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:26.995
You have people living in the
Midwest or the West Coast that

00:42:26.995 --> 00:42:29.650
have never traveled
in the South.

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:32.280
And they go and walk
through these churches,

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.740
through this historic
site, they meet people.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.190
And they'll change.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:43.860
Or to have someone who beat
you 50 years ago and then

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.717
come up or come to your
office in Washington and say,

00:42:47.717 --> 00:42:48.550
you know, I'm sorry.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.670
I want to apologize.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:52.650
Will you forgive me?

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:59.150
And to have a chief of police
in Montgomery, Alabama,

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:02.130
almost two years ago,
but more than a year ago,

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.430
a young guy who
was not even born,

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:08.550
said to me, "Congressman,
when you came here in 1961,

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.310
more than 50 years ago,
our police department

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:13.790
was not kind to you
and your colleagues.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:15.320
We withdrew."

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.710
He was not a police officer.

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:17.950
He was not even born.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:19.720
But he said we withdrew.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.440
We let our angry mark beat you.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.630
He said, but our police
department today is better.

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:27.412
Before anyone becomes a member
of this police department,

00:43:27.412 --> 00:43:28.870
they must know
something about what

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.570
happened in Montgomery,
what happened

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:32.960
in Selma, what
happened in Birmingham.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.890
He went on talking.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:37.320
This chief is white.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.830
His deputy is African American.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.960
The young deputy
didn't even know

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.990
the chief was going
to go down that road.

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:48.450
And then before it was over,
the chief said something like,

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:51.350
"Congressman, because
of my admiration for you

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:54.272
and your colleagues
of what you did,

00:43:54.272 --> 00:43:55.760
I'm going to take off my badge.

00:43:56.912 --> 00:43:58.980
I'm going to give it to you.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.430
I'm going to present
you my badge."

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:02.880
That's what he said.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.030
And I said Chief,
you can't do that.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:07.350
You the Chief of Police.

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:09.110
You need your badge.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:12.150
And the young African
American deputy lost it.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.850
He just started
crying, because he

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:15.860
didn't know his chief
wasn't going to do that.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:20.060
And then the whole audience,
even members of Congress,

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.720
Democrats and Republicans,
black and white, Latinos

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.030
and Asian Americans, all
sitting there crying.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.910
So sometimes we
have to find ways.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:35.540
Sometimes it may not
intention, but it

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.710
tends to reach people and
catch them in the gut.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.854
ANDREW AYDIN: And,
you know, that's not

00:44:41.854 --> 00:44:44.020
a question that wasn't asked
during the Civil Rights

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.304
Movement.

00:44:45.304 --> 00:44:47.470
When Dr. King wrote a letter
from a Birmingham jail,

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:49.120
there were whites in the
community who said, you know,

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.230
why are you agitating now?

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:51.270
Why are you doing this?

00:44:52.274 --> 00:44:54.440
And there were differing
perspectives based on race.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.080
But I think what
we need to do today

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.830
is we need to look at
some of these issues

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:02.100
where they stretch clear
across racial boundaries

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.666
and are, in fact,
these social depression

00:45:05.666 --> 00:45:06.915
mechanisms like student loans.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.990
I mean, you've got a generation
of young people growing up

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:12.860
with more debt than
they ever have.

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:16.500
And he Federal Government is
profiting off of those loans.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.490
And they're using that
money to pay for war.

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:19.365
And that's not right.

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.360
But I think if you started
off and found a common ground

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.420
like that that stretches across
all groups that are suffering

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.340
from it, and you did as
LBJ told Martin Luther

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.420
King to do in the
winter of 1964,

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.092
and make Congress do
something about it.

00:45:34.092 --> 00:45:35.300
If they all organized around.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.000
At UC Occupy, they paid
down $4 million in debt.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.690
Let's make Congress pay
down $4 billion in debt.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:43.440
And then find that
common ground,

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.680
and then build from there.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.520
You really could change things.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.530
But you've got to find
that common ground.

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:50.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:45:54.436 --> 00:45:55.799
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:45:55.799 --> 00:45:57.590
Congressman John Lewis,
I thank you so much

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:00.460
not only for being here, but
for everything that you've done,

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.230
which has allowed me to be here.

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:06.140
And Andrew, as a former
middle school teacher,

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.150
I thank you for
creating something

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.810
which would be so relevant
and so easily accessible

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:12.870
for my former students.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.500
So, since we are here
at Google and thinking

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:19.837
through like for
my students, I'm

00:46:19.837 --> 00:46:21.420
thinking through the
lines of my kids.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.060
Like, this is great.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:28.800
However, it may not be the
most accessible for them, just

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.950
buying books, et cetera.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.800
What is Google's response,
or what would you

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.660
want Google's responsibility
to be in creating a platform

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.140
or sharing the miniseries
that you have created?

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.670
And also, what are your
plans for other books

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:43.917
for capturing our history?

00:46:43.917 --> 00:46:46.000
ANDREW AYDIN: Well, so
this is just the first one.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.500
Right?

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.030
And each one has a
different lesson.

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:51.040
This first one was to introduce
nonviolence as a tactic.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.561
The next one we
deal with how you

00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:54.060
make a movement a
national movement.

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.095
That's what the
Freedom Rides did.

00:46:56.095 --> 00:46:57.720
And then how you deal
with that once it

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.080
does get on the
national stage, which

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.740
was the March on
Washington, and how

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.448
you deal with the
response from it, which

00:47:02.448 --> 00:47:04.990
is the bombing of the church
and the death of the four

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:07.800
little school girls
on September 15, 1963,

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.161
just three weeks after
the March on Washington.

00:47:10.161 --> 00:47:10.660
Right?

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.020
You know, the way I think
Google should be participate

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.725
in this is sharing information.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:23.310
I don't think people adequately
understand how much governance

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:25.889
goes on at the local
level around them.

00:47:25.889 --> 00:47:28.180
Imagine if you just had a
database where you could just

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.013
simply look up this is
where I live and this

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.920
is what I care
about, and then you

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.290
saw every local meeting that
was happening around there.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:36.360
And how the legislation
or the bills that they

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.920
were considering was
made plain, and it

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.962
was shown to each person.

00:47:39.962 --> 00:47:41.503
And then they could
go to the meeting

00:47:41.503 --> 00:47:43.003
and have their
opportunity to speak.

00:47:43.003 --> 00:47:43.502
Sure.

00:47:43.502 --> 00:47:45.440
You'd frustrate some
county local officials.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.260
The meetings would
go a little longer.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.390
But that's what
they signed up for,

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:49.931
and that's what they
should be doing.

00:47:50.254 --> 00:47:51.920
And if a middle
schooler, of all things,

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.440
shows up and says I still
think that's not right,

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.670
I dare an elected official
to argue with them.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.520
You've got so many resources.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.600
And information,
above all else is,

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.790
is the most important thing.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:06.460
Make this society more informed.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.370
Let them know what is going
on in their community in a way

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:12.150
that, as Daddy King says, as
the Congressman has pointed out,

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:13.459
makes it plain.

00:48:13.459 --> 00:48:15.250
And we'll keep doing
the books to show them

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:17.590
the history and the
tactics that were used,

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.860
and you give them the
information and the tools

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.394
to do it again.

00:48:21.394 --> 00:48:22.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.196
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: Thank you.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.190
AUDIENCE: Congressman
Lewis, Mr. Aydin,

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:29.564
thank you so much
for being here.

00:48:29.564 --> 00:48:31.360
Congressman, it's
such an honor to hear

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.000
you speak and have you impart
these lessons from history that

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.450
still impact us
definitely today.

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:39.570
My question has to do
with a couple things.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:43.210
The first part is that in light
of the events of Ferguson,

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.920
as we've discussed,
in the reports that

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.310
show that literally hundreds
of African Americans,

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:50.190
specifically, are
targeted because of race

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:53.500
and unjustifiably killed, and
these actions go unprosecuted.

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.840
And as you spoke of
the Voting Rights Act,

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.390
the Supreme Court recently
struck down Section Four, one

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:02.690
of the most important
aspects and most

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.670
of the important
enforcing aspects

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:06.350
of the Voting Rights Act.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:10.850
In light of these
steep, backward steps,

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:12.900
as what I would
see them, happening

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.980
in our modern day in
our day of progress,

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.140
and in light of all the
media attention around it,

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.510
in light of technology
used to raise awareness

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:23.080
about these issues-- there are
literally millions of tweets,

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.360
thousands of articles about
these issues all the time.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:29.830
In light of all of that, we
see very little reform and very

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:33.120
little structural change
despite this awareness.

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.200
So in your mind and what
you've seen in your experience?

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.300
What is that missing link
between awareness and action

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.410
and actual reform?

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.270
My second part to
that is, in my mind

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:49.052
I see our elected officials
and the federal government,

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:50.510
our agencies, and
state governments

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:53.650
in those attendant structures
as that middle link

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.790
between the public and
reform, legislative reform,

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:57.650
what have you.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:03.590
Are you seeing any progress in
those fronts in your position

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:05.980
as an elected
official in Congress

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:09.200
that can give us hope that maybe
this action, this awareness,

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.110
will actually result in
some structural progress?

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.980
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: Well, I truly

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.915
believe that the
vote is powerful.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.410
I was in the chamber
when the Supreme Court

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:32.205
debated and considered
the Voting Rights

00:50:32.205 --> 00:50:34.500
Act, section four.

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.840
And when that decision came
down I felt like crying,

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.890
but I wouldn't cry.

00:50:40.647 --> 00:50:41.730
It meant everything to me.

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:45.650
I gave a little blood on that
bridge for the right to vote.

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:46.560
Almost died.

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:50.630
And I think there are
forces in America that

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:52.255
want to take us back
to another period.

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:58.780
But there are also forces must
speak up and speak out and say

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.030
we've made too much progress
and we're not going back.

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:05.500
The struggle is an
ongoing struggle.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.825
You know, Ferguson
was a few weeks ago.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.640
And we're not there,
but we will get there.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.770
That's why this election
is so important.

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:18.885
It is a must.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.910
If we fail to turn
out all-- I don't need

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:26.440
to say this to people
in California--

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:31.150
but in some other parts of
America-- we fail to turn out,

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:32.630
then we can go backwards.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:35.445
And we must continue
to go forward.

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.940
And put people in places
where they will speak up

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:41.610
and speak out and organize.

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:43.815
I've said it all
along that I think

00:51:43.815 --> 00:51:45.190
the America people
are too quiet.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.725
Just too quiet, too complacent.

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:56.170
If this is 1960 or 1965, there
would be hundreds of thousands

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.040
of people in the
streets of America.

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:04.305
After the beating of us
in Selma on March 7, 1965,

00:52:04.305 --> 00:52:09.052
there were major demonstrations
in every major city in America,

00:52:09.052 --> 00:52:13.210
on 80 college
campuses, overnight.

00:52:14.781 --> 00:52:16.320
It happened on a Sunday.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.030
By that Tuesday
people were sitting

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:22.730
in the White House, the
Department of Justice.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.430
Even the President said his
children couldn't sleep,

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:28.060
his two daughters
couldn't sleep,

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:30.298
because people were singing
"We Shall overcome."

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:37.880
We have to get out there again
and push and pull and have

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:38.755
some created tension.

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:43.609
So I-- you have to
go out and organize.

00:52:43.609 --> 00:52:44.150
I don't know.

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:47.400
If we didn't have
what you have today,

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.050
I don't know what we would
have been able to accomplish.

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:54.440
We got to use these tools,
use these instruments,

00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:58.875
use the information,
to recreate America.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:01.960
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:05.304 --> 00:53:06.970
AUDIENCE: Congressman,
Andrew, thank you

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:09.080
both for your life of service.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.060
My name is Seth Marvin.

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.690
I work here on the
Googlers Give Team.

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:14.590
And we help employees volunteer,
and give away their money.

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:17.972
And I used to work at
City Year, and I thank you

00:53:17.972 --> 00:53:18.680
for your service.

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.660
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS:
I'm a City Year jacket.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:20.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:23.200
You're an incredible supporter
of City Year and National

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:23.550
Service.

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:24.520
So thank you for that.

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:29.480
In the spirit of City
Year, we carried backpacks,

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.504
we wore a uniform.

00:53:30.504 --> 00:53:31.170
And I'm curious.

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:34.390
You mentioned the backpack
that you wore over the--

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:35.715
in the March over the bridge.

00:53:35.715 --> 00:53:36.840
I've been over that bridge.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.077
It's amazing to sort of
walk in your footsteps

00:53:39.077 --> 00:53:40.910
and see what you've
been able to accomplish.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:41.840
But I'm curious.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.320
What would you put
in your backpack

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.837
today if you're going
out to lead that march?

00:53:45.837 --> 00:53:47.920
And Andrew, for you, I'd
love to hear more about--

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:48.780
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS:
What instruments would I

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.890
have, Andrew, in that backpack?

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:52.490
AUDIENCE: What would be in that?

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:54.260
You mentioned an apple,
an orange, a couple books.

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:55.690
What would be in
that backpack today?

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:57.564
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS:
Well, you know, back,

00:53:57.564 --> 00:54:01.540
growing up the way I grew up,
we didn't have a telephone.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:05.670
We didn't have a subscription
to a newspaper we were so poor.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.800
But my grandfather had one.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:13.830
And each day when he would
finish reading his newspaper,

00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:16.890
we would get his
newspaper and read it.

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:20.100
Some of our neighbors had,
what we called party line.

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.234
I would have a telephone
in that backpack.

00:54:23.234 --> 00:54:24.525
I would be able to communicate.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:30.290
And probably have maybe a
small computer or something.

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:36.270
And Andrew would teach
me all of the way.

00:54:38.484 --> 00:54:39.025
He's the man.

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.330
Andrew what would you
advise me have in it?

00:54:44.539 --> 00:54:46.830
ANDREW AYDIN: I think you
just need a phone these days.

00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:47.060
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS: Yeah.

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:47.760
Just a phone.

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.260
ANDREW AYDIN: Can
start a revolution

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:50.415
with this little device.

00:54:50.415 --> 00:54:52.290
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS:
But to be very frank,

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:54.710
I wish I had the backpack back.

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:57.444
People ask me all the time,
what happened to your backpack?

00:54:57.444 --> 00:54:58.860
What happened to
your trench coat?

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.230
People from the Smithsonian,
from the Library of Congress.

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:06.509
We don't know what
happened to it.

00:55:06.509 --> 00:55:08.300
AUDIENCE: And Andrew,
I'd love to hear more

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.160
about the tools
that you mentioned,

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.260
Google Organize
and Google March.

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:13.760
If you can answer
any more specifics

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.040
on what those might look like.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.750
What are we missing
at this point?

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:19.326
ANDREW AYDIN: So, when
w get on social media,

00:55:19.326 --> 00:55:20.700
the message can
spread like that.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.440
We did the mug shot Tweet
a couple months ago,

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.290
and it was like 50,000
re-Tweets, because we

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.915
were so shocked that it
was only 53 years ago

00:55:27.915 --> 00:55:30.750
that somebody went to
Parchment Print Prison

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:32.270
for using a white restroom.

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:34.160
Right?

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:37.900
These tools need to dramatize
these same struggles that

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:38.950
are going on today.

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:46.320
I think when we shine a bright
light-- the world light,

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.950
if you will-- on to some
of these injustices,

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:53.530
then people are much
more willing to act.

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:56.830
But above all else, we've
got to get people to show up.

00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:58.510
We've got to find
a way to get people

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:00.210
to let their presence
be their voice.

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.800
We have a generation
now who's almost

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.945
bordering on becoming
armchair activists.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.010
They post things and
they come complain

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:11.174
that they think it's wrong,
but when it comes down

00:56:11.174 --> 00:56:12.590
to showing up and
putting pressure

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:14.500
on your elected officials,
because let's be honest,

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.666
most people in Congress
don't move without pressure.

00:56:17.602 --> 00:56:19.060
It's been that way
for a long time.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.309
It's not new to this Congress.

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:23.040
You have too few John Lewis's.

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.504
And so we have to get
people to show up.

00:56:26.504 --> 00:56:28.420
That was the point of
the March on Washington.

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.119
And look how well it worked.

00:56:30.119 --> 00:56:31.910
Maybe it sparked a
backlash, but in the end

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:34.270
it dramatized and helped
continue the efforts.

00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:37.020
More importantly, look at the
Mississippi Freedom Summer.

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.960
Schwerner, Chaney,
and Goodman died

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.660
so that we could have a Civil
Rights Act and a Voting Rights

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:43.680
Act.

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.200
These people showed up.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.160
They went to schools.

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.210
They educated themselves.

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:48.480
They organized.

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.320
So we have to make a
way to put these tools

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.770
in the hands of everybody.

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:55.780
First the lessons of
nonviolence, the history

00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:59.370
of nonviolence, how it was
used successfully, and then

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:02.590
take it to that next step
and help people show up.

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:03.835
Help people mobilize.

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:09.820
It was just a few weeks ago that
we had a college student put

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:13.960
out a Tweet with a hashtag that
garnered 3,000 people marching

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:16.760
through the streets of
Atlanta in solidarity

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:18.500
of Ferguson, including
Congressman Lewis.

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:19.570
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS:
And so many people

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:21.040
thought I was there.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.090
They thought I was at Ferguson.

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:28.610
They saw me walking it in
the march, holding up my arm.

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.350
But that's--

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:33.305
ANDREW AYDIN: No.

00:57:33.305 --> 00:57:34.580
And getting people to show up.

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:35.788
But I think also information.

00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:39.110
We don't understand
and we don't fully

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:41.160
appreciate how much
governance actually

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.840
happens at the local level.

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.340
Right?

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.190
I mean, we're fighting
a fight right now

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:47.570
to get people
registered to vote.

00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:50.800
And that's a local decision
first, at the county level

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.430
and then at the state level.

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:54.410
So how do you pressure
a Secretary of State

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:57.100
to recognize valid
voter applications when

00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.764
they know that it will mean
that they will lose an election?

00:57:59.764 --> 00:58:01.680
How do you pressure your
county-wide officials

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:04.340
to make it easier to
register and vote?

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:05.720
Right?

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.580
I mean we all vote on a Tuesday
and nobody gets the day off,

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:10.730
and we say everybody has
the opportunity to vote.

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:13.820
But the fact is that
most people have a job.

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.520
And they're tired
when they get home.

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.330
And they have to be into the
polling place by 7:00 o'clock.

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:20.220
I never get home
by 7:00 o'clock.

00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:22.410
But Congressman
Lewis says take time.

00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:23.550
Go vote.

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:24.330
Right?

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:26.190
We should make it
a national holiday.

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:28.690
We should press our Congress
to make it a national holiday.

00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:31.320
We should make voting as easy
as drinking a glass of water.

00:58:32.016 --> 00:58:32.515
Sorry.

00:58:32.515 --> 00:58:33.380
I stole your line.

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:34.796
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: That's OK.

00:58:35.574 --> 00:58:36.840
That's OK.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.589
AUDIENCE: Thank you
both for your service.

00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:39.589
ANDREW AYDIN: Thank you.

00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:47.180
AUDIENCE: I either have
1,000 questions or none,

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:49.020
but I wanted to say
thank you so much

00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.840
for what you've done for all
of us, because none of us

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:53.730
are free unless we're all free.

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:58.140
And I'm old enough-- I
was a young teenager when

00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:59.730
you were marching
on that bridge,

00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:01.462
and I remember seeing
the news stories

00:59:01.462 --> 00:59:02.670
and not really understanding.

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:07.880
And just thank you very
much for your courage

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.330
and all your efforts
on behalf of all of us.

00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:11.773
Thank you.

00:59:11.773 --> 00:59:15.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:21.555
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
Congressman Lewis and Andrew.

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:25.800
So one of the things, I
feel, of my generation

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.300
is that we actually
feel the vote is

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:30.440
a pretty ineffective tool
for getting our voices heard.

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:35.230
And given that we're in Silicon
Valley where you see technology

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:39.300
playing a role to do more than
just spreading information

00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.350
as in like being sort
of armchair activists

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:46.200
and being able to play a role
despite having a full time

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:51.390
job, what are the things you
think that, as technologists,

00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:53.459
we can all do to
create more impact?

00:59:53.459 --> 00:59:55.000
ANDREW AYDIN: Well,
I think it's time

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.650
for us to start the conversation
about online voting,

00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:01.250
online voter registration,
and making it national idea.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:08.420
It's oftentimes antiquated
rules with a cumbersome way

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.190
of doing it to get
people to show up.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:12.930
And we make it too hard.

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:14.120
We have all this technology.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.470
We should find new ways to
use it in the voting process.

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:20.320
It can be secure if
we work hard enough.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.960
If Diebold can advocate
for using electronic voting

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.510
machines in their
election, then perhaps it's

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:33.310
time for us to look
at it for everybody

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:35.832
online as opposed to
just the touch screens,

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.790
because there was so much
controversy with that

01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:38.748
that they supported it.

01:00:38.748 --> 01:00:40.770
But I think there's
a flip side of that.

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.696
We can't advocate
that until everybody

01:00:42.696 --> 01:00:43.820
has access to the internet.

01:00:45.014 --> 01:00:46.430
I think it's time
for us to call--

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:48.260
are you familiar with
the lifeline program?

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:48.650
AUDIENCE: No.

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:50.358
ANDREW AYDIN: It's
something the FCC does

01:00:50.358 --> 01:00:53.600
so that folks who live
below the poverty line

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.390
can have access to a cellphone.

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.930
Right?

01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:59.750
I think we need to expand
that to include data

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.190
so that everybody can have
access to information.

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:05.300
If you're poor, if you're
under the poverty line,

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.950
you just get a phone
with data on it.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.820
That's how people get
their information.

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.570
How are we expecting
people to be informed

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.650
if we don't give them
the tools to be informed?

01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:16.220
We're cutting library budgets
at a record pace, which

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.720
used to be the only
place they could

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.240
get free access to the internet.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.990
So we're going to take
it away from there.

01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:23.630
We've got to push to give
it to them somewhere else.

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:25.650
And, I think, part
of it, too, is

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:28.750
that you're not going to
fix everything in a day.

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:31.480
And we're going to have to find
small things to build momentum.

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.729
So if it's expanding
the lifeline program

01:01:34.729 --> 01:01:37.020
to include data for folks
living under the poverty line

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:41.780
and giving everybody access to
a phone with data, so be it.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.430
It's better to spend
our money on that

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:44.513
than to spend it on bombs.

01:01:45.602 --> 01:01:47.260
AUDIENCE: I think
all of us can agree.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.330
ANDREW AYDIN: Yeah.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:49.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:56.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Congressman
Lewis, for coming, and Andrew.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.640
My question is about
truth and reconciliation.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.820
I know that a lot
of the problems

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.560
here are between
different people

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.130
having-- they have different,
conflicting views about what

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:10.220
really happened.

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.010
And I think that people are
afraid to step forward and say

01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:15.730
what happened in the '60s, what
happened with the lynchings,

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:20.860
and so there's this distrust
that kind of continues on.

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.080
So what are your
thoughts about that?

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.360
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: I believe deeply

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.560
that's why we must move as
a people and as a nation.

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:34.800
There's still a lot
of hurt and pain.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:41.150
I know individuals in
African American community.

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:45.760
The book came about
lynching, a small book.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.220
It was an exhibit in
different parts of America.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:54.350
People I know in African
American community

01:02:54.350 --> 01:03:00.520
couldn't go to the museum or
to a church or to the school.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.490
And there was some colleges
and universities in this South

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:05.600
were afraid to display it.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.230
They thought something
would happen.

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:09.900
But we need to face the truth.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.750
It did happen.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.780
It did happen.

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.580
So you cannot hide it.

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:16.880
Face it.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.890
And I think South
Africa has one up on us.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:26.175
They did a better job of
bringing people together.

01:03:26.665 --> 01:03:28.040
And that's what
we've been trying

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.600
to do on a limited basis in
parts of the American South,

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.125
in Alabama, when we
go back to Montgomery

01:03:34.125 --> 01:03:36.760
and to Selma and to Birmingham.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:42.700
Let people-- the people
that was on the other side,

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.770
black and white-- let
them come together.

01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:48.595
I've gone back to Birmingham
on some of these trips,

01:03:48.595 --> 01:03:51.540
and on one occasion
when I was back there,

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.960
a white gentleman
said, middle-aged,

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.610
said I want to
speak to John Lewis.

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.680
And someone said
he's right here.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.350
And he said, Mr. Lewis, I
want to apologize to you

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:08.935
on behalf of all of the
white people of Alabama

01:04:08.935 --> 01:04:09.984
for what we did.

01:04:12.454 --> 01:04:14.770
We need to get there.

01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:16.610
People in the
Congress, we're afraid.

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:18.155
We're afraid to
issue an apology.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.450
The Congress, the National
Assembly of the United States

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:28.972
of America is afraid to say
we're sorry for slavery,

01:04:28.972 --> 01:04:31.540
we're sorry for the
system of segregation

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.780
and racial discrimination.

01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:36.060
So that legacy is still there.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.103
It lingers.

01:04:37.103 --> 01:04:40.047
AUDIENCE: And how it affects
today and what's going on today

01:04:40.047 --> 01:04:40.880
and how it connects.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.296
I think a lot of
people don't make

01:04:42.296 --> 01:04:48.340
that connection between slavery,
racism, post-reconstruction,

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.955
and what's happening in our
cities today, and Ferguson.

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:54.080
I think people just don't
make that connection.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.922
Also, I want to say
that there's definitely

01:04:55.922 --> 01:04:58.130
people who are willing to
stand up because, you know,

01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:59.950
Occupy was amazing.

01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:01.780
I was totally blown
away that they

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:04.350
were able to get so many people
together across the city.

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:08.890
I think they probably lacked a
message or a concrete message.

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:11.180
And also, I just want
to say thank you.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.270
I know I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.890
So thank you.

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:15.306
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: Thank you.

01:05:15.306 --> 01:05:18.460
There's an exhibit at
the Library of Congress.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:23.185
It should continue until
next September of '15.

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:26.770
Unreal, unbelievable.

01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:28.650
So it may travel.

01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:33.260
But it's a complete history
of the whole struggle

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.755
from the days of slavery.

01:05:34.755 --> 01:05:36.088
AUDIENCE: I'll have to catch it.

01:05:36.088 --> 01:05:36.640
Thank you.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.056
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: Thank you.

01:05:41.008 --> 01:05:42.990
AUDIENCE: Hello,
Congressman Lewis.

01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:47.520
You've talked a lot about
low voter participation

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.220
and turnouts.

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.120
And I feel like there have been
a lot of deliberate attempts

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.930
to breed cynicism
and the feeling

01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:56.010
that our vote doesn't
matter, particularly

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:59.040
for people who are more
likely to support equality.

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:03.470
And one of the ways
that I've seen this done

01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:06.620
is by splitting up elections.

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:08.420
Like, I remember
a conversation I

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.520
had with a Republican
strategist once

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.990
who talked about the
deliberate strategy

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:15.290
to hold special elections
and things like that,

01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:18.380
because there's lower voter
turnouts in those elections,

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:23.660
and those people about tend to
skew older and skew wealthier

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.920
and skew more Republican.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:29.800
And even in a lot
of local elections

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.670
are held at weird off times.

01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:35.610
And I've missed more
than one election

01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:37.260
when I moved to a
new city because it

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.460
was like there was nothing
in any of the media

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:43.420
that I get that let me know
that the election happened

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:47.800
until there was a news story
three days later about who won.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.780
And even when I have
voted sometimes,

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:55.730
by the time you get down
to family court judge,

01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:59.620
my question is why is this even
an elected position, much less

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:03.020
having a sense of who would
be the better candidate here.

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.060
So my question
is, what can we do

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:09.890
to counteract the
forces that want

01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:13.100
to discourage voter turnout
through spreading out

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:17.860
elections, and to help
it be easier for people

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.800
to become informed voters?

01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:21.390
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: I think it's

01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:27.560
important for local partisan
or nonpartisan organizations

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:31.460
and groups, like the League of
Women Voters, good government

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:38.570
groups, to lobby, to organize
and get legislation passed,

01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:42.400
to change the type of voting.

01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:48.620
But my philosophies
are also that you

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.970
should vote in every election,
even if it's only the dog

01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:54.527
catcher, you want to
vote for the dog catcher

01:07:54.527 --> 01:07:55.860
or vote against the dog catcher.

01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:58.050
But vote.

01:07:58.050 --> 01:07:59.422
It's just that important.

01:07:59.422 --> 01:08:00.880
In our young people,
we have to get

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.970
people in the habit
of participating,

01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:08.061
minorities in the South,
in the habit of voting,

01:08:08.061 --> 01:08:09.310
in the habit of participating.

01:08:11.339 --> 01:08:12.880
And we should take
our young children

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.890
when we go to the polls.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.970
Take them to the polls with
us and let them punch and do

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:22.720
whatever you do
so they can see it

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.015
become a part of
their existence.

01:08:27.987 --> 01:08:28.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:30.236
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: Thank you.

01:08:32.199 --> 01:08:32.740
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:35.500
This may be a bit more of a
statement than a question.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:39.220
First off, I wanted to say that
I'm a very recent Californian,

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.060
having here moved
here two years ago,

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:44.399
and spent the preceding
20 years in Atlanta,

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:47.130
and was extremely proud to
have had you as my Congressman

01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:49.662
for a great, great
deal of that time.

01:08:49.662 --> 01:08:51.120
CONGRESSMAN JOHN
LEWIS: Well, I try

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.640
to do my best as a
member of Congress.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.250
This young man here said I've
been here since he was three.

01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:00.359
AUDIENCE: And I
wanted to thank you

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:03.540
all for drawing the
sort of line of history,

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:06.670
because well, my wife
is older than I am

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:10.319
and she was involved in the
Vietnam Movement and protests

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:11.100
against Vietnam.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.534
My father-- we lived in Texas,
and he sat at lunch counters.

01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:21.130
But one of my great honors
as part of the continuing

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:25.034
movement, I personally met my
wife protesting US involvement

01:09:25.034 --> 01:09:29.510
in Central America
in the '80s was

01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:33.109
to be able to meet
representative of the Abraham

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:36.590
Lincoln brigades from
the Spanish Civil War.

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:40.939
And I was made acutely
aware of the legacy

01:09:40.939 --> 01:09:43.420
of the movements of the '30s.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:47.000
And so, it's a
continuous movement,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.740
and I'm proud to be part
of this river in some form.

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:54.860
And I'm very honored
to meet a giant.

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.599
In that said, thank you.

01:09:57.599 --> 01:09:59.640
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS:
Thank you very much, sir.

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:00.620
Thank you.

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:02.090
Thank you.

01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:06.770
