00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.780
SPEAKER 1: So we're going to
let you in on a little secret.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.600
Something that this woman
doesn't know yet-- that's

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.630
Keeley.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.770
And this man here-- his
heart is probably racing.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.890
Adrenaline is rushing
through his veins

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.340
but not because they're about
to climb more than 13,000 feet

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.770
to the top of this mountain.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.770
It's because of what's
going to happen when they

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.910
get to the top. [PIANO PLAYING]

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.015
STEVE: Hi, my name is Steve.

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:31.820
I'm a amateur photographer
living in Colorado.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.720
This picture was taken
on top of the Grand Teton

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.900
outside Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.630
It was taken August of 2013.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.140
So it's a picture of me
proposing to my-- at the time--

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.149
girlfriend.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.940
SPEAKER 1: Steve had
an inkling that Keeley

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.400
was going to say yes.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.050
But the journey to
pop the question

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.780
wasn't short on difficulty.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.190
STEVE: So it was a
great but pretty tough

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.410
hike that required
some rock climbing

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.980
but it was probably the most
amazing hike I've ever done.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.530
SPEAKER 1: After
camping mid hike,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.820
the couple woke up around
4:00 in the morning--

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.870
rising even before the sun
to finish their journey.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.940
But it was well worth it
given the view, the crisp air,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.670
and the chance to be alone
with your future spouse.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.940
Completely alone.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.820
Which begs the question,
who took the picture?

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.460
STEVE: I set the camera on a
little, mini tripod on a rock

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.020
and said, hey come
take a picture.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.090
When she came over
that's when I pulled out

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.640
the ring, got down on one knee.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.080
I had a remote shutter
release in my pocket.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.840
As I was proposing I
had the presence of mind

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.550
to press our remote
shutter so that picture

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.050
is the actual proposal.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.120
The look on her face
is completely real.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.610
SPEAKER 1: Though many couples
propose in sports stadiums

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.640
or with grand musical
numbers, Steve

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.040
understood that professing
his love to Keeley

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.360
would have to involve
their first love--

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.390
a love for adventure.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.650
STEVE: Travel and pressure
is important to both of us.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.340
Our first day was actually
going skiing up in Minnesota.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.380
And then camping in the
winter when it was super cold.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.420
So we've both been
pretty into it.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.980
I've done three Iron
Mans in the past

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.480
and she just did her first
one a few months ago.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.010
So we are both
pretty adventurous.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.260
We hike, climb, ski
together, ice climb.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.630
I had a very serious traumatic
brain injury last year

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.300
so that's why my speech
is a little laboured.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.720
But I'm back to skiing.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.180
Back to hiking.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.460
So things are good.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.430
Things are really good.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.680
SPEAKER 1: Climbing one of
Wyoming's highest mountains

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.540
is an adventure in itself.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.100
But for Steve and Keeley,
the real adventure

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.700
only began when they
started their journey back.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.460
Sometimes love means
making a grand gesture.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.330
And Kay Jewelers has the perfect
gift for your loved ones.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.150
Kay Jewelers.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.120
Every kiss begins with K.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.320
the definition of
love can be, check out

this video on a worldwide
study of the meaning of love.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.700
SPEAKER 2: love is project
combines social impact product

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.600
while connecting people around
the world through storytelling.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.867
The focus-- the universal
meaning of the word love.

00:03:23.867 --> 00:03:25.450
