00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.400
Now that we have seen use cases, the next behavioral

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.540
diagram I want to discuss is the sequence diagram. So

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.070
what is a sequence diagram? It is an interaction diagram

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.710
that emphasizes how objects communicate and the time ordering of

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.940
the messages between objects. To illustrate sequence diagrams in a

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.600
practical way, and hopefully in a clear way, I will

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.960
introduce them by creating an actual sequence diagram using an

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.160
example taken from our course management system. So let's see what

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.050
are the steps needed to build such a sequence diagram. The first

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.900
thing we want to do is place the objects that participate in

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.460
the interaction at the top of the diagram along the x-axis, and

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.410
you also want to place them in a specific way. You want

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.770
to place objects that initiate the interaction at the left, and place

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.260
increasingly more subordinate objects to the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.430
right. So basically, this should reflect

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.660
the way the events will flow for the majority of the interactions

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.202
in the system. Next thing you want to do is to add

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:53.910
what is called the object lifeline. It's a vertical line that

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.300
shows the existence of objects over a period of time. And

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.660
it's normally represented with a dashed line, except for the outermost

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.190
object for which it is a solid line. Now that you

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.450
have your object lifeline you can start placing messages that these

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.285
objects send and receive. You want to put them along the

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:12.860
y-axis in order of increasing time, from top to bottom. And

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.550
you can also put a number on the message to further

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.230
clarify the sequence. So in this case what we're showing

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.550
is that the student will send the fill in info

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.330
message to the registration form. And this is the first

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.960
message in the sequence diagram, the first interaction. Then the student

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.900
might submit the form and this is also a message

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.370
that goes to the registration form. At this point, when

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.440
the submission takes place, the registration form will send the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.990
message, so it will invoke some functionality in the registration manager.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.560
Specifically you will invoke the add course functionality

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.400
and pass Joe, the name of the student and

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.410
Math 101 which is the specific course for which

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.180
Joe is registering. Then the registration manager will ask

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.780
the Math 101 course whether it accepts registrations,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.780
and the interaction will continue. So that Math 101

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.820
will actually check for a specific offering, if everything

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.070
goes fine, you will receive an ack, you'll send

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.180
back the act to the registration manager and so

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.650
on. Until at the end, Joe will be registered for

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.390
Math 101. As you can see, it is very

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.600
easy to see how the interaction occurs between these different

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.010
objects at run time, dynamically. So what the behavior

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.070
of the system is for this specific scenario. So the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.780
last notational element that I want to add to this

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.350
diagram is the focus of control. Which is this tall

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.880
thin rectangle, that shows the period of time

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.190
that an object is performing an action, either

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.270
directly or indirectly. So if we look at

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.240
the registration form, this is telling us that

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.670
the registration form is active for this amount

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.170
of time. And the same thing we can

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.520
do for the registration manager, the Math 101

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.170
course offering, and the Math 101 specific section.
