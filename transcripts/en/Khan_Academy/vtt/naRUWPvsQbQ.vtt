00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.980
In the last few videos, we've
been approximating the area

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.530
under the curve using
rectangles, where

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.210
the height of each
rectangle was defined

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.330
by the function evaluated
at the left boundary.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.920
So this would have been
the first rectangle.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.130
Then the second rectangle
would look something like this.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.560
And then we'd go all the
way to the nth rectangle

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.812
would look something like that.

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:30.645
And we saw-- so this
is the first rectangle,

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:32.228
this is the second
rectangle, and we'd

00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:34.580
go all the way to
the nth rectangle--

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.250
and so we saw that the way that
you would take the sum of all

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.040
of these rectangles in order
to approximate the area is

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.870
that you would get the
sum from i equals 1 to n.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.780
And so i is essentially a
count of which rectangle

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.897
we're dealing with.

00:00:49.897 --> 00:00:51.480
And what we're going
to do is multiply

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.280
the height times the base.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.920
So the height of each rectangle,
the height of rectangle one,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.750
in this case, was the
function evaluated at x0.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.080
The height of rectangle two was
the function evaluated at x1.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.700
The height of rectangle
n was the function

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.940
evaluated at x sub n minus 1.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.170
So the height of
a rectangle i is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.900
going to be the function
evaluated x sub i minus 1.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.710
If i is 2, then we're
evaluating it at x1.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.610
If i was 2, then this would be
the function evaluated at x1.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.230
So it's the left boundary.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.370
And then we have to
multiply it times the width.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.730
And in the last few
videos, and in this video,

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.800
we will assume that all of the
rectangles have equal width.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.750
Now, we'll call that
equal width delta x.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.930
And to find it, we just have
to take the total distance

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.430
that we're going
in the x direction.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.460
So it's going to be
b minus a divided

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.400
by the number of
rectangles we want.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.170
So it's going to
be times delta x.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.770
Now, you might imagine that
this is not the only way

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.190
to take the sum
using rectangles,

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.350
or this is not the only
way to take the sum

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.150
or approximate the area using
some type of geometric shape.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.600
For example, we could
have created rectangles

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.000
where the height is defined
by the rightmost boundary.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.449
So let's define that.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.755
So here's our first rectangle.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.170
And we're defining the
height by the right boundary

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.923
of the rectangle.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.830
So this right over
here is rectangle one,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.265
and its height is f of x1.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.420
And then for this
one right over here,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.480
we take the right boundary.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.750
The right boundary
defines that height.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.370
If we go all the
way to the-- this

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.880
is rectangle two-- if we
go all way to the nth one,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.240
we use the right
boundary to define

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.930
the height of the rectangle.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.690
So in this case-- this
is the nth rectangle--

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.610
how would we write this sum?

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.909
Well, it would be
the sum-- which

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.200
is, remember, we're just
trying to approximate the area

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.220
under the curve-- from
i is equal to 1 to n.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.240
So i is a count of
each of the rectangles.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.150
And so the height of the
first rectangle is f of x1.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.530
The height of the nth
rectangle is f of x sub n.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.490
So this height right over
here is f of x sub n.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.230
So the height of
the i-th rectangle

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.470
is going to be f of x sub i.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.100
Whatever the
rectangle number is,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.097
we take the x sub
that same number

00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:29.430
and evaluate the function there.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.550
That gives us the height.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.220
And we multiply
that times delta x.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.570
So the difference between
this and this here,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.090
for the i-th
rectangle, we use x sub

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.780
i minus 1, so the left boundary.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.760
Here we use the right
boundary, f of x sub i.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.510
Well, we don't
have to stop there.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.760
Instead, we could use maybe
the midpoint between the two

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.070
boundaries instead.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.240
So, for example,
over here we could

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.290
we could use the midpoint
between x0 and x1

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.650
to find the height
of the rectangle.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.340
So this is right over here.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.830
This is f of x0
plus x1 over 2, just

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.030
the midpoint between
these two points,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.610
to define the height
of the rectangle.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.750
So it would look
something like that.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.210
And the next one, we
would look at the midpoint

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.550
to define the height.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.780
And we go all the
way to the nth one,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.860
and we define the
midpoint between its two

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.390
sides of the rectangle.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.480
So the function
evaluated there tells us

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.710
how high our
rectangle should be.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.860
And it would look
something like that.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.780
And so what would
this sum look like?

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.810
Well, once again, we would
count each of our rectangles,

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.840
so i equals 1 to
i equals n. i is

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.330
which rectangle
we're working on.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.371
So this is the first one,
this is the second one,

00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:58.720
and this is the nth one.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.840
And the height isn't just
going to be f evaluated

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.840
x sub i minus 1 or
f evaluated x sub i.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.970
It'll be the function
evaluated at the midpoint

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.690
between the two-- x sub
i minus 1 plus x sub i,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.200
all of that over two,
and then times delta x.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.960
The delta x's are the same in
every one of these scenarios.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.515
Now finally, let's try to
break out of approximating only

00:05:26.515 --> 00:05:28.640
with rectangles and get a
little bit more creative.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.460
Why don't we try to
approximate with trapezoids?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.580
So let's try to do that.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.020
So what we could have here is
the left part of the trapezoid.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.120
The height is f of x sub 0.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.760
So this is f of x sub 0.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.160
And then the right side of
the trapezoid is f of x sub 1.

00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:55.430
And then what would be
the-- here, and let me

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.429
do that for all of them.

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:58.290
So that would be
the first trapezoid.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.280
Then the second trapezoid
would look like this.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.905
This one looks almost
like a rectangle,

00:06:01.905 --> 00:06:04.910
but we assume that the
top isn't completely flat.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.075
And then we go all the
way to the nth one.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:10.020
And this should be clear that
we're dealing with a trapezoid.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.590
All the way to the nth one
will look something like that.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.200
So how would we
calculate this area,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.760
the area of the trapezoid?

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.580
Well, you just have to remember
that the area of a trapezoid

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.820
is just the average of
the heights of the two

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.140
sides times the base.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.620
So in this case-- and let me
write it out a little bit.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.270
So the area right
over there is going

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.120
to be the average
of the heights.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.950
So it's going to be f of
x sub 0 plus f of x sub 1,

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.180
all of that over 2.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.350
And then we're going to
multiply that times delta x.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.380
So that would be the area just
of this one right over here.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.540
We took the average
of the two heights

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.540
and multiplied that
times the base.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.890
Now, if we wanted the sum of the
areas of all these trapezoids,

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.750
and we wanted to write
in general terms,

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.140
we could just write it's
the sum-- once again,

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.660
we're going to count
the trapezoids.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.540
So this is the first
trapezoid, this is the second,

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.710
all the way to
the nth trapezoid.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.020
So it's i equals
1 to i equals n.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.850
And the height of
each trapezoid,

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.730
we're going to use the function
evaluated at the left boundary,

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.340
x sub i minus 1, the average
of the function evaluated

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.900
at the left boundary
and the function

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.470
evaluated at the right
boundary, and we're

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.020
going to take the
average of that

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.980
and then multiply
that times the base.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.875
So the whole reason
why I wanted to do

00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:42.000
this is to show you there's
multiple, multiple ways

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.530
of doing this.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.090
And in fact, if you wanted
to get really general,

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.790
you could even have
different widths.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.439
But then that gets a
little bit more confusing.

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:49.980
But really, just to
show you that you

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.140
might see some of this fancy
notation in your calculus book

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.840
or in your precalculus book.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.399
But all it's doing is summing
up the areas of trapezoids

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.190
and rectangles depending
on whether they're

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.650
using the right boundaries
of the rectangle

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.850
to define the height, the
left boundaries, the midpoint

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.480
of the left and the
right boundaries,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.809
or they could even
construct trapezoids.
