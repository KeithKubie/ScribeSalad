00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.330
INTERVIEWER: Hot air balloons
have been around for centuries.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.050
But, I've got to say, I
don't really get them.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.900
I like heights, but I'd
rather just go skydiving.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.830
I really don't understand what's
compelling about the scene,

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.506
but apparently 140,000
people disagree with me.

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:22.905
Hopefully the photographer
can help us out

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:26.334
with these big, possibly
pointless, floating enigmas.

00:00:26.334 --> 00:00:27.250
CHRISTOPHER CHANG: Hi.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.650
My name is Christopher Chang.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.760
By day, I lead
strategy and operations

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.140
in the high-tech industry.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.000
And in my spare time, I'm
an amateur photographer.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.320
This photo was taken in Reno,
Nevada not long after sunrise.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.715
But the event actually started
hours earlier in the day

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:42.934
at pre-dawn.

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:44.350
INTERVIEWER: What
we're looking at

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.460
is the Great Reno Balloon Race,
one of the largest balloon

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.730
races in the world.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.390
It's been an annual
celebration since 1982.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.110
And each year, 140,000
people from around the world

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.430
come to watch more than
100 unique balloons

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.077
fill the Nevada sky.

00:00:59.077 --> 00:01:00.660
CHRISTOPHER CHANG:
This photo captures

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.620
what the hot air
balloon race organizers

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.730
call the mass ascension launch,
where all the balloons take off

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.270
as the main event of the race.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.957
And it is quite the spectacle as
all the balloons fill the sky.

00:01:10.957 --> 00:01:13.040
INTERVIEWER: The sheer
scale of the mass ascension

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.940
is almost worth the
trip in and of itself.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.741
But for Christopher, that's
not even the best part.

00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:19.990
CHRISTOPHER CHANG: One of
the fun aspects of this race

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.820
is watching all the fun-shaped
balloons take to the sky.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.440
There are so many great
experiences at this event,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.130
but if I have to
pick a favorite,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.510
it is seeing the dawn patrol
getting ready and take off

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.310
to the still, dark sky.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.072
Watching these fully-lit and
colorful balloons drift off

00:01:34.072 --> 00:01:36.240
in the pre-dawn is
an incredible sight.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.210
The dawn patrol
features only a handful

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.410
of balloons that are
qualified to fly in the dark.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.450
And it's incredible to watch
these balloons glow brightly

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.392
in the dark as they
prepare to take off.

00:01:47.392 --> 00:01:49.100
INTERVIEWER: And,
honestly, after looking

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.850
at all these pictures,
I think I get it.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.556
Hot air balloons don't
need to be practical.

00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:56.380
They're just cool to look at.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.140
And sometimes it's that simple.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.430
No one needs to know the
science behind fireworks

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.200
to enjoy them, or understand
astronomy to stargaze.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.737
Sometimes it's enough
just to look up and enjoy.

00:02:07.737 --> 00:02:09.320
CHRISTOPHER CHANG:
This was my first--

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.755
and so far, only-- visit to
the Great Reno Balloon Race.

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:15.910
It's definitely in my plans
to go back for another visit.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.196
I would definitely recommend
this event to everyone.

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:26.300
INTERVIEWER: If you
liked this episode,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.850
be sure to check out this one.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.020
On this island prison
that's also a national park,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.147
strangely enough.

00:02:32.147 --> 00:02:33.980
SUBJECT: These photos
were taken on a flight

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.580
from Key West, Florida to
Fort Jefferson, Dry Tortugas.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.920
Access to the island can only
be done by sea plane or by boat.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.820
Our plane was not equipped
for landing on the water,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.211
so I enjoyed an afternoon of
picture taking from the air.

00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:49.460
INTERVIEWER: And as always,
don't forget to subscribe.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.290
Thanks for watching.
