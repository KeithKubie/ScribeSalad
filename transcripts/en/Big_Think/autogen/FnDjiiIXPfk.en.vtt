the forces underpinning this debacle is

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
the forces underpinning this debacle is
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.270
the forces underpinning this debacle is
the change in financial expectations of

what they consider to be a normal sum of
 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.539
what they consider to be a normal sum of
money to make and if everybody is

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
normal big payday is a million dollars
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.740
normal big payday is a million dollars
they do behave one way if they all

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750
they do behave one way if they all
 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.030
they do behave one way if they all

normal big payday is a hundred million
 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.690
normal big payday is a hundred million
dollars or even a billion dollars well

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700
dollars or even a billion dollars well
 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.729
dollars or even a billion dollars well
they behave another way and the other

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739
they behave another way and the other
 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.620
they behave another way and the other
way they behave is by taking a lot more

way they behave is by taking a lot more
 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.150
way they behave is by taking a lot more
risk because the only way you generate

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160
risk because the only way you generate
 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.710
risk because the only way you generate
those sums of money is by taking here

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720
those sums of money is by taking here
 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.110
those sums of money is by taking here
huge risk so there was there was this

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120
huge risk so there was there was this
 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.010
huge risk so there was there was this
thing that happened in the Wall Street

just the the level of financial
 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.490
just the the level of financial
expectations it's a little different

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500
expectations it's a little different
 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.900
expectations it's a little different
from greed it's just sort of like the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910
from greed it's just sort of like the
 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.610

are we supposed to make changed and what
we're going through right now is a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440
we're going through right now is a
 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.390
we're going through right now is a
radical downward readjustment
