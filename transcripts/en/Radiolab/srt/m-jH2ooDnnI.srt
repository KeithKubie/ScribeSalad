00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,980
You are listening to radio
lab radio from W N y.

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,480
S. C. E. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich.
I am not Jan [inaudible].

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,720
What you see who you are. Okay.
That's the oddest thing to do.

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,200
I'm a new summer Odie. I host
another podcast at w and YC studios.

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,130
Note to self.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,160
You also are on Irish show video lab.
I'll know very, very frequently. Well,

7
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,920
not very frequently but frequently
enough. Frequently enough.

8
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:33,530
Brilliantly enough. Thank you sir. We are,

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,700
yes, and I am here.

10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,240
Pinch hitting for Jad for a little
bit to spread the word that this is an

11
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:40,330
important time for Radiolab, Robert.

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,430
Well, it's the end of the year. The
giving time is the end of the year.

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,490
What we're about to do I think will be
kind of wonderful because we who make the

14
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:54,590
show and you who listened to the show
don't often have a chance to get together.

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,010
So in the next bit of time what we're
going to do is we're going to pal up.

16
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,080
We've invited some of the people who
normally listened to come on the show and

17
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:06,650
people who love Emily make the show
come and listen and we're mixing it up a

18
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,280
little bit.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,280
It's a strange menagerie of humans and
we want to just go to the zoo of us.

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,450
So that is coming right up.

21
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:17,690
But if you'd like to hit pause just for
a second and make a contribution right

22
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:18,830
away, like right now,

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,700
you can enjoy the episode knowing that
you've already done the thing that you

24
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:23,331
were supposed to do,

25
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:26,150
that we're going to be on our knees
begging you to do what you've already done

26
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:29,660
it like, yeah, that's already, you've
already solved the problem. Yes.

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,060
Do you want me to take over
here? Right here. Okay. Yeah.

28
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:34,880
Slip in and then I'll think of something
to say on the, okay, very good.

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,880
So, um,

30
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,500
what Robert is beating around the bush
is that radio lab relies on the support

31
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,980
of listener contributions.
Listeners like you, yes.

32
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,590
Who make all the stories
that we produce possible.

33
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:50,790
So it's time that we extend a hand
to you, our podcast listeners,

34
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,260
and invite you to make a
financial contribution so
that radio lab can keep these

35
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:58,980
episodes coming your way.
It is super easy to do.

36
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,190
We ask you to go to radiolab.org/donate
to give or even easier if you live in

37
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:09,120
the u s open up your phone, probably
what you're listening on. Anyway,

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,590
open up the messaging app.

39
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,770
Type the word radio lab to the number
six nine eight six six that'll get you

40
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:16,780
started. Okay,

41
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,800
but suppose you live in Montevideo,
Uruguay, or in Zagreb, Yugoslavia,

42
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,970
a country which no longer exists, then
you can't. What do you have to do then?

43
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,560
Just go to radiolab.org/donate that's
what I always do whenever I am in central

44
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:33,250
Europe, South Asia or South
America. Again, it's really easy,

45
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:36,640
so don't be intimidated
by it. Now as we promised,

46
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:39,790
it is time for you to meet some
people whom you hear on our show,

47
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:43,930
but have never really met Arianne
wack producers a part of our show.

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,350
She's never met them either. So this
was her chance to find out about them,

49
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,170
our chance to find out
what Kerryann found out.

50
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,060
Hello. Is this Terri? Did
I lose you? Did I lose you?

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,010
Hey. Hi. Hi. How are I'm good. How are

52
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,750
you?

53
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,490
I was so touched. It was your email.

54
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,880
Well, I do want to hear emails. All right.

55
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:10,440
So I decided to call up this woman that
I have just been desperately curious

56
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:14,850
about, uh, for years now since I've
worked here. What's on your mind?

57
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:17,610
What can I do for ya?
Um, the reason, well,

58
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,560
I've been wanting to reach out to you, um,

59
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,590
for a while because part of my job here
is to listen to all of the spots that

60
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:28,560
come in for our underwriting and I like
choose the reads and produce them and

61
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:31,400
put them into the episodes I need
to go in. Oh, um, cool. Well,

62
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,600
thank you for what you
do tobacco for a second.

63
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:38,601
We have our listeners submit underwriting
reeds via the app and we put them into

64
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:42,780
the brakes of our shows. If you've
listened to the show with any regularity,

65
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:46,850
you've probably heard this.
And Hey, this is Terry Babcock.

66
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,930
Lou Mitch support for NPR comes
from NPR station. Terry Babcock.

67
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,500
Lou mish does every single one
of them. This is Terry Babcock.

68
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,710
Lou Is Terry Babcock. Lou Ms.
Henry Babcock is Terry baths.

69
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,860
Terry back documentary.
Babcock was married.

70
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,620
Terry Babcock more than 300 times.

71
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,070
And I know that if in a
pinch I need a spot quick.

72
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:10,790
I know that there's going to be
a read from Terry Henry Babcock,

73
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,624
the Cochlea Mesh.

74
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you tired of hearing
my voice or this way?

75
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,280
Yeah, no,

76
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,420
that's why I wanted to call you guys
because there's three of you that leave.

77
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,550
I'm I to read almost every single piece
of copy I put up. And so especially,

78
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,030
you know, I,

79
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,180
I think you've probably been doing
it the longest out of any of them.

80
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:31,420
So I remember like when you move
that cochlear mish from cold spring,

81
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:35,410
New York from like cold springs, no
hottest is Terry Babcock. Lou Mission,

82
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,510
Honolulu, Hawaii down
to Honolulu. And like,

83
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,200
I know like when your husband is
around, hi, this is Brian Babcock,

84
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:45,740
Lou mish and this is Terry. Listen
occasionally like hip hop in. Yup. Yeah.

85
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,190
And so I just, I feel like
I kind of know you. Um,

86
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,600
well, I mean it is all based on
like evidence that I've, you know,

87
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,210
gathered from your phone calls and
the background noises and whatnot.

88
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,780
But my gosh, seriously,
this is really fun.

89
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,620
What's your hypothesis?

90
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,430
My hypothesis will you lived in a cold
spring for a while and I was like,

91
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:17,780
she doesn't, she sounds too young
to be like a, like a snowbird.

92
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:20,770
So I didn't think that you
guys had moved for the weather.

93
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,100
Like somebody must have
gotten a job down there.

94
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,170
Okay.

95
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,640
Uh, and then you have
grandkids. And I was surprised.

96
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,220
I had heard them a couple of times,

97
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,500
or at least they sound
like little kids to me.

98
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,310
Maybe they're not going
to have kids. Uh Huh.

99
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,980
Anything because technically I don't
think we're even old enough to have

100
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:42,530
grandkids.

101
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,860
Okay, good. Yeah, so I've got
conflicting narratives here.

102
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,500
That's still pretty good. Okay.
You want the real story? Yeah,

103
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:50,000
I would love the real story.

104
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,540
So my background is government.

105
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,460
I was the White House economist and
First Clinton administration. Oh my God.

106
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,150
There is no reason why I should
have gotten up with an army guy. Um,

107
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,210
fell madly in love. So he's
active duty military. Okay.

108
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,600
So we move every two
or three years with it.

109
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,693
Army assignment,

110
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,110
summer 2014 I, we got assignment to
Hawaii and that's where we lived.

111
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,800
Or sorry, that's the short version.

112
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,750
That's great. I love having the background
actually that makes me so happy.

113
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,640
Yeah. Have you ever heard
yourself, um, when you,

114
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:24,120
like you've listened to radio lab,
have you ever heard one of your reads?

115
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,090
So I haven't, you know,

116
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,520
right on a regular basis I'll get an
email from a former student or a friend or

117
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,500
whoever it might be saying that they
heard me on radio lab and it's always so

118
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,550
nice to go hear from someone that I feel
so detached from or we're just far away

119
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,290
from. But no, I've never,

120
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,660
yeah. On do you have a favorite episode?

121
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,090
I don't know,

122
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,120
but I think one of the things that I love
is that you take things that are very

123
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,030
complex and you make ideas,
whether it's, you know, CRISPR Cas,

124
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,540
nine or infectious diseases
or black holes or things.

125
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,410
I don't even know that I'm going to be
interested in you make them not just

126
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,100
interesting but accessible and exciting.

127
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:09,400
And then I remember it and then I wonder,

128
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,430
talk about it. Yeah. Yeah. So let
me ask, do you have a favorite?

129
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,840
Well, um,

130
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,430
I mean there's frequently 30
different drafts of an episode,

131
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,110
so it's hard to like hear the finished
product as just a listener again and not

132
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:27,100
being like, oh, I didn't
Depop that p there, you know,

133
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:30,490
like other room tone there. I could
have smoothed that out or something,

134
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,430
you know? And I miss, I
miss that a little bit.

135
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,030
Yeah, it sends out of it that way.
I'm so, yeah, I need to do it,

136
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:37,864
but I really do.

137
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,010
No, it's totally fine. It's
fine. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.

138
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,280
I guess, I mean, I, I want to know
like why you do it? Like, why,

139
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:51,110
why you're so committed to like
giving to us in this particular way.

140
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,840
So I feel like what you've
asked of us is so little.

141
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:01,290
And so whether it's public radio asking
for a check or it's me writing some

142
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:04,210
credits, it's something I can
do. Thankfully it was fun.

143
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,010
Okay.

144
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,940
And it's interesting and you know,
wherever we've lived, I've wanted to,

145
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,220
you know, even if the case
on pledge drive, you know,

146
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:13,320
to be involved with public
radio, I think, you know,

147
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,830
it really is the soundtrack of
my life and I could be wrong,

148
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,270
but I feel like for plenty of people,

149
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:23,271
they're concerned that they can't get as
a big check that they sign Gibbs and I,

150
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,430
I'm often very quick to challenge
that assumption. Um, you know,

151
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:33,120
I think about the people who are busy or
for people who can't write a big check,

152
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,130
you know, eating just a little tiny,
what would the be present of your coffee?

153
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,940
I think people, yeah.
Like that's not enough.

154
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,170
But those copies that up and I don't
think we should underestimate our

155
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,630
collective power with
our coffee. Yeah. Um,

156
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,780
and so in New York, if I can take
you for a cup of coffee. Yeah.

157
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,700
Oh, I'd be happy to because I really am.

158
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,210
Yeah, no, that would be great.
Thank you so much. This was a,

159
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,610
I really enjoyed this conversation

160
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,440
so by,

161
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,130
it's been such a pleasure and I have to
admit I was very surprised by your call.

162
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,970
I didn't know if you were telling
me like Sandown like retired.

163
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,870
No, really.

164
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,220
All right. Thanks so much Terry.

165
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,193
Bye Bye.

166
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:21,621
Minutia.

167
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:26,621
Here's the thing about Terry is that
she's one of a lot of folks who tuna Sian

168
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,190
and then kind of join in. Like we have a,

169
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,650
we have a very unusual audience.

170
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,020
Yeah. You have an awesome audience.
Radiolab listeners are the best.

171
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,550
Yeah. But in very particular ways,
like, like when you meet them,

172
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,090
they don't come and say, Yo, I
really, whatever that thing you do,

173
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:44,924
they don't do that.

174
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,640
They have like very specific sort
of either compliments or arguments,

175
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:53,390
but if their listeners,
meaning they've listened.

176
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,720
Robert, I think what you're saying
is the listeners, you listeners,

177
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:01,340
not only do you give your time, you
give your brain, yes, the brain,

178
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,940
the brain.

179
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,940
Let's also remember you give contributions
is what keeps radio lab on the air

180
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,240
and in order for 2017 to
knock it out of the park,

181
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:15,190
like 2016 did we need you to
keep doing that? Yeah. Yeah.

182
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,940
If you were just sitting here just
sitting there and about like maybe, okay,

183
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:24,140
maybe now what would you do
right now if you wanted to,

184
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,380
you would go online to radiolab.org/donate
to give it is Radiolab spelled it's

185
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,270
two words or one? No, it's just
one. That's right. Or even easier.

186
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:39,920
Just text that one word, Radiolab
to the number six, nine, eight,

187
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,840
six, six to get started.

188
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,900
That's if you're in the u s you
can do that in any case though,

189
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:49,220
you can get it handled in a matter of
seconds and we thank you for it. Yeah,

190
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,260
they really do. Now,

191
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,250
and introduction to one of our
listeners who I recently met,

192
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,350
the three things that I say I love about
this country. Uh, first of all, um,

193
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,110
you know, drinking water coming out of
your faucet, it's insane. You're, you're,

194
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,650
you're thirsty in the middle of a shower.

195
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:09,380
You just open your mouth and
you're done. It's incredible.

196
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,910
So this is my uncle Mishra.

197
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,910
He's a graduate student in
ecology at Princeton University.

198
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,350
Then there's a bike lanes, which
are fantastic but clean. Yeah.

199
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,150
Because you should try riding a bike,
uh, in Calcutta. Delhi. It's uh,

200
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,990
it's, it'll definitely get you
closer to God. That's right. Yeah.

201
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,120
God does exist in India. Yeah.

202
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,990
So my young started out as a
civil rights lawyer in India,

203
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,290
often defending people whom he
thought had been jailed without cause.

204
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,680
He left for the United States in part
because he had sued the man who was

205
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,040
suddenly became the prime minister
of India. And he thought, well,

206
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,740
maybe I should, uh, you
know, go somewhere else. Uh,

207
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,980
and the third thing I love about
this country was into that. I mean,

208
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:58,300
just really great internet where I
could listen to things all the time.

209
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,890
And often I heard radio lab when I
first started listening to podcasts,

210
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,080
I first met my young after giving a
lecture up at Princeton University.

211
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:09,000
He came up afterwards and he said, oh,

212
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,720
I want to tell you about the first
time I heard radio that was okay.

213
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,810
He said that he was on a road trip
with some of his fellow students.

214
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,580
So I was supposed to be navigating,

215
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,990
I was just graduating from my master's
in public administration from Princeton.

216
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,180
We were done with school,

217
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,070
but we were still getting to know
each other because you don't,

218
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,030
now that we were done with
it, we knew each other,

219
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:32,610
but we didn't quite know
where everyone came from.

220
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,040
And we were going to beach house.

221
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,610
The entire class was going there to
sort of see farewell and you know,

222
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,260
spend a few days together.

223
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,590
And I was supposed to be navigating and
I got everything wrong and we went miles

224
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:49,930
away and I started talking about, um,

225
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,190
how I had to deal with the loss of
my father. And then my grandfather,

226
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,630
both a Michael just friends and um,

227
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,410
and you also having to deal with the fact
that we were going to leave this place

228
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:05,460
behind and leave this community behind
that we had formed over the past two

229
00:13:05,461 --> 00:13:09,540
years. The first one I had in
the u s someone said, you know,

230
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:14,541
there's this incredibly greed episode
by radio lab on life after life.

231
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:15,650
I think it was,

232
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,150
that was our afterlife episode. It
was a series of meditations on death

233
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,450
on this hour. We ask that question a dead,

234
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,170
what happens at the very moment when
you slip from life to the other side and

235
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:31,890
what happens after?

236
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,380
And we started seeing it. It was just
done silence through the entire thing.

237
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:41,590
And one of the, one of the things
that always stuck with me is that, um,

238
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,270
I remember you were talking about a group
and it said that what happens when the

239
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:50,120
group disperses and people
go their separate weaves.

240
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,690
Does the group die or do
they carry it with them?

241
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,370
This was a short fiction piece by
the neurologist David Eagleman,

242
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,160
which was read on our show
by the actor Jeffrey tambor.

243
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,680
When soldiers part ways at war's end,

244
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,410
the breakup of the platoon triggers
the same emotion as the w. Well,

245
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:09,400
the death of a person,

246
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,080
participants amble away feeling that
they were just part of something larger

247
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:16,600
than themselves, something
they intuit had a life,

248
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,500
even though they can't
quite put a finger on it

249
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,050
in this way, death is not only for
humans, but for everything that existed.

250
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,820
And it turns out that anything that
enjoys life enjoys an afterlife.

251
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,730
And then there was something
about when you pass away, uh,

252
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,610
what happens to the, to the things
that make you up when you die,

253
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,260
you're aggrieved by all the
atoms of which you were composed.

254
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,370
They hung together for years,

255
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,420
whether in sheets of skin or communities
as spleen, but with your death,

256
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,430
they don't die. Instead they,

257
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,520
they part ways moving off in
their separate directions.

258
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,380
Mourning the loss of a special time.

259
00:14:57,381 --> 00:15:02,180
They shared together actually haunted
by the feeling that everyone's playing

260
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:06,320
parts in something larger than themselves.

261
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,370
Something that had its
own life, something. Um,

262
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,980
wow. They can hardly put a finger on

263
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:19,430
[inaudible].

264
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,400
Yeah. And I think, I don't know, I
had not told about things that we, um,

265
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,480
I'd had never told about where
life begins and where it ends.

266
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,190
And my uncle mentioned another Eagleman
piece that caught is a year from the

267
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:31,760
same show.

268
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,440
There was this one thing that you said,

269
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:38,441
which was that one way of looking at
death is when the last person speaks your

270
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:41,690
name. Yeah. That's when you're gone.

271
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,030
There are three depths now.

272
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:49,120
The first is when the body
ceases to function of course.

273
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,980
And the second is when the
body is consigned or you know,

274
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,480
put in the grave.

275
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,680
The third is that moment sometime in the
future when your name is spoken or the

276
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:02,554
last time,

277
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,480
oh, with my father and my grandfather,
you know, the DV, forget them, the d,

278
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,130
You know, we've stopped passing on
their stories and no one remembers them.

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,230
That's when that's when they are gone.
That's when they are actually gone.

280
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,980
So you're listening to this, right?
And the other few people listening in,

281
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,760
there's this kind of deep quiet in
the car. Yeah. And then what happened?

282
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:35,210
So that happened and then that was my
introduction to listening to podcasts and

283
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:38,580
then I started listening to Radiolab
more. And what would you do?

284
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,950
Have a lot of time on your head.
What was going on after school?

285
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:44,910
What happened to you? So what
happened was, even in school,

286
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,530
I had been a lawyer and I had
reached this point where I taught,

287
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,790
um, you know, I was done with human
beings. I was done with human rights.

288
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,570
I was done with all of that
stuff because I felt like, no,

289
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,770
we were just too far beyond saving. Um,

290
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,230
and I feel like I'm clearly,

291
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:08,520
this is not where I should be because
there's a bigger world that I clearly have

292
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:11,850
some affinity to. But what did
you, what did you decide to do?

293
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,990
Like what was the nude?

294
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,450
I wanted to go back to school and
I wanted to study ecology and, um,

295
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,110
I attended a class on
ecology and completely blew
my mind and I decided that,

296
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,070
you know,

297
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,310
clearly I'm not on the right part and
maybe this is the part I should be on.

298
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,880
I remember we were living in Brooklyn
right across from the botanic gardens and

299
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,530
even through the winter I'd go there and
I'd be listening to radio lab and, uh,

300
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,180
I, you know, every time I think
of radio lab, I think of, um,

301
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,270
smiles and tears sort of streaming down
my face because there's all of so much

302
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,880
that sort of backed into it. And
I'd be sitting there in the cold,

303
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,740
in the snow, in the botanic gardens, no
one else around with a small notebook,

304
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,340
ah, listening to radio lab. And every
time something would come into my head,

305
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:05,880
I had jotted down. So sitting there in
the botanic gardens listening to us,

306
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:10,440
like, what, what did that do for you?
So open me up and held me together.

307
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,180
Did both things right. Um,

308
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:18,120
opened me up to this new world
of, of ideas and thoughts.

309
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:22,860
And a community of people who
also have similar thoughts,

310
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,430
who also want to find out more
about what's going on. Um,

311
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,460
and also held me together because
I was sort of by myself. Um,

312
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,840
um, I, I'm very, very fortunate to
have my wife with me and she was, um,

313
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,360
I mean she's been a
huge pillar of support,

314
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:44,361
but we have both sort of stepped out of
our comfort zones and I've thought about

315
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:50,490
all of these things, um, to
some extent because of Radiolab.

316
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,330
You know, every time I hear the
opening credits or radio lab,

317
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,110
it feels like I've just stepped back
home from the cold or something.

318
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:03,111
It's just you don't shake off the snow
from your jacket and settle in you.

319
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,760
You feel like you sort of, um,
solve something. I hope not.

320
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:14,100
I hope not, but I certainly feel
very happy about where I am. Um,

321
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,300
it's interesting because if you'll,
if you listen to the show we do,

322
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:21,720
we never solve anything.
That's right. Yeah. I never do.

323
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,510
So you know what I, this was,

324
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,500
this was something I've been thinking
about a lot recently and I was speaking to

325
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:28,130
a very close friend about this as well.

326
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,820
And I was thinking about what
is the role of scientists?

327
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,010
And I found that more
recently that there, there,

328
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:40,910
there have been things that make me
wonder what the scientific community is

329
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:41,500
looking out for.

330
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Sometimes I think sometimes we're sort
of caught up in our credibility and the

331
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:52,250
fact that we must maintain
this credibility and we
shouldn't break rank. Um,

332
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,760
but no one becomes a scientist because
they read a really credible scientific

333
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,800
paper. They read the,

334
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:05,450
they become scientists because they're
inspired by this world around them and

335
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,610
they're just really curious
about what's going on.

336
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,190
And you inspired me
to, to be more curious,

337
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,683
right? Uh,

338
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,900
to recognize that we don't have answers
and sometimes just looking for questions

339
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,090
is really enjoyable. It's
a lot of fun, uh, right.

340
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,780
And to do together to, to,

341
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,480
to be looking for things together to
go on this treasure hunt around life

342
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,370
together. That's home.

343
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,920
Robert, I think I might be in love with
my encore. Yeah. Well, I already am.

344
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,620
I beat you there when we shook hands.

345
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:45,610
I remember like holding onto his hand
like for an extra beat because when you do

346
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,900
this for a living, you don't do
anything much more than tell a story.

347
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,970
But if you can,

348
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:58,050
if you can help somebody get out of
a hole or climb a mountain or change,

349
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,170
you know, change your life,
then like that's cherry on top,

350
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,910
super duper cherry on top.

351
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:08,320
And that happens oddly
not an often on this show.

352
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,350
So that's really cool. And uh,

353
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,170
should I just say like if you listeners,

354
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:18,610
if Radiolab has touched your life
at some point in this past year,

355
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,890
it doesn't mean that you had to
have a career maker like my own.

356
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,620
Maybe it was just like it made you smile
or it made you think about something a

357
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:30,880
little bit differently,
right? We ask you to remember,

358
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,690
are you part of a community?
And this community, uh,

359
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,250
is held together with
listener contributions.

360
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,010
It really is what keeps Radiolab going.

361
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,800
So let's suppose you were in the
mood to give Radiolab something.

362
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,890
How would you go about that?
It's quite easy, Robert. Okay.

363
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:47,900
Let me just take me through
it slowly instead of,

364
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,810
well these are podcast listeners.

365
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,020
Do they kind of get this whole
digital thing fast? Yeah. So

366
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,580
radiolab.org/donate place to go, or
if you're listening on your phone,

367
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:03,330
it's really easy opening up your
messaging app that you've got there. Yeah,

368
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:06,210
sure. I've got one of those mess app
I call it. Yeah, that's very good.

369
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,250
I liked the contract text.

370
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:13,251
The word radio lab's spelled fully out
to the number six nine eight six six

371
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:19,110
that's six nine eight six six
now what? Oh, now, oh yeah.

372
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:20,160
We have another story to tell.

373
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,250
And this next one comes from our
producer Annie Mcewen, who was um,

374
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,570
who wanted to meet somebody who's,
well, we all wanted to meet her.

375
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,433
So here we go.

376
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:34,370
Okay. So a few months back we
did a story called AlphaGo. Okay.

377
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,360
Is your mic on? Yeah, I'm
getting this. Making me nervous.

378
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,170
And the star of that show
was a woman named Amy Pearl.

379
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,980
Maybe I should get my epi pen. Are
you allergic to radio greatness?

380
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,160
That I know of. I haven't
been really exposed to it yet.

381
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,983
Yeah,

382
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,290
I'm Robert Krulwich. This,

383
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,710
the story was about Amy pro's allergy
to red meat and how she got that allergy

384
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,240
to red meat. So I'm not
gonna tell you any more.

385
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,100
You should go listen to the
story. Go listen right now.

386
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,420
But the reaction we got from the audience
on Twitter and in comments on our

387
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:08,200
website, which is insane. Usually
we get kind of like, you know,

388
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,170
the odd comment here or there, love the
show, hey the show, where's the science?

389
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:16,580
Stuff like that. But this time I was
just like this huge outpouring of deep,

390
00:23:16,581 --> 00:23:20,660
deep love for Amy Pearl. Like you
know, get that girl her own show.

391
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:22,460
She's incredible. She changed my life.

392
00:23:22,461 --> 00:23:27,170
Amy Pearl for president was one of the
tweets and I felt the same love for her

393
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:29,450
that everyone else did. And my
job by the show is, you know,

394
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,150
a lot of cutting tape and sound
design and music and stuff like that.

395
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,430
So I never actually like met her before,

396
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:38,270
but I met her through her
voice and I also thought, oh,

397
00:23:38,271 --> 00:23:42,380
she's very wise in ways that I feel
like I really need in my life right now.

398
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,500
And so this is one way to get, you know,

399
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:49,130
bring more Amy Pearl back into
our lives again, which feels good.

400
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,380
Hello. Hi.

401
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,770
Also, it was sort of an opportunity
for me to ask a question.

402
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,660
I wanted to kind of like,

403
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,690
I recently moved here from a really
small town in Canada and I'm trying to

404
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,250
figure out how to like be a human
being in this city and uh, just like,

405
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:08,170
you know, not let it, yeah.

406
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,170
Well, I mean it's like, I mean, did
you ever hear there's a famous saying,

407
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:16,490
did you ever hear it? If you can make
it here, you can pay kids anywhere.

408
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,520
That rings a bell for sure.
It's up to you. No, no.

409
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,280
But it's really true. Everything is
hard in the city. I mean, forget it.

410
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:29,980
It's like, I'm like, oh, I have to
renew my driver's license chapter.

411
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,590
Your driver's side. Good. You're a
big trouble. Oh my God. Everybody

412
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,090
take the week off. It's not going
to work out for you, Amy. I Dunno.

413
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,031
Let's start a support group.

414
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:45,031
It's just like everything is hard and
like all you have to do is go for a

415
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,520
minute. Like where my mom
lives in Connecticut and I
go up there and she's like,

416
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,610
oh, I'm going to return
something. Costco. I'm like, what?

417
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,440
What are you kidding me? I'm only up here
for two days. You have to have it as,

418
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,200
and she was like, oh, it'll
be easy. You like drive up,

419
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,220
drive into a parking spot, get
out of the car. Walk one second.

420
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,230
Let me help you. You're all set. Thanks
so much. Bye. Get back in the car.

421
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,420
Driving to your driveway. Park in the
garage. I don't know why the city so hard.

422
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:16,830
It's so hard. What do you do?
Like what? What do I do? I mean,

423
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,880
well for sure a good thing being
in the city is if you know,

424
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,830
if you wanted do good,
you can. You can like,

425
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,830
I'm sure between now and the
time you get home tonight,

426
00:25:29,831 --> 00:25:33,400
you can like pick up someone's
pen. Yeah. Like Fremont.

427
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,880
Like tell somebody they have, they
have like toilet paper on their shoe,

428
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,230
helps someone and seems lost or like
smile at someone that seems down or be

429
00:25:41,231 --> 00:25:43,000
like, oh my God, I love that book.

430
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,690
That's like you have every opportunity
to make someone else's day better,

431
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:50,080
which you could just be
like, I'm a superhero.

432
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,790
If something happens,

433
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:54,670
I'm going to rush over there and
something might happen any second.

434
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,770
I'm in a city. It's like, you know,

435
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,210
and it's like when you're walking around
the city, I always find treasures.

436
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,430
Like if you look in the gutter,

437
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:08,440
you just like pick up the foot of a
Barbie and it just seems like so great and

438
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,630
like, I don't know. Can you tell me,

439
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,140
uh, what's your,

440
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,050
what's it like the last time you
really saw the city as beautiful?

441
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,320
Oh my God.

442
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:21,321
I think the last time I saw the city
has beautiful probably last night.

443
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,253
Oh,

444
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,910
that was very dark.

445
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:33,650
And I got my dog and we went out like on
the block that I walk on all the time.

446
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:34,820
[inaudible]

447
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,820
but somebody had swept all the leaves
and there was a pile of oak leaf on the

448
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:44,070
side and the

449
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,920
light from the house flicked on

450
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,830
and every oak leaf was like silhouetted
and that's such a pretty shape.

451
00:26:56,011 --> 00:27:00,420
And I was like, oh my God, these are
just being thrown out by the tree,

452
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,140
these even like of youth.
And then I was like, wow,

453
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:09,170
every single here at grows a brand new
leaf and then drops it off and the girls,

454
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:12,900
another one drops it off and girls
another one drops it off at a month.

455
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:16,780
Live for like 200 years. I'm like, imagine
how many leaves the tree drops off.

456
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,240
I'm like, where does it all go?

457
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:21,840
And like what is all that energy
coming from and why are they doing it?

458
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,780
And it smells good and it's pretty

459
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,060
[inaudible].

460
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,650
I mean it's probably covered in dog this,

461
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:35,030
but I didn't get that close and I thought
it was really beautiful and it was

462
00:27:35,031 --> 00:27:38,310
like, it was a good moment.

463
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,560
Oh Amy [inaudible].

464
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,930
Yeah, she's the best.
You know like she was.

465
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:50,931
So when you hear Amy Pearl Talk About
Anything Dopey Dog pee is fine because Amy

466
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,960
brill is what is what you
would call a an n. S. T.

467
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,250
What's that? A natural storyteller. Yes,
there is no way. Yes, there's no way.

468
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:07,050
She can't make everything interesting.
And she, so when this tape came in,

469
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:11,940
when we heard it, we went, oh my God, get
her on the air and don't take her off.

470
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,920
We could just live on Amy.

471
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,400
Now listen though Robert,

472
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,240
there's a reason why we were able
to get Amy Pearl on the show.

473
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,450
It's because of the pearls
that our listeners who are,

474
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,730
who feel precious but don't always do
the thing that precious things have to do

475
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:32,430
in order to keep other
precious things alive and well,

476
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,840
I don't know what that means,

477
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:37,710
but I think it was an attempt to say in
a poetic way that people who love the

478
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:42,540
podcast and give just a few
dollars make this work possible.

479
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,410
And exactly what was that? It?
Okay. And I want to add something.

480
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,040
We actually have some really
great radio labs swag. There is.

481
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,690
Yeah. There's a [inaudible].

482
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,790
Don't pretend you're not wearing
the hoodie all the time. Well,

483
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,000
it's a very warm hood. And
if that's not your bag,

484
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,740
there's a bag. Actually
there's a knit winter cap,

485
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,850
there's a t shirt, there's lots of
swag and it, you know what it is.

486
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,240
I feel like listeners, when
you wear the radio lab's swag,

487
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:16,500
I see you on the street and I am sure
of it. When we look at each other,

488
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:17,820
we give a little wink. Yeah.

489
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,810
But you can't get the swag without
making just a little donation.

490
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:26,640
And we ask you to do that. Oh, funny
you ask Robert, let me just tell you,

491
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,880
radiolab.org/donate or even easier if
you're in the u s text the word radio lab

492
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:36,870
to the number if you're on your
phone. Six, nine, eight, six,

493
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:37,770
six to get started.

494
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,400
Next up. A story about a boy,
his mom and Latif Nasser,

495
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:46,330
lots of his, our producer, he um, he
missed out when we broadcast this,

496
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:50,710
but he wanted to get into the game as
it were. And here's what happened next.

497
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,760
Yeah. And I actually chose

498
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,670
[inaudible] our football
episode, American football.

499
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:03,880
It was actually the first
episode I was on staff for I,

500
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:06,610
I fact checked it and it
had all kinds of things.

501
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:10,780
It had a story about the history of
football and the forward pass and the

502
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:13,990
Carlisle Indian team, but
it also had kind of what,

503
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:18,430
what is the big question now? Uh,
what's the future of the game?

504
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,520
And that question was
perfectly encapsulated by this
interview with this woman.

505
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,940
I'm Monet Bartell you could add something
like if you want, I'm Monae Bartelle.

506
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,610
I'm a Libra. I enjoy long walks
on the beach. I'm just joking.

507
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,000
So this story came to us from
our senior editor, Soren Wheeler,

508
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,960
who you just heard back there. And
basically the story goes like this.

509
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:45,990
So Monet Bartelle is from a family
that lives and breathes and believes

510
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,060
football. Her Dad, Mel Pharr,

511
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,380
the superstar was a star running
back for the Detroit lions.

512
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,850
He was a two time pro bowler.

513
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:58,720
Both her brothers were professional
football players. And so for Monet,

514
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:00,430
when she had her first son Parker,

515
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,840
as soon as the doctor saw his third thumb,

516
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,650
like, dude, we're going to the NFL baby.

517
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,570
Yes. And then Parker's 10,001
ounce. He's the biggest thing.

518
00:31:16,571 --> 00:31:17,670
He walked out the wound,

519
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,700
I'm still going with third until Monet.

520
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:26,910
She signed Parker up to play in a league
when he was four years old and they

521
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,690
immediately, they named him the tank.
The moment he gets on the field,

522
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,580
he is just plowing through kids
getting touchdown after touchdown tay.

523
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,410
But this is where things get complicated
because while Parker is on the field

524
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:42,610
just dominating,

525
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,160
Mooney has a relative who played
football for a very long time and was

526
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,960
experiencing symptoms of CTE,
chronic traumatic encephalopathy,

527
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,130
which is what comes from like concussion
question after concussion symptoms

528
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:59,710
include memory loss,
sometimes bouts of anger.

529
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,920
In this case it was depression,

530
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,820
it was suicidal thoughts. It was,

531
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,050
it was getting phone calls like, Hey,

532
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,730
I need you to come get him because
he's having dangerous thoughts.

533
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:15,923
Yeah.

534
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:20,270
And Monet told us that eventually her
father started experiencing symptoms of

535
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,380
CTE as well.

536
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:26,650
And that put Monae in a very difficult
position because on the one hand she

537
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:29,720
believed that children
should not play football.

538
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,560
But then at the exact same time she
believed children should play football.

539
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,890
That it's a great sport
and ask for Parker.

540
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,160
When I asked Parker
how did he, the season,

541
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,810
his favorite things were the trophy
and the pizza party at the end.

542
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,460
He had no desire. You want to
play again next season? No,

543
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:54,230
there's no or favorite moment of this
whole story and a lot of listeners too was

544
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:59,060
when come sit with me, I
need to sit on your lap.

545
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:04,040
Parker comes home from school and sits
down with Soren and Monet and Soren asks

546
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:07,070
him, look, if you don't like football
anymore, do you like other sports

547
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,710
or do you really care about that evening?

548
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,950
I really want to do synchronized swimming.

549
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,540
Is that true? Is that true?

550
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,790
Wow. I'm mostly, because when
I saw something about it,

551
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:28,880
it looked kind of cool. Like um,

552
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,850
people are doing a lot
of cool swimming tricks.

553
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:35,210
So I kind of thought it
was something for me.

554
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,670
You playing me

555
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,610
synchronized swimming where this guy's
gonna come talk to me about football and

556
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:48,500
I'm going to tell him that I want to do
thicker nights. Right? No, you like it

557
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,400
this way and so, hello?
Hello? Hey Man. Hey,

558
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:56,234
how you doing?

559
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,230
Hey, I'm good with you. How are you?

560
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:02,140
You called Monet because at like every
time now that I see football in the

561
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:02,651
headlines,

562
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:07,600
I think of her and I wanted to
see how she was doing. All right.

563
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,370
Also like, like that tiny interview
with your son? Just uh, like I,

564
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,820
I think about it all the
time. He's kind of my hero.

565
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,490
It has grown legs.

566
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:22,550
I swear because of that interview I was
contacted about a month ago from ESPN.

567
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,510
Really

568
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:30,050
reached out to me and they came out
here and spent three days interviewing

569
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:32,450
Parker, following him around. Oh,

570
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:37,300
you can't tell Parker anything
now he thinks he's hot. S. H. I.

571
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,030
T he has now. You said in the
interview with ESPN and you know,

572
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:44,670
I know they were waiting for him to
say he was going to be a synchronized

573
00:34:44,671 --> 00:34:49,150
swimmer. Now he switched it up.
Now he wants to play dodge ball.

574
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,900
Hey, good sport. Although
there's a lot of,

575
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,860
there's a lot of like unlike synchronized
swimming, dodge ball, it's kind of a

576
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,400
contact sport. Yeah. He's not gonna he,

577
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,350
I don't even think he
plays bad fall in gym.

578
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,840
I just think this kid live some
embarrass, embarrassed the crap out of me.

579
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,570
But, um, the,

580
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:09,720
the series is about the level
of football and you know,

581
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,620
they said, aside from
Parkers, you know, let's

582
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,163
okay.

583
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,730
Residents in, in a fell,
in my immediate family,

584
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,210
it was the thing of that oxymoron.

585
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:28,211
The fact that I love football so much
and that football is still extremely,

586
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,400
you know, dangerous. You know,
my father passed away last,

587
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,640
oh my God, I'm so sorry. Oh yeah, yes.

588
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,740
The way in August of last year,

589
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,080
which I'm through with all for a loop.

590
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,660
My Dad was like the healthiest
person that we know and he, he,

591
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,360
he dropped dead. I talked
to him that morning. Uh,

592
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:53,010
it was a Monday and by 7:00 PM
that evening, he, he just, he just,

593
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,160
he just kind of slipped away. Um,

594
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,580
and we got his results back. Um, you know,

595
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:04,581
we did send his brain and spinal cord and
my dad was at stage three of four with

596
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,454
CTE.

597
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,880
Oh Wow. And that's the kind of thing you
can only find out after someone's dead.

598
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:13,380
Right, exactly. And was that, were you
sort of expecting that? Not at all.

599
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,573
Oh really?

600
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,650
My father suffered from CTE.

601
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:21,090
Bad jokingly would say my
having a conversation with
my dad towards the end of

602
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:21,924
his life, yeah.

603
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,950
Would be like a 51st dates
because my dad will tell him,

604
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,710
he'll, he'll talk to you like, Hey,
you remember such and such and such?

605
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,990
And I'm like, yeah, Dad, I remember, hey,

606
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,140
you remember such and such said my breath,

607
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,010
but

608
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,100
you don't really, you know,
you don't think about it.

609
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,750
And then getting the results of that
from my father, I'm like, God, you know,

610
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,170
stays for CTE is Mike Webster.

611
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,630
Uh, just to jump in here,

612
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:54,010
Mike Webster was a former professional
player who was suffering from Amnesia,

613
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,830
dementia, depression. He
died at the age of 50.

614
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,170
Dave for CTE. It's junior say out

615
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,280
junior. Say Al was another
former professional player,

616
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,650
shot himself in the chest at 43 years old.

617
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,850
Very four is something that these
families are suffering because they're

618
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,380
watching their loved ones
who can't take it anymore.

619
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,700
So they think that taking their
lives is the easiest way to go.

620
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:21,630
That's the only way to calm whatever it
is that's going on in their mind because

621
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:25,650
they can't even explain what's going on.
I'm thankful I didn't have to do that.

622
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,430
I cried when I watched junior, say
I was mom in the press conference.

623
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,700
I cry when I watch that because
I can't imagine as a mother,

624
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,450
um, as a sister, as a wife, as a daughter,

625
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:44,451
I can't imagine watching my dad or my
brothers or my uncle or my cousin go

626
00:37:46,321 --> 00:37:51,180
through life like that because both of
my brothers are exhibiting size now.

627
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,750
That's all I can really think
about is now what about them?

628
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,710
Yeah. So is there, what can
you do? What can they do?

629
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,260
That's the crazy thing. You
can't prepare for it. You can't,

630
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,940
you can't stop it.

631
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,360
There's absolutely nothing
you can do and fill with that.

632
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,040
Mine were at football every Friday
night cause my nephew plays.

633
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:23,500
He just got pumped up. You know,

634
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:28,810
I'm happy now that I can laugh and I
can smile because I was completely,

635
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,303
I,

636
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,760
I turned into like a vampire
when just out of nowhere.

637
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:41,470
When you're just okay, talk to you later.
Yeah. And then there never is a later.

638
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,850
Yeah. That, that's a tough one.

639
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,410
Did, did your dad, uh,
before he died, did,

640
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,100
how did your dad feel about
football? How did he feel about CTE?

641
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:54,530
How did he feel about all of this stuff?

642
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,330
If you asked my father,

643
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,900
he would tell you I would
not have changed a thing.

644
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,500
If you look at when my dad
was growing up, you know,

645
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:08,450
my dad was in an air where it
was separate but not equal.

646
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,820
He didn't have indoor plumbing.

647
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:15,020
He had to drink from a colored only
water fountain. My Dad would tell you,

648
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:17,600
he said, man, I ain't never had
a drink cold. Once I got to la,

649
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,320
he didn't even know what that feels
like. What is this going down my throat?

650
00:39:21,321 --> 00:39:24,770
So cool know. So being,

651
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,260
being smart and black wasn't enough.

652
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,510
If he would have been black
and didn't play football,

653
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,440
even as smart as my father was, where
would that have gotten him? You know,

654
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:37,310
wouldn't have gotten him to
two dinners at the White House.

655
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,880
Would it have gotten him, the private
jet would have gotten him the, you know,

656
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,650
the, the house and us,

657
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:47,651
these private school educations and all
that would being a smart black guy in

658
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:51,110
the early forties in the forties, would
that have, what would that have done?

659
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,570
He was able to build a life playing for
the Detroit lions who is owned by the

660
00:39:56,571 --> 00:40:01,340
Ford plant family. And then being
able to go and intern at Ford,

661
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,910
you know, in the off season and
then opening up a Ford dealership.

662
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,680
And then from there branching off to
what, 14 new car franchises. But she,

663
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,380
he left with, with all of us, um,

664
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,270
to be able to carry on that legacy
so it won't be in, in vain. Um,

665
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:22,760
we have started a foundation where
we're building on it little by little,

666
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:27,761
just trying to figure out where
and what avenues we want to go in.

667
00:40:27,981 --> 00:40:31,280
We know education is huge and you know,

668
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,530
that would just want to bring awareness,

669
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,730
especially to mothers who put their
young children in football as I did.

670
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,700
Just to be aware of what the dangers are.

671
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,200
Are you willing to sign up
for that? So now I'm going to,

672
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:51,600
I'm really thinking of tricking
Parker and it becoming like

673
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,410
kicker [inaudible] a kicker.

674
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,200
It's tricky but however he
is his middle school math.

675
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,320
Oh really? Well I was, I was
the mascot of my high school.

676
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:10,070
What is here was I was Griffy the Griffin.

677
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,630
Yeah, Parker is the alligator.
I forgot the alligator's name

678
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:18,790
definitely. But he's the alligators.
How does he like being the alligator?

679
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,550
He loves it and he has like
a costume that he wears.

680
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:26,610
He wears an entire furry head and
everything like eating up into some kid.

681
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,190
Who is this kid? He, he,

682
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,890
he starts Babin and like
he's this other kid.

683
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,860
And so my husband, the first
thing my husband says is

684
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,230
he's like the mascot cause
they still get a ring, right?

685
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,090
No

686
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,850
now I'm like we're going to
keep you in mascot tourism,

687
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,940
whatever it's called because
there's scholarships. Yeah.

688
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,440
And a lot of them will be
their mascot scholarship. Yeah.

689
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,990
Our mascot scholarship. No.

690
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,190
Yes. I know I'm thinking way ahead of
time. He's only in the fifth grade.

691
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,011
So is he like,

692
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:03,890
he's developing like dance moves
or like are there signature merits?

693
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,520
He gets it on Fridays. He
greets the kids in the morning.

694
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:09,620
He's got to get there early, you know,

695
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:13,490
put on his costume and he's out there in
the Carpool lane greeting kids as they

696
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:16,700
come to school. He does the
special events at the school.

697
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:20,330
Like he did the fall festival
and the trunk or treat

698
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,620
a man.

699
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,650
One of his teachers won teacher of the
year award so he got to go to the teacher

700
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:26,660
of the year award ceremony.

701
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,720
Well as a mascot, like he's
just living it up. I hope he,

702
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:35,890
he wins all the mascot scholarships
and everywhere and makes it pro,

703
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:41,240
you know, is it is it's probably cut
throat to go pro for mascots. Yeah.

704
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:45,250
I don't know how that goes. I don't
even know how that goes. I have no idea.

705
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,340
Even when we get there and how much do
they get paid, you know, all these other,

706
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:49,810
but Parker off, let's be an engineer.

707
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,940
Okay. I'm sure he could do both.
He could do both. Absolutely.

708
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,280
Thinking about what you
said about your dad,

709
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:01,310
I hope for Parker that he will
be able to get that engineering,

710
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,340
you know, that being smart will be
enough. Or, or if he wants to be a mascot,

711
00:43:05,341 --> 00:43:08,190
he can get all the scholarships,
go to whatever school he wants.

712
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:12,080
He does not have to put his body in
harm's way if he doesn't want to.

713
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:16,540
Right. He doesn't have to.
My oldest nephew, um, Trey,

714
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,200
he until recently had the title
as the smartest kid in the family.

715
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:21,810
He,

716
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,440
he played football, but he made a
plan, hey, I don't want to go pro.

717
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,060
I'm going to play in college,

718
00:43:27,061 --> 00:43:30,680
but I'm gonna go to a college that's
going to give me a head start.

719
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:34,830
So she went to Brown. Wow, great
at Brown, won a ring, did well,

720
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:38,460
and now he's off doing his
brown thing in San Francisco,

721
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:41,640
making great money as a young
black guy because he was smart,

722
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:46,200
not because of football. So what? I
love to see my son in a football jersey.

723
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:50,790
Sure. But am I thrilled to see
him in the alligator outfit?

724
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,283
Absolutely.

725
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,293
Yeah.

726
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:07,180
So we can't offer you listeners a mascot
scholarship that is really beyond our

727
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:07,900
reach and we,

728
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,080
and then you'd have to choose your
animal and we'd have to make the uniform.

729
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:14,800
Yes. So we can't, it's
comp. It's a hard, it's fun,

730
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,270
but it's a hard world. So
we're going to streamline when,

731
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:23,370
when we think about you, instead of
thinking about animals or Griffons,

732
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:24,483
it's about those guys.

733
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:30,540
We're going to just think of you
as I'm generous and now minutiae.

734
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,630
Yes. If I wanted to be generous, yes.

735
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,610
What would I choose to do?

736
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,700
You would go to
radiolab.org/donate or even easier.

737
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:49,200
You could text the word Radiolab to the
number six nine eight six six to get

738
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:51,720
started. A little form pops up, Robert,

739
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,220
and you can donate in a matter of seconds
and then you can go back to thinking

740
00:44:56,221 --> 00:45:01,221
how awesome radio labs first
spin off was two more perfect.

741
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:05,640
More of that's going to be coming up in
2017 you mentioned that because a lot of

742
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:10,641
the people who've been listening to us
to this past year noticed and or join,

743
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,270
okay. A whole lot of people that we never
heard from before became listeners to

744
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,490
something we call more perfect.

745
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,550
It just show about the Supreme
Court of the United States.

746
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,420
We thought of it because we thought
the supreme court was going to be

747
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:27,390
interesting. And now of
course with 2017 yeah,

748
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,660
we were right in spades because what's
going to happen next year is gotta be,

749
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:37,590
is this mean what will be near the center
of a lot of conversations for a lot of

750
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:42,591
people in 2017 so this more perfect Joe
is coming back in the spring of 2017

751
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:48,510
more episodes. And so people who want to
hear it again, it's coming. But listen,

752
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:52,410
here's the thing. Listener support is
a critical component of more perfect.

753
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,730
It's a critical component of radio
lab. Any amount that you can give,

754
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,550
just make a gift any amount, make a gift,

755
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,530
and show that you
understand that this is the,

756
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,040
the time to get a year end tax deductible.

757
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,350
It's also the time for us to be talking
about things that matter in a year where

758
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,390
these will matter a lot. So, so yeah,

759
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,540
we'd like you to join us both because
you want to and just because we think you

760
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:20,340
should right now, if you know what
I mean. Forget my drift next Robert.

761
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:25,170
A story that captures that spirit of
doing for others in a way that few can.

762
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,460
Hi, my name is Tracy

763
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:26,860
hunt.

764
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,970
I'm a reporter here at radio lab and I
wanted to talk to someone who has a very

765
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:35,770
different relationship with giving.
Oh, Sarah. Hello. Sarah Gray. Oh, hi.

766
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:38,500
There you are. How are you? I'm
good. I'm so good. Thank you.

767
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,440
Sarah was the star of a show that we
did a little while back called grace

768
00:46:41,441 --> 00:46:42,274
donation.

769
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,160
I guess I'm like a little
bit in your nerd famous now,

770
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,690
your nurse Venus. What is the
weight? What does that mean?

771
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,430
Um, well just nerds know who I am. You
know nerds who listen to radio lab.

772
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,040
Just a quick recap.

773
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,290
Sara told us a story about how she was
pregnant with twins, Thomas and Callum,

774
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:02,810
and something was wrong with Thomas.

775
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,790
Doctors told her that he had NSF Lilly
being born and he said he could see that

776
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:12,050
because one of the twins had around skull
and the other one had a bumpy skull.

777
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,910
She ended up giving birth to both of
them and Thomas died six days later.

778
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,620
And then right then we called
the Washington regional
transplant community and

779
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:26,580
they sent a van over to our house and
they picked up his body and took him to d

780
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,950
c children's medical center.

781
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,310
So the story was about how Sarah
ended up going on this journey,

782
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:39,910
trying to find out what happened to all
the bits and pieces of Thomas that were

783
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:41,980
donated. So she talked about, for example,

784
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:45,670
going to Duke University where they
were using cord blood from her twins and

785
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,160
they were actually researching the
disease that killed Thomas Aniceph Lee and

786
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:54,020
going to university of Pennsylvania and
talking to women there who was studying

787
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:58,490
this eye cancer that mostly affects
children and called retinoblastoma.

788
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:01,220
Eventually Sarah and
Ross visited a as lab.

789
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,760
She gave them a tour and she
sewed them Thomas's retina.

790
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:09,740
She still has samples of it
in her freezer. Tiny little,

791
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,840
I don't know, tiny little vials,

792
00:48:11,841 --> 00:48:16,580
maybe a third the size of your pinky
filled with frozen liquid liquified retina

793
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,290
already. It didn't look like much,

794
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:22,940
but it was amazing to think of how
many people were involved getting these

795
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:26,870
samples. They're like, we had to approve
it. We had to fill out this paperwork,

796
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:29,720
then the doctor had to come and remove
the highs. The NYSE had to be processed,

797
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,640
and then I'd have to be shipped up there.

798
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:35,600
Then they have to do whatever
DNA process they do and just how,

799
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:41,090
I don't know, valuable, maybe
even priceless. The sample is,

800
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:45,500
since the show came out, she's released
a book called an everlasting life.

801
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,730
And I just really wanted to get on the
phone with her and just talk about what

802
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:53,210
the impact of the show has been
and what's going on with her life.

803
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,330
And one of the first things I found
out was that she had a new baby.

804
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,360
Yes. We have a baby girl that
she was just born in June.

805
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:03,180
Oh, congratulations. Thank
you. And how's Callum doing?

806
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,390
He's doing great.

807
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,860
This is Thomas his brother.

808
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,900
He can now read a little bit
because in first grade, um,

809
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,030
and he's liking his sister. Yeah.

810
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,400
What, what have you told him about Thomas?

811
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,370
So he knows that he had a brother
who was a twin who had a very, very,

812
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,720
very bad booboo on his head.
Yeah. And that's why he died. Um,

813
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:28,250
and we just explained, you
know, um, sometimes kids die.

814
00:49:28,251 --> 00:49:29,960
That's just part of
life. People, you know,

815
00:49:29,961 --> 00:49:33,860
they get diseases just like
grown up and it's okay to die.

816
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,880
Does he ask you questions about Thomas?

817
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,410
Yeah, we visited the grave maybe
one or two times a year. And um,

818
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:44,140
when he was younger he asked, um,
is Tom Scared under the stone?

819
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:44,561
So,

820
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:48,430
and he was probably maybe two or three
questions like that were hard because I,

821
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,910
you know, I don't know how
to explain the afterlife.

822
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,030
I don't understand it myself. Yeah. So
I just told him no, he's not scared.

823
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:01,120
Um, you know, he thinks of Thomas as
being in heaven, but he also asked me,

824
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:04,990
you know, can you tell me what does it
like in heaven? And I said, um, you know,

825
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:08,350
I was really like sort of wringing my
hands. Like, oh, what do I say? I said,

826
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,580
um, well, you know,

827
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:13,120
some people think it's a place you go
when you die and some people think it's

828
00:50:13,121 --> 00:50:17,290
got clouds and, and Callum just goes,
um, no, look it up on your phone

829
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,040
like you wanted the pictures. Yeah.
Well, look, I just looked up on my phone,

830
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:28,190
I'm like, you know, just be real. Be
Real. But this is what people think. Yeah.

831
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,540
Can you show me a picture of God?

832
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,150
You don't?

833
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,950
Yeah. Sometimes it's hard
and then sometimes it's
easy. It's kind of a mixture.

834
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,920
Yeah, that's it. And also since the
show, um, Sarah has kept on donating.

835
00:50:41,921 --> 00:50:44,350
In fact, when her
daughter Jocelyn was born,

836
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:44,920
um,

837
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,920
I was inspired to donate the placenta
and the umbilical cord was turned into

838
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:55,210
four different skin grafts that are going
to be used in surgeries and for burn

839
00:50:55,211 --> 00:50:58,840
survivors and also the umbilical
cord blood went to research,

840
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,800
but also she's been inspired to track
down the people who have donated things to

841
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:04,130
her.

842
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,780
As I was writing my book, I got this
idea for checking down the blood donors

843
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,730
when she was in the
hospital with the twins.

844
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,890
She actually had a traumatic delivery.

845
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,920
She lost half of her blood and she
ended up getting a transfusion from 11

846
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:19,250
different blood donors.

847
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:23,500
So I emailed the blood bank and I've
met with them and they have sent out a

848
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,740
thank you letter from
me to those 11 people.

849
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:28,160
And when Sarah was in the
hospital with Jocelyn,

850
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,710
Jocelyn actually got
some donated breast milk

851
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,180
and I ended up saving the
bottle, actually framed it.

852
00:51:34,181 --> 00:51:38,010
I keep it in my office because just tears
me up to think of strangers donating

853
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:41,530
things to each other. But I emailed
the breast milk place and I said,

854
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,200
this is my donor id for the
breast milk. Can you tell me who?

855
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,780
Who are the people that donated the
smell? Can I send them a thank you?

856
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,010
And this is all kind of like, I know I
sound like a donation Weirdo, but uh,

857
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,050
you know, it's like you
receive and you give.

858
00:51:53,051 --> 00:51:56,350
And I just think it's neat to make the
connection and find out how that really

859
00:51:56,351 --> 00:51:57,180
work.

860
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,220
Since we recorded the episode with you,

861
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:03,470
have you heard any like anything new
come out of the research using your son's

862
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,580
tissues?

863
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:09,580
So there a study that came out on
tissue that could be my son's cornea,

864
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:11,080
this lab in Boston.

865
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,570
They've been studying corneal blindness
because when your corneas are damaged,

866
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,530
those cells,

867
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,400
once you lose them,
they're never coming back.

868
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,450
They don't regenerate. They're just dead.

869
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,470
That's what people have corneal blindness.

870
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,840
And so they're trying to figure
out ways to regenerate them. So

871
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,550
they took corneal cells
and they wounded them

872
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,320
and then added umbilical
cord blood to those cells

873
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:37,510
and they found some early stage steps to
show that these corneal cells might be

874
00:52:37,511 --> 00:52:39,310
able to regenerate with stem cells,

875
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:43,330
which I believe is kind of what they're
getting at as a possible stem cell.

876
00:52:43,331 --> 00:52:45,100
Eyedrops to get your vision back.

877
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,083
Oh Wow.

878
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,680
So this is like way, way, way in the
future, but at the beginning of, you know,

879
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:53,590
what if situation that, what if
we could make eyedrops like this?

880
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,600
You check like the, the research
often. How often do you,

881
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,230
whenever I feel like it,

882
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,630
does it feel like you're kind of

883
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:08,550
like kind of continuing your relationship
with Thomas in some way by checking on

884
00:53:08,741 --> 00:53:09,470
these things?

885
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:14,030
I don't, I don't know what you call
it. I feel like Thomas, um, you know,

886
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:19,031
he lived and he died and he made this
contribution and I'm like a spectator kind

887
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:24,920
of watching how his contribution

888
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,920
effecting other people. Yeah. And I'm,

889
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:33,780
I'm more like learning from him
then having a relationship with him,

890
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:34,930
but I know, yeah,

891
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:38,510
yeah, yeah. I, yeah, I'm not sure if
that relationship is the right word.

892
00:53:38,511 --> 00:53:43,040
I was just trying to like, it's almost,
I dunno, I don't want to say like,

893
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,370
it's like he's still there and
nothing like that. I just, you know,

894
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,050
like he's like,

895
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:51,710
he's still very much a part
of your life in some way.

896
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:56,340
Yeah. He's still relevant. Yeah. His
life did not just affect my family,

897
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,520
his life affected many other people.

898
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,650
And in fact, Sarah told me that
eight months after the show came out,

899
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:05,560
she heard from this couple in Cali,

900
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,980
husband and wife in California,

901
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:12,540
they had twins and unfortunately one
of them died unexpectedly and I believe

902
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:17,370
they asked could they donate on the group
said you cannot donate for transplant

903
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,670
because your child is too small. And
I said, well, we heard radio lab,

904
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:24,840
can we donate to research?
And they said yes.

905
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:29,250
And their daughter was able to donate
eight different tissues to eight different

906
00:54:29,251 --> 00:54:30,010
studies.

907
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:30,970
Oh my goodness.

908
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,960
Yeah. And in fact the retinas

909
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:34,030
[inaudible]

910
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,560
we went to the same um,

911
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:40,110
lab and the same researcher
that received my son's retinas.

912
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,533
Oh Wow.

913
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,530
I know. Oh.

914
00:54:42,531 --> 00:54:45,770
And the other weird thing is that they're
twins were born on the exact same day

915
00:54:45,771 --> 00:54:46,604
as my twins

916
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:51,860
pets. Oh my goodness. That's so, that's
so powerful. I don't know. I'm really,

917
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,380
I'm really kind of speechless
at that. No, that happened.

918
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:58,270
It did for me at least bring back.
So, you know, when my child, I,

919
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,840
you feel like you have no control,

920
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:05,730
but being able to donate gave me a
sense of control back that, you know,

921
00:55:05,731 --> 00:55:08,130
at least this is, this is
one thing I can control.

922
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:09,223
Right.

923
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:13,350
So I was glad that it had that
impression. It had that effect on them.

924
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:21,560
Sarah talking to me about trying to
regain a sense of control and the face of

925
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,450
unimaginable grief reminded
me of something else she
said at the end of grace

926
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:28,284
donation.

927
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,440
I used to think like the universe
treated people the way it should.

928
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:38,900
And now I don't really believe that,
but, um, I do believe that there are,

929
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:40,310
um,

930
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:45,310
really amazing kind people in the world
and science and medicine has something

931
00:55:47,871 --> 00:55:48,704
to do with that.

932
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:55,220
I started feeling that these were Thomas'
colleagues in his coworkers and that

933
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:59,090
he was a valuable partner in this
important research that was being done.

934
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:02,000
And I felt even more fundamental shifts,

935
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:06,650
almost like I had felt like I was a
boat on an ocean that was like rocky and

936
00:56:06,651 --> 00:56:10,910
choppy with waves. And I had this
feeling that I am not the boat.

937
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:11,953
I'm the ocean.

938
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:18,070
Like the decisions that I make are
changing other people as opposed to just,

939
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:23,900
I'm about getting slapped with
waves all the time. [inaudible]

940
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,290
it has made me feel

941
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,493
powerful.

942
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:40,300
[inaudible].
