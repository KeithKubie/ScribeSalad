support for nostalgic controller I spent

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.010
support for nostalgic controller I spent
 

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.740
support for nostalgic controller I spent
lots for my nostalgic controller so I'm

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:44.750
lots for my nostalgic controller so I'm
 

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.450

your game as being incremental and then
 

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.910
your game as being incremental and then
I find the menus don't navigate there

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920
I find the menus don't navigate there
 

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.830

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360
ship games that really support
 

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.720
ship games that really support
controllers in menus and in the game if

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:04.730
controllers in menus and in the game if
 

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.010

you're going to have elaborate
 

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.200
you're going to have elaborate
configuration screens great but also

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:08.210
configuration screens great but also
 

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.630
configuration screens great but also
have great defaults almost every

controller will work well in menus with

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:12.230
controller will work well in menus with
 

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.470
controller will work well in menus with
these settings and if your game only

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480
these settings and if your game only
 

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.150
these settings and if your game only
needs digital controls or buttons this

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160
needs digital controls or buttons this
 

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.390
needs digital controls or buttons this
will be a great set of defaults one

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:19.400
will be a great set of defaults one
 

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.340
will be a great set of defaults one
thing to note is that I suggest

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:21.350
thing to note is that I suggest
 

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.650
thing to note is that I suggest
supporting both d-pad Center and a and

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:23.660
supporting both d-pad Center and a and
 

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.930

the reason for this is that well you

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:25.940
the reason for this is that well you

know most hid controllers will have

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:27.830
know most hid controllers will have
 

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.590
know most hid controllers will have
these buttons and we do a great job of

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600
these buttons and we do a great job of
 

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.600
these buttons and we do a great job of
mapping these two reasonable defaults

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:31.610
mapping these two reasonable defaults
 

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.230

reason we decided to map both a and B to
 

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.150
reason we decided to map both a and B to
the back button and this doesn't really

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160
the back button and this doesn't really
 

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.590
the back button and this doesn't really
make sense to most users as they are

if you handle the analog event you must

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.100
if you handle the analog event you must
 

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.710
if you handle the analog event you must
handle the hats which event as well if

you just do that and the items purchased

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:46.830
you just do that and the items purchased
 

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.960
you just do that and the items purchased
right it's no problem

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:47.970
right it's no problem
 

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.090
right it's no problem
wait don't you have to do more than that

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100
wait don't you have to do more than that
 

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.830
wait don't you have to do more than that
more than that okay I'm actually

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:51.840
more than that okay I'm actually

actually have to have the code that

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:55.170
actually have to have the code that
 

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.680
actually have to have the code that
handles the approaches state changes but

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:57.690

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.330
handles the approaches state changes but
then that's still not that complicated

00:11:59.330 --> 00:11:59.340
then that's still not that complicated
 

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.760
then that's still not that complicated
but what if the app is sleeping okay if

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:01.770
but what if the app is sleeping okay if
 

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.170
but what if the app is sleeping okay if
the app is sleeping when that happens

the app is sleeping when that happens
then you should probably just add a

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:04.950
then you should probably just add a
 

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.440
then you should probably just add a
broadcast receiver just to make sure you

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:06.450
broadcast receiver just to make sure you
 

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.880
broadcast receiver just to make sure you
don't miss that mastered but but that's

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:07.890
don't miss that mastered but but that's
 

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.620
don't miss that mastered but but that's
super a symptom but broadcast receivers

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:09.630
super a symptom but broadcast receivers
 

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.970
super a symptom but broadcast receivers
can't run for a long time so what do you

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980
can't run for a long time so what do you
 

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.350
can't run for a long time so what do you
have to do lots of database worker

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360
have to do lots of database worker
 

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.720

applications have to do that right so

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:16.260
applications have to do that right so
 

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.040
applications have to do that right so
it's you should probably just add a very

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.050
it's you should probably just add a very
 

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.510
it's you should probably just add a very
simple and straightforward service

simple and straightforward service
something kind of like that and that's

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940
something kind of like that and that's
 

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.610
something kind of like that and that's
gonna take care of hemming that for you

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620
gonna take care of hemming that for you
 

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.720
gonna take care of hemming that for you
as you can see the code is very

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:26.730
as you can see the code is very
 

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.100
as you can see the code is very
straightforward and simple to understand

but what if you're using managed items

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:31.350
but what if you're using managed items
 

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.660
but what if you're using managed items
don't you need to make sure that you

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:32.670
don't you need to make sure that you
 

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.130
don't you need to make sure that you
persist those because you can't call

sure that you store the purchases and
then you don't have to make the calls

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:46.710
then you don't have to make the calls
 

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:47.270
then you don't have to make the calls
all the time

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:47.280
all the time
 

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.490
all the time
oh and and they should also obfuscate

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.500
oh and and they should also obfuscate
 

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.410
oh and and they should also obfuscate
that some way because otherwise user

alter so it's but it's still pretty

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:55.860
alter so it's but it's still pretty
 

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.290

you don't believe me so why does it get

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:00.150
you don't believe me so why does it get
 

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.810
you don't believe me so why does it get
so complicated let's start with with the

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820
so complicated let's start with with the
 

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.370
so complicated let's start with with the
simplest possible case so the user just

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380
simplest possible case so the user just
 

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.230
simplest possible case so the user just
wants to buy something and they buy

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240
wants to buy something and they buy
 

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.850
wants to buy something and they buy
something and it gets delivered to the

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860
something and it gets delivered to the
 

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.240
something and it gets delivered to the
app so so far no problem right thanks

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:11.250
app so so far no problem right thanks
 

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:11.690

bro
 

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.510
bro
exactly so not a problem so far but

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:14.520
exactly so not a problem so far but
 

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.060
exactly so not a problem so far but
suppose that instead the app is sleeping

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:17.070
suppose that instead the app is sleeping
 

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.269
suppose that instead the app is sleeping
what happens in that case in that

00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279
what happens in that case in that
 

00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:21.189
what happens in that case in that
case if the app is not running sleeping

00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199
case if the app is not running sleeping
 

00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:22.869

or something else a different guy has to

00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:22.879
or something else a different guy has to
 

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:24.160
or something else a different guy has to
pick up the package that guy is a

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.170
pick up the package that guy is a
 

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.110
pick up the package that guy is a
broadcast receiver and then that guy has

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120
broadcast receiver and then that guy has
 

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.249
broadcast receiver and then that guy has
to take care of delivering the package

00:13:27.249 --> 00:13:27.259
to take care of delivering the package
 

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:29.170
to take care of delivering the package
to the app when it makes when it wakes

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:29.180
to the app when it makes when it wakes
 

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.079
to the app when it makes when it wakes
up thanks bro exactly and that's when

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:32.089
up thanks bro exactly and that's when
 

00:13:32.089 --> 00:13:33.610
up thanks bro exactly and that's when
problems can happen because suppose that

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:33.620
problems can happen because suppose that
 

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.100
problems can happen because suppose that
that guy is not as reliable as you think

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:36.110
that guy is not as reliable as you think
 

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.840
that guy is not as reliable as you think
and he drops the package or loses the

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:37.850
and he drops the package or loses the
 

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.139
and he drops the package or loses the
package so in v2 there actually many

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:41.149
package so in v2 there actually many
 

00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:42.790

components I have to work together to

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800
components I have to work together to
 

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.079
components I have to work together to
ensure that the users purchase is

00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:44.089
ensure that the users purchase is
 

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:45.670
ensure that the users purchase is
handled correctly and it can get a

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680
handled correctly and it can get a
 

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.829
handled correctly and it can get a
little complicated in comparison here is

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839
little complicated in comparison here is
 

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:50.290
little complicated in comparison here is
what the version 3 diagram looks like no

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:50.300
what the version 3 diagram looks like no
 

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.519
what the version 3 diagram looks like no
actually let's let's use more of the

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:51.529
actually let's let's use more of the
 

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:53.259
actually let's let's use more of the
slide for that that's not gonna fit

00:13:53.259 --> 00:13:53.269
slide for that that's not gonna fit
 

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:56.049
slide for that that's not gonna fit
let's use a full slide yeah that's

00:13:56.049 --> 00:13:56.059
let's use a full slide yeah that's
 

00:13:56.059 --> 00:13:58.420
let's use a full slide yeah that's
better so the diagram for a v3 is very

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:58.430
better so the diagram for a v3 is very
 

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.489
better so the diagram for a v3 is very
simple but it has seven sub components

00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:00.499
simple but it has seven sub components
 

00:14:00.499 --> 00:14:01.689
simple but it has seven sub components
and we're gonna spend the next several

00:14:01.689 --> 00:14:01.699
and we're gonna spend the next several
 

00:14:01.699 --> 00:14:02.889
and we're gonna spend the next several
minutes discussing each of the

00:14:02.889 --> 00:14:02.899
minutes discussing each of the
 

00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:04.840
minutes discussing each of the
components separate components and also

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:04.850
components separate components and also
 

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.670
components separate components and also
the sub sub components and they're

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:06.680
the sub sub components and they're
 

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.660
the sub sub components and they're

exactly actually just kidding this is

00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:10.249
exactly actually just kidding this is
 

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:11.889
exactly actually just kidding this is
the diagram for an ability 3 it's much

00:14:11.889 --> 00:14:11.899
the diagram for an ability 3 it's much
 

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:13.749
the diagram for an ability 3 it's much
simpler right so the main improvement a

00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759
simpler right so the main improvement a
 

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:16.059
simpler right so the main improvement a
v3 is that API calls are now synchronous

00:14:16.059 --> 00:14:16.069
v3 is that API calls are now synchronous
 

00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:17.590
v3 is that API calls are now synchronous
so this means that your application can

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600
so this means that your application can
 

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.629
so this means that your application can
get a response right away and it's much

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639
get a response right away and it's much
 

00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:20.949
get a response right away and it's much
more straightforward to think about -

00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959
more straightforward to think about -
 

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:22.030
more straightforward to think about -
for instance if you want to buy

for instance if you want to buy
something like 50 gold coins all they

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:24.170
something like 50 gold coins all they
 

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.299
something like 50 gold coins all they
have to do is make a request that looks

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:25.309
have to do is make a request that looks
 

00:14:25.309 --> 00:14:27.639
have to do is make a request that looks
something like buy 50 gold coins and

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:27.649
something like buy 50 gold coins and
 

00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:30.519
something like buy 50 gold coins and
guess what if the purchase is okay the

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:30.529
guess what if the purchase is okay the
 

00:14:30.529 --> 00:14:31.929
guess what if the purchase is okay the

00:14:31.939 --> 00:14:36.429
API is going to return something that's
pretty simple like say ok and if you

00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:36.439
pretty simple like say ok and if you
 

00:14:36.439 --> 00:14:38.379
pretty simple like say ok and if you
have if you're used to v2 you probably

00:14:38.379 --> 00:14:38.389
have if you're used to v2 you probably
 

00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:40.240
have if you're used to v2 you probably
remember that listing the items that are

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.250
remember that listing the items that are
 

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.490
remember that listing the items that are
owned by a particular user is a very

expensive operation so you couldn't call

00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:44.389
expensive operation so you couldn't call
 

00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:47.110
expensive operation so you couldn't call
it all the time so you had to do that

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120
it all the time so you had to do that
 

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.240
it all the time so you had to do that
very sparingly so you your whole code

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:49.250
very sparingly so you your whole code
 

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.220

that calling restore purchases is
 

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.730
that calling restore purchases is
actually very cheap and you can do that

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:03.740
actually very cheap and you can do that
 

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.410

then over the years you've probably
 

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:18.939
then over the years you've probably
grown a healthy mistrust of people that

don't show you any code so let's start

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040
don't show you any code so let's start
 

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.499
don't show you any code so let's start
with the sales and move on to something

00:15:23.499 --> 00:15:23.509
with the sales and move on to something

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:31.100
user is probably not going to be a user
 

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.410
user is probably not going to be a user
anymore so that's something to be

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:32.420
anymore so that's something to be
 

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.840
anymore so that's something to be
avoided so this is why version 3

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:34.850
avoided so this is why version 3
 

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.280
avoided so this is why version 3

at that point your application is going
to consume the potion and then give me a

full hit my bar so that's how it works
um that's a perfectly good method but it

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:44.190
um that's a perfectly good method but it
 

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.550
um that's a perfectly good method but it
has a significant limitation so it has

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:46.560
has a significant limitation so it has
 

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.140

00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220
without paying I don't really know what
 

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.340
without paying I don't really know what
the technical term is but I'll say

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:01.350
the technical term is but I'll say
 

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.710
the technical term is but I'll say
they're pirates mostly because we spent

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720
they're pirates mostly because we spent
 

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.760
they're pirates mostly because we spent
a really long time drawing this

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:04.770
a really long time drawing this
 

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.230
a really long time drawing this
character and I had to use it somewhere

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240
character and I had to use it somewhere
 

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.570
character and I had to use it somewhere
so every time you see a purchase in your

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580
so every time you see a purchase in your
 

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.730
so every time you see a purchase in your
application you should ask yourself is

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740
application you should ask yourself is
 

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.409
application you should ask yourself is
that purchase legitimate

00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419
that purchase legitimate
 

00:22:12.419 --> 00:22:14.779
that purchase legitimate
and a pilot's job is going to be to try

00:22:14.779 --> 00:22:14.789
and a pilot's job is going to be to try
 

00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:17.060
and a pilot's job is going to be to try
to convince you that it is and your job

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:17.070
to convince you that it is and your job
 

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.389
to convince you that it is and your job
is to detect that they're lying no one

00:22:20.389 --> 00:22:20.399
is to detect that they're lying no one
 

00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:21.830
is to detect that they're lying no one
can actually stop piracy all together I

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840
can actually stop piracy all together I
 

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.840
can actually stop piracy all together I
would be lying to you if I said as much

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:23.850
would be lying to you if I said as much
 

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.820
would be lying to you if I said as much
but you can actually make life pretty

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:25.830
but you can actually make life pretty
 

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.619
but you can actually make life pretty
hard for pirates so here are some

00:22:27.619 --> 00:22:27.629
hard for pirates so here are some
 

00:22:27.629 --> 00:22:29.450
hard for pirates so here are some
defenses you can employ developer

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460
defenses you can employ developer
 

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.099
defenses you can employ developer
payload signature verification and

00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:31.109
payload signature verification and
 

00:22:31.109 --> 00:22:33.830
payload signature verification and
server-side validation let's talk about

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840
server-side validation let's talk about
 

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.080
server-side validation let's talk about
developer payload developer payload is

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:36.090
developer payload developer payload is
 

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.460
developer payload developer payload is
actually something really simple it's

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:37.470
actually something really simple it's
 

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.049
actually something really simple it's
just a tag that gets attached to every

00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:39.059
just a tag that gets attached to every
 

00:22:39.059 --> 00:22:41.180
just a tag that gets attached to every
purchase and whenever you query for that

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:41.190
purchase and whenever you query for that
 

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.580
purchase and whenever you query for that
purchase it comes back with it so you

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:43.590
purchase it comes back with it so you
 

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.139
purchase it comes back with it so you
should use it to identify the owner of

00:22:45.139 --> 00:22:45.149
should use it to identify the owner of
 

00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:46.430
should use it to identify the owner of
the purchase and the reason why you want

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440
the purchase and the reason why you want
 

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.869
the purchase and the reason why you want
to identify the owner of the purchase is

00:22:47.869 --> 00:22:47.879
to identify the owner of the purchase is
 

00:22:47.879 --> 00:22:50.989
to identify the owner of the purchase is
to prevent a replay attack so how how

00:22:50.989 --> 00:22:50.999
to prevent a replay attack so how how
 

00:22:50.999 --> 00:22:54.019
to prevent a replay attack so how how
does that kind of attack work ok so

00:22:54.019 --> 00:22:54.029
does that kind of attack work ok so
 

00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:56.210
does that kind of attack work ok so
again that's me a stick figure again

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220
again that's me a stick figure again
 

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.889
again that's me a stick figure again
like everyone else

00:22:57.889 --> 00:22:57.899
like everyone else
 

00:22:57.899 --> 00:22:59.720
like everyone else
not only I have a hit point bar but I

00:22:59.720 --> 00:22:59.730
not only I have a hit point bar but I
 

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.029
not only I have a hit point bar but I
also have an evil twin says that guy

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039
also have an evil twin says that guy
 

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:04.729
also have an evil twin says that guy
over there that guy apart from having a

over there that guy apart from having a
goatee isn't very honest and last week

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440
goatee isn't very honest and last week
 

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.139
goatee isn't very honest and last week
he actually picked up my phone and did a

00:23:09.139 --> 00:23:09.149
he actually picked up my phone and did a
 

00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:10.970
he actually picked up my phone and did a
database dump on the items I had and

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:10.980
database dump on the items I had and
 

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.769
database dump on the items I had and
then tried to replay them on his device

00:23:12.769 --> 00:23:12.779
then tried to replay them on his device
 

00:23:12.779 --> 00:23:15.680
then tried to replay them on his device
hoping to get items from free so when

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:15.690
hoping to get items from free so when
 

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.810
hoping to get items from free so when
owner my evil twin runs your application

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820
owner my evil twin runs your application
 

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.519
owner my evil twin runs your application
you'll check what items he owns and

00:23:19.519 --> 00:23:19.529
you'll check what items he owns and
 

00:23:19.529 --> 00:23:22.460
you'll check what items he owns and
you'll see this purchase now all they

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:22.470
you'll see this purchase now all they
 

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:23.570
you'll see this purchase now all they
have to do is check the developer

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580
have to do is check the developer
 

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.099
have to do is check the developer
payload and you know that it's a fake

00:23:25.099 --> 00:23:25.109
payload and you know that it's a fake
 

00:23:25.109 --> 00:23:26.989
payload and you know that it's a fake
because it says belong to Bruno and its

00:23:26.989 --> 00:23:26.999
because it says belong to Bruno and its
 

00:23:26.999 --> 00:23:28.970
because it says belong to Bruno and its
owner that's trying to use it and it's

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:28.980
owner that's trying to use it and it's
 

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.099
owner that's trying to use it and it's
it's hard for owner to fake that

00:23:31.099 --> 00:23:31.109
it's hard for owner to fake that
 

00:23:31.109 --> 00:23:33.200
it's hard for owner to fake that
developer payload because every purchase

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:33.210
developer payload because every purchase
 

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.749
developer payload because every purchase
is signed with a private key that we

00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:35.759
is signed with a private key that we
 

00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:37.789
is signed with a private key that we
only we have so it's very difficult for

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799
only we have so it's very difficult for
 

00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:40.580
only we have so it's very difficult for
for him to alter that signature so

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:40.590
for him to alter that signature so
 

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.560
for him to alter that signature so
speaking about signatures so what is

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:42.570
speaking about signatures so what is
 

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.509
speaking about signatures so what is
signature verification well every

00:23:44.509 --> 00:23:44.519
signature verification well every
 

00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:46.399
signature verification well every
application has a private key and a

00:23:46.399 --> 00:23:46.409
application has a private key and a
 

00:23:46.409 --> 00:23:48.139
application has a private key and a
public key the private key is known only

00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:48.149
public key the private key is known only
 

00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:49.789
public key the private key is known only
to Google and the private the public key

00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799
to Google and the private the public key
 

00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:51.889
to Google and the private the public key
is known to you every time we send a

00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:51.899
is known to you every time we send a
 

00:23:51.899 --> 00:23:53.989
is known to you every time we send a
partial response we sign that purchase

00:23:53.989 --> 00:23:53.999
partial response we sign that purchase
 

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:55.849
partial response we sign that purchase
with the private key and then you can

00:23:55.849 --> 00:23:55.859
with the private key and then you can
 

00:23:55.859 --> 00:23:57.379
with the private key and then you can
verify that signature with the public

00:23:57.379 --> 00:23:57.389
verify that signature with the public
 

00:23:57.389 --> 00:23:59.090
verify that signature with the public
key so this means that nobody else

00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100
key so this means that nobody else
 

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.190
key so this means that nobody else
outside of Google can actually send you

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200
outside of Google can actually send you
 

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.159
outside of Google can actually send you
a purchase a correctly signed purchase

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:04.169
a purchase a correctly signed purchase
 

00:24:04.169 --> 00:24:06.200
a purchase a correctly signed purchase
so if you check that you can be

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:06.210
so if you check that you can be
 

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.479
so if you check that you can be
reasonably sure that the purchase is

00:24:08.479 --> 00:24:08.489
reasonably sure that the purchase is
 

00:24:08.489 --> 00:24:11.239
reasonably sure that the purchase is
legitimate now signature verification is

00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:11.249
legitimate now signature verification is
 

00:24:11.249 --> 00:24:13.999
legitimate now signature verification is
not actually very difficult but I mean

00:24:13.999 --> 00:24:14.009
not actually very difficult but I mean
 

00:24:14.009 --> 00:24:15.200
not actually very difficult but I mean
you can implement it just using the

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:15.210
you can implement it just using the
 

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.269
you can implement it just using the
other standard Java framework but it

00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279
other standard Java framework but it
 

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:18.649
other standard Java framework but it
comes with our sample so if you're just

00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659
comes with our sample so if you're just
 

00:24:18.659 --> 00:24:20.419
comes with our sample so if you're just
basing your code on our sample we don't

00:24:20.419 --> 00:24:20.429
basing your code on our sample we don't
 

00:24:20.429 --> 00:24:23.089
basing your code on our sample we don't
even have to implement that even though

00:24:23.089 --> 00:24:23.099
even have to implement that even though
 

00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:24.529
even have to implement that even though
our signature verification is pretty

00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539
our signature verification is pretty
 

00:24:24.539 --> 00:24:25.590
our signature verification is pretty
cool

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600
cool
 

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.810
cool
thinking that client-side security alone

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:27.820
thinking that client-side security alone
 

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.120
thinking that client-side security alone
is enough would be a big mistake because

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:30.130
is enough would be a big mistake because
 

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.210
is enough would be a big mistake because
regardless of how secure you make things

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220
regardless of how secure you make things
 

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.440
regardless of how secure you make things
phones can be hacked so it should

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:34.450
phones can be hacked so it should
 

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.090
phones can be hacked so it should
definitely add server-side security to

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:36.100
definitely add server-side security to
 

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.910
definitely add server-side security to
your application on the server side it

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:38.920
your application on the server side it
 

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.830
your application on the server side it
should check the signature again just in

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840
should check the signature again just in
 

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.240
should check the signature again just in
case the client has been compromised a

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:42.250
case the client has been compromised a
 

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.040
case the client has been compromised a
cool thing you can do the server that

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:44.050
cool thing you can do the server that
 

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.450
cool thing you can do the server that
you can't do on the client is to check

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:45.460
you can't do on the client is to check
 

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.770
you can't do on the client is to check
order numbers because since you're

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:46.780
order numbers because since you're
 

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.270
order numbers because since you're
receiving every order from every user

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:48.280
receiving every order from every user
 

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.670
receiving every order from every user
you can check if if a given order number

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:50.680
you can check if if a given order number
 

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.590
you can check if if a given order number
is a duplicate from an other other

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600
is a duplicate from an other other
 

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.730
is a duplicate from an other other
number that you actually delivered to

number that you actually delivered to
 

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.980
number that you actually delivered to
someone else and it's very important

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:55.990
someone else and it's very important
 

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:57.390
someone else and it's very important
that you secure the handshake because

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:57.400
that you secure the handshake because
 

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.030
that you secure the handshake because
it's not gonna do you any good if you

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:00.040
it's not gonna do you any good if you
 

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.560
it's not gonna do you any good if you
have a perfectly good signature

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:01.570
have a perfectly good signature

verification order number of
 

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.080
verification order number of
verification method and then the

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.090
verification method and then the
 

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.360
verification method and then the
handshake is very insecure so make sure

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:06.370
handshake is very insecure so make sure
 

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:08.070
handshake is very insecure so make sure
that the the handshake is that is also

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080
that the the handshake is that is also
 

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.610
that the the handshake is that is also
very secure so just giving you a summary

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:11.620
very secure so just giving you a summary
 

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.530
very secure so just giving you a summary
of the security methods so that we

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:13.540
of the security methods so that we
 

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.900
of the security methods so that we
presented if you don't do if you don't

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:15.910
presented if you don't do if you don't
 

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:17.130
presented if you don't do if you don't
do anything you were essentially a

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:17.140
do anything you were essentially a
 

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.350
do anything you were essentially a
sitting duck and you can be and anything

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360
sitting duck and you can be and anything
 

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.820
sitting duck and you can be and anything
can be used to exploit your application

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:20.830
can be used to exploit your application
 

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.070
can be used to exploit your application
if you do only client-side signature

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080
if you do only client-side signature
 

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.380
if you do only client-side signature
verification you are protected against a

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:25.390
verification you are protected against a
 

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.700
verification you are protected against a
man-in-the-middle attacks so it's going

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:26.710
man-in-the-middle attacks so it's going
 

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.670
man-in-the-middle attacks so it's going
to be hard to replay purchases if in

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:29.680
to be hard to replay purchases if in
 

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.740
to be hard to replay purchases if in
addition to that use the unique

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:31.750
addition to that use the unique
 

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.320
addition to that use the unique
developer payload then you can you're

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:34.330
developer payload then you can you're
 

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:35.580
developer payload then you can you're
also going to be relatively protected

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:35.590
also going to be relatively protected
 

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.430
also going to be relatively protected
against purchase replay attacks if you

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.440
against purchase replay attacks if you
 

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.930
against purchase replay attacks if you
add server-side verification to that

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:39.940
add server-side verification to that
 

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.430
add server-side verification to that
you're also going to be safe against

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440
you're also going to be safe against
 

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.290
you're also going to be safe against
against a rare form of attack which is

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:43.300
against a rare form of attack which is
 

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.710
against a rare form of attack which is

one more thing one of the things that

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:57.940
one more thing one of the things that
 

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.580
one more thing one of the things that
you as game developers have been asking

00:25:59.580 --> 00:25:59.590
you as game developers have been asking
 

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.200

for ever since the launch of in-app
 

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.700
for ever since the launch of in-app
billing and Google Play is the ability

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:02.710
billing and Google Play is the ability
 

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:04.350
billing and Google Play is the ability
to gate to get real-time pricing

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360
to gate to get real-time pricing
 

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.820

information so that you can actually

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:05.830
information so that you can actually
 

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.190
information so that you can actually
display the actual price at Google Play

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200
display the actual price at Google Play
 

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.920
display the actual price at Google Play
we'll be charging your users and it

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:10.930
we'll be charging your users and it
 

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.390
we'll be charging your users and it
turns out that's one of the main things

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400
turns out that's one of the main things
 

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.850
turns out that's one of the main things
we've added in IBB 3 imagine if that was

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:14.860
we've added in IBB 3 imagine if that was
 

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.500
we've added in IBB 3 imagine if that was
even localized so you can actually do

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:19.510
even localized so you can actually do
 

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.870
even localized so you can actually do
quite a lot with that so that's pretty

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:21.880
quite a lot with that so that's pretty
 

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.640
quite a lot with that so that's pretty
much all we have on on in-app billing

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:23.650
much all we have on on in-app billing
 

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:28.170
much all we have on on in-app billing
and on game quality we hope you enjoyed
