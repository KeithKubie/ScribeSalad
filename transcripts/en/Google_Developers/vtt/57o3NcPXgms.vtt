KORY JEFFREY: Greetings,
everyone, and welcome.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.100
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.500
Joining me in the studio is Lisa
Fetterman, the CEO of Nomiku,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.920
who has a hardware and
software solution that

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.964
is changing the world
for the food industry.

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:15.890
[LAUGHING]

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.209
Tell us a little bit about it.

00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:19.500
LISA FETTERMAN: So Nomiku is
the first of our home sous

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.850
vide immersion circulator.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.680
And we have a Wi-Fi one
coming out this November

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.010
that you can use your
app on your phone,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.129
for Android or iOS
or Windows phone,

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.420
where it controls your machine.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.780
And you can cook with one tap.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.530
KORY JEFFREY: Wow.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.290
So for those who don't know, can
you explain what sous vide is?

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.750
LISA FETTERMAN: Yes.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.210
KORY JEFFREY: Yes.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.290
LISA FETTERMAN: Yes.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.740
Sous vide is a relatively
new thing that's come about.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.120
But it's been used for
decades by top chefs

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.552
all around the world.

00:00:43.552 --> 00:00:45.510
And now, top chefs use
my machine-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.260
in Madison Park, Saison,
Restaurant at Meadowood.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.790
And what it does is that it
controls water and circulates

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.950
it to a very
precise temperature.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.400
What you do is put
your food inside of bag

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.020
and then drop it into
the water, walk away.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.394
When you come back, you
have a world class meal.

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:01.150
KORY JEFFREY: Wow.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.950
LISA FETTERMAN: Yeah.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.900
KORY JEFFREY: So what's the
price point for something

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.775
like that, typically?

00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:05.099
LISA FETTERMAN: $199.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.610
It used to be
thousands of dollars.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.625
I remember working for
Jean-Georges and Mario Batali.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:12.639
And we would have this
huge, hulking piece

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.246
of laboratory equipment that
was thousands of dollars.

00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:17.616
And we would cook a lot
of our components in it.

00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:19.100
And I was like, why?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.678
When you took food
out of there, it

00:01:20.678 --> 00:01:23.412
was like eating heavenly food.

00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:24.984
You know how food
is perfect on TV?

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.025
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:27.060
LISA FETTERMAN: This
is how they do it.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.940
KORY JEFFREY: Really?

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.990
So how long does it take to cook
something using that method?

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.410
LISA FETTERMAN:
It really ranges,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.535
depending on what you cook.

00:01:33.535 --> 00:01:35.012
Like, fish is 20 minutes.

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:35.720
KORY JEFFREY: OK.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.430
LISA FETTERMAN:
Steak is an hour.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.880
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.296
LISA FETTERMAN:
Sometimes, there's

00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:39.740
short ribs that are 48 hours.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.000
So you put that in there, and
then you just go to sleep.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.390
KORY JEFFREY: And
then you wake up,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.160
and then you go to sleep again.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.114
LISA FETTERMAN: Yeah.

00:01:45.114 --> 00:01:47.780
KORY JEFFREY: So you've recently
had a whole bunch of accolades,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.390
including the White House,
we were talking about?

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.265
LISA FETTERMAN: Yeah.

00:01:50.265 --> 00:01:51.629
I'm a White House honored maker.

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:53.920
That's how we got our start,
from the Maker Revolution.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.730
We traveled, actually, across
the United States teaching

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.710
people how to make their own DIY
open source sous vide machines.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.210
Our code is still up on Eagle.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.030
We have our CAD files
up, whatever people want.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.781
They can make their
own sous vide machine.

00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:08.613
KORY JEFFREY: Great.

00:02:08.613 --> 00:02:10.030
LISA FETTERMAN:
That's our start.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.830
And this year, I'm also
a Forbes 30 Under 30

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.751
and Zagat 30 Under 30
for the innovation.

00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:15.500
KORY JEFFREY: Wow.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.309
LISA FETTERMAN: So thank you--
thank you, the media gods.

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.600
KORY JEFFREY: It's a lot of
momentum-- lot of momentum.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.266
LISA FETTERMAN: Yeah,
a lot of momentum,

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:25.380
because this is a way of cooking
that everybody has been waiting

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.065
for, myself included.

00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:29.610
And I couldn't believe it
hadn't even been done before.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.216
It's like modern art.

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:33.840
It's like, oh, you just control
the temperature very precisely?

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.290
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah?

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.610
LISA FETTERMAN: My
kid could do that.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.350
You know what I'm saying?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.460
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.930
LISA FETTERMAN: It
was just too obvious,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.430
because ever since
the dawn of fire,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.870
we've been trying to control it.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.610
And if you think
about chefs, what they

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.650
do-- they're not the
controllers of the ingredients.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.830
That's the farmers.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.470
What they do in the
kitchen is to control heat.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.539
And now, you can control heat
to 0.1 degrees Celsius, that's

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.892
completely revolutionary
to how you can cook.

00:02:55.892 --> 00:02:56.850
KORY JEFFREY: Great.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.020
And so what's the
market share like?

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.060
LISA FETTERMAN: The
market share-- well,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.900
great thing you asked,
because Unilever, Nestle,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.960
and Campbell-- they all lose $16
billion a year in market share

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.758
to people like me
who cook food the way

00:03:13.758 --> 00:03:16.980
that people really, really
want to eat it-- perfectly.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.004
So a big thing that they
lose out on is frozen food.

00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:20.712
KORY JEFFREY: OK.

00:03:20.712 --> 00:03:22.476
LISA FETTERMAN: And
that's packaged food.

00:03:22.476 --> 00:03:25.197
And what we do is that we
have-- we have packaged food

00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:26.610
that we sell.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.110
Yeah.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.274
We have it in beta
right now with BuyRIGHT.

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:30.940
All you have to do
is go to our website,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.040
and then we ship it
right to your door.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.547
You drop it in the water,
and then walk away.

00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:38.130
It's just like microwaved food,
except it becomes the freaking

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.569
centerpiece of your meal.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.610
KORY JEFFREY: Does it lose
any nutritional value?

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.750
LISA FETTERMAN: That's
right, because nothing cooks

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.320
at above 100 degrees Celsius.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.920
At 57 degrees Celsius,
the fat and the collagen

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.360
melt into the muscle of a steak.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.620
Effectively, you can make a NY
strip steak taste like ragout.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.540
It's so good.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.320
Magic happens.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.265
KORY JEFFREY: You're
making me hungry.

00:04:02.265 --> 00:04:03.307
LISA FETTERMAN: Oh, good.

00:04:03.307 --> 00:04:03.806
Oh, good.

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:04.710
You can come eat.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.967
Come eat at Namiku.

00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:09.050
KORY JEFFREY: So you're
also a speaker here today.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.080
You have a booth.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.819
How did the speaking session go?

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.110
LISA FETTERMAN: The speaking
session was off the chain.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.090
There are so many people here.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.710
KORY JEFFREY: There are.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.390
There's a lot.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.240
LISA FETTERMAN: Yeah,
so it was really

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.870
fun to speak in front
of a big audience.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.740
KORY JEFFREY: So what
was your message?

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.198
What were you trying
to talk about?

00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:23.900
LISA FETTERMAN: The message
was the connection between food

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.760
and everything in our lives.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.790
People treat food
like, oh, whatever.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.860
They treat it as some
kind of soft, soft thing.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.220
But it's like hard.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.530
It's real freaking money.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.108
And also, you put in
your body every day.

00:04:43.108 --> 00:04:44.650
KORY JEFFREY: Captive audience.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.990
LISA FETTERMAN: The experience--
you have to have it.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.344
KORY JEFFREY: So what
drew you to this event?

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:52.840
LISA FETTERMAN:
This event-- I just

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.480
love that there was gonna
be like smart people here.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.980
I don't have to explain
what sous vide is

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.730
to every single person.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.750
And also, a lot of cool people--
like Tim Draper was here,

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.220
Danielle Fong, Hiba,
Hammoud-- these people

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.830
that I watched from
afar build their stuff.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.799
I'm like, oh, how you do that?

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:14.882
KORY JEFFREY: That's cool.

00:05:14.882 --> 00:05:15.880
LISA FETTERMAN: So that's
why it was exciting.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.640
KORY JEFFREY: And
so obviously, you're

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.050
a big fan of technology,
food technology.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.790
Is there anything
else in the landscape

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.289
that kind of gets you excited
from a technology perspective?

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.810
LISA FETTERMAN: From a
technology perspective,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.914
I love all things hardware.

00:05:27.914 --> 00:05:29.580
So there's this thing
called Ever Purse.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.309
They just partnered
with Kate Spade.

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:34.840
And what they did is that they
made this cute little bag,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.798
you drop your phone in,
and then it charges it.

00:05:36.798 --> 00:05:37.796
KORY JEFFREY:
That's pretty cool.

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:38.712
LISA FETTERMAN: Boosh.

00:05:38.712 --> 00:05:40.291
I need that.

00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:41.454
I never charge my phone.

00:05:41.454 --> 00:05:42.287
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:05:42.287 --> 00:05:43.285
That's really clever, actually.

00:05:43.285 --> 00:05:44.782
LISA FETTERMAN: Yeah, I love it.

00:05:44.782 --> 00:05:46.279
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.362
And do you have a favorite
Google technology?

00:05:48.362 --> 00:05:52.610
LISA FETTERMAN: A
favorite Goog-- oh, Goog.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.560
Well, I love Gmail-- no doy.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.499
Holler at Paul Buchheit.

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:00.540
You know what I'm saying?

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.770
Gmail-- I mean, how could-- I
use it for my business, too.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.279
lisa@nomiku.com, that
goes through Gmail.

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.320
I can't believe I've been
using it for years now.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.770
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah, it's
a really good product.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.300
LISA FETTERMAN: I probably
use a lot of Google stuff

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.120
that I don't even
know it's Google.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.004
KORY JEFFREY: That
is probably true,

00:06:17.004 --> 00:06:18.420
which is part of
the point, right?

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.770
LISA FETTERMAN: Yes.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.950
Oh, actually, you know what?

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.930
One thing that I
really do notice

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.210
