00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.640
Well, I looked at the first one -- only figures to look at the sequel during this Sequel Month.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.040
It's "Mickey's Twice Upon A Christmas", and you know...

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.800
When people ask, "What's the difference between something that's good for kids yet not necessarily for adults

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.900
or bad for kids and not necessarily for adults either," *this* is a perfect example.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.100
The first "Once Upon a Christmas" was a simple but humble and sweet story.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.360
It was expressive, it was kind, it was a little corny, but the effort really shows and pays off.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.020
*This* is a cash-in you can smell from a mile away.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.260
Just *look* at it! I mean... *look* at it!

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.320
I know it's direct-to-DVD, so the CGI isn't going to be, like, Pixar-quality, but...

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.380
*Look at it!*

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.960
The first one was direct-to-DVD, too, and you can see all the great drawings, all the great atmosphere, expressions...

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.560
It was impressive by its own standards.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.820
*This*, even by its own standards, is cheap-looking, and lame, and not written well, and heartless, and empty,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.480
and just, like I said, an obvious cash-in!

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.340
Okay, well, I guess I should go over all the stories, but that almost seems pointless because

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.840
where, in the first film, it was only three stories that seemed reasonably enough,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.680
this one, it's like *eight*.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.760
Yeah. They just throw a bunch of 'em at you whether they make sense or not.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.420
It becomes so much overload that the motivations aren't even established when the stories start.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.200
The very first story is just Daisy and Minnie skating. Well, okay, that's fine.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.760
But for whatever reason, Daisy tries to sabotage Minnie.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.160
Was that in her character? Is that something she's known for?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.680
I can see Donald doing that, but nothing about her has ever been established as this egotistical, jealous character.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.240
And then Minnie gets really angry, too, and she starts fighting back, and it's just this entirely pointless number.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.200
There's another kinda mean-spirited story where Donald comes home from work,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.100
he's really tired, he just wants to relax,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.420
but then Daisy and the boys all want to go Christmas shopping, and they force him to come with.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.420
He gets angry because Christmas is being shoved in his face, and he just needs a break from it, but...

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.780
He shouldn't be! He's wrong!

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.860
Much like "Christmas with the Kranks", you should just accept everything about Christmas and love it all unconditionally.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.760
Seems like a very confused message.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.740
On the one hand, I can kinda see what they're going for,

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.600
like you're just gonna need that extra effort to make Christmas special for your kids and your loved ones and stuff,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.020
but, first of all, they're his nephews, not his kids. I still don't know where their damn parents are.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.620
Second, you sympathize too much for him.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.820
I *want* him to be by the fireplace. I want him to have his hot chocolate.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.200
I don't want him to go out to the store and have all this commercialism shoved in his face!

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.300
Somewhere, there's a sweet, nice idea trying to get out, but it's just lost.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.900
There's also this lame number about Max bringing his girlfriend to meet his dad, and most of it's a pop song that he's not really singing.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.660
Yeah, you never really see his lips move, and the song doesn't really match the atmosphere.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.400
They're trying to make it sound like one of those songs you can hear on the radio,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.860
but it's not even vague enough to be a song that you can hear on the radio.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.020
They're obviously saying that "Dad's gonna embarrass me. I hope he doesn't embarrass me around Christmas."

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.220
They can't even get whoring the fake pop song right!

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.760
Nobody will listen to this on their own, but the character's clearly not singing the song, either, so it's just entirely confused.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.220
Remember how Santa Claus was a big deal in the first one? Like, Goofy and Max were trying to believe,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.240
but they didn't know if they did, but they wanted to believe. That was a whole big thing.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.600
In this one, Huey, Dewey, and Louie just *mail* themselves to Santa!

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.740
Yeah. I guess he's not really that big a deal anymore.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.480
And look at him. Talk about the most generic, forgettable Santa you can imagine.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.680
Alright, alright, are there any good things about this special?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.700
I guess the colors can be kinda nice and Christmas-y.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.020
Every once in a while, there is a good visual joke or a line here or there.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.400
But, for the most part, it just feels shallow.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.520
I guess it seems silly to be this hard on a little Christmas special that's obviously just meant for little kids, but

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.320
the first one was just a little Christmas special meant for little kids, and they really did a much better job.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.100
They cared. They took the time to write good stories and put in good animation because

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.360
it felt like the respect of the audience was important.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.700
They know they can show little kids anything with Donald and Goofy and Mickey and stuff,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.980
but, instead, they tried to give something really nice and meaningful,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.840
and that's felt by the adults as well as the children.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.840
This just feels like what it most likely is: a last-minute sequel.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.520
The first one probably made a lot of money, so they had to squeeze out a sequel, and this is what we got:

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.820
a cheap knockoff with little to no heart.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.340
I can't say it's as bad as some of Disney's other worse animated films.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.160
I mean, I can't say of "Chicken Little" or "Home on the Range" or "Mulan 2".

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.200
But it just feels... lazy.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.200
And don't get me wrong. I don't know how much time or money they had to put into this, so I shouldn't judge,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.920
but it's just how it feels. It *feels* lazy.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.600
Can you show it to kids? Sure.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.560
Does it get across any mean-spirited or bad morals? A little debatable, but none that little kids'll probably get.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.540
It's just a weak Christmas cash-grab and nothing more.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.880
If you kid's *really* dying to see it, I guess it's okay to show, but in my opinion,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.760
I'd just put on the first one again.
