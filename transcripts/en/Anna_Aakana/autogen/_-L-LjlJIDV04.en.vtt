00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
When I was on set filming Miss 2059 waiting for a scene to be set up,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.920
I was hanging out with two of my co-stars,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.800
Nikki Soohoo, who played my twin, and Jasmine Batchelor, an African-American woman

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.940
who was playing a werewolf alien.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.480
We were kind of like goofing off and talking when Jasmine asked,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.440
"Hey, so what do Asians do when they see each other?"

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.520
"What do you mean?"

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.780
"Like, earlier today, when I made eye contact with the only other black person on set,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.440
we kind of gave each other .... a nod.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.220
And I was wondering, like, do Asians have anything that they do when they see each other?"

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.420
"It's a smile!" *synchronized high pitched giggly laughter*

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.940
And to this day, I notice just how much I smile at other Asian people, completely involuntarily.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.460
Whether I make eye contact with them at a party, or at the grocery store, or while driving.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.560
(crash)

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.320
I'm just kidding.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.740
But seriously, I do wonder, "Why do I do this?"

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.300
Like, what am I actually trying to communicate
with my itty-bitty smile?

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.140
"Hello, there. You're Asian. I'm Asian. We're the same!"

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.500
"Damn right we are! What up sister from another mister? Do you know if there's any food at this party?"

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.820
"Mm-hm, but only that, like, bullshit food, like chips and dip, that everyone already ate. Trust me, I was on that shit like white on rice."

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.480
"Speaking of rice, why don't these people ever throw parties with substantial food? Am I right or am I right?"

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.320
"Dude, you're so right. Asians know how to party."

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.600
"Asians know how to party! Oh shit, I gotta go, I didn't hear what this person's saying at all."

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.500
"Chill. Talk later, dude."

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.400
But maybe this is just an American thing, right?

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.920
Like, if I was living internationally in an Asian country, maybe I wouldn't care because I'm the majority there.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.420
Maybe it would be the exact opposite.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.260
"What are you looking at? You stupid biiiiitch."

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.870
"Stupid face, you stupid biiiiiiiiitch."

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.390
(dramatic music)

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.020
Ultimately, I think it's a sign of familiarity, right?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.680
That kind of acknowledging that you have something in common with this other person.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.700
You know, I wonder if people with the same hair color do this.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.820
(belch)

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.640
Or if you're both wearing something from the same fandom.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.240
I know whenever I see someone wearing, like, a t-shirt or hoodie with one of my favorite shows

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.500
or one of my favorite characters on it, I'm always inclined to be like, "Heh, nice!"

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.000
Even though it makes me feel like a moron, you kind of want to be like: "Hey, I like that too."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.080
"Maybe we can be friends," or, "You're cool."

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.190
Wait, what's that?

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.500
Did somebody say hats?

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.820
Oh my God! Speaking of hats,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.340
This is my limited edition hat available at CrowdMade.com/AnnaAkana for only 10 days.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.660
You can get this hat and other apparel with this really cute neon kitty on it at CrowdMade.com/AnnaAkana

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.980
The hat itself is limited, the apparel might be there there longer,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.080
but you can wear it, and then see someone else wearing it, and then be like:

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.820
(clicks tongue) Meow.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:54.760
(music)
