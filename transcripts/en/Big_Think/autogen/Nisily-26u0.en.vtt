we really have to understand more deeply

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029
we really have to understand more deeply
 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.629
we really have to understand more deeply
what the implications of creating an AI

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639
what the implications of creating an AI
 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.510
what the implications of creating an AI
are and what not that we haven't already

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:13.520
are and what not that we haven't already
 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.599

fear with artificial intelligence that a

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800
fear with artificial intelligence that a
 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.160
fear with artificial intelligence that a
lot of people possess can actually be

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170
lot of people possess can actually be
 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.400
lot of people possess can actually be
solved by the fundamental ethic behind

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410
solved by the fundamental ethic behind
 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.859

blockchain technology because when you

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869
blockchain technology because when you
 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.810
blockchain technology because when you
think about systems logic and systems

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820
think about systems logic and systems
 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.810
think about systems logic and systems
integrity if the minds operating the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820
integrity if the minds operating the
 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.750
integrity if the minds operating the
system lack integrity then the system no

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760
system lack integrity then the system no
 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.729
system lack integrity then the system no

will lack integrity and I think the big

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800
will lack integrity and I think the big

fear with AI has to do with the

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290
fear with AI has to do with the
 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.250
fear with AI has to do with the
centralization of power because the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260
centralization of power because the
 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.959
centralization of power because the
moment that we put something in a

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969
moment that we put something in a
 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.770
moment that we put something in a
god-like state and we say you have all

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780
god-like state and we say you have all
 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.810
god-like state and we say you have all
knowledge in the universe you have all

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820
knowledge in the universe you have all
 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.330
knowledge in the universe you have all
power you have access to every piece of

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340
power you have access to every piece of
 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.369
power you have access to every piece of
knowledge that is created around the

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379
knowledge that is created around the
 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.260
knowledge that is created around the
world from every human being at once and

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270
world from every human being at once and
 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.749
world from every human being at once and
if we store all of that knowledge in

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759
if we store all of that knowledge in
 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.200
if we store all of that knowledge in
something that is all-powerful yeah that

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210
something that is all-powerful yeah that
 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.280
something that is all-powerful yeah that
is totally scary the idea of any one

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290
is totally scary the idea of any one
 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.890
is totally scary the idea of any one
thing having ultimate power that's

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900
thing having ultimate power that's
 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.160
thing having ultimate power that's
always just that's a bad idea that's

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170
always just that's a bad idea that's
 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.340
always just that's a bad idea that's
always been a bad idea but if we can

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350
always been a bad idea but if we can
 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.190
always been a bad idea but if we can
take these concepts and change the way

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200
take these concepts and change the way
 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.280
take these concepts and change the way
that we think about their ability to own

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290
that we think about their ability to own
 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.780
that we think about their ability to own
power I think that will change the way

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790
power I think that will change the way
 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.030
power I think that will change the way
that we perceive what artificial

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040
that we perceive what artificial
 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.920
that we perceive what artificial
intelligence will be able to do for us

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930
intelligence will be able to do for us
 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.380
intelligence will be able to do for us
because there will be so many net

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390
because there will be so many net
 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.440
because there will be so many net
positives created by these emergent and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450
positives created by these emergent and
 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.429
positives created by these emergent and
incredible technologies and yeah if we

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439
incredible technologies and yeah if we
 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.030
incredible technologies and yeah if we
have every basic job of someone doing

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040
have every basic job of someone doing
 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.999
have every basic job of someone doing
something that doesn't fulfill deeply

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009
something that doesn't fulfill deeply
 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.760
something that doesn't fulfill deeply
what is their ultimate human potential

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770
what is their ultimate human potential
 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.910
what is their ultimate human potential
because why are we on this earth right

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920
because why are we on this earth right
 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.120
because why are we on this earth right
we're not cogs in a machine we're human

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130
we're not cogs in a machine we're human
 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.889
we're not cogs in a machine we're human

earth has an unlimited potential an

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159
earth has an unlimited potential an
 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.879
earth has an unlimited potential an
unlimited potential that for centuries

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:14.889
unlimited potential that for centuries
 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.159
unlimited potential that for centuries
has been constrained by the way that

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:18.169
has been constrained by the way that
 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:18.699

wheat they

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.720

about resource allocation whether that's

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730
about resource allocation whether that's
 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.360
about resource allocation whether that's
resource allocation in terms of money in

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370
resource allocation in terms of money in
 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.259
resource allocation in terms of money in
terms of knowledge and if we can create

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269
terms of knowledge and if we can create
 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.420
terms of knowledge and if we can create
a world of infinite resource I think

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430
a world of infinite resource I think
 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.970
a world of infinite resource I think
that is fundamentally when we will be

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980
that is fundamentally when we will be
 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.390
that is fundamentally when we will be
able to unleash in a different way the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400
able to unleash in a different way the
 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.970
able to unleash in a different way the
infinite human potential that every

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980
infinite human potential that every
 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.780
infinite human potential that every
person on earth possesses and you know

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790
person on earth possesses and you know
 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.000
person on earth possesses and you know
we're not we're certainly not at that

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010
we're not we're certainly not at that
 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.909
we're not we're certainly not at that
point in our human evolution yet I wish

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:51.919
point in our human evolution yet I wish
 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.720
point in our human evolution yet I wish
we were but I think that we're on the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730
we were but I think that we're on the
 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.819
we were but I think that we're on the
verge of something meaningful and

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829
verge of something meaningful and
 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.490
verge of something meaningful and
something beautiful and something

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500
something beautiful and something
 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.000
something beautiful and something
incredible and with any system it's up

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010
incredible and with any system it's up
 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.259
incredible and with any system it's up
to us it is up to our hearts and it is

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269
to us it is up to our hearts and it is
 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.289
to us it is up to our hearts and it is
up to our minds and is up to our spirit

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299
up to our minds and is up to our spirit
 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.830
up to our minds and is up to our spirit
and the way that we carry ourself into

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840
and the way that we carry ourself into
 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.990
and the way that we carry ourself into
greatness whether that's as an

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000
greatness whether that's as an
 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.140
greatness whether that's as an
individual or as a civilization but

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150
individual or as a civilization but
 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.449
individual or as a civilization but
that's our choice and I think that if

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459
that's our choice and I think that if
 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.629
that's our choice and I think that if
every person comes together and moves in

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639
every person comes together and moves in
 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.270
every person comes together and moves in
the right direction we will see a

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280
the right direction we will see a
 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.569
the right direction we will see a
positive evolution and aggregation of

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579
positive evolution and aggregation of
 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.430
positive evolution and aggregation of
human potential
