00:00:00.427 --> 00:00:01.846
- [Voiceover] We're
given the definitive role

00:00:01.846 --> 00:00:04.615
from one to four of f
of x dx is equal to six.

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:06.209
And the definitive role for one to seven

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.360
of f of x dx is equal to 11.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.335
And we wanna figure out
the definite integral

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:14.252
from four to seven of f of x dx.

00:00:15.556 --> 00:00:18.518
So at least in my brain,
I'm visualizing these

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:22.147
as areas between the
curve y equals f of x,

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.105
and the x axis.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.114
So let's just draw that,
we don't know exactly

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:28.730
what f of x is, but we can
draw an arbitrary f of x.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.955
Just to help us visualize things.

00:00:30.955 --> 00:00:35.727
So let me draw, so that is,
draw it in a bolder color.

00:00:35.727 --> 00:00:37.597
So that's our y axis.

00:00:37.597 --> 00:00:39.764
And this is our x axis.

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.231
And let's see, all the action is happening

00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:46.312
between x, from x, from one to seven.

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.979
So we can go one, we can go one,

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.066
two, three, four,

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:55.612
five, six, seven,

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.404
and we can even go to eight if we like.

00:00:58.404 --> 00:01:00.090
But the important numbers,
let's see we're dealing

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.840
with one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:06.784
six, seven, and then we go to eight.

00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:10.336
And let me just draw the
graph y equals f of x,

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.245
and I'm just gonna draw
something arbitrary here.

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:15.853
So let's say the graph of y
equals f of x looks like that.

00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:17.603
Y is equal to f of x.

00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:21.174
And of course I put it on my axis.

00:01:21.174 --> 00:01:23.810
That's the x axis, that is the y axis.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.502
And let's think about what each of

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.465
these integrals represent.

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:31.108
So the integral, the definite
integral from one to four,

00:01:31.108 --> 00:01:33.585
well that's going to be,
we're going to be going

00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:36.418
from one to four, right over here.

00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:42.678
So this is the definite
integral from one to four.

00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:45.659
This area under the
curve, between the curve

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.326
of the x axis, dx, which is equal to six.

00:01:50.503 --> 00:01:53.867
And now let's see, we also have the region

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:56.284
that goes from four to seven.

00:01:57.964 --> 00:02:00.020
We have this region right over here.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.023
And that area is represented
by this definite integral,

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.572
the one that we need to figure out.

00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:08.023
The definitive role from four to seven

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:11.786
of f of x dx, we need to figure that out.

00:02:11.786 --> 00:02:13.673
And they also, what else do we have?

00:02:13.673 --> 00:02:15.406
So let me underline this.

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:18.701
So that's that, this is
the area of the region

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:20.543
between x equals four and x equals seven

00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:23.299
under y equals f of x above the x axis.

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.999
And then they also gave us
this last piece of information.

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.041
Which is, let me do this in another color,

00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:32.821
the definitive role from one to seven.

00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:34.710
Well that's going from one.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.850
One all the way to seven.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.889
So that's the sum of these
two regions right over here.

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.188
So we could re-write this as the definite

00:02:44.188 --> 00:02:47.605
integral from one to four of f of x dx

00:02:48.592 --> 00:02:51.592
plus the definite integral from four

00:02:54.525 --> 00:02:57.608
to seven of f of x dx is equal to,

00:03:00.374 --> 00:03:03.707
the definite integral from one to seven.

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:07.302
One to seven of f of x dx.

00:03:09.384 --> 00:03:11.026
And notice what's going on here.

00:03:11.026 --> 00:03:13.652
The first one just goes to the area from

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:15.700
one to four, then we
go from four to seven,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.733
so if you add those together,
that's gonna be the area

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:19.983
from one to seven, from one to seven.

00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:22.608
And so they gave us a
lot of this information,

00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:26.520
they tell us that this
right over here is six,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.087
let me do that same color.

00:03:28.087 --> 00:03:31.588
They tell us that this
is six, they tell us that

00:03:31.588 --> 00:03:33.755
this is 11, and so we have

00:03:35.942 --> 00:03:38.548
six plus this is equal to 11.

00:03:38.548 --> 00:03:40.643
Well six plus one is equal to 11.

00:03:40.643 --> 00:03:42.472
Well this thing right over here must be

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:46.457
equal to this thing right,
the definite integral

00:03:46.457 --> 00:03:49.215
from four to seven must be equal to five.

00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:51.097
This must be equal to five.

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:54.549
Another way to think about
it, if this region right

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.062
over, having trouble switching colors,

00:03:57.062 --> 00:04:00.682
if this region right over here is six,

00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:04.682
so that has an area of
six, and the whole region

00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:08.575
if everything has an area of 11,

00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:14.209
so if that plus that has an area of 11,

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.120
well then the stuff that we don't know,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.953
this orange region, is going to be

00:04:23.984 --> 00:04:25.067
11 minus six.

00:04:27.227 --> 00:04:29.007
So this region right over here is going to

00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:30.757
have an area of five.
