00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.968
♪♪

00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:05.901
Narrator:
IT'S CALLED A JETWING,

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:09.133
A HUMAN-SIZED, JET-PROPELLED
CARBON-FIBER WING

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:12.334
THAT TURNS THE PERSON WHO WEARS
IT INTO A FLYING AIRCRAFT.

00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:13.701
THAT'S BANANAS.

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:15.734
WE'VE ALL SEEN HANG GLIDERS.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:18.133
YOU JUMP OFF A CLIFF,
AND YOU FLOAT DOWN.

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:21.467
NOW IMAGINE FLOATING DOWN
WITH YOUR OWN JET ENGINE.

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:22.667
I LIKE IT.

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:25.133
Haislip:
JETWINGS LOOK FREAKIN' RAD.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.467
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE
ACTUALLY A THING,

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:28.801
'CAUSE THEY KIND OF LOOK LIKE
A THING

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:31.767
THAT WOULD JUST POP UP IN
A "MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE" MOVIE.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.734
THIS IS BETTER.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.534
Narrator:
JETWING PARTS INCLUDE

00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:38.634
FOUR STATE-OF-THE-ART
JET ENGINES,

00:00:38.634 --> 00:00:41.167
CARBON FIBER,
A MULTIPOINT HARNESS,

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:44.033
THREE PARACHUTES,
AND A FRIEND WITH A HELICOPTER.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:47.033
THESE GUYS ARE TAKING FLIGHT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL --

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:49.334
TO THE NEXT, SCARY LEVEL.

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:51.100
YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST DIVE OUT
OF A PLANE

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.300
WITH A JETWING ON YOUR BACK.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.901
OH, IT MIGHT LOOK EASY
IN A JAMES BOND MOVIE,

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.534
BUT, UH, NO.

00:00:56.534 --> 00:00:57.701
STEP ONE IN THIS PROCESS

00:00:57.701 --> 00:00:59.567
IS GETTING COMFORTABLE
WITH SKYDIVING.

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:00.934
AND NOT JUST SKYDIVING,

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:03.601
BUT SKYDIVING WITH SOMETHING BIG
ON YOUR BACK.

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.934
Narrator: BEFORE ATTEMPTING
JET-PROPELLED FLIGHT,

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.868
JETWING PILOTS USE
NONPOWERED TEST WINGS

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:11.501
TO GET ACCUSTOMED
TO THE MECHANICS OF GLIDING.

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:13.400
THEY EMPLOY THESE
WHILE SKYDIVING

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.067
TO LEARN HOW TO USE THEIR
BODIES' POSITIONS TO STEER.

00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:18.601
THIS JETWING DOESN'T HAVE ANY
TRADITIONAL STEERING CONTROLS,

00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:20.434
SO YOUR BODY ACTS AS THE RUDDER,

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:23.200
AND SMALL CHANGES IN YOUR HEAD
OR YOUR ARMS AND LEGS

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.968
STEER YOU OFF IN ONE DIRECTION
OR THE OTHER.

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:27.534
YOU DO WANT IT TO BE STRONG
ENOUGH TO SUPPORT YOU IN FLIGHT,

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:31.133
SO YOU WANT IT TO BE AS LIGHT
AND AS STIFF AS POSSIBLE.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.334
Narrator: WINGS ARE MOLDED
FROM CARBON FIBER,

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:35.667
PAINTED WITH EPOXY, AND DRIED.

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:38.501
WING SECTIONS
ARE THEN FASTENED TOGETHER.

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:41.434
FOUR-GALLON FUEL TANKS
ARE ATTACHED TO EACH WING.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.601
CARBON FIBER'S GREAT
BECAUSE IT'S LIGHTWEIGHT.

00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:46.801
IT'S 80% LESS DENSE THAN STEEL,
BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY STRONG.

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:49.567
IT'S ACTUALLY STRONGER,
POUND FOR POUND, THAN ALUMINUM,

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.267
WHICH IS THE STANDARD
FOR AIRCRAFT.

00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:53.100
Narrator:
A JETWING'S THRUST IS PROVIDED

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.267
BY FOUR SMALL BUT POWERFUL
JetCat P 400-RX ENGINES,

00:01:57.267 --> 00:01:59.667
EACH WEIGHING JUST 7.7 POUNDS

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:02.801
BUT CAPABLE OF GENERATING
88 POUNDS OF THRUST

00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:06.634
WITH TURBINES SPINNING AT UP TO
98,000 REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE.

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:09.400
THE TWO ENGINES ARE ATTACHED
TO EACH SIDE OF THE JETWING

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.601
AND SHEATHED IN KEVLAR
FOR EXTRA PROTECTION.

00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:16.033
LISTEN, I'VE TRIED PARASAILING.
IT'S A LITTLE SLOW.

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:17.968
I THINK ADDING A JET ENGINE
TO IT

00:02:17.968 --> 00:02:19.868
MAKES IT A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME.

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:23.300
BUT YOU'RE SERIOUSLY RISKING
ANGERING THE BIRDS.
