00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:09.980
"Dear Harvard" plays

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.630
Seniors!

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.980
This is your day.

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.600
"Dear Harvard" keeps playing

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.859
(new speaker) class of two thousand nine

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.880
are you guys nervous?

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.009
I am.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.610
anxiety appears

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.790
each time I hear/ numbers of fear

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.550
economic statistics

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.320
about waste that's ballistic/about haste

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.860
that is in no way ecological. But what are we supposed
to do?

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.670
(new speaker) we are most intelligent

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.220
accomplished

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.290
and unemployed class

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.170
to ever graduate from Harvard.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.530
Hahvahd.  Far from delivering the limitless success we
dreamt it would

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.950
seems sometimes (switch speaker) ... only doubts about whether we might in fact be the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.630
admissions mistake

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.659
(new speaker) if i could trade places with you

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.900
and go back to being twenty one years of
age I would do it in a second.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.700
i would take on the challenges, i would take
on the ups the downs

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.280
and heartaches that you will undoubtedly
face in these coming years i would try

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.320
in some small way (song "lean on me" starts)

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.140
(times in our lives)

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.290
you are

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.110
... the best and the brightest

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.240
(we all have pain, we all have sorrow)

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.470
And I know you will make us proud

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.560
(if we are wise, we know that there's)

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.030
(always tomorrow)

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.720
(lean on me)

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.270
(when you're not stong)

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.179
(And I'll be your friend)

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.299
(I'll help you carry on)

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.889
(for it won't)

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:20.899
(be long)

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.799
('till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on)

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.799
We are
0:02:27.799,0:02:32.859
an amazing class and we should always be always be able to count on and call on each other. When we walk tomorrow

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.810
Let us all think of the real meaning of the
word, "commencement"

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.719
It is a beginning.

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.789
Let us call on each other throughout our lives leaning when we must and providing

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:44.700
shoulder when we can

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.820
never again will there be another class of two thousand and nine so let's make

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.380
the most of it.
