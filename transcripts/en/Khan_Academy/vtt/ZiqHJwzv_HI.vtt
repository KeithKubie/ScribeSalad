00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.470
Angle A is a circumscribed
angle on circle O.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.950
So this is angle
A right over here.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.360
Then when they say it's
a circumscribed angle,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.550
that means that the
two sides of the angle

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.820
are tangent to the circle.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.530
So AC is tangent to
the circle at point

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.090
C. AB is tangent to
the circle at point B.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.440
What is the measure of angle A?

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.730
Now, I encourage you
to pause the video now

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.840
and to try this out on your own.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.600
And I'll give you a hint.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.960
It will leverage the fact that
this is a circumscribed angle

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.580
as you could imagine.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.140
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.560
So the other piece
of information

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.490
they give us is that angle D,
which is an inscribed angle,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.960
is 48 degrees and it intercepts
the same arc-- so this

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.940
is the arc that it intercepts,
arc CB I guess you could call

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.640
it-- it intercepts this
arc right over here.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.740
It's the inscribed angle.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.320
The central angle that
intersects that same arc

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.840
is going to be twice
the inscribed angle.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.235
So this is going
to be 96 degrees.

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:09.610
I could put three markers here
just because we've already

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.370
used the double marker.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.855
Notice, they both intercept
arc CB so some people would

00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:18.530
say the measure of
arc CB is 96 degrees,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.180
the central angle is 96
degrees, the inscribed angle

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.570
is going to be half
of that, 48 degrees.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.850
So how does this help us?

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.560
Well, a key clue is that angle
is a circumscribed angle.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.410
So that means AC and AB are
each tangent to the circle.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.450
Well, a line that is
tangent to the circle

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.830
is going to be perpendicular to
the radius of the circle that

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.570
intersects the circle
at the same point.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.930
So this right over here is
going to be a 90-degree angle,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.730
and this right over here is
going to be a 90-degree angle.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.380
OC is perpendicular to CA.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.330
OB, which is a radius,
is perpendicular to BA,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.160
which is a tangent line, and
they both intersect right

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.520
over here at B. Now, this
might jump out at you.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.509
We have a quadrilateral
going on here.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.480
ABOC is a quadrilateral,
so its sides

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.310
are going to add
up to 360 degrees.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.170
So we could know, we
could write it this way.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.380
We could write the
measure of angle A

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:37.930
plus 90 degrees plus another
90 degrees plus 96 degrees

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.880
is going to be equal
to 360 degrees.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.720
Or another way of thinking
about it, if we subtract 180

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.670
from both sides, if we
subtract that from both sides,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.870
we get the measure of
angle A plus 96 degrees

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.142
is going to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:03:05.142 --> 00:03:06.600
Or another way of
thinking about it

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.950
is the measure of angle A
or that angle A and angle O

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.860
right over here-- you
could call it angle COB--

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.620
that these are going to be
supplementary angles if they

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.990
add up to 180 degrees.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.130
So if we subtract 96
degrees from both sides,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.561
we get the measure
of angle A is equal

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:30.060
to-- I don't want to make that
look like a less than symbol,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.380
let make it-- measure of
angle-- this one actually

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.010
looks more like a--
measure of angle A

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.980
is equal to 180 minus 96.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.840
Let's see, 180 minus
90 would be 90,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.190
and then we subtract another
6 gets us to 84 degrees.
