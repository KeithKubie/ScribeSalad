so there's now a whole host of studies

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959
so there's now a whole host of studies
 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.100
so there's now a whole host of studies
underway that you mainly with kids

animal on their belly and then they
 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:49.800
animal on their belly and then they
listened to a tape that guided them

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810
listened to a tape that guided them
 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.249
listened to a tape that guided them
through watching the belly rise on the

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259
through watching the belly rise on the
 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.550
through watching the belly rise on the

for kids you know in cognitive science

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250
for kids you know in cognitive science
 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.619
for kids you know in cognitive science
would say this is the training of

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629
would say this is the training of
 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.379
would say this is the training of
attention so you can do it with very

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389
attention so you can do it with very
 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.700
attention so you can do it with very
young kids and this helps them get

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710
young kids and this helps them get
 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.010
young kids and this helps them get
stronger in their ability to concentrate

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020
stronger in their ability to concentrate
 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.519
stronger in their ability to concentrate
attention deficit disorder is basically

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:20.529
attention deficit disorder is basically
 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.040

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050
not being able to control your mind
 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.110
not being able to control your mind
wandering off from what you're paying

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120
wandering off from what you're paying
 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.050
wandering off from what you're paying
attention to every time you watch your

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060
attention to every time you watch your
 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.089
attention to every time you watch your
belly rise and then your mind wanders

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099
belly rise and then your mind wanders
 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:31.679
belly rise and then your mind wanders
off and you bring it back to your belly

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:31.689
off and you bring it back to your belly
 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:33.809
off and you bring it back to your belly
you're strengthening the neural

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819
you're strengthening the neural
 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.929
you're strengthening the neural
circuitry for focus and countering mind

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:36.939
circuitry for focus and countering mind
 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:39.149
circuitry for focus and countering mind
wandering so this seems very promising

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159
wandering so this seems very promising
 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.269
wandering so this seems very promising
in early studies early pilots show that

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279
in early studies early pilots show that
 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:45.209
in early studies early pilots show that
this may well counter the problems kids

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219
this may well counter the problems kids
 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.540
this may well counter the problems kids
face in a didi and I'm very happy to say

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550
face in a didi and I'm very happy to say
 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.909
face in a didi and I'm very happy to say
that major studies are underway we're

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919
that major studies are underway we're
 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.369
that major studies are underway we're
waiting for those results but I think

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:53.379
waiting for those results but I think
 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:55.710
waiting for those results but I think
they're promising

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720
they're promising
 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.959
they're promising
