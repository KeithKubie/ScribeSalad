hello everyone and welcome to fragment
tricks today we're going to be talking

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790
tricks today we're going to be talking
 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.490
tricks today we're going to be talking
about a few effective patterns for using

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500
about a few effective patterns for using
 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.490
about a few effective patterns for using
the fragment api's in your ass now some

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500
the fragment api's in your ass now some
 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.230
the fragment api's in your ass now some
of these are going to be they may seem a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
of these are going to be they may seem a
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.090
of these are going to be they may seem a
little bit basic but there are also

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
little bit basic but there are also
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.250
little bit basic but there are also
things that are going to help you build

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
things that are going to help you build
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.470
things that are going to help you build
it apps in a way that factors your code

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
it apps in a way that factors your code
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.450
it apps in a way that factors your code
effectively encapsulate things and make

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460
effectively encapsulate things and make
 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.540
effectively encapsulate things and make
sure that you can keep your code clean

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550
sure that you can keep your code clean
 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.609

stupid fragment tricks yeah stupid

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
stupid fragment tricks yeah stupid
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.229
stupid fragment tricks yeah stupid
fragment tricks

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239
 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.220
anyway so let's start and start with a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230
anyway so let's start and start with a
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.049
anyway so let's start and start with a
little bit of history behind this which

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
little bit of history behind this which
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.549
little bit of history behind this which
kind of helps to understand where some

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559
kind of helps to understand where some
 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.060
kind of helps to understand where some
of the fragment api's came from so as we

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
of the fragment api's came from so as we
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.799
of the fragment api's came from so as we
started moving into large screen devices

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809
started moving into large screen devices
 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.170
started moving into large screen devices
it's a honeycomb era we started

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
it's a honeycomb era we started
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.970
it's a honeycomb era we started
realizing that there are a few specific

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
realizing that there are a few specific
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.650
realizing that there are a few specific
patterns in the way that some apps are

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
patterns in the way that some apps are
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479
patterns in the way that some apps are
put together especially apps the time

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
put together especially apps the time
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.520
put together especially apps the time
you've got one area that's devoted to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
you've got one area that's devoted to
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.139
you've got one area that's devoted to
your navigation and then you've got

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
your navigation and then you've got
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.729
your navigation and then you've got
another area that's devoted the content

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739
another area that's devoted the content
 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.260
another area that's devoted the content
and when you put these two things

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
and when you put these two things
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.020
and when you put these two things
together you can imagine on a small

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
together you can imagine on a small
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.580
together you can imagine on a small
screen device you might see the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
screen device you might see the
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.380
screen device you might see the
navigation as one screen that advances

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
navigation as one screen that advances
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.840
navigation as one screen that advances
to a Content screen and when you're on a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
to a Content screen and when you're on a
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.250
to a Content screen and when you're on a
larger screen device you're able to show

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
larger screen device you're able to show
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.109
larger screen device you're able to show
these same things side by side so we had

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119
these same things side by side so we had
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.190
these same things side by side so we had
this question of how do you write an

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
this question of how do you write an
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.000
this question of how do you write an
apps that work seamlessly across both so

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
apps that work seamlessly across both so
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.010
apps that work seamlessly across both so
the fragment api's were born it was

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
the fragment api's were born it was
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200
the fragment api's were born it was
something that you could use to factory

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
something that you could use to factory
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.140
something that you could use to factory
out your activity components into two

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
out your activity components into two
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.399
out your activity components into two
separate pieces that you could show

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
separate pieces that you could show
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.899
separate pieces that you could show
differently they some different device

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
differently they some different device
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.929
differently they some different device
configuration now this works really well

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
configuration now this works really well
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999
configuration now this works really well
for some applications like Gmail but

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
for some applications like Gmail but
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.710
for some applications like Gmail but
your app probably isn't Gmail if you've

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
your app probably isn't Gmail if you've
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.390
your app probably isn't Gmail if you've
followed the development of app design

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
followed the development of app design
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280
followed the development of app design
over the past several years you realize

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
over the past several years you realize
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.920
over the past several years you realize
that this sort of pattern just doesn't

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
that this sort of pattern just doesn't
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.830
that this sort of pattern just doesn't
fit for a lot of things however it's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
fit for a lot of things however it's
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.140
fit for a lot of things however it's
still extremely useful for representing

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
still extremely useful for representing
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.940
still extremely useful for representing
your application as a series of

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950
your application as a series of
 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.749
your application as a series of
destinations so even on a small screen

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
destinations so even on a small screen
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.550
destinations so even on a small screen
device you might have an app that looks

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
device you might have an app that looks
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.020
device you might have an app that looks
something like this we've got our little

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
something like this we've got our little
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.810
something like this we've got our little
application that where you can order

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
application that where you can order
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.370
application that where you can order
some micro kitchen snacks around the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
some micro kitchen snacks around the
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.280
some micro kitchen snacks around the
Google campus and for each one of these

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
Google campus and for each one of these
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.929
Google campus and for each one of these
screens you can perform a replace

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939
screens you can perform a replace
 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.929
screens you can perform a replace
transaction to replace the destination

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
transaction to replace the destination
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.179
transaction to replace the destination
that you're looking at previously with

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189
that you're looking at previously with
 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.580
that you're looking at previously with
the new one a replace transaction will

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
the new one a replace transaction will
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.580
the new one a replace transaction will
remove any fragment in the container and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590
remove any fragment in the container and
 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.309
remove any fragment in the container and
then add the new fragment

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.330
so the nice thing about this is that you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
so the nice thing about this is that you
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.830
so the nice thing about this is that you
can place these particular transactions

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840
can place these particular transactions
 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.119
can place these particular transactions
on the back sack and we'll go ahead and

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129
on the back sack and we'll go ahead and
 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.970
on the back sack and we'll go ahead and
handle that back navigation for you now

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980
handle that back navigation for you now
 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.740
handle that back navigation for you now
the nice thing about this is that the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750
the nice thing about this is that the
 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.539
the nice thing about this is that the
content and navigation pane separation

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549
content and navigation pane separation
 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.360
content and navigation pane separation
isn't limited to just large screens this

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370
isn't limited to just large screens this
 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.619
isn't limited to just large screens this
can really help to keep your chrome

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629
can really help to keep your chrome
 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.420
can really help to keep your chrome
stable in your application so anytime

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430
stable in your application so anytime
 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.789
stable in your application so anytime
that you have things like bars net

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799
that you have things like bars net
 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.729
that you have things like bars net
drawers bottom navigation bars any of

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739
drawers bottom navigation bars any of
 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:36.660
drawers bottom navigation bars any of
these things that you want to keep

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670
these things that you want to keep
 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.280
these things that you want to keep
stable and performs some consistent

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290
stable and performs some consistent
 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.899
stable and performs some consistent
animations from one screen to another

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909
animations from one screen to another
 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.729
animations from one screen to another
this really lets you do it in the way

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739
this really lets you do it in the way
 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.349
this really lets you do it in the way
that is really difficult to accomplish

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359
that is really difficult to accomplish
 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.089
that is really difficult to accomplish
with activity to activity transitions

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099
with activity to activity transitions
 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.740
with activity to activity transitions
where you can't preserve that kind of

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750
where you can't preserve that kind of
 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.809
where you can't preserve that kind of
continuity in your UI as you navigate

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819
continuity in your UI as you navigate
 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.479
continuity in your UI as you navigate
deeper in your apps hierarchy a little

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489
deeper in your apps hierarchy a little

bit Madigan flows now when I talk about

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670
bit Madigan flows now when I talk about
 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.930
bit Madigan flows now when I talk about
navigation flows I'm talking about those

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
navigation flows I'm talking about those
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.280
navigation flows I'm talking about those
step by step flows that you have in your

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290
step by step flows that you have in your
 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.899
step by step flows that you have in your
application so when you have a checkout

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909
application so when you have a checkout
 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.220
application so when you have a checkout
or a signup or a set up wizard you're

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230
or a signup or a set up wizard you're
 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.690
or a signup or a set up wizard you're
going to go the users are going a step

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700
going to go the users are going a step
 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.050
going to go the users are going a step
by step through their navigation and

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060
by step through their navigation and
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.550
by step through their navigation and
then they might want to wander back

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560
then they might want to wander back
 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.199
then they might want to wander back
using the back button or and then go

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209
using the back button or and then go
 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.430
using the back button or and then go
forward again and then when they're all

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440
forward again and then when they're all
 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.379
forward again and then when they're all
done you want to be all done with that

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389
done you want to be all done with that
 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.240
done you want to be all done with that
you don't want to want your user to be

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250
you don't want to want your user to be
 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.259
you don't want to want your user to be
able to go back through the checkout

the main screen you want them to go into
the category of perhaps or even from a

00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:11.249
the category of perhaps or even from a
 

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:13.429
the category of perhaps or even from a
notification or from a notification

00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:13.439
notification or from a notification
 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.619
notification or from a notification
that's a great example from the notation

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:15.629
that's a great example from the notation
 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.229
that's a great example from the notation
or maybe a search inside your

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:18.239
or maybe a search inside your
 

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:19.249
or maybe a search inside your
application you might want to have the

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:19.259
application you might want to have the
 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:23.749
application you might want to have the
same thing so what do we do well we just

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759
same thing so what do we do well we just
 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.519
same thing so what do we do well we just
execute a whole bunch of transactions

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:25.529
execute a whole bunch of transactions
 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:27.589
execute a whole bunch of transactions
all at the same time so build up the

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599
all at the same time so build up the
 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:29.299
all at the same time so build up the
stack for them boo boo boo boo boo boom

00:07:29.299 --> 00:07:29.309
stack for them boo boo boo boo boo boom
 

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:35.299
stack for them boo boo boo boo boo boom
execute them well hang on George so if I

00:07:35.299 --> 00:07:35.309
execute them well hang on George so if I
 

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:37.549
execute them well hang on George so if I
make repeated transactions then that

00:07:37.549 --> 00:07:37.559
make repeated transactions then that
 

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:38.359
make repeated transactions then that
means that each one of those

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:38.369
means that each one of those
 

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:40.100
means that each one of those
transactions I'm going to start and stop

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110
transactions I'm going to start and stop
 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.979
transactions I'm going to start and stop
those fragments as I execute each one in

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:42.989
those fragments as I execute each one in
 

00:07:42.989 --> 00:07:45.679
those fragments as I execute each one in
turn so that that can be really

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:45.689
turn so that that can be really
 

00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:47.389
turn so that that can be really
expensive right so how do I go ahead and

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:47.399
expensive right so how do I go ahead and
 

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:49.339
expensive right so how do I go ahead and
maintain that back stack state while

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:49.349
maintain that back stack state while
 

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:50.899
maintain that back stack state while
still not doing a whole lot of really

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:50.909
still not doing a whole lot of really
 

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:52.519
still not doing a whole lot of really
heavyweight work as I start and stop

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:52.529
heavyweight work as I start and stop
 

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:53.719
heavyweight work as I start and stop
each one of those fragments along the

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:53.729
each one of those fragments along the
 

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:55.939
each one of those fragments along the
way yeah that's a really big problem

00:07:55.939 --> 00:07:55.949
way yeah that's a really big problem
 

00:07:55.949 --> 00:07:57.739
way yeah that's a really big problem
because you have to create all those

00:07:57.739 --> 00:07:57.749
because you have to create all those
 

00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:00.439
because you have to create all those
views tear them down again inflation

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:00.449
views tear them down again inflation
 

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:01.729
views tear them down again inflation
right it seems like a lot of unnecessary

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:01.739
right it seems like a lot of unnecessary
 

00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:03.979
right it seems like a lot of unnecessary
work it is a lot of unnecessary work

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:03.989
work it is a lot of unnecessary work
 

00:08:03.989 --> 00:08:05.799
work it is a lot of unnecessary work
sorry guys

00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:05.809
sorry guys
 

00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:10.369
sorry guys
well you want to pick that sure all

00:08:10.369 --> 00:08:10.379
well you want to pick that sure all
 

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:17.389
well you want to pick that sure all
right thanks Adam so now we have this

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:17.399
right thanks Adam so now we have this
 

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:20.239
right thanks Adam so now we have this
new thing here called set reordering

00:08:20.239 --> 00:08:20.249
new thing here called set reordering
 

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:22.729
new thing here called set reordering
allows and what this does is it allows

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:22.739
allows and what this does is it allows
 

00:08:22.739 --> 00:08:25.609
allows and what this does is it allows
all of the execution to happen all at

00:08:25.609 --> 00:08:25.619
all of the execution to happen all at
 

00:08:25.619 --> 00:08:28.819
all of the execution to happen all at
once without changing your fragment

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:28.829
once without changing your fragment
 

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:32.449
once without changing your fragment
state and then at the very end we bring

00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459
state and then at the very end we bring
 

00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:33.980
state and then at the very end we bring
up all the fragments that need to be

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:33.990
up all the fragments that need to be
 

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.149
up all the fragments that need to be
brought up and tear down all the

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159
brought up and tear down all the
 

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.369
brought up and tear down all the
fragment that need be torn down and now

00:08:37.369 --> 00:08:37.379
fragment that need be torn down and now
 

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:39.170
fragment that need be torn down and now
your fragments don't have to go through

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180
your fragments don't have to go through
 

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.509
your fragments don't have to go through
all that oh I got it removed okay I

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519
all that oh I got it removed okay I
 

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:44.209
all that oh I got it removed okay I
don't remember so we can optimize this

00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:44.219
don't remember so we can optimize this
 

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:46.879
don't remember so we can optimize this
for you but you have to watch out

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:46.889
for you but you have to watch out
 

00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:50.010
for you but you have to watch out
because if you expected

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:50.020
because if you expected
 

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.769
because if you expected
a fragment to exist that didn't that

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:52.779
a fragment to exist that didn't that
 

00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:55.470
a fragment to exist that didn't that
might have been optimized out if it you

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480
might have been optimized out if it you
 

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.030
might have been optimized out if it you
expected it to go through this creation

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040
expected it to go through this creation
 

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.460
expected it to go through this creation
it might not have done that

00:08:59.460 --> 00:08:59.470
it might not have done that
 

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.769
it might not have done that
so you have to watch out for this so you

00:09:01.769 --> 00:09:01.779
so you have to watch out for this so you
 

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:04.230
so you have to watch out for this so you
use this in your applications it's great

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240
use this in your applications it's great
 

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.930
use this in your applications it's great
to use but expect some slightly

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:06.940
to use but expect some slightly
 

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:13.800
to use but expect some slightly
different behavior than before now you

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:13.810
different behavior than before now you
 

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.269
different behavior than before now you
might have seen in our in our

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279
might have seen in our in our
 

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:17.250
might have seen in our in our
application that as a user click through

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:17.260
application that as a user click through
 

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.269
application that as a user click through
the checkout screen it was just oh hop

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279
the checkout screen it was just oh hop
 

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:24.960
the checkout screen it was just oh hop
hop hop the screens changed

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:24.970
hop hop the screens changed
 

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.900
hop hop the screens changed
instantaneously and that's not very

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:27.910
instantaneously and that's not very
 

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.690
instantaneously and that's not very
pleasant so what we can do is we can add

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:30.700
pleasant so what we can do is we can add
 

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.780
pleasant so what we can do is we can add
transitions the easiest ones to use are

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:35.790
transitions the easiest ones to use are
 

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.710
transitions the easiest ones to use are
the trick the basic transistor

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:37.720
the trick the basic transistor
 

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.410
the trick the basic transistor
transitions that come with fragments and

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420
transitions that come with fragments and
 

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.699
transitions that come with fragments and
there are three options and this is done

00:09:41.699 --> 00:09:41.709
there are three options and this is done
 

00:09:41.709 --> 00:09:45.030
there are three options and this is done
on the transaction you call set

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040
on the transaction you call set
 

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.300
on the transaction you call set
transition and the basic transition

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:48.310
transition and the basic transition
 

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:53.810
transition and the basic transition
transitions are fade open and closed and

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820
transitions are fade open and closed and
 

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.269
transitions are fade open and closed and
from this it's really hard to see the

00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279
from this it's really hard to see the
 

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.699
from this it's really hard to see the
differences but you can see the fade has

00:09:59.699 --> 00:09:59.709
differences but you can see the fade has
 

00:09:59.709 --> 00:10:02.130
differences but you can see the fade has
just a simple crossfade and the open and

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:02.140
just a simple crossfade and the open and
 

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.280
just a simple crossfade and the open and
close also have a fade and zoom so play

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:05.290
close also have a fade and zoom so play
 

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.350
close also have a fade and zoom so play
with it a little bit see what works well

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360
with it a little bit see what works well
 

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.970
with it a little bit see what works well
in your application see what you like

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:08.980
in your application see what you like
 

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.530
in your application see what you like
that it provides a nice subtle effect

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:13.540
that it provides a nice subtle effect
 

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.699
that it provides a nice subtle effect
for your transition what if I want to do

00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:17.709
for your transition what if I want to do
 

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:20.310
for your transition what if I want to do
something a little bit more in keeping

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320
something a little bit more in keeping
 

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.740
something a little bit more in keeping
with my own apps design yeah if you want

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:22.750
with my own apps design yeah if you want
 

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.100
with my own apps design yeah if you want
something mobile custom then we can use

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.110
something mobile custom then we can use
 

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.949
something mobile custom then we can use
animations animations in this case is

00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959
animations animations in this case is
 

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:30.810
animations animations in this case is
the view animations that that allow you

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:30.820
the view animations that that allow you
 

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:39.170
the view animations that that allow you
to change scale rotation translation

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.180
 

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.870
alpha so fading so you can set those

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880
alpha so fading so you can set those
 

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.790
alpha so fading so you can set those
four and this is only on the support

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800
four and this is only on the support
 

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.930
four and this is only on the support
library you can set those on the view

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:48.940
library you can set those on the view
 

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.699
library you can set those on the view

popped sorry being removed and also the

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:57.550
popped sorry being removed and also the
 

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.569
popped sorry being removed and also the
same thing for the top as well the ones

00:11:00.569 --> 00:11:00.579
same thing for the top as well the ones
 

00:11:00.579 --> 00:11:02.370
same thing for the top as well the ones
that being added and removed if you have

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:02.380
that being added and removed if you have
 

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.900
that being added and removed if you have
different animations for each of those

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:03.910
different animations for each of those
 

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.250
different animations for each of those
and you can get an effect like this

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:05.260
and you can get an effect like this
 

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.820
and you can get an effect like this
which is very nice a slide effect but

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:08.830
which is very nice a slide effect but
 

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.400
which is very nice a slide effect but
you couldn't do with the basic animation

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:11.410
you couldn't do with the basic animation
 

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:16.080
you couldn't do with the basic animation
biggest ranches transitions now if

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:16.090
biggest ranches transitions now if
 

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.480
biggest ranches transitions now if
you're working with the framework

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:18.490
you're working with the framework
 

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.370
you're working with the framework
fragments you can do the same things

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:20.380
fragments you can do the same things
 

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.350
fragments you can do the same things
with animators but they provide even

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360
with animators but they provide even
 

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.470
with animators but they provide even
more benefit because now you can animate

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.480
more benefit because now you can animate
 

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.100
more benefit because now you can animate
any property on the view it means you

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:29.110
any property on the view it means you
 

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.720
any property on the view it means you
can have some really custom animations

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:30.730
can have some really custom animations
 

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.750
can have some really custom animations
whatever you want to do it's great and

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760
whatever you want to do it's great and
 

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.500
whatever you want to do it's great and
what's better now you can also do that

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:37.510
what's better now you can also do that
 

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:41.560
what's better now you can also do that
in this world I break

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:41.570
 

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:47.460
[Applause]

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:47.470
[Applause]
 

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.690
[Applause]
transition style is also added for

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:49.700
transition style is also added for
 

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.090
transition style is also added for
Frankford framework so that you can do

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:52.100
Frankford framework so that you can do
 

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.810
Frankford framework so that you can do
this set your animations animators in a

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:55.820
this set your animations animators in a
 

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.040
this set your animations animators in a
style now a lot of you have been using

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.050
style now a lot of you have been using
 

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.800
style now a lot of you have been using
the activity transitions and you want to

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:02.810
the activity transitions and you want to
 

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.530
the activity transitions and you want to
have that work with fragments as well so

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:05.540
have that work with fragments as well so
 

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.030
have that work with fragments as well so
activity transitions allows this great

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040
activity transitions allows this great
 

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.960
activity transitions allows this great
ability to have a shared element change

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:10.970
ability to have a shared element change
 

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.430
ability to have a shared element change
from one view to another so in this case

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440
from one view to another so in this case
 

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.950
from one view to another so in this case
from one fragment to another and it

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:17.960
from one fragment to another and it
 

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.470
from one fragment to another and it
works on activity transitions from

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480
works on activity transitions from
 

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.960
works on activity transitions from
lollipop on very useful and so we added

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:24.970
lollipop on very useful and so we added
 

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.540
lollipop on very useful and so we added
the ability to do that so in fragment

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:28.550
the ability to do that so in fragment
 

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.060
the ability to do that so in fragment
you call instead of doing this on the

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:31.070
you call instead of doing this on the
 

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.220
you call instead of doing this on the
transaction you do this on the fragment

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:33.230
transaction you do this on the fragment
 

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.950
transaction you do this on the fragment
itself you can set the views the

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:35.960
itself you can set the views the
 

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.960
itself you can set the views the
animations the transition to do on the

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:37.970
animations the transition to do on the
 

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.130
animations the transition to do on the
views that are coming in and this is for

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:42.140
views that are coming in and this is for
 

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.920
views that are coming in and this is for
all the views that are not the shared

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:44.930
all the views that are not the shared
 

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.320
all the views that are not the shared
element so that's the enter transition

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:47.330
element so that's the enter transition
 

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.140
element so that's the enter transition
and the shared element enter transition

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:50.150
and the shared element enter transition
 

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.000
and the shared element enter transition
this is the one you do on the view that

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.010
this is the one you do on the view that
 

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.240
this is the one you do on the view that
is moving this is our shared element in

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.250
is moving this is our shared element in
 

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.710
is moving this is our shared element in
this case I don't know what it was the

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720
this case I don't know what it was the
 

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.130
this case I don't know what it was the
almonds maybe and here this move views

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:00.140
almonds maybe and here this move views
 

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.550
almonds maybe and here this move views
is a combination of change bounds change

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:03.560
is a combination of change bounds change
 

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.820
is a combination of change bounds change
transform and change image transform as

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:06.830
transform and change image transform as
 

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.769
transform and change image transform as
too many things to fit on the slide but

00:13:08.769 --> 00:13:08.779
too many things to fit on the slide but
 

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:12.250
too many things to fit on the slide but
that's what it is here and then in the

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:12.260
that's what it is here and then in the
 

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.640
that's what it is here and then in the
transaction we add the shared element

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:15.650
transaction we add the shared element
 

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.890
transaction we add the shared element
itself and the shared element is the

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:17.900
itself and the shared element is the
 

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.040
itself and the shared element is the
view that's in that fragment and then we

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.050
view that's in that fragment and then we
 

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.949
view that's in that fragment and then we
have a target name this name this is a

00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959
have a target name this name this is a
 

00:13:23.959 --> 00:13:25.840
have a target name this name this is a
shared element transition name and this

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:25.850
shared element transition name and this
 

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.130
shared element transition name and this
is the name that you've given the

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:27.140
is the name that you've given the
 

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.910
is the name that you've given the
transition element in the fragment that

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920
transition element in the fragment that
 

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.949
transition element in the fragment that
has not been inflated yet so this in

00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959
has not been inflated yet so this in
 

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.990
has not been inflated yet so this in
this case it's in the my fragment that's

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000
this case it's in the my fragment that's
 

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.800
this case it's in the my fragment that's
being pulled in and then we can have our

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:41.810
being pulled in and then we can have our
 

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.460
being pulled in and then we can have our
transition which is great but

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:45.470
transition which is great but
 

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.519
transition which is great but
something's wrong right

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:48.529
 

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:53.050
you see it everyone raised his hand if

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:53.060
you see it everyone raised his hand if
 

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.460
you see it everyone raised his hand if
you see it what's the problem with this

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:54.470
you see it what's the problem with this
 

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.439
you see it what's the problem with this
okay a lot of you can see the problem

00:13:56.439 --> 00:13:56.449
okay a lot of you can see the problem
 

00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:59.309
okay a lot of you can see the problem
right transition is only working one way

00:13:59.309 --> 00:13:59.319
right transition is only working one way
 

00:13:59.319 --> 00:14:01.629
right transition is only working one way
right it works great getting into the

00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639
right it works great getting into the
 

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:04.329
right it works great getting into the
into the detailed view but when we come

00:14:04.329 --> 00:14:04.339
into the detailed view but when we come
 

00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:06.369
into the detailed view but when we come
back to that main view with all those

00:14:06.369 --> 00:14:06.379
back to that main view with all those
 

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:09.309
back to that main view with all those
other of these other elements you're not

00:14:09.309 --> 00:14:09.319
other of these other elements you're not
 

00:14:09.319 --> 00:14:12.699
other of these other elements you're not
seeing it and why is that well that main

00:14:12.699 --> 00:14:12.709
seeing it and why is that well that main
 

00:14:12.709 --> 00:14:15.939
seeing it and why is that well that main
view is a recycler view and what's

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:15.949
view is a recycler view and what's
 

00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:19.480
view is a recycler view and what's
happening is the recycler view will lay

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:19.490
happening is the recycler view will lay
 

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:25.480
happening is the recycler view will lay
out its views after the set adapter call

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:25.490
out its views after the set adapter call
 

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.980
out its views after the set adapter call
is made so we have to wait for the

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:26.990
is made so we have to wait for the
 

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.199
is made so we have to wait for the
layout call after the Civet after result

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:29.209
layout call after the Civet after result
 

00:14:29.209 --> 00:14:31.119
layout call after the Civet after result
is made and the transition is coming in

00:14:31.119 --> 00:14:31.129
is made and the transition is coming in
 

00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:33.340
is made and the transition is coming in
and said hey I want to share element and

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:33.350
and said hey I want to share element and
 

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.069
and said hey I want to share element and
it's not there so what does it do says

00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079
it's not there so what does it do says
 

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:38.160
it's not there so what does it do says
up give up fade-out

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.170
up give up fade-out
 

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.699
up give up fade-out
and so in activity transitions what do

00:14:42.699 --> 00:14:42.709
and so in activity transitions what do
 

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:45.040
and so in activity transitions what do
we do well it's great we have this thing

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.050
we do well it's great we have this thing
 

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.079
we do well it's great we have this thing
called postponing the transaction we're

00:14:47.079 --> 00:14:47.089
called postponing the transaction we're
 

00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:48.670
called postponing the transaction we're
postponing the transition so we have a

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:48.680
postponing the transition so we have a
 

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.980
postponing the transition so we have a
postpone enter transition and then we

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:50.990
postpone enter transition and then we
 

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.199
postpone enter transition and then we
when the views are ready we call start

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:53.209
when the views are ready we call start
 

00:14:53.209 --> 00:14:55.540
when the views are ready we call start
postpone gender transition so it gives

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:55.550
postpone gender transition so it gives
 

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.369
postpone gender transition so it gives
you all the ability to say okay just

00:14:57.369 --> 00:14:57.379
you all the ability to say okay just
 

00:14:57.379 --> 00:14:58.960
you all the ability to say okay just
hold on a second wait for my views come

00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:58.970
hold on a second wait for my views come
 

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.079
hold on a second wait for my views come
on come on views come on views and then

00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:02.089
on come on views come on views and then
 

00:15:02.089 --> 00:15:04.389
on come on views come on views and then
state when they're all ready then you

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399
state when they're all ready then you
 

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:08.559
state when they're all ready then you
said go and so we want to do this for

00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:08.569
said go and so we want to do this for
 

00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:12.670
said go and so we want to do this for
fragments as well so here we go we can

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680
fragments as well so here we go we can
 

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.490
fragments as well so here we go we can
do it for fragments but there's one

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:15.500
do it for fragments but there's one
 

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.579
do it for fragments but there's one
extra thing you need to do you

00:15:18.579 --> 00:15:18.589
extra thing you need to do you
 

00:15:18.589 --> 00:15:19.960
extra thing you need to do you
absolutely have to have the set

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:19.970
absolutely have to have the set
 

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.069
absolutely have to have the set
reordering allowed because for our short

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079
reordering allowed because for our short
 

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:26.889
reordering allowed because for our short
time while you're postponing both

00:15:26.889 --> 00:15:26.899
time while you're postponing both
 

00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:28.629
time while you're postponing both
fragments are there they're both active

00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639
fragments are there they're both active
 

00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:31.480
fragments are there they're both active
and that is not the order you've set is

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:31.490
and that is not the order you've set is
 

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.460
and that is not the order you've set is
it you expected one to be removed

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:33.470
it you expected one to be removed
 

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.669
it you expected one to be removed
another one be added so both those views

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:36.679
another one be added so both those views
 

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:38.860
another one be added so both those views
for both fragments are creating they

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:38.870
for both fragments are creating they
 

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.030
for both fragments are creating they
created state so that's gonna be a

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040
created state so that's gonna be a
 

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.819
created state so that's gonna be a
little weird for you so we want to make

00:15:42.819 --> 00:15:42.829
little weird for you so we want to make
 

00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:44.379
little weird for you so we want to make

at this point I am going to do a

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:05.770
at this point I am going to do a
 

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.170
at this point I am going to do a
recyclerview and I know I need to worry

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:08.180
recyclerview and I know I need to worry
 

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:13.240
recyclerview and I know I need to worry
about the transitions there and because

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.250
about the transitions there and because
 

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.100
about the transitions there and because
I love data binding some of you might

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.110
I love data binding some of you might
 

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.380
I love data binding some of you might
know that I love data binding and we

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:17.390
know that I love data binding and we
 

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.700
know that I love data binding and we
have a few models here too so that's

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:18.710
have a few models here too so that's
 

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.340
have a few models here too so that's
good too mm-hmm Thank You Adam if you

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:21.350
good too mm-hmm Thank You Adam if you
 

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.170
good too mm-hmm Thank You Adam if you
haven't seen that talk you should go

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:23.180
haven't seen that talk you should go
 

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.260
haven't seen that talk you should go
back and watch it we're using that so

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:26.270
back and watch it we're using that so
 

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.330

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:47.060
transition is ready and it will just go
 

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:53.880
transition is ready and it will just go
on ahead and I figure I stick to slide

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:53.890
 

00:16:53.890 --> 00:17:01.300
so okay it works all right so one of the

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:01.310
so okay it works all right so one of the
 

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.980
so okay it works all right so one of the
other features moving along to something

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:02.990
other features moving along to something
 

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.540
other features moving along to something
completely different one of the other

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:04.550
completely different one of the other
 

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.740
completely different one of the other
features that we get a lot of questions

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:05.750
features that we get a lot of questions
 

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.780
features that we get a lot of questions
about are the set retain instance method

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:07.790
about are the set retain instance method
 

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.030
about are the set retain instance method
on fragments so you retain an instance

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:10.040
on fragments so you retain an instance
 

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.699
on fragments so you retain an instance
across an activity destruction and

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:12.709
across an activity destruction and
 

00:17:12.709 --> 00:17:15.010
across an activity destruction and
creation across something like a

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:15.020
creation across something like a
 

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.000
creation across something like a
configuration change so this means that

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.010
configuration change so this means that
 

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.860
configuration change so this means that
the object instance itself of the

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:20.870
the object instance itself of the
 

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:22.300
the object instance itself of the
fragment that you've marked this way is

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:22.310
fragment that you've marked this way is
 

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.460
fragment that you've marked this way is
transferred across the parent recreation

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:24.470
transferred across the parent recreation
 

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.370
transferred across the parent recreation
so anything that you put there is moved

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:27.380
so anything that you put there is moved
 

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.140
so anything that you put there is moved
along with it so objects you don't have

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:29.150
along with it so objects you don't have
 

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.420
along with it so objects you don't have
to serialize this into a partial bowl

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:31.430
to serialize this into a partial bowl
 

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.940
to serialize this into a partial bowl

passed across as shared as saved in some
 

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.400
passed across as shared as saved in some
state but the important thing to

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:36.410
state but the important thing to
 

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.840
state but the important thing to
remember if you're doing this is that it

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:37.850
remember if you're doing this is that it
 

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.430
remember if you're doing this is that it
doesn't happen if the process is

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440
doesn't happen if the process is
 

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.950
doesn't happen if the process is
recreated your objects aren't there so

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960
recreated your objects aren't there so
 

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.030
recreated your objects aren't there so
you need to be a little bit careful

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:43.040
you need to be a little bit careful
 

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.440
you need to be a little bit careful
about this you need to make sure that

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:44.450
about this you need to make sure that
 

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.880
about this you need to make sure that
you can still restore from instance

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:45.890
you can still restore from instance
 

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.170
you can still restore from instance
state if you have to even though in the

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:47.180
state if you have to even though in the
 

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.120
state if you have to even though in the
common case you still have the full

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:49.130
common case you still have the full
 

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.500
common case you still have the full
objects that you may have created in the

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:50.510
objects that you may have created in the
 

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:54.220
objects that you may have created in the
first place so this is a replacement for

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:54.230
first place so this is a replacement for
 

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.230
first place so this is a replacement for
the old on retained non configuration

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240
the old on retained non configuration
 

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.230
the old on retained non configuration

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.270
instance method that was on activity in
fact the same mechanism is used to

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280
fact the same mechanism is used to
 

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.000
fact the same mechanism is used to
implement the fragments version of this

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.010
implement the fragments version of this
 

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:05.290
implement the fragments version of this
but what's a little bit more interesting

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:05.300
but what's a little bit more interesting
 

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.210
but what's a little bit more interesting
is that this mechanism is right now the

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:07.220
is that this mechanism is right now the
 

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.590
is that this mechanism is right now the
backbone of the dn't view model

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:08.600
backbone of the dn't view model
 

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.910
backbone of the dn't view model
component that we've been talking about

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:09.920
component that we've been talking about
 

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.790
component that we've been talking about
earlier at i/o here so the view models

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:12.800
earlier at i/o here so the view models
 

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.610
earlier at i/o here so the view models
are actually saved within a

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:15.620
are actually saved within a
 

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.350
are actually saved within a
retain instance fragments to shuffle

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360
retain instance fragments to shuffle
 

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.750
retain instance fragments to shuffle
them across from one one activity of the

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760
them across from one one activity of the
 

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.370
them across from one one activity of the
next and this just kind of goes to show

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:21.380
next and this just kind of goes to show
 

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.110
next and this just kind of goes to show
the types of infrastructure that you can

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120
the types of infrastructure that you can
 

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.730
the types of infrastructure that you can
build on top of a routine instance

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:24.740
build on top of a routine instance
 

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.380
build on top of a routine instance
fragment it's something that's a little

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:26.390
fragment it's something that's a little
 

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.210
fragment it's something that's a little
bit on the more abstract end of things

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:28.220
bit on the more abstract end of things
 

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.710
bit on the more abstract end of things
so we end up getting a lot of questions

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720
so we end up getting a lot of questions
 

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.540
so we end up getting a lot of questions
about hey what's this good for oh this

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:31.550
about hey what's this good for oh this
 

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.720
about hey what's this good for oh this
is a pretty good example and just like

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:34.730
is a pretty good example and just like
 

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.850
is a pretty good example and just like
we talked about with view models it

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:36.860
we talked about with view models it
 

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.200
we talked about with view models it
means that there's a few things that you

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.210
means that there's a few things that you
 

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.840
means that there's a few things that you
really need to avoid in this case

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:40.850
really need to avoid in this case
 

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.240
really need to avoid in this case
don't put views in a retain instance

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:43.250
don't put views in a retain instance
 

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.560
don't put views in a retain instance

manual bookkeeping technically you can

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:46.550
manual bookkeeping technically you can
 

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.500
manual bookkeeping technically you can
kind of get away with it if you're

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:47.510
kind of get away with it if you're
 

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.210
kind of get away with it if you're
really careful make sure that you

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:49.220
really careful make sure that you
 

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.980
really careful make sure that you
release all your references and

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:50.990
release all your references and
 

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.450
release all your references and

fragment so on and so forth but really
 

00:18:54.679 --> 00:18:55.840
fragment so on and so forth but really
it ends up being best just to kind of

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:55.850
it ends up being best just to kind of
 

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.940
it ends up being best just to kind of
avoid it and we'll get into a few more

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:57.950
avoid it and we'll get into a few more
 

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.620
avoid it and we'll get into a few more
patterns later in the talk here around

00:18:59.620 --> 00:18:59.630
patterns later in the talk here around
 

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.070

what you can do instead context
 

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.470
what you can do instead context
specifically activity context well we

specifically activity context well we
all know why you don't want to save an

all know why you don't want to save an
 

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.890
all know why you don't want to save an

lifetime of that activity itself but the

00:19:14.169 --> 00:19:14.179
thing that really tends to catch people
 

00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:16.210
thing that really tends to catch people
is callback references so if you

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:16.220
is callback references so if you
 

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.950
is callback references so if you
register a listener or some sort of a

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960
register a listener or some sort of a
 

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.540
register a listener or some sort of a
callback with a fragment and that

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:19.550
callback with a fragment and that
 

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.890
callback with a fragment and that
fragment is going to outlive the

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:20.900
fragment is going to outlive the
 

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.450
fragment is going to outlive the
container it's really easy to

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:22.460
container it's really easy to
 

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.880
container it's really easy to
accidentally close over that in that

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:24.890
accidentally close over that in that
 

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.220
accidentally close over that in that
context that you had and have the

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:27.230
context that you had and have the
 

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:32.790
context that you had and have the
activity still outlast the original host

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:32.800
 

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.799
so child fragments are something that

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:35.809
so child fragments are something that
 

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:37.330
so child fragments are something that
did a lot of people really hard a few

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:37.340
did a lot of people really hard a few
 

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.770
did a lot of people really hard a few
years ago because frankly we had a lot

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:38.780
years ago because frankly we had a lot
 

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.110
years ago because frankly we had a lot
of bugs around them and they were

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120
of bugs around them and they were
 

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.460
of bugs around them and they were
created to solve a particular problem

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:42.470
created to solve a particular problem
 

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.140
created to solve a particular problem
and that was dependency management

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:44.150
and that was dependency management
 

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:48.340
and that was dependency management
within a particular activity so consider

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:48.350
within a particular activity so consider
 

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.049
within a particular activity so consider
this case you've got a fragment that has

00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:50.059
this case you've got a fragment that has
 

00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:50.710
this case you've got a fragment that has
a viewpager

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720
a viewpager
 

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.100
a viewpager
pretty common right the viewpager uses a

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:54.110
pretty common right the viewpager uses a
 

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.660
pretty common right the viewpager uses a
fragment pager adapter because that's a

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:55.670
fragment pager adapter because that's a
 

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.690
fragment pager adapter because that's a
pretty easy way to use a view pager and

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:57.700
pretty easy way to use a view pager and
 

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.570
pretty easy way to use a view pager and
then you remove the pager fragment well

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:01.580
then you remove the pager fragment well
 

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.299
then you remove the pager fragment well
now we have a problem so what actually

00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:04.309
now we have a problem so what actually
 

00:20:04.309 --> 00:20:05.890
now we have a problem so what actually
happens in that case you've got all the

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:05.900
happens in that case you've got all the
 

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.090
happens in that case you've got all the
fragments that were added by the pager

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:07.100
fragments that were added by the pager
 

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.760
fragments that were added by the pager
adapter but the host fragment or the

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:09.770
adapter but the host fragment or the
 

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.290
adapter but the host fragment or the
conceptual host fragment in this case

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:11.300
conceptual host fragment in this case
 

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.030
conceptual host fragment in this case
that has a view pager itself was removed

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:13.040
that has a view pager itself was removed
 

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.710
that has a view pager itself was removed
now something has to be in charge of

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720
now something has to be in charge of
 

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.750
now something has to be in charge of
removing the individual page fragments

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760
removing the individual page fragments
 

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.760
removing the individual page fragments
and this was something that really kind

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:18.770
and this was something that really kind
 

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.410
and this was something that really kind
of went to show that a single collection

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:20.420
of went to show that a single collection
 

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.570
of went to show that a single collection
of fragments is insufficient in fact

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:22.580
of fragments is insufficient in fact
 

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.310
of fragments is insufficient in fact
when the fragment api's were first sort

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320
when the fragment api's were first sort
 

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.900
when the fragment api's were first sort
of rolling out to a lot of internal

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:25.910
of rolling out to a lot of internal
 

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.669
of rolling out to a lot of internal
developers right around honeycomb this

00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679
developers right around honeycomb this
 

00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:27.910
developers right around honeycomb this
is

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:27.920
is
 

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.410
is
of the first questions that we got and

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:29.420
of the first questions that we got and
 

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.580
of the first questions that we got and
it took us quite a while to come back

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:30.590
it took us quite a while to come back
 

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.410
it took us quite a while to come back
and address this of what happens when

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:32.420
and address this of what happens when
 

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.790
and address this of what happens when
you do have these dependencies in

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:33.800
you do have these dependencies in
 

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.540
you do have these dependencies in
between fragments and part of the reason

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:37.550
between fragments and part of the reason
 

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.220
between fragments and part of the reason
why this was such a pain is because we

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:39.230
why this was such a pain is because we
 

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.720
why this was such a pain is because we
didn't have any ordering guarantees

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:40.730
didn't have any ordering guarantees
 

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.600
didn't have any ordering guarantees
around fragments being created and

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:42.610
around fragments being created and
 

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.100
around fragments being created and
what's worse is a lot of times this only

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:45.110
what's worse is a lot of times this only
 

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.900
what's worse is a lot of times this only
would come up much much later in the

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:46.910
would come up much much later in the
 

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:50.560
would come up much much later in the
process just because you added fragments

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:50.570
process just because you added fragments
 

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.120
process just because you added fragments
in one particular order you could

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:52.130
in one particular order you could
 

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.310
in one particular order you could
control that that order as you're

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320
control that that order as you're
 

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.260
control that that order as you're
running that and kind of running the

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:56.270
running that and kind of running the
 

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.790
running that and kind of running the
initial transactions that builds up that

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:57.800
initial transactions that builds up that
 

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.130
initial transactions that builds up that
state but when your process dies and we

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:00.140
state but when your process dies and we
 

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.540
state but when your process dies and we
restore those fragments from instant

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:01.550
restore those fragments from instant
 

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.670
restore those fragments from instant
state later the order of that recreation

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:03.680
state later the order of that recreation
 

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.500
state later the order of that recreation
was always undefined depending on what

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:05.510
was always undefined depending on what
 

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.510
was always undefined depending on what
all may have happened throughout the

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520
all may have happened throughout the
 

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.000
all may have happened throughout the
lifetime of your activity before just

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.010
lifetime of your activity before just
 

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.140
lifetime of your activity before just
kind of due to some artifacts of

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:11.150
kind of due to some artifacts of
 

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.910
kind of due to some artifacts of
internal bookkeeping this was something

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:12.920
internal bookkeeping this was something
 

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.250
internal bookkeeping this was something
that could cause these things to be

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:15.260
that could cause these things to be
 

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.750
that could cause these things to be
reordered in terms of which one would

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760
reordered in terms of which one would
 

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.580
reordered in terms of which one would
get oncreate first so on and so forth

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:18.590
get oncreate first so on and so forth
 

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:19.960
get oncreate first so on and so forth
and it made it very difficult to

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:19.970
and it made it very difficult to
 

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.210
and it made it very difficult to
reconnect any sorts of shared State now

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:22.220
reconnect any sorts of shared State now
 

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.070
reconnect any sorts of shared State now
this sort of shared state is something

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080
this sort of shared state is something
 

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.540
this sort of shared state is something
that's much easier to handle with the

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:25.550
that's much easier to handle with the
 

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.240
that's much easier to handle with the
viewmodel system that we showed earlier

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.250
viewmodel system that we showed earlier
 

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.010
viewmodel system that we showed earlier
but at the time we really didn't have a

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:30.020
but at the time we really didn't have a
 

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.370
but at the time we really didn't have a
good solution to this problem so one of

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:33.380
good solution to this problem so one of
 

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.630
good solution to this problem so one of
the other things that was kind of a pain

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640
the other things that was kind of a pain
 

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.610
the other things that was kind of a pain
is that the deferred transaction commits

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:36.620
is that the deferred transaction commits
 

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.430
is that the deferred transaction commits
that have been common ever since we are

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440
that have been common ever since we are
 

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.740
that have been common ever since we are
up until we added the commit now method

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:41.750
up until we added the commit now method
 

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.740
up until we added the commit now method
on fragment transaction the nice thing

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:44.750
on fragment transaction the nice thing
 

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.090
on fragment transaction the nice thing
and the reason why this was done in the

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:46.100
and the reason why this was done in the
 

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.070
and the reason why this was done in the
first place was to avoid reentrant calls

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080
first place was to avoid reentrant calls
 

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.320
first place was to avoid reentrant calls
you didn't have to worry about one

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:50.330
you didn't have to worry about one
 

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.000
you didn't have to worry about one
particular transaction being half

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.010
particular transaction being half
 

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.830
particular transaction being half
executed and then starting another

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840
executed and then starting another
 

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.220
executed and then starting another
transaction as a result of it but this

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:57.230
transaction as a result of it but this
 

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:58.810
transaction as a result of it but this
really did have a cost and I think that

00:21:58.810 --> 00:21:58.820
really did have a cost and I think that
 

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.390
really did have a cost and I think that
if you're in this room right now you've

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.400
if you're in this room right now you've
 

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.130
if you're in this room right now you've
probably experienced some of the costs

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:03.140
probably experienced some of the costs
 

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.780
probably experienced some of the costs
of this raise your hand if you called

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:04.790
of this raise your hand if you called
 

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.610
of this raise your hand if you called
execute pending transactions to fix a

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:06.620
execute pending transactions to fix a
 

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:11.470
execute pending transactions to fix a
bug yeah that's a lot of hands so this

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480
bug yeah that's a lot of hands so this
 

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.030
bug yeah that's a lot of hands so this
is one of those things that ends up

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:13.040
is one of those things that ends up
 

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.100
is one of those things that ends up
being really kind of difficult to work

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.110
being really kind of difficult to work
 

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:20.800
being really kind of difficult to work
with so child fragments as dependencies

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:20.810
with so child fragments as dependencies
 

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.630
with so child fragments as dependencies
work out really well because they solve

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640
work out really well because they solve
 

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.880
work out really well because they solve
a lot of these particular issues it's a

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:24.890
a lot of these particular issues it's a
 

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.590
a lot of these particular issues it's a
separate fragment manager so you don't

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:26.600
separate fragment manager so you don't
 

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.150
separate fragment manager so you don't
get the reentrant cases no matter what

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:28.160

so all these things are added and
 

00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:41.450
so all these things are added and
removed as a unit which means that it

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:41.460
removed as a unit which means that it
 

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.070

00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:55.969
that you can define parameters to these
you can place in line we can go ahead

00:25:55.969 --> 00:25:55.979
you can place in line we can go ahead
 

00:25:55.979 --> 00:25:58.419
you can place in line we can go ahead
and inflate arguments in a way that

00:25:58.419 --> 00:25:58.429
and inflate arguments in a way that
 

00:25:58.429 --> 00:26:02.299
and inflate arguments in a way that
excuse me in a way that allows you to do

00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:02.309
excuse me in a way that allows you to do
 

00:26:02.309 --> 00:26:03.680
excuse me in a way that allows you to do
this without having a lot of very

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:03.690
this without having a lot of very
 

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.269
this without having a lot of very
heavyweight integration you don't have

00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279
heavyweight integration you don't have
 

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:06.680
heavyweight integration you don't have
to go find it

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:06.690
to go find it
 

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.389
to go find it
configure it separately you just do it

00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:08.399
configure it separately you just do it
 

00:26:08.399 --> 00:26:11.509
configure it separately you just do it
inline so one of the things that made

00:26:11.509 --> 00:26:11.519
inline so one of the things that made
 

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:13.009
inline so one of the things that made
this really difficult to do in the past

00:26:13.009 --> 00:26:13.019
this really difficult to do in the past
 

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:15.169
this really difficult to do in the past
was kind of again just artifact of

00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:15.179
was kind of again just artifact of
 

00:26:15.179 --> 00:26:17.299
was kind of again just artifact of
history and they you couldn't actually

00:26:17.299 --> 00:26:17.309
history and they you couldn't actually
 

00:26:17.309 --> 00:26:19.519
history and they you couldn't actually
set fragment arguments that arguments

00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:19.529
set fragment arguments that arguments
 

00:26:19.529 --> 00:26:23.479
set fragment arguments that arguments
bundle after after the fragment had been

00:26:23.479 --> 00:26:23.489
bundle after after the fragment had been
 

00:26:23.489 --> 00:26:25.549
bundle after after the fragment had been
added to a fragment manager so now we've

00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559
added to a fragment manager so now we've
 

00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:27.619
added to a fragment manager so now we've
relaxed that and we've said that now

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:27.629
relaxed that and we've said that now
 

00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:29.269
relaxed that and we've said that now
fragment arguments can be changed

00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279
fragment arguments can be changed
 

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:31.579
fragment arguments can be changed
anytime the state isn't saved including

00:26:31.579 --> 00:26:31.589
anytime the state isn't saved including
 

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:33.619
anytime the state isn't saved including
during inflation so there's this case

00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:33.629
during inflation so there's this case
 

00:26:33.629 --> 00:26:35.899
during inflation so there's this case
where after you rotate or so on and so

00:26:35.899 --> 00:26:35.909
where after you rotate or so on and so
 

00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:37.459
where after you rotate or so on and so
forth and we're reconnecting inflated

00:26:37.459 --> 00:26:37.469
forth and we're reconnecting inflated
 

00:26:37.469 --> 00:26:39.229
forth and we're reconnecting inflated
fragments which is again something that

00:26:39.229 --> 00:26:39.239
fragments which is again something that
 

00:26:39.239 --> 00:26:43.579
fragments which is again something that
we do automatically then you can run in

00:26:43.579 --> 00:26:43.589
we do automatically then you can run in
 

00:26:43.589 --> 00:26:45.139
we do automatically then you can run in
this case where we've already restored

00:26:45.139 --> 00:26:45.149
this case where we've already restored
 

00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.979
this case where we've already restored
that fragment

00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:45.989
that fragment
 

00:26:45.989 --> 00:26:47.479
that fragment
we're trying to hook it back up again

00:26:47.479 --> 00:26:47.489
we're trying to hook it back up again
 

00:26:47.489 --> 00:26:49.190
we're trying to hook it back up again
but it's already added which means that

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200
but it's already added which means that
 

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.499
but it's already added which means that
you can't do what the natural thing is

00:26:51.499 --> 00:26:51.509
you can't do what the natural thing is
 

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:53.029
you can't do what the natural thing is
which is to represent all those

00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039
which is to represent all those
 

00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:54.379
which is to represent all those
arguments that you may inflate as

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:54.389
arguments that you may inflate as
 

00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:56.779
arguments that you may inflate as
arguments in the bundle so that way you

00:26:56.779 --> 00:26:56.789
arguments in the bundle so that way you
 

00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:58.579
arguments in the bundle so that way you
have basically a single source of truth

00:26:58.579 --> 00:26:58.589
have basically a single source of truth
 

00:26:58.589 --> 00:27:00.440
have basically a single source of truth
for all the configuration parameters of

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:00.450
for all the configuration parameters of
 

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.049
for all the configuration parameters of
that fragment well now you can way to

00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059
that fragment well now you can way to
 

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:05.590
that fragment well now you can way to
take any wave in here go back go back

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600
take any wave in here go back go back
 

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.360
take any wave in here go back go back
what does not is state safe thing oh

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:08.370
what does not is state safe thing oh
 

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:12.520
what does not is state safe thing oh
yeah so again a bunch of people had I

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:12.530
yeah so again a bunch of people had I
 

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.630
yeah so again a bunch of people had I
don't know where this comes from but

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640
don't know where this comes from but
 

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.760
don't know where this comes from but
people apparently try to commit fragment

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:16.770
people apparently try to commit fragment
 

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.560
people apparently try to commit fragment
transactions when states already been

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:18.570
transactions when states already been
 

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.000
transactions when states already been
saved and they've got why would you do

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.010
saved and they've got why would you do
 

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.279
saved and they've got why would you do
that I don't know but because I can't

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:22.289
that I don't know but because I can't
 

00:27:22.289 --> 00:27:26.360
that I don't know but because I can't
tell that might have been it yeah so we

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:26.370
tell that might have been it yeah so we
 

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.710
tell that might have been it yeah so we
added a simple getter on this one so

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720
added a simple getter on this one so
 

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.880
added a simple getter on this one so
that you can know when that happens and

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:28.890
that you can know when that happens and
 

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.500
that you can know when that happens and
it also makes things like writing

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:30.510
it also makes things like writing
 

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.960
it also makes things like writing
lifecycle aware components that make

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:32.970
lifecycle aware components that make
 

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:34.460
lifecycle aware components that make
sure that you don't try to crack mint

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:34.470
sure that you don't try to crack mint
 

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.580
sure that you don't try to crack mint
transactions when when it's not valid to

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:37.590
transactions when when it's not valid to
 

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.350
transactions when when it's not valid to
do so I was a whole heck of a lot easier

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360
 

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:47.029
thank you so again part of what we're

00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039
thank you so again part of what we're
 

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:48.110
thank you so again part of what we're
trying to do here is create a much

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120
trying to do here is create a much
 

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.789
trying to do here is create a much
better layered infrastructure we've

00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799
better layered infrastructure we've
 

00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:51.200
better layered infrastructure we've
traditionally hidden a lot of these

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.210
traditionally hidden a lot of these
 

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.940
traditionally hidden a lot of these
internals in some of these Android

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:52.950
internals in some of these Android
 

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.310
internals in some of these Android
components such that only the internal

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320
components such that only the internal
 

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.630
components such that only the internal
components are twiddling them which

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640
components are twiddling them which
 

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.370
components are twiddling them which
means that as soon as you all have a

00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:58.380
means that as soon as you all have a
 

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.169
means that as soon as you all have a
more complicated case that you're trying

00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179
more complicated case that you're trying
 

00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:01.490
more complicated case that you're trying
to handle we've made it very difficult

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.500
to handle we've made it very difficult
 

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.710
to handle we've made it very difficult
for you to do this in the past so we

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720
for you to do this in the past so we
 

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.240
for you to do this in the past so we
tried to open a lot more of those things

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.250
tried to open a lot more of those things
 

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.560
tried to open a lot more of those things
up make these things a little bit easier

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:06.570
up make these things a little bit easier
 

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.419
up make these things a little bit easier
to inspect from your own code to deal

00:28:08.419 --> 00:28:08.429
to inspect from your own code to deal
 

00:28:08.429 --> 00:28:09.830
to inspect from your own code to deal
with those cases that arise that we

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840
with those cases that arise that we
 

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.210
with those cases that arise that we
didn't think of so in this case the

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:14.220
didn't think of so in this case the
 

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.680
didn't think of so in this case the
pattern that we really kind of want to

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:15.690
pattern that we really kind of want to
 

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.930
pattern that we really kind of want to
encourage is mapping fragment arguments

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940
encourage is mapping fragment arguments
 

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.330
encourage is mapping fragment arguments
to attributes for those UI fragments

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340
to attributes for those UI fragments
 

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.380
to attributes for those UI fragments
again it gives you kind of a single

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:21.390
again it gives you kind of a single
 

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:25.310
again it gives you kind of a single
source of truth so let's go ahead and go

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320
source of truth so let's go ahead and go
 

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.919
source of truth so let's go ahead and go
over to an example of this so in this

00:28:27.919 --> 00:28:27.929
over to an example of this so in this
 

00:28:27.929 --> 00:28:30.289
over to an example of this so in this
case we've got a few kind of nice little

00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:30.299
case we've got a few kind of nice little
 

00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:33.200
case we've got a few kind of nice little
Kotlin based methods that are extensions

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:33.210
Kotlin based methods that are extensions
 

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.460
Kotlin based methods that are extensions
that make this a little bit easier to

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:34.470
that make this a little bit easier to
 

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:38.149
that make this a little bit easier to
handle in this case we've got one

00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159
handle in this case we've got one
 

00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:41.029
handle in this case we've got one
utility method that is just our width

00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039
utility method that is just our width
 

00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:44.060
utility method that is just our width
styled attributes here so many of you

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:44.070
styled attributes here so many of you
 

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.710
styled attributes here so many of you
have dealt with inflating attributes for

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720
have dealt with inflating attributes for
 

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.680
have dealt with inflating attributes for
views and you know you have to get the

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:48.690
views and you know you have to get the
 

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.450
views and you know you have to get the
typed array you have to recycle it

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:50.460
typed array you have to recycle it
 

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.130
typed array you have to recycle it
afterwards it's really easy to just kind

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:52.140
afterwards it's really easy to just kind
 

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.810
afterwards it's really easy to just kind
of wrap these up inside some extension

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:53.820
of wrap these up inside some extension
 

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.080
of wrap these up inside some extension
functions similarly we have this this

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:57.090
functions similarly we have this this
 

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:58.940
functions similarly we have this this
simple little thing hey is there a

00:28:58.940 --> 00:28:58.950
simple little thing hey is there a
 

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.890

reuse it otherwise create a new one so

00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:05.419
reuse it otherwise create a new one so

reuse it otherwise create a new one so
these are the sorts of things that

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:07.350
these are the sorts of things that

these are the sorts of things that
Kotlin really adds to the fragment API

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480
Kotlin really adds to the fragment API
 

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.899
Kotlin really adds to the fragment API
all the things that are kind of a pain

00:29:11.899 --> 00:29:11.909
all the things that are kind of a pain
 

00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:14.539
all the things that are kind of a pain
in the neck to do with fragments you can

00:29:14.539 --> 00:29:14.549
in the neck to do with fragments you can
 

00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:16.549
in the neck to do with fragments you can
make some simple extensions that you

00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559
make some simple extensions that you
 

00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:18.610
make some simple extensions that you
were really hard to do before

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:18.620
were really hard to do before
 

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.370
were really hard to do before
but for example one of my favorite

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:21.380
but for example one of my favorite
 

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.080
but for example one of my favorite
features for something like this is to

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:23.090
features for something like this is to
 

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.030
features for something like this is to
use property delegates to deal with

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:25.040
use property delegates to deal with
 

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.530
use property delegates to deal with
arguments and you can rap even more of

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:26.540
arguments and you can rap even more of
 

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.540
arguments and you can rap even more of
this stuff and just basically treat them

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:28.550
this stuff and just basically treat them
 

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.340
this stuff and just basically treat them
as normal properties on your fragment

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:30.350
as normal properties on your fragment
 

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:35.350
as normal properties on your fragment
objects so putting a bunch of this

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360
objects so putting a bunch of this
 

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.630
objects so putting a bunch of this
together

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640
together
 

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.160
together
fragments help you maintain more of a

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:39.170
fragments help you maintain more of a
 

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:43.240
fragments help you maintain more of a
content and chroma separation they give

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:43.250
content and chroma separation they give
 

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:44.590
content and chroma separation they give
you the ability to keep your content

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600
you the ability to keep your content
 

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.980
you the ability to keep your content
pages as fully encapsulated items

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:47.990
pages as fully encapsulated items
 

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.200
pages as fully encapsulated items
without disturbing the rest of the UI

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:50.210
without disturbing the rest of the UI
 

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:55.750
without disturbing the rest of the UI
around it you get richer transitions you

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760
around it you get richer transitions you
 

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.880
around it you get richer transitions you
get better shared components because you

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:57.890
get better shared components because you
 

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:59.290
get better shared components because you
can reuse a lot of these things and you

00:29:59.290 --> 00:29:59.300
can reuse a lot of these things and you
 

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.549
can reuse a lot of these things and you
don't have to initialize all of them

00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559
don't have to initialize all of them
 

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:02.680
don't have to initialize all of them
separately and you can better

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:02.690
separately and you can better
 

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.830
separately and you can better
encapsulate your dependencies so you

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840
encapsulate your dependencies so you
 

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.120
encapsulate your dependencies so you
don't necessarily have to leak all of

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:07.130
don't necessarily have to leak all of
 

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.510
don't necessarily have to leak all of
these things to the surrounding host and

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520
these things to the surrounding host and
 

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.270
these things to the surrounding host and
thank you very much for coming

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:13.280
thank you very much for coming
 

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:27.209
thank you very much for coming
