00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:02.630
I'm going to show you
what we came up with.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.880
But this isn't necessarily,
the right answer.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.040
Remember, this an art,
it's not a science.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.740
And either way, I'm not going to
give you the whole answer.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.070
I'm leaving a few tweaks for
you to make,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.480
and you'll be working on this site
again, at the end of the next lesson.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.420
Looking at the new site,
there are a number of major changes.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.715
Let's go ahead and start small.

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:26.470
First off, the Nav buttons that
were right here above the hero,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.410
have been shifted off-canvas,
into the Hamburger button menu.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.740
The Hamburger button, is the one
with the three horizontal lines.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.560
And now we've got our Nav-Links,
over here on the side.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.900
This is a nice way of retrieving,
a little bit of screen real estate.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.820
Also, the header text, is a little bit
smaller to match this smaller viewport.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
The first breakpoint
comes in a 550 pixels.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.830
See how the elements ref load and
change their location on the screen.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.090
The weather is now here, in this second
position, the hero is only taking up

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.460
about 60% of the viewport width,
while the weather has the other 40%.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.340
Also, the Nav button showed back up.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.990
To see how it's done,
I've opened up Sublime Text.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.360
You can see some breakpoints, like this
one using min-width 550 pixels and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.520
this one using min-width 700 pixels.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.770
And these breakpoints
include changes to order and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.720
widths of different elements on
the screen, like hero and weather.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.660
Great points like these, make it
really easy to change the width and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.640
order of elements and
totally change and shift the layout.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.140
The next great point comes
in at 700 pixels across.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.890
The layout's changed a bit.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.550
Top news is moved up here.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.590
And we've got 50% on the Top news side,
and 50% for the hero image.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.120
And the weather is now, down below.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.050
At even larger widths,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.290
eventually the main section of the page,
keeps to a fixed width.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.890
This was accomplished with a breakpoint
that set the width to 850 pixels,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.540
once the page's view port is as large or
larger than 850 pixels.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.490
I've also the shifted the scores and
the weather.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.700
The scores are taking up 60% of
the screen and the weather's got 40%.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.340
The design that you see here, takes
advantage of a mostly fluid design,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.630
with a little bit of layout shifting,
I think the hometown site is

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.140
actually looking pretty good right now,
but it's definitely not perfect.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.280
Let's look at the weather real quick.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.540
On this view, the weather looks like so,
with this cute little icon right here

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.030
and then the actual
temperature right next to it.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.570
But if you resize the screen
just a little bit.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.990
The temperature drops down
to the line below it and

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.810
that's actually kind of gross.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.360
I don't like that.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.950
I also think that something better
could be done with the hero image.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.570
Watch the edge of it
as the screen resizes.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.170
See how the edge actually changes?

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.850
That's because right now, CSS is being
used to set and position the image.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.000
Background size cover,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.500
will scale up the image to make
sure it covers the entire div.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.440
I think there could
be a better solution.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.380
What do you think?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.810
In the next lesson, you'll get
a chance to finish the site and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.070
make even more improvements.
