00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Instructor] So what we
have depicted in this diagram

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.760
is the business cycle
that we have looked at

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.650
in other videos.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.250
This horizontal axis is time.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.470
The vertical axis is real GDP.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.900
What we see in this dark blue color,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.220
you can view that as
full employment output

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.470
at different points in time,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.970
and you can see that it is growing.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.570
So this economy is
experiencing economic growth.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.500
Maybe it's population is increasing,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.760
they're getting more productive,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.940
maybe with better education
or with better technology.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.790
But we know that real
economies don't just have

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.100
this nice, clean economic growth.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.420
They tend to cycle around
their full employment output.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.680
There are times when they
are above the trend line.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.650
Like right over here, you
have a positive output gap.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.160
So this is a positive output gap

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.610
at that point right over there.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.030
And you could also have
negative output gaps.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.349
We also talked in other
videos about fiscal policy.

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:54.550
These are tools that governments might use

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.090
in order to close these output gaps.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.470
For example, when you have
a positive output gap,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.140
a government might be afraid
that things are overheating.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.740
Maybe they're afraid of inflation.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.160
They might have
contractionary fiscal policy.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.080
They might try to do something
for that moment in time

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.230
to bring to close that gap a little bit.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.210
More likely, when there's
a negative output gap

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.180
and people are out of work,
the government will say,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.061
"Hey, let's pass a stimulus package,

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:24.940
"explicitly to try to close
this gap. Let's lower taxes.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.770
"Let's increase government spending."

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.990
That type of fiscal policy,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.110
where the government is
doing something special

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.280
for that circumstance in order
to close that output gap,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.430
that is discretionary,
discretionary fiscal policy.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.980
It's at the discretion of
the government to do it.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.990
What we're going to focus on in this video

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.772
are automatic stabilizers.

00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:47.900
These are things that people don't have to

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.820
take special action based
on the circumstances

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.200
in order for them to help
smooth out the business cycle.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.820
So automatic stabilizers.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.510
So what are examples of
automatic stabilizers?

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.095
So one common one is taxes.

00:02:05.095 --> 00:02:07.970
So pause this video for
a second and think about

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.282
how do taxes help smooth
out these fluctuations?

00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:14.313
So let's think about what's happening

00:02:14.313 --> 00:02:15.950
at a part of the business cycle

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.540
where the economy's expanding,
let's say right over there,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.860
or let's say right over here.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.639
What would be happening with taxes?

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.750
Well, in these realities,
with this positive output gap,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.290
you could imagine people's
incomes are going to get higher

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.720
and higher, corporate profits
are going to be more and more,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.630
and so our change in taxes
is going to be positive,

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.170
and not only is it going to be positive,

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.050
not only are taxes going to increase

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.390
in absolute dollar terms,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.560
but they're probably gonna
grow at a faster rate

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.630
than the economy.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.650
Why is that?

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.178
When the economy turns positive,

00:02:47.178 --> 00:02:48.880
when you start expanding more,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.917
more and more corporations are
going to become profitable.

00:02:50.917 --> 00:02:52.745
If you think about personal income taxes,

00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:54.900
below certain incomes
in a lot of countries,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.540
you don't even have to pay income taxes,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.830
and that for every incremental dollar

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.953
or every incremental $10,000, the tax rate

00:03:00.953 --> 00:03:04.290
on that incremental chunk could go up.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.204
And so that's why the absolute
dollar amount of taxes

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:11.170
will likely increase at a faster rate

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.527
than the actual economic growth.

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.240
And let's think about the other scenario.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.840
Let's think about what taxes do

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.190
when we are in a recession.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.313
So let's say we pick that
place right over there.

00:03:20.313 --> 00:03:22.830
Well, in this situation, corporate profits

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.760
are going to be lower.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.840
In fact, some corporations
are gonna become unprofitable,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.090
in which case they wouldn't
pay corporate taxes.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.970
People are gonna make less and less money.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.540
So your change in taxes
here is going to be

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.910
likely to be negative.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.530
And once again, your
rate of decrease in taxes

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.260
is likely to be greater
than your rate in decrease

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.660
of real GDP.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.400
The tax multiplier is negative,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.116
and so it might smooth out
the curve a little bit.

00:03:46.116 --> 00:03:49.406
Now another example of
an automatic stabilizer

00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:54.406
would be things like welfare payments

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.533
or unemployment insurance.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:01.470
Why would these be automatic stabilizers?

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.490
Well, when times are good,

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.840
when you have this positive output gap,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.689
fewer and fewer people
are going to need welfare

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.070
or they're going to need
unemployment payments,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.090
and so in that world,
that is like a decrease

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.200
in government spending.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.770
The government's not going to have to pay

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.150
for these benefits.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.140
And so decrease in government spending,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.290
that's contractionary, and so that'll help

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.890
smooth out the curve a little bit.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.191
And once again, when we
go into our recession

00:04:28.191 --> 00:04:32.140
and then when we start having
our negative output gaps,

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.980
more people are going to be on welfare.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.730
More people are going to need
their unemployment benefits

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.959
and so that's going to
increase government spending,

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.443
which might, with the multiplier,

00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:44.040
smooth out this curve a little bit.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.380
And so the big takeaway is

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.720
is when the government
does something explicitly

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.470
for the time that they are in

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.140
in order to smooth out the curve,

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.122
that's discretionary fiscal policy.

00:04:54.122 --> 00:04:56.360
But you might have things in the system,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.250
the existing tax policy,
existing laws around welfare,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.429
or unemployment insurance,
or other benefits

00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:04.290
that might have an effect of,

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.672
regardless of where we
are in the business cycle,

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:09.052
they have a dampening effect.

00:05:09.052 --> 00:05:12.400
They would smooth out these
oscillations a little more.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.770
They would be automatic stabilizers.
