00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.230
Alright so, now that we have a handle on what it means

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.110
to compute a best response against some finite state strategy. Let's actually

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.100
take a look at these. So, so this is a quiz. Imagine

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.310
that we have a gamma that is large, so greater than a six.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.163
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:14.900
&gt;&gt; What is the best response to each of these

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.795
strategies? So this will be a quiz, but let me just

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:19.470
make it clear what the, the goal of the quiz

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.150
is. So, if you're, if you are playing against, always cooperate.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.490
Which of these is the best response to it, which of these is

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.130
going to actually have maximum reward?

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.880
If we're playing against always defect which

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.070
is going to have maximum reward? And if we're playing against tit for tat

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.980
which are going to have maximum reward? Any

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.670
questions about that, does that make sense?

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.180
&gt;&gt; I'm just making certain I have the rows and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.640
the columns right. So my opponent is playing on the rows.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.440
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.480
&gt;&gt; And so I'm choosing among the columns for each one of those rows. Yes?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I labelled it best

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.730
possible response for the columns. And these

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.600
are the opponent's strategies on the rows.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.260
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.480
&gt;&gt; Okay, go.
