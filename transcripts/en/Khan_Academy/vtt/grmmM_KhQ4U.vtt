00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.620
You are at a Parisian
cafe with a friend.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.310
A local in front of you buys a
cup of coffee and a croissant

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.860
for $5 or 5.30 Euro.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.650
When you and your friend get
two cups of coffee and two

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.150
croissants, you are
charged 14 Euro.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.310
Can we solve for the price of
a cup of coffee and croissant

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.390
using the information
into a system

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.450
of linear equations
in two variables?

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.490
If yes, what is the solution?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.725
If no, what is the
reason we cannot?

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.100
So we're looking
for two things--

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.100
the price of a cup of coffee
and the price of a croissant.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.700
So let's define
two variables here.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.120
Since we have all
these C's here,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.536
I'm just going to
use x's and y's.

00:00:39.536 --> 00:00:46.965
So let's let x be equal to the
price of the cup of coffee.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.290
And let's let y be equal to
the price of a croissant.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.519
So we first have
this information

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.060
of what the local
in front of us did.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.050
The local in front of us buys
one cup of coffee and one

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.920
croissant for 5.30 Euro.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.610
So how would we set
that up as an equation?

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.200
Well, we got one cup of coffee.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.050
So that's going to be one
x, or we could just write x,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.180
plus one y because
he got one croissant,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:32.240
and it cost 5.30 Euro.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.380
So this equation describes
what happened to the local--

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.546
bought one cup of coffee, one
croissant, paid 5.30 Euro.

00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:40.920
Now, when you and
your friend get

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.850
two cups of coffee
and two croissants,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.100
you are charged 14 Euro.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.530
So what's an equation
to describe this?

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.240
So we should be charged
two times the price

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.650
of a cup of coffee.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.020
So it should be 2x.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.450
And then we should be
charged two times the price

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.652
of a croissant, so plus 2y.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.610
And the sum of these
should be the total amount

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.401
that we're charged.

00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:03.374
So we've been charged 14 Euro.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.630
So let's see if we can solve
this system of equations.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.890
And there's many, many,
many ways to solve this.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.684
But the most
obvious way at least

00:02:14.684 --> 00:02:17.100
looking at this right over
here is you have x, we have 2x,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.810
we have y, we have 2y.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.660
Let's take this first
equation that described local

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.870
and multiply it by two.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.290
So let's just
multiply it by two.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.873
So we're going to
multiply both sides,

00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:28.970
otherwise equality
won't hold anymore.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:37.940
So we would get 2x plus 2y is
equal to 2 times 5.30 is 10

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.575
euro 60.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.580
Now, something very
interesting is going on here.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.660
If the local had bought twice
as many cups of coffee and twice

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.145
as many croissants, he
would have paid 10.60.

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:56.270
And that would have been
the exact amount of coffee

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.710
and croissants you
got and you paid 14.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.160
So it looks pretty
clear that you

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.020
got charged a different amount.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.960
You got the tourist rate for
the cup of coffee and croissant,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.130
while he got the local rate.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.280
And we can verify that
there's no x and y that's

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.250
going to satisfy this.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.420
And even logically
it makes sense here.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.640
2x plus 2y is 14.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.692
Here, 2x plus 2y is 10 euro 60.

00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:20.650
And we could even show
that mathematically this

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.040
doesn't make sense.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.460
So if we were to subtract this
bottom equation from this top,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.660
so essentially you could
imagine multiplying

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.500
the entire bottom
equation times negative 1.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.750
So let's multiply the entire
bottom equation by negative 1

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.326
and then we add
these two equations.

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:38.700
Remember all we're
doing is we're

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.620
starting with say this
equation, and we're

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.530
adding the same
thing to both sides.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.360
We're going to add
this to this side.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.700
And we already know that
negative 10.60 is the same

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.940
thing as this, we're
going to add to that side.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.090
So on the left hand side,
this cancels with this,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.140
this cancels with this,
we're left with 0.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.405
And on the right hand side,
14 minus 10.60 will get you

00:03:57.405 --> 00:03:59.000
to 3.40.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.820
And there's no x and y that
you can think of that can all

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.430
of a sudden make 0 equal 3.40.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.220
So there is no solution.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.320
And the only
explanation over here

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.268
is that the local was
charged a cheaper rate.
