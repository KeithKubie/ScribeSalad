00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.760
Recall that in any modern operating system, each process is in it's own

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.190
protection domain. And usually, a separate hardware

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.420
address space. And the operating system maintains

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.120
a page table on behalf of each of these processes. The page table

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.210
is the operating system's data structure that

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.510
holds the mapping between the virtual page

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.330
numbers and the physical pages where those

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.810
virtual pages are contained in the main memory

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.922
of the hardware. The physical memory of

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:37.660
course is contiguous starting from zero to whatever

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.050
is the maximum limit of the hardware

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.010
capabilities are. But the virtual address pace of

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.660
a given processor course is not contiguous

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.120
in physical memory, but it is scattered all

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.570
over the physical memory. And that's in some sense the advantage that

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.060
you get with page based memory management. That a process notion of

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.830
which virtual address being contiguous is

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.420
not necessarily reflected in the physical

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.540
mapping of those virtual pages to the physical pages in the main memory.
